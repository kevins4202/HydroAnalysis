17685,a novel concept for fecal pollution analysis was applied at alluvial water resources to substantially extend the information provided by fecal indicator bacteria fib fib data were linked to river connectivity and genetic microbial source tracking mst the concept was demonstrated at the danube river and its associated backwater area downstream of the city of vienna using a comprehensive 3 year data set 10 selected sites n 317 samples enumeration of escherichia coli iso 16649 2 intestinal enterococci iso 7899 2 and clostridium perfringens iso 14189 revealed a patchy distribution for the investigation area based on these parameters alone a clear interpretation of the observed fecal contamination patterns was not possible comparison of fib concentrations to river connectivity allowed defining sites with dominating versus rare fecal pollution influence from the river danube a strong connectivity gradient at the selected backwater sites became obvious by 2d hydrodynamic surface water modeling ranging from 278 days 25 down to 5 days 1 of hydraulic connectivity to the river danube within the 3 year study period human sewage pollution could be identified as the dominating fecal source at the highly connected sites by adding information from mst analysis in contrast animal fecal pollution proofed to be dominating in areas with low river connectivity the selection of genetic mst markers was focusing on potentially important pollution sources in the backwater area using human bachum hf183ii ruminant bacr and pig pig2bac associated quantitative pcr assays the presented approach is assumed to be useful to characterize alluvial water resources for water safety management throughout the globe by allocating fecal pollution to autochthonous allochthonous human or animal contamination components the established river connectivity metric is not limited to bacterial fecal pollution but can be applied to any type of chemical and microbiological contamination graphical abstract image 1 keywords river connectivity alluvial drinking water resources fecal pollution allochthonous vs autochthonous sources human vs animal sources integrated monitoring 1 introduction the socioeconomic importance of riverine floodplains is well recognized besides flood water retention the drinking water supply and space provided for recreational activities play important roles baart et al 2013 fecal pollution is a substantial hazard to these water resources especially in terms of water supply for alluvial backwater systems two potential pollution sources must be considered i allochthonous sources from the main river channel and ii autochthonous sources from the floodplain itself in addition both sources can be impacted by humans or animals or by a combination of both routine surface water quality monitoring is mainly based on the cultivation of escherichia coli e coli and intestinal enterococci recently it was demonstrated that these fecal indicator bacteria fib can sensitively detect fecal pollution from mammal bird and human individual or sewage sources equally in such systems frick et al 2018 in addition fecal emissions from poikilothermic animals such as snails frogs and fish may also contribute to the observed fib levels in backwater systems to some extent frick et al 2018 but allocating fecal contamination to their sources of origin is not possible by relying on fib monitoring data alone for the studied backwater area of the danube river in the east of austria we speculated that two specific contamination types would influence the water quality of the floodplain area first for the allochthonous contamination input into the backwater human fecal sources should dominate as the water quality of the danube river is mainly determined by large capitals tributaries and branches that receive municipal human wastewater kirschner et al 2008 2017 the extent of fecal contamination from those sources in the backwater area should depend on the level of human fecal pollution in the river and the connectivity to the concerned backwater sites at locations with higher river connectivity increased allochthonous human fecal input can be expected compared to sites with lower connectivity as a second and likewise important fecal source autochthonous fecal material from wild animals has to be considered for the concerning water resource the studied alluvial backwater is an important wilderness area that harbors numerous species of wild animals weigelhofer et al 2013 a pollution source profile of the study area identified birds deer and wild boar as the most important fecal sources from homeothermic animals frick et al 2018 the area and its sorroundings are also popular for recreational activities such as bathing sports fishing or cycling arnberger et al 2009 thus human visitors in the absence of appropriate sanitary installation could also contribute to the fecal input however compared to the reported numbers of animals in this area humans should play a minor role as a fecal pollution source frick et al 2018 except for basic hydrological data such as precipitation or river discharge there are only a few published studies available that combined information from microbial source tracking mst with hydrological models or hydrological metrics derived from it to identify sources of water compartments that were mainly responsible for bacterial loadings within the yarra estuary mccarthy et al 2017 implemented mst and evaluated this method using a 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model sokolova et al 2012 combined mst markers with a 3 dimensional coupled hydrodynamic model to investigate the contribution from different contamination sources in a swedish lake in addition derx et al 2016 used a human associated mst marker to calibrate a hydrological process based microbial fate and transport model qmracatch for a river and backwater river system for microbial risk assessment to the best of our knowledge detailed hydrological characterization or modeling in combination with the use of mst markers to explain patterns and sources of fib in riverine floodplains has not been reported in the literature so far the aim of this study was to characterize patterns temporal variation and sources of fecal pollution in a typical backwater area of the danube river a new concept was applied by extending the observed fib data with information on river connectivity and genetic mst marker levels river connectivity was calculated by a detailed 2d hydrodynamic surface water model to date the term hydrological connectivity has been used in an ecological context to refer to water mediated transfer of matter energy and or organisms within or between elements of riverine corridors tockner et al 2000 hein et al 2003 2016 pringle 2003 reckendorfer et al 2013 weigelhofer et al 2015 mayr et al 2020 in this study river connectivity was used in a new context to support improved data interpretation guiding pollution and health related water quality management for this survey connectivity was defined as the degree of hydraulic connection between the river danube and the sampling locations in the backwater area it is given as relative connectivity in calculated for each sampling site as the number of connected days during the total investigation period 3 years we hypothesized that the proposed concept is able to allocate the observed fecal pollution levels to their allochthonous and autochthonous sources of human or animal origin in the backwater area to support the evaluation of the new approach the investigation design covered a pronounced connectivity gradient from the river to the backwater environment as well as significant variations in the expected animal abundance to cover sites with both low and high animal impact 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the investigated alluvial backwater area called porous aquifer pa is a typical urban riverine wetland whose dynamic character was fundamentally changed by the regulation of the danube river in the 19th century weigelhofer et al 2013 it is located on the north side of the danube river at the eastern border of vienna austria fig 1 and covers an area of approximately 12 km2 due to the regulation of the danube and the construction of a flood protection dam alongside the danube the pa backwater was almost completely disconnected from the main stream the backwater presently consists of a river channel network whose main side arm has a surface connection with the danube river at its lowermost end through a levee opening backflow connection numerous partly disconnected backwaters and isolated ponds are also present the pa backwater is subdivided into 6 basins by check dams and natural fords floods that enter the floodplain via the backflow connection move upstream along the main side arm creating a distinct gradient in hydrological connectivity in the various waterbodies with distance to the inflow reckendorfer et al 2013 the pa backwater is an important water resource for vienna s drinking water supply hein et al 2006 and five drinking water wells riverbank filtrate are situated in the floodplain area it is also part of a national park that plays a strategic role as a wilderness area and for recreation arnberger et al 2009 there are no settlements or livestock in the considered backwater area but there is a considerable population of wild animals such as ruminants wild boars and birds fr√ºhauf and sabathy 2006 b parz gollner 2006 arnberger et al 2009 in addition 600 000 people visit the national park area every year hinterberger et al 2000 bathing is prohibited within the considered backwater area and visitors may only use selected paths for walking and cycling therefore the possibility for human fecal input from visitors is considered to be low frick et al 2018 2 2 sampling surface water samples were taken monthly at the danube river site and at nine representative backwater locations lsw1 lsw9 fig 1 at different sections of the backwater area gabriel et al 2014 from may 2010 to june 2013 the sampling location lsw1 was situated in a side arm outside the flood protected area delineated by the dam and therefore represented waterbodies with high connectivity to the danube river the locations lsw2 and lsw3 represent waterbodies at the main side arm with a decreasing gradient of connectivity and average water depths of approx 110 cm and 170 cm respectively the sites lsw4 lsw5 and lsw6 represent side ditches with very low connectivity at the western end of the study area the water depth at lsw4 was approx 30 50 cm and it once completely dried out by the end of 2012 at this location animal traces e g traces or fecal material from ruminants could be repeatedly detected in the waterbody lsw5 was located in a side ditch with a water depth of approx 110 cm on average the depth at lsw6 was approx 100 cm three sampling sites lsw7 lsw8 lsw9 were chosen in disconnected shallow backwaters that repeatedly completely dried out lsw7 was located in a small pond with a water depth of approx 30 cm at lsw7 a range of animal traces footprints and wallows of wild boars were repeatedly detected so a high animal abundance could be expected lsw8 was in a very shallow side ditch approx 20 40 cm water depth near a feeding lot for game and was frequently used by wild animals e g wild boar for wallowing in 2010 and 2011 locations lsw7 and lsw8 were sampled alternately each month lsw7 or lsw8 was sampled lsw9 was situated in a shallow side ditch water depth of approx 40 60 cm right beside a frequented path for visitors therefore the abundance of wild animals was expected to be low water samples were taken approx 15 cm below the water surface if the water depth was lower than approx 30 cm samples were taken very carefully to avoid contamination from the surface layer or from whirled up sediments samples for microbiological analysis were collected in sterile 2 l plastic bottles samples for chemical analysis were collected in prewashed polyethylene bottles the samples were transported in dark cool boxes to the laboratory within 4 h during sampling relevant additional information i e numbers of visible animals animal traces in soil and sediments wallows amount of visible fecal pats on animal abundance was gathered 2 3 standard fecal indicator bacteria bacteriological analysis of surface water samples was performed according to established iso standards based on membrane filtration and cultivation one hundred milliliters or an appropriate dilution of each water sample was filtered through a cellulose nitrate filter pore size 0 45 Œºm e coli was investigated on tbx agar 44 0 5 c 44 4 h according to iso 16649 2 international organisation for standardisation 2001 intestinal enterococci were enumerated on slanetz and bartley agar 36 2 c 44 4 h and confirmed on bile aesculin agar 44 0 5 2 h according to iso 7899 2 international organisation for standardisation 2000 c perfringens was investigated in accordance with iso 14189 international organisation for standardisation 2013 on tsc agar 44 1 c 21 3 h and confirmed by testing for acid phosphatase water samples for the detection of c perfringens were pasteurized before filtration 15 1 min 60 2 c to detect spores only for quality control the following type strains were used e coli nctc 9001 enterococcus faecalis nctc 775 and clostridium perfringens nctc 8237 the threshold of detection was 1 or 10 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml depending on the sample volume analyzed 2 4 genetic source tracking markers for the analysis of microbial source tracking mst markers samples from the danube river danube and from five representative sampling locations lsw1 lsw3 lsw4 lsw7 and lsw8 were selected in the main side arm lsw1 represents a location with high connectivity and lsw3 represents a location with low connectivity lsw4 was chosen as a side ditch closely connected to the main side arm but with low connectivity to the river danube and furthermore a high animal abundance lsw7 and lsw8 represent more disconnected ditches with anticipated significant animal abundance water samples 200 ml until july 2011 afterwards 600 ml were filtered through 0 2 Œºm polycarbonate filters merck millipore usa if the filter clogged before the intended volume was filtered filtration was terminated after 1 h the filtered volume was determined as a weight difference by comparing the start and end weights of the bottles dna extraction was performed using a bead beating and phenol chloroform based dna extraction protocol as described previously griffiths et al 2000 the extracted dna was eluted in tris buffer ph 8 0 and stored at 80 c until further analysis prior to the qpcr assays the concentration of the dna extracts was quantified with a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific united kingdom a universal bacteroidetes marker bacdick dick and field 2004 was used as a quality control to assess the ability to amplify dna in the samples and to rule out the presence of dna inhibiting substances in the dna extracts reischer et al 2008 mayer et al 2018 furthermore all qpcr assays except for bacdick were run with the ntb2 fragment as an internal amplification control in duplex iac noncompetitive to monitor for qpcr amplification inhibition anderson et al 2011 all sample dnas in the qpcr assays detecting host associated fecal pollution from humans bachum kildare et al 2007 and hf183ii green et al 2014 ruminants bacr reischer et al 2006 and pigs wild baors pig2bac mieszkin et al 2009 were measured in duplicate quality assessment of qpcr data was performed as previously described in detail reischer et al 2006 2011 mayer et al 2018 all controls and no template controls were consistently negative i e the fluorescence never exceeded the threshold qpcr standard dilutions ranging from 101 to 106 targets per reaction were used in a linear regression model to calculate the qpcr calibration curve the results are reported as marker equivalents per filtered water volume me vol 1 as previously described reischer et al 2006 the filtration volume of the sample the analyzed volume for qpcr analysis and the minimal detectable marker concentration per pcr defined the threshold of detection reischer et al 2011 mayer et al 2018 the threshold of detection of the data set presented herein ranged from 11 to 222 marker equivalents per analyzed water sample see supplemental material data the bacdick assay was run on a mastercycler realplex pcr machine eppendorf germany in a total reaction volume of 25 Œºl with 2 5 Œºl diluted sample dna 1 4 1 16 and if necessary 1 64 all other qpcr assays were run on a rotor gene q thermocycler in a total reaction volume of 15 Œºl with 2 5 Œºl diluted sample dna 1 4 or 1 16 to ensure the applicability of the genetic mst markers their performance needs to be tested for the individual catchment and fecal sources reischer et al 2013 mayer et al 2018 all mst assays applied the bachum the hf183ii the pig2bac and the bacr assay were tested for their level of specificity and sensitivity for the respective fecal source group s on samples from the study area further details on molecular methods quality assurance and

material table s6 2 6 hydrodynamic modeling and calculating river connectivity the connection of the selected sampling sites along the floodplain river to the danube river was determined based on a 2d hydrodynamic surface water model cche2d version 2 0 national center for computational hydroscience and engineering university of mississippi the model is based on the solution of the two dimensional formulation of the shallow water equations and has been successfully applied for the analysis of river flows chao et al 2015 2016 the model uses depth integrated reynolds equations the spatial discretization of the geometry and the related processes is based on the efficient element method wang and hu 1992 for temporal discretization the implicit first order euler s method was implemented and was able to simulate subcritical and supercritical flow conditions the model domain covered an area of approximately 22 km2 fig s1 the terrain and riverbed elevation in the model grid cells were a product from a digital terrain model dtm the dtm was based on laser scan data which were complemented with terrestrial surveys along the side arm channel gsch√∂pf and blaschke 2009 the spatial distribution of the manning roughness values were based on a detailed land use and vegetation classification 43 classes that was mapped into 12 different roughness classes hein et al 2008 during model calibration the manning roughness values were fine adjusted to floods of the river danube during august 2008 june 2009 and june 2011 ranging from 0 024 to 0 125 s m 0 3 within the model domain the spatial resolution of the rectangular model grid varied between 0 1 m and 20 m depending on local topographic characteristics the total number of calculation nodes was 396 000 as the upstream model boundary bu the observed hourly discharges at the danube stream gauge in fischamend were used the downstream boundary bd condition was given by the observed water level at the eastern model boundary at river station 1911 km fig s1 the initial flow conditions at the calculated nodes were based on steady flow simulations for typical flow conditions in the danube river at fischamend depending on the temporal dynamics of the input hydrographs calculation time step lengths between 30 s and 1 h were used for calculating the river connectivity the 2d surface water flow velocities of the floodplain river were simulated on an hourly basis during a flood event in january 2011 with an approximate 10 year return period the floodplain river is connected to the danube river if the flow discharge exceeds the mean flow discharge of 1910 m3 s 1 in this case the danube river water flows into the floodplain river during the rising limb of a flood event when the flood peak is reached the flow direction reverses and the water flows back toward the danube river a specific sampling site was considered to be connected as soon as the inflowing danube river water reached up to this point during the rising limb of the flood event this criterion was fulfilled if the simulated 2d flow velocities in the floodplain river were larger than 0 1 m s 1 from the point of entry towards the sampling site fig s3 in this way a threshold water level at the danube river was determined for each sampling site if the danube river water level was higher or equal to this threshold level a sampling site was considered to be connected the connectivity of the floodplain river was then defined for each sampling site as the time span during which the site was connected the connectivity of each sampling site was determined based on the threshold water levels fig s2 and the water level duration curves of the gauge station for the observation period from 2010 to 2013 the connectivity in was calculated for each sampling site as the number of connected days in the observation period furthermore the time span since the last surface water connection to the danube river was calculated for each sampling site and date 2 7 statistics for further analysis all values under the threshold of detection were set to zero statistics were calculated in ibm spss version 23 and sigmaplot version 13 0 for correlation analysis spearman s rank correlation and the kruskal wallis test for the comparison of groups were applied kruskal and wallis 1952 for significance testing multiple correlations were adjusted according to bonferroni correction bonferroni 1936 3 results 3 1 establishing basic knowledge on standard fecal indicator bacteria fib from 2010 to 2013 the selected sites in the backwater area and the danube river 10 sites n 317 samples were investigated for the occurrence and temporal variation of fecal pollution by enumerating the fib table 1 the results on the occurrence of the fib e coli intestinal enterococci and c perfringens spores at the sampling sites showed a patchy distribution with a median concentration range from 0 3 to 2 1 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 no clear spatial trend of fecal contamination was obvious from the fib data alone the highest median concentrations of e coli and enterococci were detected at the danube river and the side ditches lsw4 lsw7 and lsw8 1 72 2 01 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 and 1 28 2 14 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 respectively the lowest concentrations were found in the main side arm at lsw3 and at the side ditches lsw5 and lsw9 0 78 1 04 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 and 0 60 0 85 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 respectively the concentrations of c perfringens spores were highest at the danube river the locations in the main side arm lsw1 and lsw2 and in the side ditches lsw7 and lsw8 1 32 1 72 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 the lowest concentrations were detected at lsw3 and the side ditches lsw5 and lsw9 0 30 0 98 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 3 2 river connectivity and fib concentrations in context to the connectivity gradient the determined river connectivity values of the sampling sites to the danube river were expressed as days and percentage of days within a 3 year period 2010 2013 the selected sampling sites showed a strong connectivity gradient from 1050 days at the danube river 100 down to 278 days at lsw 1 25 30 days at lsw 2 3 20 days at lsw 3 2 9 days at lsw4 to lsw7 1 and 5 days at lsw 8 and 9 1 fig 2 the investigated backwater locations could thus be separated into two sections the first is a somewhat more frequently river connected section fcs covering the locations from the danube river along the main side arm lsw1 lsw2 lsw3 is located in a transition area to the second rarely river connected section rcs including the rest of the sampling locations from lsw4 to lsw9 fig 2 at the fcs locations within the course of the main backwater branch the declining connectivity gradient from 100 to 3 was also clearly reflected by a decreasing trend in fib concentrations table 1 fig 2 this trend could be consistently observed for e coli kruskal wallis test n 145 p 0 001 enterococci kruskal wallis test n 148 p 0 001 and c perfringens spores kruskal wallis test n 145 p 0 001 indicating a dominating and frequent influence of allochthonous sewage pollution from the danube river into the backwater system in accordance with the hydrological link of the investigated systems in contrast in the rcs lsw3 lsw9 the observed patchy distribution of fecal pollution as indicated by e coli enterococci and c perfringens spores was not related to river connectivity at all table 1 for example the strong variation in fecal pollution at the rcs irrespective of the situation at the danube river is impressively demonstrated by the observed e coli concentrations fig 2 concentration ranges from very low e coli concentrations up to levels even higher than those detected at the danube river an extremely fluctuating situation was observed at lsw7 ranging from not detectable up to 3 5 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 fig 2 the situation at the rcs regarding the detected fib levels suggested animal fecal pollution sources of autochthonous origin from the backwater area to test this hypothesis genetic mst markers were applied to generate information on the origin of observed fecal pollution levels 3 3 complementing the data set with information on pollution sources mst from 2010 to 2013 a number of 174 water samples were also analyzed for human ruminant and pig associated genetic mst markers from six selected locations danube river lsw1 lsw3 lsw4 lsw7 lsw8 to conduct fecal source allocation fig 3 for the danube river samples human associated mst markers bachum hf183ii were the dominant markers proving that this river environment is indeed mainly impacted by municipal wastewater the median values for the human associated fecal markers bachum and hf183ii were 3 6 and 2 7 log10 me 100 ml 1 respectively in contrast the median concentrations for ruminant bacr and pig associated pig2bac markers were below the detection limits at the danube river fig 3 at lsw1 a backwater river site with 25 river connectivity within the fcs the concentrations of the human associated mst markers were considerably lower compared to the danube river nonetheless concentrations were still detectable at the 75th percentiles with bachum and hf183ii levels higher than 2 0 log10 me 100 ml 1 demonstrating the impact of human fecal pollution events from the danube river except for a few cases of very low qpcr determinations ruminant and pig associated mst markers could not be detected in any of the lsw1 samples fig 3 at lsw3 a backwater river location with low connectivity 2 at the transition area between the fcs and rcs bachum could be found in only 2 7 of the samples indicating a sporadic impact by human fecal pollution fig 3 the human associated marker hf183ii was not detectable in any of the samples ruminant bacr and pig pig2bac associated fecal markers were detectable in 45 and 16 of all samples with 90th percentiles at 2 9 log10 and 2 5 log10 me 100 ml 1 respectively showing that wildlife had a detectable influence at lsw4 lsw7 and lsw8 within the rcs locations in side ditches with very low connectivity 1 to the danube river wildlife especially ruminant populations exhibited a strong and obvious influence at lsw4 the ruminant associated mst marker bacr was detected in 90 of the samples with a median concentration of 4 0 log10 me 100 ml 1 and a 90th percentile of 5 0 log10 me 100 ml 1 the pig associated marker pig2bac was detectable in 43 of the samples at lower concentrations with a 90th percentile of 3 7 log10 me 100 ml 1 bacr could be found in 58 90th percentile of 3 8 log10 me 100 ml 1 pig2bac in 42 90th percentile of 3 2 log10 me 100 ml 1 of the samples from lsw7 at lsw8 bacr was detected in 88 of the samples with a median concentration of 4 1 log10 me 100 ml 1 and a 90th percentile of 5 0 log10 me 100 ml 1 pig2bac was found in 35 of the samples with a 90th percentile of 3 7 log10 me 100 ml 1 human associated markers bachum hf183ii indicated only a sporadic impact by human fecal pollution fig 3 at those locations human associated markers decreased with declining connectivity this effect was most distinct for bachum fig 4 showing a strong decreasing median concentration gradient from high to low river connectivity 3 4 highlighting habitat differences by statistical analysis the results of a statistical correlation analysis for the selected locations danube river lsw1 lsw3 lsw4 lsw8 with additional mst information further supported the different pollution characteristics between frequently and rarely river connected locations lsw7 was omitted because of low sample size n 12 at the danube river site significant correlations were detectable between all analyzed fib and many chemophysical parameters table s1 supplemental material e coli correlated significantly with the human associated fecal markers hf183ii and bachum whereas no significant correlations with the animal associated markers were detectable table 2 similar to the danube river location significant correlations were also detectable between all analyzed fib and many chemophysical parameters for the sampling site lsw1 table s2 supplemental material e coli correlated significantly with the human associated mst markers hf183ii and bachum table 2 the highest correlation between fib and human associated mst markers was observed for the combination of hf183ii and c perfringens spores r 0 73 p 0 01 n 32 see supplemental material c perfringens was recently suggested as a human associated sewage tracer vierheilig et al 2013 very remarkably for lsw1 a clear dependence for all fib parameters and human associated mst marker concentrations on the time span since the last hydrological connection to the danube river became obvious r 0 50 to 0 61 p 0 05 n 33 37 table s2 in contrast no significant correlations to the animal associated mst markers were observed table 2 taken together human derived sewage had a strong governing effect on the observed fecal pollution levels for the fcs statistical correlation outcomes from lsw3 located in the transition area between the fcs and rcs and lsw4 as well as lsw8 located in the rcs exhibited contrasting results from the fcs hardly any correlations could be detected among the analyzed microbiological chemophysica and chemical data sets tables s3 s4 and s5 supplemental material a significant correlation between the fib fractions could be detected at lsw3 and lsw8 for e coli vs enterococci table 2 4 discussion 4 1 successful realization of the new approach the newly established approach was able to characterize the observed fecal pollution patterns in the backwater area in detail fib data alone only provided the basis for a highly speculative interpretation of the nature of the observed fecal pollution combining the information from the fib with river connectivity and genetic mst marker concentrations gave very useful information on two potential pollution aspects of the selected water resource on the one hand information on the allochthonous i e externally from the main river channel vs the autochthonous i e internally from the backwater area natures of fecal pollution could be gathered on the other hand information on the host origin was also generated i e human vs animal by combining both aspects a congruent and precise picture of the characteristics of the observed fecal pollution at the backwater locations could successfully be drawn it could be demonstrated that linking host associated genetic fecal markers with river connectivity data can add valuable spatial information on mst efforts information on mst marker occurrence per se only provides an indication of the responsibility of host groups for fecal pollution events e g pigs vs ruminants vs pets humans vs animals but does not give any information on its spatial origin if required information on the spatial origin of mst markers can be generated by laborious hydraulic transport modeling efforts sokolova et al 2012 however in this study we demonstrated that combining microbiological and hydrological connectivity data provides a very straightforward way to obtain information on the spatial component of fecal contamination in backwater resources as seasonal river fluctuations determined the hydrological connectivity in the investigated area this data also provides information on the temporal component of fecal contamination compare fig s3 supplemental material the suggested approach may not be limited to alluvial backwater resources but is also likely useful for other types of water resources where different water compartments interact such as in estuaries and marshes col√≥n rivera et al 2012 wild allen and andrewartha 2016 raimonet and cloern 2017 in addition this study provides the first clear evidence that hydrological river connectivity is not only a very useful metric in river ecology tockner et al 1999 hein et al 2003 reckendorfer et al 2013 weigelhofer et al 2015 but can efficiently be applied for user and health related alluvial water quality investigations too 4 2 significance of results for water resource management alluvial backwater systems are essential water resources throughout the world tockner and stanford 2002 filippini et al 2015 bonsor et al 2017 martinez et al 2017 often used not only for drinking water supply and recreational activities but also for aquaculture handisyde et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 bayazid et al 2019 the new approach is able to realize improved fecal pollution monitoring practices to support target oriented water quality management in backwater areas all over the globe different methods for the determination of river connectivity matrices are available and it is not a must to rely on hydrodynamic modeling as provided in this study tritthart et al 2011 shen et al 2015 stone et al 2017 diaz redondo et al 2018 the suggested approach is not limited to fecal hazard characterization and improved backwater catchment protection i e minimization of fecal pollution events but is also able to essentially support microbial risk assessment activities qmra it can be further used to provide information on the relevant fecal pollution sources to develop sound qmra modeling scenarios for the backwater area of consideration derx et al 2016 the river connectivity approach can be extended to any reference pathogen global water pathogen project 2019 or chemical pollutant of interest islam et al 2015 hai et al 2018 van driezum et al 2019 for the investigated backwater area downstream of vienna it was demonstrated that two different pollution sources have to be regarded when talking about fecal contamination i human fecal pollution from municipal wastewater as the dominating allochthonous component by the danube river kirschner et al 2017 and ii wildlife fecal pollution as an important autochthonous source directly situated in the backwater this aspect is important for target oriented quality management of the pa backwater because just until recently the danube river was considered the only fecal pollution source for the pa drinking water resources however other backwaters may show completely different pollution patterns for example autochthonous pollution from human activities settlements leaking sewage pipes pit latrines and agriculture and livestock can be of significant relevance for many other floodplain areas tockner and stanford 2002 because the pa backwater is managed as a nature conservation area where no livestock farming or human settlements are allowed it can be considered a kind of natural fecal pollution reference area for the central european region with wild boars and deer as the major managed populations of the hunting ground arnberger et al 2009 furthermore the main river in contrast to the danube river may also show significant pollution with nonhuman fecal sources recent studies revealed the adverse effect of grazing livestock on river water quality jabbar and grote 2019 and identified direct defecation to the stream by wading livestock and the release of fib from cowpats by surface runoff from the adjacent pastures as very important transmission routes for fib to the river kay et al 2018 4 3 applicability of genetic mst markers in backwaters the application of genetic bacteroidetes mst markers is at least partly driven by the availability of appropriately performing genetic markers according to certain mst quality criteria such as pollution source sensitivity and specificity for the austrian pa backwater area the selection of this set of markers focusing on human ruminant and pig fecal pollution was scientifically justified as the pollution source profile psp indicated humans ruminants and pigs as potential emission sources with the highest relevance frick et al 2018 interestingly the investigated pa area inhabits approximately twice as many ruminants as wild boar arnberger et al 2009 apparently explaining the higher concentrations of ruminant associated markers compared to pig markers at the investigated sampling locations fig 3 however the local animal distribution and abundance seems to be an important factor for fecal pollution levels as detected by fib concentrations the psp also indicated that birds may play a role as fecal sources in the pa backwater area frick et al 2018 unfortunately a comprehensive genetic mst marker assay covering all avian populations of potential interest is currently not available for the pa area in addition pollution source profiling psp linked to gis modeling indicated that poikilothermic species i e animals whose body temperature depends on the temperature of the environment such as fish frogs and snails may further contribute relevant amounts of fib to the pa backwater frick et al 2018 no genetic mst marker assay exists for poikilotherms so far as these animals were not regarded as relevant sources until very recently complementing mst by genetic qpcr targets for birds and poikilothermic animals would add more details about the nature of the observed wildlife pollution source in the future nonetheless extending the mst marker set would not change the main outcome of this study regarding the identified main drivers of the autochthonous i e human sewage and allochthonous i e wildlife feces fecal pollution sources at the pa backwater mst efforts during this study focused on bacterial genetic markers to complement the fib data the sampling technique frequency required volumes as well as the processing of samples e g filtration can easily be extended to support robust interpretation for the bacterial compartment mayer et al 2015 2016 savio et al 2018 however extending mst for backwater resources towards the viral compartment can be highly attractive for several reasons e g high specificity characteristics for the targeted fecal source many human animal and bacterial phage viral mst targets for qpcr exist ahmed and harwood 2017 edwards et al 2019 and can be linked with the suggested river connectivity approach 5 conclusions on the example of the austrian porous aquifer backwater area it was demonstrated that the combination of river connectivity and genetic mst markers could explain the fecal pollution patterns revealed by standard fecal indicator bacteria monitoring whereas fib data alone could not it was demonstrated that allochthonous and autochthonous sources can be important for alluvial backwaters in the study area the relevance of external sources from the river dominated by human fecal sources from municipal sewage disposal systems is depending on the connectivity of the concerned sites internal fecal sources from wild animals are not distributed homogenously but depend on local animal abundance which is determined by specific habitat preferences the results are a valuable input for sustainable and target oriented water source management and for microbial risk assessment the presented approach is assumed to be useful for characterizing alluvial water resources for water

17685,a novel concept for fecal pollution analysis was applied at alluvial water resources to substantially extend the information provided by fecal indicator bacteria fib fib data were linked to river connectivity and genetic microbial source tracking mst the concept was demonstrated at the danube river and its associated backwater area downstream of the city of vienna using a comprehensive 3 year data set 10 selected sites n 317 samples enumeration of escherichia coli iso 16649 2 intestinal enterococci iso 7899 2 and clostridium perfringens iso 14189 revealed a patchy distribution for the investigation area based on these parameters alone a clear interpretation of the observed fecal contamination patterns was not possible comparison of fib concentrations to river connectivity allowed defining sites with dominating versus rare fecal pollution influence from the river danube a strong connectivity gradient at the selected backwater sites became obvious by 2d hydrodynamic surface water modeling ranging from 278 days 25 down to 5 days 1 of hydraulic connectivity to the river danube within the 3 year study period human sewage pollution could be identified as the dominating fecal source at the highly connected sites by adding information from mst analysis in contrast animal fecal pollution proofed to be dominating in areas with low river connectivity the selection of genetic mst markers was focusing on potentially important pollution sources in the backwater area using human bachum hf183ii ruminant bacr and pig pig2bac associated quantitative pcr assays the presented approach is assumed to be useful to characterize alluvial water resources for water safety management throughout the globe by allocating fecal pollution to autochthonous allochthonous human or animal contamination components the established river connectivity metric is not limited to bacterial fecal pollution but can be applied to any type of chemical and microbiological contamination graphical abstract image 1 keywords river connectivity alluvial drinking water resources fecal pollution allochthonous vs autochthonous sources human vs animal sources integrated monitoring 1 introduction the socioeconomic importance of riverine floodplains is well recognized besides flood water retention the drinking water supply and space provided for recreational activities play important roles baart et al 2013 fecal pollution is a substantial hazard to these water resources especially in terms of water supply for alluvial backwater systems two potential pollution sources must be considered i allochthonous sources from the main river channel and ii autochthonous sources from the floodplain itself in addition both sources can be impacted by humans or animals or by a combination of both routine surface water quality monitoring is mainly based on the cultivation of escherichia coli e coli and intestinal enterococci recently it was demonstrated that these fecal indicator bacteria fib can sensitively detect fecal pollution from mammal bird and human individual or sewage sources equally in such systems frick et al 2018 in addition fecal emissions from poikilothermic animals such as snails frogs and fish may also contribute to the observed fib levels in backwater systems to some extent frick et al 2018 but allocating fecal contamination to their sources of origin is not possible by relying on fib monitoring data alone for the studied backwater area of the danube river in the east of austria we speculated that two specific contamination types would influence the water quality of the floodplain area first for the allochthonous contamination input into the backwater human fecal sources should dominate as the water quality of the danube river is mainly determined by large capitals tributaries and branches that receive municipal human wastewater kirschner et al 2008 2017 the extent of fecal contamination from those sources in the backwater area should depend on the level of human fecal pollution in the river and the connectivity to the concerned backwater sites at locations with higher river connectivity increased allochthonous human fecal input can be expected compared to sites with lower connectivity as a second and likewise important fecal source autochthonous fecal material from wild animals has to be considered for the concerning water resource the studied alluvial backwater is an important wilderness area that harbors numerous species of wild animals weigelhofer et al 2013 a pollution source profile of the study area identified birds deer and wild boar as the most important fecal sources from homeothermic animals frick et al 2018 the area and its sorroundings are also popular for recreational activities such as bathing sports fishing or cycling arnberger et al 2009 thus human visitors in the absence of appropriate sanitary installation could also contribute to the fecal input however compared to the reported numbers of animals in this area humans should play a minor role as a fecal pollution source frick et al 2018 except for basic hydrological data such as precipitation or river discharge there are only a few published studies available that combined information from microbial source tracking mst with hydrological models or hydrological metrics derived from it to identify sources of water compartments that were mainly responsible for bacterial loadings within the yarra estuary mccarthy et al 2017 implemented mst and evaluated this method using a 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model sokolova et al 2012 combined mst markers with a 3 dimensional coupled hydrodynamic model to investigate the contribution from different contamination sources in a swedish lake in addition derx et al 2016 used a human associated mst marker to calibrate a hydrological process based microbial fate and transport model qmracatch for a river and backwater river system for microbial risk assessment to the best of our knowledge detailed hydrological characterization or modeling in combination with the use of mst markers to explain patterns and sources of fib in riverine floodplains has not been reported in the literature so far the aim of this study was to characterize patterns temporal variation and sources of fecal pollution in a typical backwater area of the danube river a new concept was applied by extending the observed fib data with information on river connectivity and genetic mst marker levels river connectivity was calculated by a detailed 2d hydrodynamic surface water model to date the term hydrological connectivity has been used in an ecological context to refer to water mediated transfer of matter energy and or organisms within or between elements of riverine corridors tockner et al 2000 hein et al 2003 2016 pringle 2003 reckendorfer et al 2013 weigelhofer et al 2015 mayr et al 2020 in this study river connectivity was used in a new context to support improved data interpretation guiding pollution and health related water quality management for this survey connectivity was defined as the degree of hydraulic connection between the river danube and the sampling locations in the backwater area it is given as relative connectivity in calculated for each sampling site as the number of connected days during the total investigation period 3 years we hypothesized that the proposed concept is able to allocate the observed fecal pollution levels to their allochthonous and autochthonous sources of human or animal origin in the backwater area to support the evaluation of the new approach the investigation design covered a pronounced connectivity gradient from the river to the backwater environment as well as significant variations in the expected animal abundance to cover sites with both low and high animal impact 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the investigated alluvial backwater area called porous aquifer pa is a typical urban riverine wetland whose dynamic character was fundamentally changed by the regulation of the danube river in the 19th century weigelhofer et al 2013 it is located on the north side of the danube river at the eastern border of vienna austria fig 1 and covers an area of approximately 12 km2 due to the regulation of the danube and the construction of a flood protection dam alongside the danube the pa backwater was almost completely disconnected from the main stream the backwater presently consists of a river channel network whose main side arm has a surface connection with the danube river at its lowermost end through a levee opening backflow connection numerous partly disconnected backwaters and isolated ponds are also present the pa backwater is subdivided into 6 basins by check dams and natural fords floods that enter the floodplain via the backflow connection move upstream along the main side arm creating a distinct gradient in hydrological connectivity in the various waterbodies with distance to the inflow reckendorfer et al 2013 the pa backwater is an important water resource for vienna s drinking water supply hein et al 2006 and five drinking water wells riverbank filtrate are situated in the floodplain area it is also part of a national park that plays a strategic role as a wilderness area and for recreation arnberger et al 2009 there are no settlements or livestock in the considered backwater area but there is a considerable population of wild animals such as ruminants wild boars and birds fr√ºhauf and sabathy 2006 b parz gollner 2006 arnberger et al 2009 in addition 600 000 people visit the national park area every year hinterberger et al 2000 bathing is prohibited within the considered backwater area and visitors may only use selected paths for walking and cycling therefore the possibility for human fecal input from visitors is considered to be low frick et al 2018 2 2 sampling surface water samples were taken monthly at the danube river site and at nine representative backwater locations lsw1 lsw9 fig 1 at different sections of the backwater area gabriel et al 2014 from may 2010 to june 2013 the sampling location lsw1 was situated in a side arm outside the flood protected area delineated by the dam and therefore represented waterbodies with high connectivity to the danube river the locations lsw2 and lsw3 represent waterbodies at the main side arm with a decreasing gradient of connectivity and average water depths of approx 110 cm and 170 cm respectively the sites lsw4 lsw5 and lsw6 represent side ditches with very low connectivity at the western end of the study area the water depth at lsw4 was approx 30 50 cm and it once completely dried out by the end of 2012 at this location animal traces e g traces or fecal material from ruminants could be repeatedly detected in the waterbody lsw5 was located in a side ditch with a water depth of approx 110 cm on average the depth at lsw6 was approx 100 cm three sampling sites lsw7 lsw8 lsw9 were chosen in disconnected shallow backwaters that repeatedly completely dried out lsw7 was located in a small pond with a water depth of approx 30 cm at lsw7 a range of animal traces footprints and wallows of wild boars were repeatedly detected so a high animal abundance could be expected lsw8 was in a very shallow side ditch approx 20 40 cm water depth near a feeding lot for game and was frequently used by wild animals e g wild boar for wallowing in 2010 and 2011 locations lsw7 and lsw8 were sampled alternately each month lsw7 or lsw8 was sampled lsw9 was situated in a shallow side ditch water depth of approx 40 60 cm right beside a frequented path for visitors therefore the abundance of wild animals was expected to be low water samples were taken approx 15 cm below the water surface if the water depth was lower than approx 30 cm samples were taken very carefully to avoid contamination from the surface layer or from whirled up sediments samples for microbiological analysis were collected in sterile 2 l plastic bottles samples for chemical analysis were collected in prewashed polyethylene bottles the samples were transported in dark cool boxes to the laboratory within 4 h during sampling relevant additional information i e numbers of visible animals animal traces in soil and sediments wallows amount of visible fecal pats on animal abundance was gathered 2 3 standard fecal indicator bacteria bacteriological analysis of surface water samples was performed according to established iso standards based on membrane filtration and cultivation one hundred milliliters or an appropriate dilution of each water sample was filtered through a cellulose nitrate filter pore size 0 45 Œºm e coli was investigated on tbx agar 44 0 5 c 44 4 h according to iso 16649 2 international organisation for standardisation 2001 intestinal enterococci were enumerated on slanetz and bartley agar 36 2 c 44 4 h and confirmed on bile aesculin agar 44 0 5 2 h according to iso 7899 2 international organisation for standardisation 2000 c perfringens was investigated in accordance with iso 14189 international organisation for standardisation 2013 on tsc agar 44 1 c 21 3 h and confirmed by testing for acid phosphatase water samples for the detection of c perfringens were pasteurized before filtration 15 1 min 60 2 c to detect spores only for quality control the following type strains were used e coli nctc 9001 enterococcus faecalis nctc 775 and clostridium perfringens nctc 8237 the threshold of detection was 1 or 10 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml depending on the sample volume analyzed 2 4 genetic source tracking markers for the analysis of microbial source tracking mst markers samples from the danube river danube and from five representative sampling locations lsw1 lsw3 lsw4 lsw7 and lsw8 were selected in the main side arm lsw1 represents a location with high connectivity and lsw3 represents a location with low connectivity lsw4 was chosen as a side ditch closely connected to the main side arm but with low connectivity to the river danube and furthermore a high animal abundance lsw7 and lsw8 represent more disconnected ditches with anticipated significant animal abundance water samples 200 ml until july 2011 afterwards 600 ml were filtered through 0 2 Œºm polycarbonate filters merck millipore usa if the filter clogged before the intended volume was filtered filtration was terminated after 1 h the filtered volume was determined as a weight difference by comparing the start and end weights of the bottles dna extraction was performed using a bead beating and phenol chloroform based dna extraction protocol as described previously griffiths et al 2000 the extracted dna was eluted in tris buffer ph 8 0 and stored at 80 c until further analysis prior to the qpcr assays the concentration of the dna extracts was quantified with a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific united kingdom a universal bacteroidetes marker bacdick dick and field 2004 was used as a quality control to assess the ability to amplify dna in the samples and to rule out the presence of dna inhibiting substances in the dna extracts reischer et al 2008 mayer et al 2018 furthermore all qpcr assays except for bacdick were run with the ntb2 fragment as an internal amplification control in duplex iac noncompetitive to monitor for qpcr amplification inhibition anderson et al 2011 all sample dnas in the qpcr assays detecting host associated fecal pollution from humans bachum kildare et al 2007 and hf183ii green et al 2014 ruminants bacr reischer et al 2006 and pigs wild baors pig2bac mieszkin et al 2009 were measured in duplicate quality assessment of qpcr data was performed as previously described in detail reischer et al 2006 2011 mayer et al 2018 all controls and no template controls were consistently negative i e the fluorescence never exceeded the threshold qpcr standard dilutions ranging from 101 to 106 targets per reaction were used in a linear regression model to calculate the qpcr calibration curve the results are reported as marker equivalents per filtered water volume me vol 1 as previously described reischer et al 2006 the filtration volume of the sample the analyzed volume for qpcr analysis and the minimal detectable marker concentration per pcr defined the threshold of detection reischer et al 2011 mayer et al 2018 the threshold of detection of the data set presented herein ranged from 11 to 222 marker equivalents per analyzed water sample see supplemental material data the bacdick assay was run on a mastercycler realplex pcr machine eppendorf germany in a total reaction volume of 25 Œºl with 2 5 Œºl diluted sample dna 1 4 1 16 and if necessary 1 64 all other qpcr assays were run on a rotor gene q thermocycler in a total reaction volume of 15 Œºl with 2 5 Œºl diluted sample dna 1 4 or 1 16 to ensure the applicability of the genetic mst markers their performance needs to be tested for the individual catchment and fecal sources reischer et al 2013 mayer et al 2018 all mst assays applied the bachum the hf183ii the pig2bac and the bacr assay were tested for their level of specificity and sensitivity for the respective fecal source group s on samples from the study area further details on molecular methods quality assurance and

material table s6 2 6 hydrodynamic modeling and calculating river connectivity the connection of the selected sampling sites along the floodplain river to the danube river was determined based on a 2d hydrodynamic surface water model cche2d version 2 0 national center for computational hydroscience and engineering university of mississippi the model is based on the solution of the two dimensional formulation of the shallow water equations and has been successfully applied for the analysis of river flows chao et al 2015 2016 the model uses depth integrated reynolds equations the spatial discretization of the geometry and the related processes is based on the efficient element method wang and hu 1992 for temporal discretization the implicit first order euler s method was implemented and was able to simulate subcritical and supercritical flow conditions the model domain covered an area of approximately 22 km2 fig s1 the terrain and riverbed elevation in the model grid cells were a product from a digital terrain model dtm the dtm was based on laser scan data which were complemented with terrestrial surveys along the side arm channel gsch√∂pf and blaschke 2009 the spatial distribution of the manning roughness values were based on a detailed land use and vegetation classification 43 classes that was mapped into 12 different roughness classes hein et al 2008 during model calibration the manning roughness values were fine adjusted to floods of the river danube during august 2008 june 2009 and june 2011 ranging from 0 024 to 0 125 s m 0 3 within the model domain the spatial resolution of the rectangular model grid varied between 0 1 m and 20 m depending on local topographic characteristics the total number of calculation nodes was 396 000 as the upstream model boundary bu the observed hourly discharges at the danube stream gauge in fischamend were used the downstream boundary bd condition was given by the observed water level at the eastern model boundary at river station 1911 km fig s1 the initial flow conditions at the calculated nodes were based on steady flow simulations for typical flow conditions in the danube river at fischamend depending on the temporal dynamics of the input hydrographs calculation time step lengths between 30 s and 1 h were used for calculating the river connectivity the 2d surface water flow velocities of the floodplain river were simulated on an hourly basis during a flood event in january 2011 with an approximate 10 year return period the floodplain river is connected to the danube river if the flow discharge exceeds the mean flow discharge of 1910 m3 s 1 in this case the danube river water flows into the floodplain river during the rising limb of a flood event when the flood peak is reached the flow direction reverses and the water flows back toward the danube river a specific sampling site was considered to be connected as soon as the inflowing danube river water reached up to this point during the rising limb of the flood event this criterion was fulfilled if the simulated 2d flow velocities in the floodplain river were larger than 0 1 m s 1 from the point of entry towards the sampling site fig s3 in this way a threshold water level at the danube river was determined for each sampling site if the danube river water level was higher or equal to this threshold level a sampling site was considered to be connected the connectivity of the floodplain river was then defined for each sampling site as the time span during which the site was connected the connectivity of each sampling site was determined based on the threshold water levels fig s2 and the water level duration curves of the gauge station for the observation period from 2010 to 2013 the connectivity in was calculated for each sampling site as the number of connected days in the observation period furthermore the time span since the last surface water connection to the danube river was calculated for each sampling site and date 2 7 statistics for further analysis all values under the threshold of detection were set to zero statistics were calculated in ibm spss version 23 and sigmaplot version 13 0 for correlation analysis spearman s rank correlation and the kruskal wallis test for the comparison of groups were applied kruskal and wallis 1952 for significance testing multiple correlations were adjusted according to bonferroni correction bonferroni 1936 3 results 3 1 establishing basic knowledge on standard fecal indicator bacteria fib from 2010 to 2013 the selected sites in the backwater area and the danube river 10 sites n 317 samples were investigated for the occurrence and temporal variation of fecal pollution by enumerating the fib table 1 the results on the occurrence of the fib e coli intestinal enterococci and c perfringens spores at the sampling sites showed a patchy distribution with a median concentration range from 0 3 to 2 1 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 no clear spatial trend of fecal contamination was obvious from the fib data alone the highest median concentrations of e coli and enterococci were detected at the danube river and the side ditches lsw4 lsw7 and lsw8 1 72 2 01 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 and 1 28 2 14 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 respectively the lowest concentrations were found in the main side arm at lsw3 and at the side ditches lsw5 and lsw9 0 78 1 04 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 and 0 60 0 85 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 respectively the concentrations of c perfringens spores were highest at the danube river the locations in the main side arm lsw1 and lsw2 and in the side ditches lsw7 and lsw8 1 32 1 72 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 the lowest concentrations were detected at lsw3 and the side ditches lsw5 and lsw9 0 30 0 98 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 3 2 river connectivity and fib concentrations in context to the connectivity gradient the determined river connectivity values of the sampling sites to the danube river were expressed as days and percentage of days within a 3 year period 2010 2013 the selected sampling sites showed a strong connectivity gradient from 1050 days at the danube river 100 down to 278 days at lsw 1 25 30 days at lsw 2 3 20 days at lsw 3 2 9 days at lsw4 to lsw7 1 and 5 days at lsw 8 and 9 1 fig 2 the investigated backwater locations could thus be separated into two sections the first is a somewhat more frequently river connected section fcs covering the locations from the danube river along the main side arm lsw1 lsw2 lsw3 is located in a transition area to the second rarely river connected section rcs including the rest of the sampling locations from lsw4 to lsw9 fig 2 at the fcs locations within the course of the main backwater branch the declining connectivity gradient from 100 to 3 was also clearly reflected by a decreasing trend in fib concentrations table 1 fig 2 this trend could be consistently observed for e coli kruskal wallis test n 145 p 0 001 enterococci kruskal wallis test n 148 p 0 001 and c perfringens spores kruskal wallis test n 145 p 0 001 indicating a dominating and frequent influence of allochthonous sewage pollution from the danube river into the backwater system in accordance with the hydrological link of the investigated systems in contrast in the rcs lsw3 lsw9 the observed patchy distribution of fecal pollution as indicated by e coli enterococci and c perfringens spores was not related to river connectivity at all table 1 for example the strong variation in fecal pollution at the rcs irrespective of the situation at the danube river is impressively demonstrated by the observed e coli concentrations fig 2 concentration ranges from very low e coli concentrations up to levels even higher than those detected at the danube river an extremely fluctuating situation was observed at lsw7 ranging from not detectable up to 3 5 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 fig 2 the situation at the rcs regarding the detected fib levels suggested animal fecal pollution sources of autochthonous origin from the backwater area to test this hypothesis genetic mst markers were applied to generate information on the origin of observed fecal pollution levels 3 3 complementing the data set with information on pollution sources mst from 2010 to 2013 a number of 174 water samples were also analyzed for human ruminant and pig associated genetic mst markers from six selected locations danube river lsw1 lsw3 lsw4 lsw7 lsw8 to conduct fecal source allocation fig 3 for the danube river samples human associated mst markers bachum hf183ii were the dominant markers proving that this river environment is indeed mainly impacted by municipal wastewater the median values for the human associated fecal markers bachum and hf183ii were 3 6 and 2 7 log10 me 100 ml 1 respectively in contrast the median concentrations for ruminant bacr and pig associated pig2bac markers were below the detection limits at the danube river fig 3 at lsw1 a backwater river site with 25 river connectivity within the fcs the concentrations of the human associated mst markers were considerably lower compared to the danube river nonetheless concentrations were still detectable at the 75th percentiles with bachum and hf183ii levels higher than 2 0 log10 me 100 ml 1 demonstrating the impact of human fecal pollution events from the danube river except for a few cases of very low qpcr determinations ruminant and pig associated mst markers could not be detected in any of the lsw1 samples fig 3 at lsw3 a backwater river location with low connectivity 2 at the transition area between the fcs and rcs bachum could be found in only 2 7 of the samples indicating a sporadic impact by human fecal pollution fig 3 the human associated marker hf183ii was not detectable in any of the samples ruminant bacr and pig pig2bac associated fecal markers were detectable in 45 and 16 of all samples with 90th percentiles at 2 9 log10 and 2 5 log10 me 100 ml 1 respectively showing that wildlife had a detectable influence at lsw4 lsw7 and lsw8 within the rcs locations in side ditches with very low connectivity 1 to the danube river wildlife especially ruminant populations exhibited a strong and obvious influence at lsw4 the ruminant associated mst marker bacr was detected in 90 of the samples with a median concentration of 4 0 log10 me 100 ml 1 and a 90th percentile of 5 0 log10 me 100 ml 1 the pig associated marker pig2bac was detectable in 43 of the samples at lower concentrations with a 90th percentile of 3 7 log10 me 100 ml 1 bacr could be found in 58 90th percentile of 3 8 log10 me 100 ml 1 pig2bac in 42 90th percentile of 3 2 log10 me 100 ml 1 of the samples from lsw7 at lsw8 bacr was detected in 88 of the samples with a median concentration of 4 1 log10 me 100 ml 1 and a 90th percentile of 5 0 log10 me 100 ml 1 pig2bac was found in 35 of the samples with a 90th percentile of 3 7 log10 me 100 ml 1 human associated markers bachum hf183ii indicated only a sporadic impact by human fecal pollution fig 3 at those locations human associated markers decreased with declining connectivity this effect was most distinct for bachum fig 4 showing a strong decreasing median concentration gradient from high to low river connectivity 3 4 highlighting habitat differences by statistical analysis the results of a statistical correlation analysis for the selected locations danube river lsw1 lsw3 lsw4 lsw8 with additional mst information further supported the different pollution characteristics between frequently and rarely river connected locations lsw7 was omitted because of low sample size n 12 at the danube river site significant correlations were

suggested as a human associated sewage tracer vierheilig et al 2013 very remarkably for lsw1 a clear dependence for all fib parameters and human associated mst marker concentrations on the time span

microbiological chemophysica and chemical data sets tables s3 s4 and s5 supplemental material a significant correlation between the fib fractions could be detected at lsw3 and lsw8 for e coli vs enterococci table 2 4 discussion 4 1 successful realization of the new approach the newly established approach was able to characterize the observed fecal pollution patterns in the backwater area in detail fib data alone only provided the basis for a highly speculative interpretation of the nature of the observed fecal pollution combining the information from the fib with river connectivity and genetic mst marker concentrations gave very useful information on two potential pollution aspects of the selected water resource on the one hand information on the allochthonous i e externally from the main river channel vs the autochthonous i e internally from the backwater area natures of fecal pollution could be gathered on the other hand information on the host origin was also generated i e human vs animal by combining both aspects a congruent and precise picture of the characteristics of the observed fecal pollution at the backwater locations could successfully be drawn it could be demonstrated that linking host associated genetic fecal markers with river connectivity data can add valuable spatial information on mst efforts information on mst marker occurrence per se only provides an indication of the responsibility of host groups for fecal pollution events e g pigs vs ruminants vs pets humans vs animals but does not give any information on its spatial origin if required information on the spatial origin of mst markers can be generated by laborious hydraulic transport modeling efforts sokolova et al 2012 however in this study we demonstrated that combining microbiological and hydrological connectivity data provides a very straightforward way to obtain information on the spatial component of fecal contamination in backwater resources as seasonal river fluctuations determined the hydrological connectivity in the investigated area this data also provides information on the temporal component of fecal contamination compare fig s3 supplemental material the suggested approach may not be limited to alluvial backwater resources but is also likely useful for other types of water resources where different water compartments interact such as in estuaries and marshes col√≥n rivera et al 2012 wild allen and andrewartha 2016 raimonet and cloern 2017 in addition this study provides the first clear evidence that hydrological river connectivity is not only a very useful metric in river ecology tockner et al 1999 hein et al 2003 reckendorfer et al 2013 weigelhofer et al 2015 but can efficiently be applied for user and health related alluvial water quality investigations too 4 2 significance of results for water resource management alluvial backwater systems are essential water resources throughout the world tockner and stanford 2002 filippini et al 2015 bonsor et al 2017 martinez et al 2017 often used not only for drinking water supply and recreational activities but also for aquaculture handisyde et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 bayazid et al 2019 the new approach is able to realize improved fecal pollution monitoring practices to support target oriented water quality management in backwater areas all over the globe different methods for the determination of river connectivity matrices are available and it is not a must to rely on hydrodynamic modeling as provided in this study tritthart et al 2011 shen et al 2015 stone et al 2017 diaz redondo et al 2018 the suggested approach is not limited to fecal hazard characterization and improved backwater catchment protection i e minimization of fecal pollution events but is also able to essentially support microbial risk assessment activities qmra it can be further used to provide information on the relevant fecal pollution sources to develop sound qmra modeling scenarios for the backwater area of consideration derx et al 2016 the river connectivity approach can be extended to any reference pathogen global water pathogen project 2019 or chemical pollutant of interest islam et al 2015 hai et al 2018 van driezum et al 2019 for the investigated backwater area downstream of vienna it was demonstrated that two different pollution sources have to be regarded when talking about fecal contamination i human fecal pollution from municipal wastewater as the dominating allochthonous component by the danube river kirschner et al 2017 and ii wildlife fecal pollution as an important autochthonous source directly situated in the backwater this aspect is important for target oriented quality management of the pa backwater because just until recently the danube river was considered the only fecal pollution source for the pa drinking water resources however other backwaters may show completely different pollution patterns for example autochthonous pollution from human activities settlements leaking sewage pipes pit latrines and agriculture and livestock can be of significant relevance for many other floodplain areas tockner and stanford 2002 because the pa backwater is managed as a nature conservation area where no livestock farming or human settlements are allowed it can be considered a kind of natural fecal pollution reference area for the central european region with wild boars and deer as the major managed populations of the hunting ground arnberger et al 2009 furthermore the main river in contrast to the danube river may also show significant pollution with nonhuman fecal sources recent studies revealed the adverse effect of grazing livestock on river water quality jabbar and grote 2019 and identified direct defecation to the stream by wading livestock and the release of fib from cowpats by surface runoff from the adjacent pastures as very important transmission routes for fib to the river kay et al 2018 4 3 applicability of genetic mst markers in backwaters the application of genetic bacteroidetes mst markers is at least partly driven by the availability of appropriately performing genetic markers according to certain mst quality criteria such as pollution source sensitivity and specificity for the austrian pa backwater area the selection of this set of markers focusing on human ruminant and pig fecal pollution was scientifically justified as the pollution source profile psp indicated humans ruminants and pigs as potential emission sources with the highest relevance frick et al 2018 interestingly the investigated pa area inhabits approximately twice as many ruminants as wild boar arnberger et al 2009 apparently explaining the higher concentrations of ruminant associated markers compared to pig markers at the investigated sampling locations fig 3 however the local animal distribution and abundance seems to be an important factor for fecal pollution levels as detected by fib concentrations the psp also indicated that birds may play a role as fecal sources in the pa backwater area frick et al 2018 unfortunately a comprehensive genetic mst marker assay covering all avian populations of potential interest is currently not available for the pa area in addition pollution source profiling psp linked to gis modeling indicated that poikilothermic species i e animals whose body temperature depends on the temperature of the environment such as fish frogs and snails may further contribute relevant amounts of fib to the pa backwater frick et al 2018 no genetic mst marker assay exists for poikilotherms so far as these animals were not regarded as relevant sources until very recently complementing mst by genetic qpcr targets for birds and poikilothermic animals would add more details about the nature of the observed wildlife pollution source in the future nonetheless extending the mst marker set would not change the main outcome of this study regarding the identified main drivers of the autochthonous i e human sewage and allochthonous i e wildlife feces fecal pollution sources at the pa backwater mst efforts during this study focused on bacterial genetic markers to complement the fib data the sampling technique frequency required volumes as well as the processing of samples e g filtration can easily be extended to support robust interpretation for the bacterial compartment mayer et al 2015 2016 savio et al 2018 however extending mst for backwater resources towards the viral compartment can be highly attractive for several reasons e g high specificity characteristics for the targeted fecal source many human animal and bacterial phage viral mst targets for qpcr exist ahmed and harwood 2017 edwards et al 2019 and can be linked with the suggested river connectivity approach 5 conclusions on the example of the austrian porous aquifer backwater area it was demonstrated that the combination of river connectivity and genetic mst markers could explain the fecal pollution patterns revealed by standard fecal indicator bacteria monitoring whereas fib data alone could not it was demonstrated that allochthonous and autochthonous sources can be important for alluvial backwaters in the study area the relevance of external sources from the river dominated by human fecal sources from municipal sewage disposal systems is depending on the connectivity of the concerned sites internal fecal sources from wild animals are not distributed homogenously but depend on local animal abundance which is determined by specific habitat preferences the results are a valuable input for sustainable and target oriented water source management and for microbial risk assessment the presented approach is assumed to be useful for characterizing alluvial water resources for water

two orders of magnitude higher than that of chlorine unchlorinated algal impacted waters were toxic owning to the presence of mcs and chlorination enhanced their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity due to

chlorine heeb et al 2014 however the role of br in the degradation of cyanotoxins is not clear given the complex role of chlorination in determining the toxicity of treated algal impacted waters the experimental measurement of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity is required to decipher the forcing agent formation of halogenated dbps vs degradation of cyanotoxins for the toxicity in view of increasing occurrence of harmful algal bloom in surface waters the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the comparative formation of dbps during chlorination of algal impacted waters and surface waters under practical water treatment conditions 2 to study the kinetics for the reactions of mcs with chlorine and bromine and 3 to determine the mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the extracted organics of the chlorinated water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents culturing of cyanobacteria and preparation of algal impacted waters all chemical solutions were prepared from

the model cyanobacterium species in this study the culturing of cyanobacteria and preparation of algal impacted waters are described in our previous study liu et al 2018 which is further detailed in text s2 of the supplementary material in addition six types of raw surface waters and treated waters after coagulation and sand filtration but without disinfection were collected from several water treatment plants in south carolina usa the selection of these waters was based on their distinct specific ultraviolet absorbance suva indicator of aromatic and hydrophobic properties values ranging from 1 7 to 5 1 l mg m covering the typical suva values of surface waters in water treatment additional information regarding sampling and water characteristics can be found in supplementary material

5 10 mm phosphate buffer and 21 c room temperature in milli q water under pseudo first order conditions where chlorine or bromine was at least 10 fold in excess bromine solutions were prepared by the reaction of chlorine with br according to a previously described method liu et al 2012 the reaction was initiated by injecting 50 Œºl of the chlorine or bromine stock solution into 5 ml of solutions containing mcs which were capped with ptfe faced silica septum after the addition of oxidant the vials were placed on a vortex mixer with stirring for 10 s samples 300 Œºl were transferred into vials with inserts containing 10 Œºl of sodium sulfite solutions 50 mm to quench the oxidant afterwards concentrations of residual mcs were analyzed directly by hplc all experiments were duplicated 2 4 experiments for chlorination of algal impacted waters and surface waters for chlorination of algal impacted waters experiments were conducted in 6 l of capped bottles since large volume was needed for toxicity measurement for chlorination of surface waters experiments were carried out in 250 ml of capped amber bottles all experiments were performed under headspace free conditions at ph 7 5 in the dark at room temperature 21 1 c each source water doc 2 mg l in the presence of various initial br concentrations i e 0 800 Œºg l covering the typical br range in source waters was treated with chlorine under practical water treatment conditions 4 mg l cl2 for 24 h reactions were initiated by the injection of an aliquot of an hocl stock solution after 24 h 240 ml of water samples were withdrawn and after the measurement of residual oxidants the corresponding amount of ascorbic acid molar ratio 1 0 was added to quench the residual for the dbp analyses ascorbic acid was recommended for the quenching of water samples for the analyses of organic dbps i e thms haas hans etc since it does not decompose these dbps kristiana et al 2014 the remaining chlorinated algal impacted waters were extracted for mammalian cell toxicity experiments 2 5 isolation of organics the organics resulting from unchlorinated used as the control and chlorinated algal impacted waters were concentrated by adsorption onto xad resins plewa 2016 xad 2 amberlite xad 2 sigma aldrich mo and xad 8 supelite dax 8 sigma aldrich mo resins were pre cleaned in a soxhlet extractor and stored in pure methanol in the refrigerator before use a slurry of 55 ml xad 2 xad 8 resin mix measured in a graduated cylinder was packed on a plug of glass wool in a glass chromatography column the water samples were acidified to ph 2 by sulfuric acid prior to being added into the column for extraction to ensure the protonation of carboxylic organics the resins were eluted with 400 ml of optima spectroscopy grade ethyl acetate fisher scientific pa to elute the organic compounds the residual water in the ethyl acetate eluent was removed using a separatory funnel followed by passing the hydrophobic fraction through a column of anhydrous sodium sulfate the ethyl acetate extract was then reduced to 1 1 5 ml by a rotary evaporator at 50 60 c and evaporated blown down to a sludge using a gentle stream of nitrogen gas for each sample dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was used to dissolve the organic extract resulting in a 105 fold concentration of organic compounds derived from the water samples 2 6 chinese hamster ovary cho cells the cho cells cell line as52 clone 11 4 8 were used for the mammalian cell toxicity studies and maintained in ham s f12 5 fetal bovine serum fbs medium at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere of 5 co2 the cells exhibit normal morphology express cell contact inhibition and grow as a monolayer without expression of neoplastic foci 2 7 cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay the cho cell microplate chronic cytotoxicity assay measures the reduction in cell density as a function of the concentration of the test agent during a 72 h exposure period the detailed procedure is presented in text s6 of supplementary material briefly the protocol involved the use of a 96 well flat bottomed micro plate to evaluate the diluted organic extracts of the algal impacted water samples with varying concentration factors for each concentration factor of a given water sample 4 8 replicates were analyzed and the experiments were repeated the data were used to generate a concentration response curve for each algal impacted water sample regression analysis was applied to calculate the lc50 defined as the calculated concentration of the test agent that induced a cell density that was 50 of the negative control the metric for the aqueous or organic concentration was the concentration factor which allows for direct comparison among the water samples 2 8 cho cell single cell gel electrophoresis assay single cell gel electrophoresis scge comet is a molecular genetic assay that can quantitatively measure the level of genomic dna damage induced in individual nuclei of cells

provided in text s7 of supplementary material akin to cho chronic cytotoxicity assay 4 104 cho cells were added to each microplate well and treated with a series of diluted organic extracts of the algal impacted water samples with varying concentration factors for 4 h experiments were repeated 2 3 times for each water sample concentrate a computerized image analysis system comet iv perspective instruments ltd suffolk uk was employed to determine the tail dna the amount of dna that migrated from the nucleus into the microgel of the nuclei as the measure of dna damage kumaravel and jha 2006 the digitalized data fig s2 of supplementary material were automatically transferred to a computer based spreadsheet for subsequent statistical analysis for concentration factors of each algal impacted water sample with the cell viability 70 a concentration response curve was generated based on the regression analysis for the curve fitting the concentration factor that induced a 50 tail dna value was calculated 2 9 statistical analyses for the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays the units of measure were the clone of exposure cells and the microgel respectively a one way analysis of variance anova test was conducted to determine if each water sample induced a statistically significant level of either cytotoxicity or genotoxicity within the concentration response curve if a significant f value p 0 05 was obtained a holm sidak multiple comparison versus the control group analysis was performed to identify the lowest cytotoxic or genotoxic concentration factor the power of the test statistic 1 Œ≤ was maintained as 0 8 at Œ± 0 05 to determine significant differences among the water sample groups a bootstrap statistical approach was used to generate a series of multiple lc50 values and multiple 50 tail dna values for each water sample for each lc50 value a cytotoxicity index cti value was calculated as lc50 1 103 for the 50 tail dna values a genotoxicity index gti value was calculated 50 tail dna 1 103 these cti and gti values were separately analyzed using an anova test 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative formation of dbps from algal impacted waters and surface waters 3 1 1 thms fig 1 presents the concentrations of measured thms from algal impacted waters and surface waters in the presence of various initial br concentrations concentrations of thms from algal impacted waters ranged from 6 2 0 7 representing mean standard errors in this paper to 18 1 0 5 Œºg mgc for initial br concentrations of 40 800 Œºg l in contrast median concentrations of those from surface waters where nom predominates were in the range of 33 9 98 3 Œºg mgc these results indicate that the formation of thms from aom is much lower than that of comparable nom for example the median thm concentration from nom was as five times high as that formed from aom at initial br concentration of 40 Œºg l it was reported that tcm concentration in the absence of br under fp conditions from suwannee river nom was almost twice that from aom i e c a 70 vs 30 Œºg mgc fang et al 2010 therefore the gap for the thm formation from nom vs aom is smaller under fp conditions nom is typically comprised of 50 of humic substances which contain aromatic phenolic and carboxyl group contents functioning as fast reacting thm precursors leenheer and crou√© 2003 liu and croue 2016 however humic substances only account for 14 22 of the total doc in aom and the major fraction is protein and carbohydrate type of structure which might be slow reacting thm precursors liu et al 2018 therefore the quantification of thm formation for aom under fp conditions may not represent the thm formation for practical applications where low chlorine dose and short reaction time were employed it was seen that increasing the initial br concentration increased the formation of total thms from aom and nom fig 1 for example median thm concentrations from nom were 33 9 48 8 69 7 and 98 3 Œºg mgc for initial br concentrations of 40 200 400 and 800 Œºg l respectively this is in line with previous studies ersan et al 2019a hu et al 2010 hua et al 2006 in addition increasing initial br concentration shifted the formation of thms from chlorinated to brominated species 3 1 2 haas fig 2 shows that total concentrations of haas formed from algal impacted waters ranged from 8 0 0 4 to 11 3 0 3 Œºg mgc while median concentrations of those from surface waters were in the range of 33 6 54 6 Œºg mgc similar to thm the major fraction of nom is aromatic phenolic and carboxyl groups which are haa precursors leenheer and crou√© 2003 therefore the median concentration of haas formed from nom was three times as high as that of aom at initial br concentration of 40 Œºg l different from thm increasing initial br concentration only slightly increased total concentrations of haas formed from aom however the speciation of haas was shifted from chlorinated species to brominated analogues all nine haa species were measured and their concentrations vary with the change in the initial br concentration 3 1 3 hans the formed total hans from aom are present at slightly lower concentrations than their median concentrations from nom e g 1 7 vs 2 3 Œºg mgc at initial br concentration of 40 Œºg l fig 3 hans were formed from nitrogen containing functional groups such as amines amino acids which are derived from proteins and or anthropogenic compounds hureiki et al 1994 nevertheless their precursors are structure specific for example the dcan formation yield from aspartic acid was two orders of magnitude higher than those from other amino acids e g glycine alanine etc selbes et al 2015 it is likely that the surface waters have more han precursors than algal impacted water harvested in this study due to the distinct precursor of hans versus thm haa formed from aromatic phenolic and carboxyl groups the ratio of han formation from nom to han formation from aom was 1 3 1 6 which is much smaller than that of thm haa 3 0 5 0 although aom does not appear to be an important thm haa precursor it can form comparable levels of hans with nom increasing the initial br concentration significantly increased concentrations of total hans from aom and nom for example increasing the initial br concentration from 0 to 800 Œºg l almost doubled the concentrations of total hans indicating that bromine favours the formation of hans as compared to chlorine this may increase the toxicity of treated waters since brominated hans are much more toxic than their chlorinated analogues wagner and plewa 2017 3 1 4 tox the formation of tox total organic chlorine tocl and total organic bromine tobr during chlorination of aom and nom is presented in fig 4 aom produced lower tox ca 49 Œºg cl mgc than their median levels from nom 128 0 141 5 Œºg cl mgc in addition concentrations of tox remained generallly stable irrespective of changes in initial br concentrations since there was no change for the amounts of precursors nevertheless increasing initial br concentrations shifted the formation of tox from chlorinated species to brominated analogues fig s3 of supplementary material shows the fraction of each group of dbp of total tox from chlorination of algal impacted waters thm and haa are the main groups of dbps while han is the minor species unknown tox which was calculated from the difference between the tox and the sum of halogen equivalent concentrations of measured specific dbps accounted for 70 of total tox due to the hydrophilic nature of aom in contrast for nom unknown tox only accounts for 50 60 of the total tox fig s4 of supplementary material this may be attributed to nom being more aromatic and hydrophobic as indicated by higher suva values in table s2 of supplementary material forming more known dbps henderson et al 2008 liu et al 2018 generally increasing the initial br concentration decreased the percentage of unknown tox indicating that the formation of known dbps e g thm was favoured in the bromination process 3 2 kinetics for the reactions of microcystins with chlorine or bromine even though toxic halogenated dbps can be formed during chlorination chlorine can react with the cyanotoxins in algal impacted waters previous studies have shown that the reaction of mcs with chlorine is of second order in total first order in oxidant chlorine and first order in mcs acero et al 2005 rodriguez et al 2007 the rate constant for the reaction of chlorine bromine with mcs was investigated under pseudo first order conditions i e at least a 10 1 molar ratio of oxidant to mcs in a batch reactor fig s5 of supplementary material shows the degradation of various mcs by chlorination and bromination only for mc lr almost 90 of initial mc lr was degraded by chlorine in 30 min and complete degradation by bromine was achieved in 0 5 min this indicated that bromine reacts much faster than chlorine toward mc lr for other mcs over 95 of degradation was seen in 15 min the degradation rates follow the order mc wr mc lw mc yr mc ly mc rr to determine the second order rate constants for the reactions of oxidant with mcs the reaction can be written as 1 hocl mc products k app and hence the rate of mc degradation can be expressed as 2 d mc dt kapp mc hocl where kapp is the apparent second order rate constant under the pseudo first order conditions equation 2 is simplified to 3 d mc dt k mc and 4 k kapp hocl 0 taking natural log at both sides of equation 3 gives 5 ln mc mc 0 k t where k is the pseudo first order rate constant therefore if the assumption of first order kinetics with respect to mcs is correct the plot of the ln mc mc o versus time should yield a straight line for each experiment and the slope is k as shown in fig s6 of supplementary material table s3 of supplementary material summarizes the values of k obtained for various mcs based on the obtained k and equation 4 second order rate constants for the reactions of mcs with chlorine or bromine can be deduced as shown in table 1 the reaction rate constants of mcs vary depending on the connected l amino acids in the x and y positions and the oxidant chlorine or bromine for example the second order rate constant for the reaction between chlorine and mc lr is 60 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 and 21 c which was similar to 61 8 m 1s 1 reported in literature acero et al 2005 mc rr shows similar reactivity k 58 6 m 1s 1 with mc lr higher reaction constants k 92 8 and 138 6 m 1 s 1 were determined for mc ly and mc yr respectively this might be due to their tyrosine denoting to y in the name in which the phenolic moiety is the reactive site for chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 mc lw and mc wr are highly reactive 90 of initial mc lw and mc wr was degraded in 1 min therefore it is difficult to withdraw multiple samples in a batch reactor during such a short period to accurately determine the k however based on the available data sampled in the short time the range of k can be approximated as a result the range of k for mc lw and mc wr is 371 and 1214 m 1 s 1 respectively their greater reaction rate constants than other mcs are likely due to a tryptophan moiety denoting to w in the name being highly reactive towards chlorine pattison et al 2007 interestingly bromine reacts much faster than chlorine with mc lr and 95 of mc lr was degraded by bromine in 0 5 min likewise the range of k is 6350 m 1 s 1 indicating that the second order reaction rate constant of bromine with mc lr is two orders of magnitude higher than that of chlorine the reactions between bromine and other mcs were not studied due to the difficulty in measuring the fast reactions completed in 1 min but based on the order of the second order rate constants for the reactions between chlorine and mcs it can be expected that the k for the reactions between bromine and other mcs is 6350 m 1 s 1 it has been recognized that bromine reacts with phenolic compounds much faster than chlorine factor of 3000 heeb et al 2014 apparently the presence of br during chlorination of algal impacted waters will promote the degradation of mcs 3 3 cho cell chronic cytotoxicity analyses chlorination can be used to destruct cyanotoxins in a seasonal harmful algal bloom event but this could increase the formation of toxic halogenated dbps therefore the impact of chlorination on the toxicity of algal impacted waters under various initial br concentrations was evaluated by cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay figs s7 12 of supplementary material show the concentration response curves for each sample the data demonstrated that every sample induced mammalian cell cytotoxicity and generated a significant difference from their concurrent negative control table 2 however to determine if there was a significant difference among the algal samples a series of lc50 values using bootstrap statistics were converted into cytotoxicity index cti values lc50 1 103 varian 2005 the mean cti values were analyzed for significant differences using an anova test statistic with pairwise comparison this generated a metric in which the larger the number the greater the cytotoxic potency of the sample fig 5 shows the cytotoxicity index i e cho cell chronic cytotoxicity during chlorination under various initial br concentrations the data demonstrated that the cti value for the algal impacted water without chlorination was relatively high for a negative control table s4 of supplementary material shows mc concentrations in algal impacted waters the concentration of mc lr is the highest among various species of mcs 11 97 Œºg l for 2 mg l doc which is similar to that reported in literature 5 Œºg per mg of doc li et al 2012 for other types of mcs concentrations range from 2 03 to 2 67 Œºg l except for mc rr 0 59 Œºg l it was reported that mc lr can express cytotoxicity to cho cells lankoff et al 2003 xue et al 2015 over 100 different mc variants have been identified to date yet only six mcs were measured in this study due to the lack of commercially available standards in addition other cyanotoxins such as cylindrospermopsin and various neurotoxins have been detected in cyanobacteria spoof et al 2003 therefore six measured mcs and other matrix unknown toxins were likely to be the main contributor to the toxicity of the unchlorinated algal impacted waters when the algal impacted waters were chlorinated the mammalian cell cytotoxicity response increased significantly due to the formation of toxic dbps as shown in figs 1 4 meanwhile the concentrations of mc lr was reduced to 0 96 Œºg l and other mcs were not detected since chlorine can effectively degrade these toxins table 1 based on protein phosphatase 1 inhibition assay ppia the transformation products of chlorinated algal toxins were found to be non toxic rodr√≠guez et al 2008 this implies that chlorination would reduce the mc induced cytotoxicity increasing the initial concentrations of br from 0 to 800 Œºg l further decreased the concentration of mc lr to 0 15 Œºg l which was the higher reaction rate constants of bromine towards mc lr table 1 therefore the toxicity of treated waters slightly decreased with increasing initial br concentrations in addition as the initial br concentration increased the formation of unknown dbps i e unknown tox decreased fig s4 of supplementary material our recent study has indicated a correlation between cytotoxicity and unknown tox for disinfected waters ersan et al 2019b when the toxicity of chlorinated algal impacted waters was compared with tap waters from european countries eu tap waters in fig 5 in the literature jeong et al 2012 the cytotoxicity index of the former one was 2 3 times higher than the median value of the tap water this may indicate that even though algal impacted waters form less regulated identified dbps the more unknown dbps matrix would account for the higher toxicity index 3 4 cho cell acute genotoxicity analyses in addition to the chronic cytotoxicity the acute genotoxicity of the same samples was evaluated figs s13 18 of supplementary material present the genomic dna damage analyses each sample was analyzed for genomic dna damage with multiple repeated experiments the tail dna values for each concentration were combined and presented in the concentration response curves an analysis of variance test statistic was conducted with the data for each sample box et al 1978 detailed scge analyses for the induction of genomic dna damage in cho cells induced by each sample is presented in table 3 fig 6 shows the cho cell acute genotoxicity during chlorination of algal impacted waters under various initial br concentrations all samples expressed genotoxicity and generated concentration response graphs due to the presence of mcs unchlorinated algal impacted waters expressed genotoxicity chlorination increased the genotoxicity index which was attributed to the formation of toxic dbps the addition of br from 40 to 200 Œºg l to the algal impacted waters gradually increased the level of genotoxic response samples with initial br concentrations of 400 and 800 Œºg l did not express a continuation of increasing genotoxicity a possible reason is that further increasing initial concentration of br did not further remove cyanotoxins table s4 of supplementary material and the genotoxicity was driven preferentially by brominated or nitrogenous species plewa et al 2008 therefore the interactions among the cyanotoxins known dbps and unknown dbps are complex and not dependent on a single set of characteristics similarly the genotoxicity index of chlorinated algal impacted waters is much higher than that of eu tap waters the unknown dbps matrix in the algal impacted waters would contribute to the higher toxicity index further studies should address the identification of the highly toxic algal derived by products 4 conclusions under practical water treatment conditions algal impacted waters produced less regulated thms haas hans and tox than nom the ratios of dbp from aom to nom median levels were around 1 5 1 3 1 2 and 1 3 for thms haas hans and tox respectively the second order rate constant for the reactions of mc lr with chlorine were 60 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 5 and 21 c and other variants exhibit comparable or even higher reaction rate constants the reaction rate constant of bromine with mc lr is two orders of magnitude higher than that of chlorine owing to the presence of mcs unchlorinated algal impacted water expressed toxicity and chlorination further enhanced the mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity therefore the observed toxicity of treated waters depended on the evolution of cyanotoxins and the formation of dbps

17686,seasonal algal blooms in surface waters can impact water quality through an input of algal organic matter aom to the pool of dissolved organic matter as well as the release of cyanotoxins the formation and speciation of disinfection byproducts dbps during chlorination of algal impacted waters collected from growth of microcystis aeruginosa were studied second order rate constants for the reactions of microcystins mcs with chlorine and bromine were determined finally the toxicity of chlorinated algal impacted waters was evaluated by chinese hamster ovary cho cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays under practical water treatment conditions algal impacted waters produced less regulated trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and total organic halogen tox than natural organic matter nom for example the weight ratios of dbp formation from aom to nom median levels were approximately 1 5 1 3 1 2 and 1 3 for thms haas hans and tox respectively increasing initial bromide level significantly enhanced thm and han concentrations and therefore unknown tox decreased the second order rate constant for the reactions of mc lr the most common mc species with chlorine was 60 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 5 and 21 c and the rate constants for mc congeners follow the order mc wr mc lw mc yr mc ly mc lr mc rr the reaction rate constant of bromine with mc lr is two orders of magnitude higher than that of chlorine unchlorinated algal impacted waters were toxic owning to the presence of mcs and chlorination enhanced their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity due to the formation of toxic halogenated dbps however the toxicity of treated waters depended on the evolution of cyanotoxins and formation of dbps particularly unknown or emerging dbps graphical abstract

br levels good and vanbriesen 2016 kim et al 2015 during chlorination process br can be oxidized to hypobromous acid hobr which can react with dom to form brominated dbps br dbps the formation of br dbps is of particular concern since they are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogues plewa et al 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 due to the release of aom and cyanotoxins during seasonal algal bloom events impacting water quality chlorination may bring pros and cons to the toxicity of treated waters it was reported that compared with nom aom could form significant amounts of nitrogenous dbps upon chlorination under formation potential fp conditions where high initial concentrations of chlorine and longer reaction time were employed fang et al 2010 however the comparative formation of dbps formed from aom and nom under realistic drinking water treatment conditions remains unknown on the other hand during seasonal algal bloom events concentrations of mcs can be much higher than the regulation 1 0 Œºg l for example a maximum concentration of mcs in lake waters of finland was reported as 42 Œºg l spoof et al 2003 conventional coagulation sedimentation filtration

opportunity for optimization of chlorine disinfection oxidation process to control mcs in the presence of br it was reported that the secondarily formed hobr has higher reactivity towards phenols than chlorine heeb et al 2014 however the role of br in the degradation of cyanotoxins is not clear given the complex role of chlorination in determining the toxicity of treated algal impacted waters the experimental measurement of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity is required to decipher the forcing agent formation of halogenated dbps vs degradation of cyanotoxins for the toxicity in view of increasing occurrence of harmful algal bloom in surface waters the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the comparative formation of dbps during chlorination of algal impacted waters and surface waters under practical water treatment conditions 2 to study the kinetics for the reactions of mcs with chlorine and bromine and 3 to determine the mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the extracted organics of the chlorinated water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents culturing of cyanobacteria and preparation of algal impacted waters all chemical solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals or stock solutions using deionized milli q mq water 18 2 mœâ cm millipore the descriptions of all other standards and reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 of the supplementary material microcystis aeruginosa which was identified as the main species responsible for severe harmful blooms of cyanobacteria in large lakes worldwide liu et al 2019 was selected as the model cyanobacterium species in this study the culturing of cyanobacteria and preparation of algal impacted waters are described in our previous study liu et al 2018 which is further detailed in text s2 of the supplementary material in addition six types of raw surface waters and treated waters after coagulation and sand filtration but without disinfection were collected from several water treatment plants in south carolina usa the selection of these waters was based on their distinct specific ultraviolet absorbance suva indicator of aromatic and hydrophobic properties values ranging from 1 7 to 5 1 l mg m covering the typical suva values of surface waters in water treatment additional information regarding sampling and water characteristics can be found in supplementary material

dissolved nitrogen concentrations of residual chlorine anions total organic halogen tox and dbps can be found in text s4 of supplementary material the measurement of mcs mc rr yr lr wr ly and lw was detailed in text s5 of supplementary material 2 3 reaction rate constants of microcystins with chlorine and bromine the kinetics for the mc reactions with chlorine and bromine were determined at ph 7 5 10 mm phosphate buffer and 21 c room temperature in milli q water under pseudo first order conditions where chlorine or bromine was at least 10 fold in excess bromine solutions were prepared by the reaction of chlorine with br according to a previously described method liu et al 2012 the reaction was initiated by injecting 50 Œºl of the chlorine or bromine stock solution into 5 ml of solutions containing mcs which were capped with ptfe faced silica septum after the addition of oxidant the vials were placed on a vortex mixer with stirring for 10 s samples 300 Œºl were transferred into vials with inserts containing 10 Œºl of sodium sulfite solutions 50 mm to quench the oxidant afterwards concentrations of residual mcs were analyzed directly by hplc all experiments were duplicated 2 4 experiments for chlorination of algal impacted waters and surface waters for chlorination of algal impacted waters experiments were conducted in 6 l of capped bottles since large volume was needed for toxicity measurement for chlorination of surface waters experiments were carried out in 250 ml of capped amber bottles all experiments were performed under headspace free conditions at ph 7 5 in the dark at room temperature 21 1 c each source water doc 2 mg l in the presence of various initial br concentrations i e 0 800 Œºg l covering the typical br range in source waters was treated with chlorine under practical water treatment conditions 4 mg l cl2 for 24 h reactions were initiated by the injection of an aliquot of an hocl stock solution after 24 h 240 ml of water samples were withdrawn and after the measurement of residual oxidants the corresponding amount of ascorbic acid molar ratio 1 0 was added to quench the residual for the dbp analyses ascorbic acid was recommended for the quenching of water samples for the analyses of organic dbps i e thms haas hans etc since it does not decompose these dbps kristiana et al 2014 the remaining chlorinated algal impacted waters were extracted for mammalian cell toxicity experiments 2 5 isolation of organics the organics resulting from unchlorinated used as the control and chlorinated algal impacted waters were concentrated by adsorption onto xad resins plewa 2016 xad 2 amberlite xad 2 sigma aldrich mo and xad 8 supelite dax 8 sigma aldrich mo resins were pre cleaned in a soxhlet extractor and stored in pure methanol in the refrigerator before use a slurry of 55 ml xad 2 xad 8 resin mix measured in a graduated cylinder was packed on a plug of glass wool in a glass chromatography column the water samples were acidified to ph 2 by sulfuric acid prior to being added into the column for extraction to ensure the protonation of carboxylic organics the resins were eluted with 400 ml of optima spectroscopy grade ethyl acetate fisher scientific pa to elute the organic compounds the residual water in the ethyl acetate eluent was removed using a separatory funnel followed by passing the hydrophobic fraction through a column of anhydrous sodium sulfate the ethyl acetate extract was then reduced to 1 1 5 ml by a rotary evaporator at 50 60 c and evaporated blown down to a sludge using a gentle stream of nitrogen gas for each sample dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was used to dissolve the organic extract resulting in a 105 fold concentration of organic compounds derived from the water samples 2 6 chinese hamster ovary cho cells the cho cells cell line as52 clone 11 4 8 were used for the mammalian cell toxicity studies and maintained in ham s f12 5 fetal bovine serum fbs medium at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere of 5 co2 the cells exhibit normal morphology express cell contact inhibition and grow as a monolayer without expression of neoplastic foci 2 7 cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay the cho cell microplate chronic cytotoxicity assay measures the reduction in cell density as a function of the concentration of the test agent during a 72 h exposure period the detailed procedure is presented in text s6 of supplementary material briefly the protocol involved the use of a 96 well flat bottomed micro plate to evaluate the diluted organic extracts of the algal impacted water samples with varying concentration factors for each concentration factor of a given water sample 4 8 replicates were analyzed and the experiments were repeated the data were used to generate a concentration response curve for each algal impacted water sample regression analysis was applied to calculate the lc50 defined as the calculated concentration of the test agent that induced a cell density that was 50 of the negative control the metric for the aqueous or organic concentration was the concentration factor which allows for direct comparison among the water samples 2 8 cho cell single cell gel electrophoresis assay single cell gel electrophoresis scge comet is a molecular genetic assay that can quantitatively measure the level of genomic dna damage induced in individual nuclei of cells fairbairn et al 1995 rundell et al 2003 tice et al 2000 wagner and plewa 2009 a flow diagram of the scge procedure is presented in fig s1 of supplementary material and the detailed procedure is provided in text s7 of supplementary material akin to cho chronic cytotoxicity assay 4 104 cho cells were added to each microplate well and treated with a series of diluted organic extracts of the algal impacted water samples with varying concentration factors for 4 h experiments were repeated 2 3 times for each water sample concentrate a computerized image analysis system comet iv perspective instruments ltd suffolk uk was employed to determine the tail dna the amount of dna that migrated from the nucleus into the microgel of the nuclei as the measure of dna damage kumaravel and jha 2006 the digitalized data fig s2 of supplementary material were automatically transferred to a computer based spreadsheet for subsequent statistical analysis for concentration factors of each algal impacted water sample with the cell viability 70 a concentration response curve was generated based on the regression analysis for the curve fitting the concentration factor that induced a 50 tail dna value was calculated 2 9 statistical analyses for the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays the units of measure were the clone of exposure cells and the microgel respectively a one way analysis of variance anova test was conducted to determine if each water sample induced a statistically significant level of either cytotoxicity or genotoxicity within the concentration response curve if a significant f value p 0 05 was obtained a holm sidak multiple comparison versus the control group analysis was performed to identify the lowest cytotoxic or genotoxic concentration factor the power of the test statistic 1 Œ≤ was maintained as 0 8 at Œ± 0 05 to determine significant differences among the water sample groups a bootstrap statistical approach was used to generate a series of multiple lc50 values and multiple 50 tail dna values for each water sample for each lc50 value a cytotoxicity index cti value was calculated as lc50 1 103 for the 50 tail dna values a genotoxicity index gti value was calculated 50 tail dna 1 103 these cti and gti values were separately analyzed using an anova test 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative formation of dbps from algal impacted waters and surface waters 3 1 1 thms fig 1 presents the concentrations of measured thms from algal impacted waters and surface waters in the presence of various initial br concentrations concentrations of thms from algal impacted waters ranged from 6 2 0 7 representing mean standard errors in this paper to 18 1 0 5 Œºg mgc for initial br concentrations of 40 800 Œºg l in contrast median concentrations of those from surface waters where nom predominates were in the range of 33 9 98 3 Œºg mgc these results indicate that the formation of thms from aom is much lower than that of comparable nom for example the median thm concentration from nom was as five times high as that formed from aom at initial br concentration of 40 Œºg l it was reported that tcm concentration in the absence of br under fp conditions from suwannee river nom was almost twice that from aom i e c a 70 vs 30 Œºg mgc fang et al 2010 therefore the gap for the thm formation from nom vs aom is smaller under fp conditions nom is typically comprised of 50 of humic substances which contain aromatic phenolic and carboxyl group contents functioning as fast reacting thm precursors leenheer and crou√© 2003 liu and croue 2016 however humic substances only account for 14 22 of the total doc in aom and the major fraction is protein and carbohydrate type of structure which might be slow reacting thm precursors liu et al 2018 therefore the quantification of thm formation for aom under fp conditions may not represent the thm formation for practical applications where low chlorine dose and short reaction time were employed it was seen that increasing the initial br concentration increased the formation of total thms from aom and nom fig 1 for example median thm concentrations from nom were 33 9 48 8 69 7 and 98 3 Œºg mgc for initial br concentrations of 40 200 400 and 800 Œºg l respectively this is in line with previous studies ersan et al 2019a hu et al 2010 hua et al 2006 in addition increasing initial br concentration shifted the formation of thms from chlorinated to brominated species 3 1 2 haas fig 2 shows that total concentrations of haas formed from algal impacted waters ranged from 8 0 0 4 to 11 3 0 3 Œºg mgc while median concentrations of those from surface waters were in the range of 33 6 54 6 Œºg mgc similar to thm the major fraction of nom is aromatic phenolic and carboxyl groups which are haa precursors leenheer and crou√© 2003 therefore the median concentration of haas formed from nom was three times as high as that of aom at initial br concentration of 40 Œºg l different from thm increasing initial br concentration only slightly increased total concentrations of haas formed from aom however the speciation of haas was shifted from chlorinated species to brominated analogues all nine haa species were measured and their concentrations vary with the change in the initial br concentration 3 1 3 hans the formed total hans from aom are present at slightly lower concentrations than their median concentrations from nom e g 1 7 vs 2 3 Œºg mgc at initial br concentration of 40 Œºg l fig 3 hans were formed from nitrogen containing functional groups such as amines amino acids which are derived from proteins and or anthropogenic compounds hureiki et al 1994 nevertheless their precursors are structure specific for example the dcan formation yield from aspartic acid was two orders of magnitude higher than those from other amino acids e g glycine alanine etc selbes et al 2015 it is likely that the surface waters have more han precursors than algal impacted water harvested in this study due to the distinct precursor of hans versus thm haa formed from aromatic phenolic and carboxyl groups the ratio of han formation from nom to han formation from aom was 1 3 1 6 which is much smaller than that of thm haa 3 0 5 0 although aom does not appear to be an important thm haa precursor it can form comparable levels of hans with nom increasing the initial br concentration significantly increased concentrations of total hans from aom and nom for example increasing the initial br concentration from 0 to 800 Œºg l almost doubled the concentrations of total hans indicating that bromine favours the formation of hans as compared to chlorine this may increase the toxicity of treated waters since brominated hans are much more toxic than their chlorinated analogues wagner and plewa 2017 3 1 4 tox the formation of tox total organic chlorine tocl and total organic bromine tobr during chlorination of aom and nom is presented in fig 4 aom produced lower tox ca 49 Œºg cl mgc than their median levels from nom 128 0 141 5 Œºg cl mgc in addition concentrations of tox remained generallly stable irrespective of changes in initial br concentrations since there was no change for the amounts of precursors nevertheless increasing initial br concentrations shifted the formation of tox from chlorinated species to brominated analogues fig s3 of supplementary material shows the fraction of each group of dbp of total tox from chlorination of algal impacted waters thm and haa are the main groups of dbps while han is the minor species unknown tox which was calculated from the difference between the tox and the sum of halogen equivalent concentrations of measured specific dbps accounted for 70 of total tox due to the hydrophilic nature of aom in contrast for nom unknown tox only accounts for 50 60 of the total tox fig s4 of supplementary material this may be attributed to nom being more aromatic and hydrophobic as indicated by higher suva values in table s2 of supplementary material forming more known dbps henderson et al 2008 liu et al 2018 generally increasing the initial br concentration decreased the percentage of unknown tox indicating that the formation of known dbps e g thm was favoured in the bromination process 3 2 kinetics for the reactions of microcystins with chlorine or bromine even though toxic halogenated dbps can be formed during chlorination chlorine can react with the cyanotoxins in algal impacted waters previous studies have shown that the reaction of mcs with chlorine is of second order in total first order in oxidant chlorine and first order in mcs acero et al 2005 rodriguez et al 2007 the rate constant for the reaction of chlorine bromine with mcs was investigated under pseudo first order conditions i e at least a 10 1 molar ratio of oxidant to mcs in a batch reactor fig s5 of supplementary material shows the degradation of various mcs by chlorination and bromination only for mc lr almost 90 of initial mc lr was degraded by chlorine in 30 min and complete degradation by bromine was achieved in 0 5 min this indicated that bromine reacts much faster than chlorine toward mc lr for other mcs over 95 of degradation was seen in 15 min the degradation rates follow the order mc wr mc lw mc yr mc ly mc rr to determine the second order rate constants for the reactions of oxidant with mcs the reaction can be written as 1 hocl mc products k app and hence the rate of mc degradation can be expressed as 2 d mc dt kapp mc hocl where kapp is the apparent second order rate constant under the pseudo first order conditions equation 2 is simplified to 3 d mc dt k mc and 4 k kapp hocl 0 taking natural log at both sides of equation 3 gives 5 ln mc mc 0 k t where k is the pseudo first order rate constant therefore if the assumption of first order kinetics with respect to mcs is correct the plot of the ln mc mc o versus time should yield a straight line for each experiment and the slope is k as shown in fig s6 of supplementary material table s3 of supplementary material summarizes the values of k obtained for various mcs based on the obtained k and equation 4 second order rate constants for the reactions of mcs with chlorine or bromine can be deduced as shown in table 1 the reaction rate constants of mcs vary depending on the connected l amino acids in the x and y positions and the oxidant chlorine or bromine for example the second order rate constant for the reaction between chlorine and mc lr is 60 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 and 21 c which was similar to 61 8 m 1s 1 reported in literature acero et al 2005 mc rr shows similar reactivity k 58 6 m 1s 1 with mc lr higher reaction constants k 92 8 and 138 6 m 1 s 1 were determined for mc ly and mc yr respectively this might be due to their tyrosine denoting to y in the name in which the phenolic moiety is the reactive site for chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 mc lw and mc wr are highly reactive 90 of initial mc lw and mc wr was degraded in 1 min therefore it is difficult to withdraw multiple samples in a batch reactor during such a short period to accurately determine the k however based on the available data sampled in the short time the range of k can be approximated as a result the range of k for mc lw and mc wr is 371 and 1214 m 1 s 1 respectively their greater reaction rate constants than other mcs are likely due to a tryptophan moiety denoting to w in the name being highly reactive towards chlorine pattison et al 2007 interestingly bromine reacts much faster than chlorine with mc lr and 95 of mc lr was degraded by bromine in 0 5 min likewise the range of k is 6350 m 1 s 1 indicating that the second order reaction rate constant of bromine with mc lr is two orders of magnitude higher than that of chlorine the reactions between bromine and other mcs were not studied due to the difficulty in measuring the fast reactions completed in 1 min but based on the order of the second order rate constants for the reactions between chlorine and mcs it can be expected that the k for the reactions between bromine and other mcs is 6350 m 1 s 1 it has been recognized that bromine reacts with phenolic compounds much faster than chlorine factor of 3000 heeb et al 2014 apparently the presence of br during chlorination of algal impacted waters will promote the degradation of mcs 3 3 cho cell chronic cytotoxicity analyses chlorination can be used to destruct cyanotoxins in a seasonal harmful algal bloom event but this could increase the formation of toxic halogenated dbps therefore the impact of chlorination on the toxicity of algal impacted waters under various initial br concentrations was evaluated by cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay figs s7 12 of supplementary material show the concentration response curves for each sample the data demonstrated that every sample induced mammalian cell cytotoxicity and generated a significant difference from their concurrent negative control table 2 however to determine if there was a significant difference among the algal samples a series of lc50 values using bootstrap statistics were converted into cytotoxicity index cti values lc50 1 103 varian 2005 the mean cti values were analyzed for significant differences using an anova test statistic with pairwise comparison this generated a metric in which the larger the number the greater the cytotoxic potency of the sample fig 5 shows the cytotoxicity index i e cho cell chronic cytotoxicity during chlorination under various initial br concentrations the data demonstrated that the cti value for the algal impacted water without chlorination was relatively high for a negative control table s4 of supplementary material shows mc concentrations in algal impacted waters the concentration of mc lr is the highest among various species of mcs 11 97 Œºg l for 2 mg l doc which is similar to that reported in literature 5 Œºg per mg of doc li et al 2012 for other types of mcs concentrations range from 2 03 to 2 67 Œºg l except for mc rr 0 59 Œºg l it was reported that mc lr can express cytotoxicity to cho cells lankoff et al 2003 xue et al 2015 over 100 different mc variants have been identified to date yet only six mcs were measured in this study due to the lack of commercially available standards in addition other cyanotoxins such as cylindrospermopsin and various neurotoxins have been detected in cyanobacteria spoof et al 2003 therefore six measured mcs and other matrix unknown toxins were likely to be the main contributor to the toxicity of the unchlorinated algal impacted waters when the algal impacted waters were chlorinated the mammalian cell cytotoxicity response increased significantly due to the formation of toxic dbps as shown in figs 1 4 meanwhile the concentrations of mc lr was reduced to 0 96 Œºg l and other mcs were not detected since chlorine can effectively degrade these toxins table 1 based on protein phosphatase 1 inhibition assay ppia the transformation products of chlorinated algal toxins were found to be non toxic rodr√≠guez et al 2008 this implies that chlorination would reduce the mc induced cytotoxicity increasing the initial concentrations of br from 0 to 800 Œºg l further decreased the concentration of mc lr to 0 15 Œºg l which was the higher reaction rate constants of bromine towards mc lr table 1 therefore the toxicity of treated waters slightly decreased with increasing initial br concentrations in addition as the initial br concentration increased the formation of unknown dbps i e unknown tox decreased fig s4 of supplementary material our recent study has indicated a correlation between cytotoxicity and unknown tox for disinfected waters ersan et al 2019b when the toxicity of chlorinated algal impacted waters was compared with tap waters from european countries eu tap waters in fig 5 in the literature jeong et al 2012 the cytotoxicity index of the former one was 2 3 times higher than the median value of the tap water this may indicate that even though algal impacted waters form less regulated identified dbps the more unknown dbps matrix would account for the higher toxicity index 3 4 cho cell acute genotoxicity analyses in addition to the chronic cytotoxicity the acute genotoxicity of the same samples was evaluated figs s13 18 of supplementary material present the genomic dna damage analyses each sample was analyzed for genomic dna damage with multiple repeated experiments the tail dna values for each concentration were combined and presented in the concentration response curves an analysis of variance test statistic was conducted with the data for each sample box et al 1978 detailed scge analyses for the induction of genomic dna damage in cho cells induced by each sample is presented in table 3 fig 6 shows the cho cell acute genotoxicity during chlorination of algal impacted waters under various initial br concentrations all samples expressed genotoxicity and generated concentration response graphs due to the presence of mcs unchlorinated algal impacted waters expressed genotoxicity chlorination increased the genotoxicity index which was attributed to the formation of toxic dbps the addition of br from 40 to 200 Œºg l to the algal impacted waters gradually increased the level of genotoxic response samples with initial br concentrations of 400 and 800 Œºg l did not express a continuation of increasing genotoxicity a possible reason is that further increasing initial concentration of br did not further remove cyanotoxins table s4 of supplementary material and the genotoxicity was driven preferentially by brominated or nitrogenous species plewa et al 2008 therefore the interactions among the cyanotoxins known dbps and unknown dbps are complex and not dependent on a single set of characteristics similarly the genotoxicity index of chlorinated algal impacted waters is much higher than that of eu tap waters the unknown dbps matrix in the algal impacted waters would contribute to the higher toxicity index further studies should address the identification of the highly toxic algal derived by products 4 conclusions under practical water treatment conditions algal impacted waters produced less regulated thms haas hans and tox than nom the ratios of dbp from aom to nom median levels were around 1 5 1 3 1 2 and 1 3 for thms haas hans and tox respectively the second order rate constant for the reactions of mc lr with chlorine were 60 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 5 and 21 c and other variants exhibit comparable or even higher reaction rate constants the reaction rate constant of bromine with mc lr is two orders of magnitude higher than that of chlorine owing to the presence of mcs unchlorinated algal impacted water expressed toxicity and chlorination further enhanced the mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity therefore the observed toxicity of treated waters depended on the evolution of cyanotoxins and the formation of dbps

17687,methamphetamine meth has been recognized as an emerging organic contaminant as it was widely detected in the aquatic environment via wastewater effluent discharge however the ecological hazard posed by meth at environmentally relevant concentrations was remained unclear in this study adult medaka fish were exposed to meth at environmental levels 0 05 0 2 0 5 5 Œºg l 1 and high level 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 for 90 days to investigate its effect on ecologically behavioral functions histopathology bioconcentration and transgenerational toxicity the significant increase of locomotion activity total distance and max velocity of adult medaka were observed at low meth levels 0 2 0 5 Œºg l 1 while it markedly decreased at high levels 25 100 Œºg l 1 this effect may increase the predation risk of the fish the significant alteration on the relative expressions of the genes cacna1c oxtr erk1 and c fos as well as the contents of the proteins oxytocin oxt and protein kinase a pka involved in voltage dependent calcium channel vdcc and mitogen activated protein kinase mapk signaling channel induced by meth could partly elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the changes of the behavioral traits meth could induce obvious minimal gliosis neuronal loss and necrotic in brain tissues additionally the significant increase of hepatic somatic index hsi of male medaka at 0 2 5 Œºg l 1 groups and the decrease of female medaka at 100 Œºg l 1 group indicated male fish was more susceptible to meth nephric somatic index nsi of medaka markedly declined induced by meth at 0 05 100 Œºg l 1 the bioconcentration factor bcf 0 4 5 8 in medaka fish revealed the bioconcentration potential of meth in fish this study for the first time demonstrated meth could induced the development defects of larvae in f1 generation at environmentally relevant concentrations thereby resulting in a significant decrease in the capacity of fish to produce offspring meanwhile the rq values 1 of meth in river in china usa and australia showed a high teratogenic risk level suggesting the ecosystem levels consequence posed by meth should be concerned graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords emerging pollutant transgenerational toxicity bioconcentration potential environmental concentrations ecological risk 1 introduction methamphetamine meth is a highly addictive drug with abuse potential that may cause neurotoxicity since it can easily penetrate blood brain barrier ballester et al 2017 world drug report 2019 showed that the consumption of meth has been increasing most rapidly in the east and southeast asia and north america in recent years unodc 2019 similar to other pharmaceuticals meth are incompletely metabolized in human body and then excreted into municipal sewage system with a blend of unchanged substance metabolites and conjugates via urine or feces kuo et al 2015 typically the conventional treatment of wastewater plant contributes very little elimination of trace organic pollutants which will result in meth and its metabolites discharged into receiving water through effluent du et al 2015 as a result meth has been widely detected in surface water around the world for instance the concentrations of meth in nepean river of new south wales in australia were up to 25 25 Œºg l 1 paciuszkiewicz et al 2019 in usa the levels of meth in clark river and in missouri river were reported in the range of 2 7 25 7 ng l 1 and 2 3 62 2 ng l 1 respectively bartelt hunt et al 2009 skees et al 2018 in the mainland of china the meth concentrations in urban rivers in beijing were up to 99 5 ng l 1 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the highest concentration of meth in 36 major rivers in bohai bay was up to 42 0 ng l 1 wang et al 2016 while the highest level of meth in shenzhen river was 239 ng l 1 wang et al 2019 in taiwan of china the meth concentration reached to 405 ng l 1 in surface water lin et al 2010 meanwhile previous study has elucidated that meth was a refractory pollutant in lab scale microcosm wang et al 2018 hence the ubiquity and high concentrations of meth in surface water may pose a threat to aquatic ecosystem there have been several publications about the toxicity of meth to fish mi et al 2016 found that acute exposure to meth at 2 mg l 1 may induce significant anxiety like behavior acute administration to meth at 40 Œºg g 1 caused conditioned place preference cpp of adult zebrafish zhu et al 2017 acute and chronic exposure to meth at 1 2 mg l 1 may impact the survival rate and cardiovascular development of zebrafish embryos ickes 2015 jiang et al 2016 investigated that injection of meth 40 mg kg 1 effected locomotor activity via regulation of dopaminergic and glutamatergic system the male sailfin molly showed alteration in sexual behavior exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 of meth for 7 days ghazilou and ghazilou 2011 zebrafish embryos exposed to meth 500 mg l 1 for 24 h induced heart rate decline and pericardial edema fang et al 2016 once entering surface water meth would induce a negative effect to aquatic organisms since the chemical and biological activity was remained wang and lin 2014 only two studies have reported toxicological outcomes of meth in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentration liao et al 2015 found that sub chronic treatment to meth 597 ng l 1 6 0 mg l 1 for 7 days might significantly impact blood circulation hatching time and oxidative stress of medaka embryos and altered medaka larval swimming pattern our previous investigation showed that marked alteration on locomotion behavior feeding rate and chemotaxis of c elegans were observed in meth sub chronic exposure groups at low environmental concentrations 50 ng l 1 wang et al 2019 however to reasonably estimate the ecological risk posed by meth the investigation about the chronic toxicity and bio availability of meth for adult fish at environmentally relevant concentrations are necessary in this work we exposed adult medaka fish oryzias latipes to meth at environmental levels 0 05 25 Œºg l 1 to high level 100 Œºg l 1 for 90 days the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the alteration on the unconditioned neurobehaviors locomotion velocity and organ coefficient kidney and liver of medaka fish induced by meth 2 elucidate the bioconcentration potential of meth and its metabolite amphetamine amp in medaka fish body and eggs 3 reveal the underlying toxicological mechanism via the changes of relative expression of genes and

instructions the details are provided in the supporting information the calibration curve equations the limit of quantitation loq and method accuracy were showed in table s5 2 8 risk characterization risk quotients rq is the basic principle to assess the eco risk posed by the environmental pollutants hernando et al 2006 the value is computed by the measured environmental concentration mec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec of the target chemical the pnec is derived from the ecx ec effect concentration x percent of affected organisms divided by the extrapolated factors ef ranging from 1000 to 1 calow 1998 based on the regulations defined by eu tgd communities 1996 the ef of 50 is applied when there is only chronic toxicity data of one species therefore the rq of meth was calculated by the formula below 4 rq mec pnec where pnec ec10 50 the ec10 value was obtained from the dose effect curve of the larval deformation incidences fig 3 the mec was acquired in the previous investigations reporting the concentrations of meth in surface water different eco risk levels interpreting the rq low risk from 0 01 through 0 1 medium risk from 0 1 through 1 and high risk 1 was applied in the present work hernando et al 2006 2 9 statistical analysis the statistical program spss 18 0 chicago il usa was used to collate and analyze all the collected data ten or more replicates of each parameter were determined to eliminate the variability of the results all the data were expressed as mean standard deviations s d the normality was assessed by shapiro wilk tests homogeneity of variance set was determined by levene s test differences between the control and meth exposure groups were evaluated by one way anova followed by post hoc tukey s test 95 confidence interval the two way anova tests were used to examine the significance of differences in the hsi values between female and male at the same concentration the two tailed t tests were used to determine the difference of the development parameters body length interorbital width body length and body width body length of larvae between the control and 0 2 Œºg l 1 groups at the same incubation time the pearson correlation test was performed for the correlations between the parameters canonical correlation analysis cca and principal component analyses pca among the biomarkers were conducted using canoco version 4 5 differences in larval deformation incidence were analyzed via œá2 tests the differences were significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of the behaviors of adult medaka induced by meth although the behavioral phenotypes are variable among the individual fish the locomotion pattern of the healthy fish model keeps intact gerlai et al 2009 previous investigation found that normal fish unconditionally preferred to swim around the edge of the tank once placed into a new circumstance maximino et al 2010 the aberrant swimming patterns of adult medaka were observed in meth exposure groups in this work as showed in fig 1 the swimming trails and the locomotion activities markedly altered in exposure groups compared with the control previous studies have elucidated that there was a classic relationship between anxiety and erratic behavioral function in fish barbosa et al 2012 duarte et al 2019 hence the significant increase of continual spontaneous turns center zone dwell frequency shown in fig 1a total distance fig 1b and max velocity fig 1c illuminated that environmental levels of meth 0 05 0 5 Œºg l 1 may promote anxiety in adult medaka similarly the stimulus in medaka larvae posed by meth at environmentally relevant concentrations was observed in previous study liao et al 2015 however the inverted u shaped dose response of total distance 0 5 Œºg l 1 p 0 05 at 100 Œºg l 1 and max velocity 0 5 Œºg l 1 p 0 05 at 25 Œºg l 1 indicated that high doses of meth had anesthetic features fig 1b and c which was consistent to the previous publication that zebrafish exhibited trance like passive swimming treated with hallucinogenic cunningham et al 2011 additionally the different results about the anxiety of adult zerafish induced by high dose of meth 2 mg l 1 or 40 mg kg 1 with acute treatment 30 min or 12 h indicated the different effect between chronic and acute exposure jiang et al 2016 mi et al 2016 from an ecological point the alteration on the normal behavioral function of fish may pose ecosystem level consequence johansson and brodin 2003 fish are able to avoid predator by swimming around the safe area fuiman and magurran 1994 in this work as the locomotion activity was accelerated by meth at environmentally relevant levels 0 05 0 5 Œºg l 1 adult medaka fish were noticeable to increase predation risk the flourish of the fish community may be impaired hence the ecosystem level risks induced by meth in aquatic system should not be overlooked 3 2 alterations on histopathology of brain and the organ coefficients previous publications had reported that meth can distribute throughout the body extensively via permeating the blood brain barrier and then activate certain systems in the brain roohbakhsh et al 2016 sharma and kiyatkin 2009 found that meth treatment could induce rapid morphological brain abnormalities histopathology of brain isolated from adult medaka was determined in this work the brain slices of medaka in the control group showed an intact tissue structure with complete cellular structure fig 2 a while the brain section of the fish treated with meth at 0 2 Œºg l 1 showed obvious minimal gliosis neuronal loss and necrotic arrows fig 2b meth is mainly metabolized in the liver catalyzed by cytochrome isoenzyme cyp2d6 and then largely excreted in the urine cruickshank and dyer 2009 meanwhile sex dependent effects of meth toxicity were documented in previous publication bourque et al 2012 in this work as shown in fig 2c the significant increase of hsi values induced by meth was observed in male fish at environmental concentrations 0 2 5 Œºg l 1 while the hsi values of female fish markedly declined at 100 Œºg l 1 meth group the gender differences were observed in 0 05 0 5 and 5 Œºg l 1 groups p 0 05 which revealed that the different toxicity between male and female fish induced by meth at environmental levels should be taken into consideration to reasonably estimate the eco risk posed by meth to aquatic ecosystem the nsi values of adult medaka were remarkably decreased treatment with meth at 0 05 100 Œºg l 1 fig 2d there were no significant changes of csi values observed in all exposure groups similarly the dose dependent effect of histopathology induced by meth on fish was found by previous study zhu et al 2017 3 3 alteration on the gene expressions and protein contents to clarify the underlying mechanism of the changes of the behaviors histopathology and the hsi nsi values induced by meth we studied the relative expression of genes cacna1c oxtr erk1 and c fos and the contents of proteins oxt and pka in medaka brain from different groups dose dependent transcription inhibition of cacna1c was found in adult fish brain exposed to meth at 0 5 100 Œºg l 1 fig 3 a calcium ca2 channels in neurons regulate variable physiological functions including neurochemistry and neurobehavior licata and pierce 2003 previous study showed that the alteration of the expression of cacna1c gene ca2 channel genes subunit contributed to the mechanism underlying the behavioral changes induced by psychostimulant kabir et al 2017 the down regulation of cacna1c gene in response to meth can partly explain the changes of behavioral pattern of medaka fig 3b showed the relative expression of oxtr gene as a crucial gene in oxytocin system in brain was significantly up regulated by meth 0 2 100 Œºg l 1 meanwhile the plasma oxytocin oxt levels in brain markedly increased in meth exposure groups at 25 to 100 Œºg l 1 fig 4 a which has been unveiled by previous investigation zanos et al 2014 the endogenous oxt system was relevant to the addiction related behaviors chronic exposure with drugs mcgregor et al 2008 which may associated with the changes of behavioral functions zhang et al 2015 found that exposure to meth at 15 Œºm activated the mapk mitogen activated protein kinase signaling channel in brain studies have pointed that antidepressant drugs reinforced the behaviors by activating mapk signaling pathway r√©us et al 2014 di benedetto et al 2013 erk1 extracellular regulated protein kinase and pka protein kinase a are part of the mapk signaling in this work treatment with meth up regulated the transcriptional expression of erk1 gene at 0 05 100 Œºg l 1 fig 3c and the content of pka at 0 2 100 Œºg l 1 fig 4b the previous investigation revealed that food seeking behaviors and other learned behaviors were regulated by fos protein the product of the immediate early gene c fos in striatum and prefrontal cortex liu et al 2014 similarly we found the relative expression of c fos gene was significantly up regulated by meth at 0 2 100 Œºg l 1 groups fig 3d which may result in the enhancement of medaka locomotion activity to show the correlations among the tested biomarkers person correlation analyses canonical correlation analysis cca and principal component analyses pca were conducted as showed in fig s3 the significant correlations were found among the ecologically important behaviors and the selected genes and proteins which indicated the up or down regulations of the molecular indicators were associated with the changes on the physiological parameters the two axis 1 and 2 contributed 95 85 to the total score according to cca results fig s4 a the gene cacna1c maybe the key factor to explain the changes on the physiological biomarkers followed by genes erk1 oxtr meanwhile the hsi of female fish was mainly impacted by gene erk1 while the explains determined by the changes of relative expressions or contents of genes and proteins to the changes of nsi was negligible based on the pca fig s4 b the two most significant factors contribute approximately 80 to the total score the duplicates in each exposure groups were clustered but divided from other groups the statistical analysis elucidated the correlation not the causal relationship between the tested biomarkers therefore further investigations should be performed to explain the biological mechanism 3 4 transgenerational toxicity as showed in fig 5 several kinds of development deformations were observed in the larvae of the f1 generation in meth exposure groups collected in the last week fig 5a showed the normal morphology of medaka larvae from the control yolk sac edema fig 5b e hemorrhaging occurred in spots of the heart sac fig 5f and lordosis fig 5g and h were observed in larvae from the meth exposure groups generally most medaka larvae with development defects couldn t swim up and died in several dph the deformation occurred incidences in the 0 05 0 2 0 5 5 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 meth exposure groups were 3 03 5 165 œá2 1 54 p 0 22 3 53 6 170 œá2 2 22 p 0 14 8 33 14 168 œá2 10 11 p 0 0015

from meth exposure groups has been observed in the previous study liao et al 2015 according to the logarithmic fitting formula showed in fig 5i the ec10 was 24 5 Œºg l 1 to further elucidate the mechanism expressions of gata 4 and gata 6 genes involved in the cardiac and skeletal development were evaluated in the abnormal larvae borok et al 2016 charron et al 1999 the transcription levels of gata 4 and gata 6 genes in medaka larvae were significantly p 0 05 down regulated by meth at 0 5 and 5 Œºg l 1 respectively fig 5j which was associated with the development deformations of the f1 generation larvae induced by meth linear regression between the relative expressions of the two genes and the abnormalities incidences showed a significant covariant relationship further indicating the underling mechanisms fig s5 the development parameters including body length body width and interorbital width of the medaka larvae without obvious deformations occurred from the control and 0 2 Œºg l 1 group were determined on day 7 10 20 30 dph as showed in table 2 the body length of larvae from 0 2 Œºg l 1 dose group was significantly shorter in comparison to the larvae in the control at 7 30 dph moreover the ratio of interorbital width to body length as well as the ratio of body width to body length of the larvae in 0 2 Œºg l 1 dose group were markedly less than it in the control at 20 and 30 dph the abnormal development parameters of medaka larvae occurred in the meth exposure group indicated that the transgenerational toxicity posed by meth at environmental levels to aquatic organisms was persistent hence the aquatic teratogenic risk of meth shouldn t be underestimated the larvae abnormality and death in f1 generation induced by meth over time have ecosystem level consequence as it would lead to population decline and then impair the flourish of the fish 3 5 residue meth levels in adult medaka and eggs the accumulated body burdens of meth and its major metabolite amp were quantified in this work to estimate the bioccumulation of meth in adult medaka and the eggs for adult medaka fish body meth was detected in all exposure groups whereas amp was only detected in high level groups 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 table 1 after 90 day exposure residual levels of meth in fish bodies were 0 24 0 05 0 98 0 13 2 89 0 32 19 21 0 51 37 52 0 89 and 39 94 0 93 ng g 1 of wet weight ww corresponding with 0 05 0 2 0 5 5 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 meth groups respectively the concentrations of amp in fish from 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 meth groups were 8 3 1 23 and 10 2 1 08 ng g 1 of ww respectively the bioconcentration factor bcf of meth in medaka ranged from 0 4 to 5 8 which was similar to the reports in freshwater snail cipangopaludian cathayensis 5 8 9 exposed to meth at 0 1 mg l 1 qu et al 2020 in zebrafish 1 6 42 exposed to meth 1 100 Œºg l 1 but much lower than the bcf in zebrafish 449 exposed to meth at 0 01 Œºg l 1 yin et al 2019a this may attribute to the difference between variable fish species the accumulated body burden of meth in wild fish was raged from 0 0038 to 0 087 ng g 1 collected in urban river in beijing yin et al 2019b for the eggs collected in the last week there was no residue of meth or amp detected this may be due to the protection of fish embryos by chorion egg envelope against the organic contaminants boudreau et al 2005 3 6 risk assessment the pnec of the offspring deformations induced by meth calculated from the ec10 24 5 Œºg l 1 and ef 50 was 490 ng l 1 based on the occurrence of meth in surface water investigated by previous studies including china mainland and taiwan hu et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 lai et al 2018 li et al 2016 lin et al 2010 lin et al 2014 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 australia paciuszkiewicz et al 2019 spain mendoza et al 2014 postigo et al 2010 postigo et al 2012 czech republic koba et al 2018 italy zuccato et al 2008 uk baker and kasprzyk hordern 2013 zuccato et al 2008 and usa bartelt hunt et al 2009 tian et al 2019 watanabe et al 2020 skees et al 2018 jones lepp et al 2012 we quantified the teratogenic risk level posed by meth via calculating the rq values using eq 4 as showed in table 3 and fig s6 the rq in taiwan in china was more than 1 high risk while beijing yunnan and guangdong shenzhen and guangzhou were greater than 0 1 indicting the risk in the surface water in these regions was at medium level the other provinces such as heilongjiang liaoning tianjin heibei shandong hubei and ningxia were was at low risk level meanwhile the rq of meth in forester creek california and colorado river arizona in usa were greater than 1 at high risk level while missouri river nebraska and clark river tennessee was more than 0 1 up to medium level more surprisingly the rq values of meth in australia nepean river were several orders of magnitude greater than it in other countries at high risk level the result may attribute to the sample site in this study adjoined with the outlet of the wastewater treatment plants which resulted in the high concentrations of meth detected in the river since it wasn t diluted by the fresh water in europe the risk posed by meth in the rivers in czech republic was up to medium level 0 1 rq 1 whereas in spain italy and uk was at low level thus the adverse effect offspring deformation occurrence posed by meth on fish shouldn t be neglected 4 conclusion this study for the first time clarified that meth could pose ecosystem level consequences to fish by modifying the ecologically important behavioral functions including swimming pattern and locomotion velocity of adult medaka fish at environmentally relevant concentrations 0 2 Œºg l 1 the significant alteration on the transcriptional levels of the genes cacna1c oxtr erk1 and c fos as well as the contents of the proteins oxt and pka involved in the vdcc and mapk signaling channel were observed in the meth exposure groups 0 05 Œºg l 1 which may elucidate the underlying mechanisms about the effect on the ecologically important behavioral traits of adult medeka by meth the gender difference on the changes of hsi values of medaka fish induced by meth indicated that male fish was more susceptible meth showed a potential bioconcentration in fish body since the bcf ranged from 0 4 to 5 8 exposed to meth for 90 days the development deformations of medaka larvae in f1 generation induced by meth showed a significant dose response manner and then threaten the prosperity of the fish community this study for the first time clarified that meth can induce the changes of ecologically important behaviors of fish and abnormalities of f1 generation fish larvae thereby posing ecosystem level consequences to fish high concentrations of meth were widely reported in surface water and therefore could induce an extensive development abnormality in the offspring of wild fish according to the rq values the teratogenic risk of meth in the surface water in china usa and australia was up to high level 1 therefore long term environmental monitoring for meth in surface water should be performed to estimate the temporal variations of its teratogenic risk providing proof on the necessity for further control measures declaration of competing interest manuscript has been read and approved by all authors and no conflict

17687,methamphetamine meth has been recognized as an emerging organic contaminant as it was widely detected in the aquatic environment via wastewater effluent discharge however the ecological hazard posed by meth at environmentally relevant concentrations was remained unclear in this study adult medaka fish were exposed to meth at environmental levels 0 05 0 2 0 5 5 Œºg l 1 and high level 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 for 90 days to investigate its effect on ecologically behavioral functions histopathology bioconcentration and transgenerational toxicity the significant increase of locomotion activity total distance and max velocity of adult medaka were observed at low meth levels 0 2 0 5 Œºg l 1 while it markedly decreased at high levels 25 100 Œºg l 1 this effect may increase the predation risk of the fish the significant alteration on the relative expressions of the genes cacna1c oxtr erk1 and c fos as well as the contents of the proteins oxytocin oxt and protein kinase a pka involved in voltage dependent calcium channel vdcc and mitogen activated protein kinase mapk signaling channel induced by meth could partly elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the changes of the behavioral traits meth could induce obvious minimal gliosis neuronal loss and necrotic in brain tissues additionally the significant increase of hepatic somatic index hsi of male medaka at 0 2 5 Œºg l 1 groups and the decrease of female medaka at 100 Œºg l 1 group indicated male fish was more susceptible to meth nephric somatic index nsi of medaka markedly declined induced by meth at 0 05 100 Œºg l 1 the bioconcentration factor bcf 0 4 5 8 in medaka fish revealed the bioconcentration potential of meth in fish this study for the first time demonstrated meth could induced the development defects of larvae in f1 generation at environmentally relevant concentrations thereby resulting in a significant decrease in the capacity of fish to produce offspring meanwhile the rq values 1 of meth in river in china usa and australia showed a high teratogenic risk level suggesting the ecosystem levels consequence posed by meth should be concerned graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords emerging pollutant transgenerational toxicity bioconcentration potential environmental concentrations ecological risk 1 introduction methamphetamine meth is a highly addictive drug with abuse potential that may cause neurotoxicity since it can easily penetrate blood brain barrier ballester et al 2017 world drug report 2019 showed that the consumption of meth has been increasing most rapidly in the east and southeast asia and north america in recent years unodc 2019 similar to other pharmaceuticals meth are incompletely metabolized in human body and then excreted into municipal sewage system with a blend of unchanged substance metabolites and conjugates via urine or feces kuo et al 2015 typically the conventional treatment of wastewater plant contributes very little elimination of trace organic pollutants which will result in meth and its metabolites discharged into receiving water through effluent du et al 2015 as a result meth has been widely detected in surface water around the world for instance the concentrations of meth in nepean river of new south wales in australia were up to 25 25 Œºg l 1 paciuszkiewicz et al 2019 in usa the levels of meth in clark river and in missouri river were reported in the range of 2 7 25 7 ng l 1 and 2 3 62 2 ng l 1 respectively bartelt hunt et al 2009 skees et al 2018 in the mainland of china the meth concentrations in urban rivers in beijing were up to 99 5 ng l 1 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the highest concentration of meth in 36 major rivers in bohai bay was up to 42 0 ng l 1 wang et al 2016 while the highest level of meth in shenzhen river was 239 ng l 1 wang et al 2019 in taiwan of china the meth concentration reached to 405 ng l 1 in surface water lin et al 2010 meanwhile previous study has elucidated that meth was a refractory pollutant in lab scale microcosm wang et al 2018 hence the ubiquity and high concentrations of meth in surface water may pose a threat to aquatic ecosystem there have been several publications about the toxicity of meth to fish mi et al 2016 found that acute exposure to meth at 2 mg l 1 may induce significant anxiety like behavior acute administration to meth at 40 Œºg g 1 caused conditioned place preference cpp of adult zebrafish zhu et al 2017 acute and chronic exposure to meth at 1 2 mg l 1 may impact the survival rate and cardiovascular development of zebrafish embryos ickes 2015 jiang et al 2016 investigated that injection of meth 40 mg kg 1 effected locomotor activity via regulation of dopaminergic and glutamatergic

heart rate decline and pericardial edema fang et al 2016 once entering surface water meth would induce a negative effect to aquatic organisms since the chemical and biological activity was remained wang and lin 2014 only two studies have reported toxicological outcomes of meth in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentration liao et al 2015 found that sub chronic treatment to meth 597 ng l 1 6 0 mg l 1 for 7 days might significantly impact blood circulation hatching time and oxidative stress of medaka embryos and altered medaka larval swimming pattern our previous investigation showed that marked alteration on locomotion behavior feeding rate and chemotaxis of c elegans were observed in meth sub chronic exposure groups at low environmental concentrations 50 ng l 1 wang et al 2019 however to reasonably estimate the ecological risk posed by meth the investigation about the chronic toxicity and bio availability of meth for adult fish at environmentally relevant concentrations are necessary in this work we exposed adult medaka fish oryzias latipes to meth at environmental levels 0 05 25 Œºg l 1 to high level 100 Œºg l 1 for 90 days the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the alteration on the unconditioned neurobehaviors locomotion velocity and organ coefficient kidney and liver of medaka fish induced by meth 2 elucidate the bioconcentration potential of meth and its metabolite amphetamine amp in medaka fish body and eggs 3 reveal the underlying toxicological mechanism via the changes of relative expression of genes and

instructions the details are provided in the supporting information the calibration curve equations the limit of quantitation loq and method accuracy were showed in table s5 2 8 risk characterization risk quotients rq is the basic principle to assess the eco risk posed by the environmental pollutants hernando et al 2006 the value is computed by the measured environmental concentration mec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec of the target chemical the pnec is derived from the ecx ec effect concentration x percent of affected organisms divided by the extrapolated factors ef ranging from 1000 to 1 calow 1998 based on the regulations defined by eu tgd communities 1996 the ef of 50 is applied when there is only chronic toxicity data of one species therefore the rq of meth was calculated by the formula below 4 rq mec pnec where pnec ec10 50 the ec10 value was obtained from the dose effect curve of the larval deformation incidences fig 3 the mec was acquired in the previous investigations reporting the concentrations of meth in surface water different eco risk levels interpreting the rq low risk from 0 01 through 0 1 medium risk from 0 1 through 1 and high risk 1 was applied in the present work hernando et al 2006 2 9 statistical analysis the statistical program spss 18 0 chicago il usa was used to collate and analyze all the collected data ten or more replicates of each parameter were determined to eliminate the variability of the results all the data were expressed as mean standard deviations s d the normality was assessed by shapiro wilk tests homogeneity of variance set was determined by levene s test differences between the control and meth exposure groups were evaluated by one way anova followed by post hoc tukey s test 95 confidence interval the two way anova tests were used to examine the significance of differences in the hsi values between female and male at the same concentration the two tailed t tests were used to determine the difference of the development parameters body length interorbital width body length and body width body length of larvae between the control and 0 2 Œºg l 1 groups at the same incubation time the pearson correlation test was performed for the correlations between the parameters canonical correlation analysis cca and principal component analyses pca among the biomarkers were conducted using canoco version 4 5 differences in larval deformation incidence were analyzed via œá2 tests the differences were significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of the behaviors of adult medaka induced by meth although the behavioral phenotypes are variable among the individual fish the locomotion pattern of the healthy fish model keeps intact gerlai et al 2009 previous investigation found that normal fish unconditionally preferred to swim around the edge of the tank once placed into a new circumstance maximino et al 2010 the aberrant swimming patterns of adult medaka were observed in meth exposure groups in this work as showed in fig 1 the swimming trails and the locomotion activities markedly altered in exposure groups compared with the control previous studies have elucidated that there was a classic relationship between anxiety and erratic behavioral function in fish barbosa et al 2012 duarte et al 2019 hence the significant increase of continual spontaneous turns center zone dwell frequency shown in fig 1a total distance fig 1b and max velocity fig 1c illuminated that environmental levels of meth 0 05 0 5 Œºg l 1 may promote anxiety in adult medaka similarly the stimulus in medaka larvae posed by meth at environmentally relevant concentrations was observed in previous study liao et al 2015 however the inverted u shaped dose response of total distance 0 5 Œºg l 1 p 0 05 at 100 Œºg l 1 and max velocity 0 5 Œºg l 1 p 0 05 at 25 Œºg l 1 indicated that high doses of meth had anesthetic features fig 1b and c which was consistent to the previous publication that zebrafish exhibited trance like passive swimming treated with hallucinogenic cunningham et al 2011 additionally the different results about the anxiety of adult zerafish induced by high dose of meth 2 mg l 1 or 40 mg kg 1 with acute treatment 30 min or 12 h indicated the different effect between chronic and acute exposure jiang et al 2016 mi et al 2016 from an ecological point the alteration on the normal behavioral function of fish may pose ecosystem level consequence johansson and brodin 2003 fish are able to avoid predator by swimming around the safe area fuiman and magurran 1994 in this work as the locomotion activity was accelerated by meth at environmentally relevant levels 0 05 0 5 Œºg l 1 adult medaka fish were noticeable to increase predation risk the flourish of the fish community may be impaired hence the ecosystem level risks induced by meth in aquatic system should not be overlooked 3 2 alterations on histopathology of brain and the organ coefficients previous publications had reported that meth can distribute throughout the body extensively via permeating the blood brain barrier and then activate certain systems in the brain roohbakhsh et al 2016 sharma and kiyatkin 2009 found that meth treatment could induce rapid morphological brain abnormalities histopathology of brain isolated from adult medaka was determined in this work the brain slices of medaka in the control group showed an intact tissue structure with complete cellular structure fig 2 a while the brain section of the fish treated with meth at 0 2 Œºg l 1 showed obvious minimal gliosis neuronal loss and necrotic arrows fig 2b meth is mainly metabolized in the liver catalyzed by cytochrome isoenzyme cyp2d6 and then largely excreted in the urine cruickshank and dyer 2009 meanwhile sex dependent effects of meth toxicity were documented in previous publication bourque et al 2012 in this work as shown in fig 2c the significant increase of hsi values induced by meth was observed in male fish at environmental concentrations 0 2 5 Œºg l 1 while the hsi values of female fish markedly declined at 100 Œºg l 1 meth group the gender differences were observed in 0 05 0 5 and 5 Œºg l 1 groups p 0 05 which revealed that the different toxicity between male and female fish induced by meth at environmental levels should be taken into consideration to reasonably estimate the eco risk posed by meth to aquatic ecosystem the nsi values of adult medaka were remarkably decreased treatment with meth at 0 05 100 Œºg l 1 fig 2d there were no significant changes of csi values observed in all exposure groups similarly the dose dependent effect of histopathology induced by meth on fish was found by previous study zhu et al 2017 3 3 alteration on the gene expressions and protein contents to clarify the underlying mechanism of the changes of the behaviors histopathology and the hsi nsi values induced by meth we studied the relative expression of genes cacna1c oxtr erk1 and c fos and the contents of proteins oxt and pka in medaka brain from different groups dose dependent transcription inhibition of cacna1c was found in adult fish brain exposed to meth at 0 5 100 Œºg l 1 fig 3 a calcium ca2 channels in neurons regulate variable physiological functions including neurochemistry and neurobehavior licata and pierce 2003 previous study showed that the alteration of the expression of cacna1c gene ca2 channel genes subunit contributed to the mechanism underlying the behavioral changes induced by psychostimulant kabir et al 2017 the down regulation of cacna1c gene in response to meth can partly explain the changes of behavioral pattern of medaka fig 3b showed the relative expression of oxtr gene as a crucial gene in oxytocin system in brain was significantly up regulated by meth 0 2 100 Œºg l 1 meanwhile the plasma oxytocin oxt levels in brain markedly increased in meth exposure groups at 25 to 100 Œºg l 1 fig 4 a which has been unveiled by previous investigation zanos et al 2014 the endogenous oxt system was relevant to the addiction related behaviors chronic exposure with drugs mcgregor et al 2008 which may associated with the changes of behavioral functions zhang et al 2015 found that exposure to meth at 15 Œºm activated the mapk mitogen activated protein kinase signaling channel in brain studies have pointed that antidepressant drugs reinforced the behaviors by activating mapk signaling pathway r√©us et al 2014 di benedetto et al 2013 erk1 extracellular regulated protein kinase and pka protein kinase a are part of the mapk signaling in this work treatment with meth up regulated the transcriptional expression of erk1 gene at 0 05 100 Œºg l 1 fig 3c and the content of pka at 0 2 100 Œºg l 1 fig 4b the previous investigation revealed that food seeking behaviors and other learned behaviors were regulated by fos protein the product of the immediate early gene c fos in striatum and prefrontal cortex liu et al 2014 similarly we found the relative expression of c fos gene was significantly up regulated by meth at 0 2 100 Œºg l 1 groups fig 3d which may result in the enhancement of medaka locomotion activity to show the correlations among the tested biomarkers person correlation analyses canonical correlation analysis cca and principal component analyses pca were conducted as showed in fig s3 the significant correlations were found among the ecologically important behaviors and the selected genes and proteins which indicated the up or down regulations of the molecular indicators were associated with the changes on the physiological parameters the two axis 1 and 2 contributed 95 85 to the total score according to cca results fig s4 a the gene cacna1c maybe the key factor to explain the changes on the physiological biomarkers followed by genes erk1 oxtr meanwhile the hsi of female fish was mainly impacted by gene erk1 while the explains determined by the changes of relative expressions or contents of genes and proteins to the changes of nsi was negligible based on the pca fig s4 b the two most significant factors contribute approximately 80 to the total score the duplicates in each exposure groups were clustered but divided from other groups the statistical analysis elucidated the correlation not the causal relationship between the tested biomarkers therefore further investigations should be performed to explain the biological mechanism 3 4 transgenerational toxicity as showed in fig 5 several kinds of development deformations were observed in the larvae of the f1 generation in meth exposure groups collected in the last week fig 5a showed the normal morphology of medaka larvae from the control yolk sac edema fig 5b e hemorrhaging occurred in spots of the heart sac fig 5f and lordosis fig 5g and h were observed in larvae from the meth exposure groups generally most medaka larvae with development defects couldn t swim up and died in several dph the deformation occurred incidences in the 0 05 0 2 0 5 5 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 meth exposure groups were 3 03 5 165 œá2 1 54 p 0 22 3 53 6 170 œá2 2 22 p 0 14 8 33 14 168 œá2 10 11 p 0 0015

from meth exposure groups has been observed in the previous study liao et al 2015 according to the logarithmic fitting formula showed in fig 5i the ec10 was 24 5 Œºg l 1 to further elucidate the mechanism expressions of gata 4 and gata 6 genes involved in the cardiac and skeletal development were evaluated in the abnormal larvae borok et al 2016 charron et al 1999 the transcription levels of gata 4 and gata 6 genes in medaka larvae were significantly p 0 05 down regulated by meth at 0 5 and 5 Œºg l 1 respectively fig 5j which was associated with the development deformations of the f1 generation larvae induced by meth linear regression between the relative expressions of the two genes and the abnormalities incidences showed a significant covariant relationship further indicating the underling mechanisms fig s5 the development parameters including body length body width and interorbital width of the medaka larvae without obvious deformations occurred from the control and 0 2 Œºg l 1 group were determined on day 7 10 20 30 dph as showed in table 2 the body length of larvae from 0 2 Œºg l 1 dose group was significantly shorter in comparison to the larvae in the control at 7 30 dph moreover the ratio of interorbital width to body length as well as the ratio of body width to body length of the larvae in 0 2 Œºg l 1 dose group were markedly less than it in the control at 20 and 30 dph the abnormal development parameters of medaka larvae occurred in the meth exposure group indicated that the transgenerational toxicity posed by meth at environmental levels to aquatic organisms was persistent hence the aquatic teratogenic risk of meth shouldn t be underestimated the larvae abnormality and death in f1 generation induced by meth over time have ecosystem level consequence as it would lead to population decline and then impair the flourish of the fish 3 5 residue meth levels in adult medaka and eggs the accumulated body burdens of meth and its major metabolite amp were quantified in this work to estimate the bioccumulation of meth in adult medaka and the eggs for adult medaka fish body meth was detected in all exposure groups whereas amp was only detected in high level groups 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 table 1 after 90 day exposure residual levels of meth in fish bodies were 0 24 0 05 0 98 0 13 2 89 0 32 19 21 0 51 37 52 0 89 and 39 94 0 93 ng g 1 of wet weight ww corresponding with 0 05 0 2 0 5 5 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 meth groups respectively the concentrations of amp in fish from 25 and 100 Œºg l 1 meth groups were 8 3 1 23 and 10 2 1 08 ng g 1 of ww respectively the bioconcentration factor bcf of meth in medaka ranged from 0 4 to 5 8 which was similar to the reports in freshwater snail cipangopaludian cathayensis 5 8 9 exposed to meth at 0 1 mg l 1 qu et al 2020 in zebrafish 1 6 42 exposed to meth 1 100 Œºg l 1 but much lower than the bcf in zebrafish 449 exposed to meth at 0 01 Œºg l 1 yin et al 2019a this may attribute to the difference between variable fish species the accumulated body burden of meth in wild fish was raged from 0 0038 to 0 087 ng g 1 collected in urban river in beijing yin et al 2019b for the eggs collected in the last week there was no residue of meth or amp detected this may be due to the protection of fish embryos by chorion egg envelope against the organic contaminants boudreau et al 2005 3 6 risk assessment the pnec of the offspring deformations induced by meth calculated from the ec10 24 5 Œºg l 1 and ef 50 was 490 ng l 1 based on the occurrence of meth in surface water investigated by previous studies including china mainland and taiwan hu et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 lai et al 2018 li et al 2016 lin et al 2010 lin et al 2014 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 australia paciuszkiewicz et al 2019 spain mendoza et al 2014 postigo et al 2010 postigo et al 2012 czech republic koba et al 2018 italy zuccato et al 2008 uk baker and kasprzyk hordern 2013 zuccato et al 2008 and usa bartelt hunt et al 2009 tian et al 2019 watanabe et al 2020 skees et al 2018 jones lepp et al 2012 we quantified the teratogenic risk level posed by meth via calculating the rq values using eq 4 as showed in table 3 and fig s6 the rq in taiwan in china was more than 1 high risk while beijing yunnan and guangdong shenzhen and guangzhou were greater than 0 1 indicting the risk in the surface water in these regions was at medium level the other provinces such as heilongjiang liaoning tianjin heibei shandong hubei and ningxia were was at low risk level meanwhile the rq of meth in forester creek california and colorado river arizona in usa were greater than 1 at high risk level while missouri river nebraska and clark river tennessee was more than 0 1 up to medium level more surprisingly the rq values of meth in australia nepean river were several orders of magnitude greater than it in other countries at high risk level the result may attribute to the sample site in this study adjoined with the outlet of the wastewater treatment plants which resulted in the high concentrations of meth detected in the river since it wasn t diluted by the fresh water in europe the risk posed by meth in the rivers in czech republic was up to medium level 0 1 rq 1 whereas in spain italy and uk was at low level thus the adverse effect offspring deformation occurrence posed by meth on fish shouldn t be neglected 4 conclusion this study for the first time clarified that meth could pose ecosystem level consequences to fish by modifying the ecologically important behavioral functions including swimming pattern and locomotion velocity of adult medaka fish at environmentally relevant concentrations 0 2 Œºg l 1 the significant alteration on the transcriptional levels of the genes cacna1c oxtr erk1 and c fos as well as the contents of the proteins oxt and pka involved in the vdcc and mapk signaling channel were observed in the meth exposure groups 0 05 Œºg l 1 which may elucidate the underlying mechanisms about the effect on the ecologically important behavioral traits of adult medeka by meth the gender difference on the changes of hsi values of medaka fish induced by meth indicated that male fish was more susceptible meth showed a potential bioconcentration in fish body since the bcf ranged from 0 4 to 5 8 exposed to meth for 90 days the development deformations of medaka larvae in f1 generation induced by meth showed a significant dose response manner and then threaten the prosperity of the fish community this study for the first time clarified that meth can induce the changes of ecologically important behaviors of fish and abnormalities of f1 generation fish larvae thereby posing ecosystem level consequences to fish high concentrations of meth were widely reported in surface water and therefore could induce an extensive development abnormality in the offspring of wild fish according to the rq values the teratogenic risk of meth in the surface water in china usa and australia was up to high level 1 therefore long term environmental monitoring for meth in surface water should be performed to estimate the temporal variations of its teratogenic risk providing proof on the necessity for further control measures declaration of competing interest manuscript has been read and approved by all authors and no conflict

capable of degrading refractory organic contaminants in water this study found that magnesium and calcium ions mg2 and ca2 accelerate the degradation of micfrocystin lr mc lr the most toxic and abundant cyanotoxin by the fe ii tpp o2 system the addition of mg2 and ca2 increased the observed rate constant of mc lr degradation by up to 4 3 and 14 8 folds respectively mg2 and ca2 accelerated the mc lr degradation in the entire ph range except for the alkaline region with ph ca 10 the addition of mg2 and ca2 also reshaped the ph dependency of the mc lr degradation greatly increasing the rate of mc lr degradation at neutral ph it was found that mg2 and ca2 accelerate the reaction of fe ii tpp complexes with oxygen resulting in faster production of reactive oxidants the findings from cyclic voltammetry and potentiometric titration suggest that mg2 and ca2 form ternary complexes with fe ii tpp which exhibit higher reactivity with oxygen due to the effects of mg2 and ca2 the rate of

contaminants which suggests the possibility of the fe ii o2 system for water and wastewater treatment applications the oxidation of fe ii by o2 produces superoxide radical anion o2 and subsequently hydrogen peroxide h2o2 via a series of one electron transfer reactions reactions 1 2 the resultant h2o2 reacts with another fe ii to generate reactive oxidants such as hydroxyl radical oh and ferryl

has been proposed as a promising strategy to increase the oxidant yield of the fe ii o2 system by preventing iron precipitation keenan and sedlak 2008b in addition the iron complexation with the ligands affects the spin state of the produced fe iv species enhancing its reactivity bernasconi and baerends 2008 kazaryan and baerends 2015 for these reasons various iron chelating agents such as oxalate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta nitriloriacetic acid polyoxometalates poms and polyphosphates have been tested to improve the performance of the fe ii o2 system chen et al 2019 deng et al

chen et al 2019 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2013 2015 our previous study also showed that the fe ii tpp o2 system can effectively degrade microcystin lr mc lr one of most toxic cyanobacterial hepatotoxins and as a result remove its toxicity kim et al 2017 this study newly found that magnesium and calcium ions mg2 and ca2 accelerate the degradation of mc lr by the fe ii tpp o2 system since mg2 and ca2 are common divalent cations that prevail in natural water they are expected to play a key role in the performance of the fe ii tpp o2 system in field applications the objectives of this study were i to elucidate the effects of mg2 and ca2 on the reactive oxidant production by the fe ii tpp o2 system as well as the resultant mc lr degradation and ii to assess the importance of these effects for natural water application for these purposes mc lr degradation and oxidant production using methanol as an oxidant probe compound were examined by varying the mg2 and ca2 concentrations and ph the ph dependent speciation and the redox properties of fe ii tpp complexes were investigated in the presence of mg2 and ca2 using potentiometric titration and cyclic voltammetry respectively

figs s8 s16 of the sd in the absence of mg2 and ca2 the rate of mc lr degradation showed a unique ph dependency i e a dip at ph 8 and two peaks at ph 6 and 9 in fig 2a also refer to fig s17a of the sd which is consistent with our previous observations kim et al 2017 the addition of mg2 and ca2 significantly increased the mc lr degradation rate over the entire ph range reshaping its ph dependency the dip at ph 8 disappeared and a peak evolved at the near point ph 7 8 fig 2a such a transformation of the ph dependency was also observed in the percent degradation of mc lr fig s17a of the sd the rate of hcho production by the fe ii tpp o2 system without mg2 and ca2 increased with increasing ph fig 2b when mg2 or ca2 were added an optimal ph appeared at 8 however at ph 7 the final concentration of hcho 60 min was clearly higher in absence of both cations fig s17b of the sd in absence of mg2 and ca2 k obs fe ii values increased with increasing ph fig 2c at ph 5 these values were much lower than those obtained in the presence of mg2 and ca2 for which maxima were obtained at ph 10 and 9 respectively 3 3 redox properties of fe ii tpp complexes the cyclic voltammograms of fe ii tpp complexes were obtained in the absence and presence of mg2 and ca2 fig 3 tpp alone showed a pair of anodic and cathodic peaks at 0 72 and 0 05 vsce respectively for the fe ii tpp complexes an additional peak was observed at 0 16 vsce which is responsible for the oxidation of fe ii tpp to fe iii tpp wang et al 2013 the counter cathodic peak was masked by the hydrogen evolution reaction that started at 0 3 vsce the addition of mg2 and ca2 shifted the peak for the oxidation of fe ii tpp toward more negative voltage values i e 0 21 and 0 23 vsce respectively refer to the inset of fig 3 3 4 speciation of fe ii tpp complexes the ph dependent speciation of fe ii tpp complexes was examined by potentiometric titration the pk a values of fe ii tpp complexes in the absence and presence of mg2

same order to verify the effects of mg2 and ca2 in natural waters on the degradation of mc lr the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 were correlated with the rate of mc lr degradation fig 6 the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 showed good linear correlation with ln k bos mc lr r2 0 93 and 0 929 respectively fig 6a and 6b in particular the sum of mg2 and ca2 concentrations exhibited perfect

mediated by fe ii tpp complexes sychev and isak 1995 previous studies suggested that fe iv species most likely fe iv tpp complexes rather than oh is the major reactive oxidant produced by the fenton like reaction of fe ii tpp reaction 5 alternative to reaction 3 kim et al 2015 2017 5 fe ii tpp h 2 o 2 fe iv tpp h 2 o in addition the possibility of the direct production of fe iv tpp by the reaction of fe ii tpp and o2 has been proposed kim et al 2015 the two electron transfer reactions may proceed as described below 6 fe ii tpp o 2 2 h fe iv tpp h 2 o 2 7 fe ii tpp o 2 fe iv o tpp oxo complexes such a two electron oxidation mechanism was reasoned by the observation that the oxidant yield defined as Œ¥ oxidant Œ¥ fe ii in the fe ii tpp o2 system exceeded the theoretical value for the serial one electron oxidation of fe ii tpp reactions 1 3 or 5 kim et al 2015 the produced oxidants fe iv tpp complexes are either used for the oxidative degradation of organic contaminants e g microcystins carbamazepine and reactive black 5 reaction 8 or are scavenged by fe ii tpp and h2o2 reactions 9 and 10 kim et al 2015 2017 8 fe iv tpp mc lr oxidation products 9 fe iv tpp fe ii tpp 2 fe iii tpp 10 fe iv tpp h 2 o 2 fe iii tpp ho 2 h 4 2 role of mg2 and ca2 the primary role of mg2 and ca2 in the fe ii tpp o2 system is to increase the reactivity of fe ii tpp complex which accelerates the oxidation of fe ii tpp and the subsequent oxidant production as shown in figs 1 and 2 the change in reactivity of fe ii tpp by mg2 and ca2 is believed to result from the formation of ternary complexes i e fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 the definite chemical composition and structures are unclear mg2 and ca2 are known to form strong complexes with tpp the stability constants for mg2 tpp and ca2 tpp complexes were reported to be 106 04 and 105 46 respectively watters and machen 1968 which are comparable to or slightly less than that of fe ii 107 68 reed 1969 it is plausible that mg2 and ca2 additionally interact with unbound phosphate moieties of fe ii tpp to form the ternary complexes in which tpp serves as a bridging ligand the formation of fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 complexes was evidenced by the speciation change of fe ii tpp complexes in the presence of mg2 and ca2 fig 4 the presence of mg2 and ca2 altered the species distribution reducing the number of ph dependent species from five to four probably by occupying deprotonated phosphoryl oxygen of tpp the enhanced reactivity of fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 complexes with o2 compared to the fe ii tpp complexes is believed to result from the change in electronic properties of the center ferrous iron by the altered geometry of the complexes in a similar context bernasconi and baerends 2009 have simulated changes in the o2 activation reactivity of fe ii edta complexes by taking into account the distortion of the ligand due to the protonation states indeed the redox potentials of the fe ii fe iii couple for fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 0 21 vshe and 0 23 vshe respectively were lower than that for fe ii tpp 0 16 vshe fig 3 indicating that mg2 and ca2 enhance the reducing power of fe ii tpp the higher potential shift for fe ii tpp ca2 is consistent with the greater effect of ca2 compared to mg2 figs 1 and 2 the lower redox potentials of ligand bridged dimetallic complexes than monometallic ones have been reported for several other metals callahan et al 1975 wang and fox 1994 mg2 and ca2 can also affect the reactivity of fe iv tpp produced by the fe ii tpp o2 system previous studies have reported that the electron transfer reactions of several l fe iv o 2 l ligand complexes are significantly enhanced by the addition of redox inactive metal ions such as sc3 zn2 mg2 and ca2 morimoto et al 2011 park et al 2011 this phenomenon was explained by the metal ion coupled electron transfer mechanism in which metal ion acting as a lewis acid combines with the oxo oxygen atom in l fe iv o 2 to increase the oxidation power of the fe iv species reaction 8 4 3 effects of mg2 and ca2 on mc lr degradation and oxidant production the mc lr degradation hcho production the oxidant production and fe ii oxidation by the fe ii tpp o2 system were strongly affected by the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 added fig 1b 1d increasing the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 can increase the fractions of fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 however as the ratios of mg2 and ca2 to fe ii exceed their optima fe ii in the fe ii tpp complexes may be substituted by mg2 and ca2 as a result at excessive concentrations of mg2 and ca2 the rates of mc lr degradation and oxidant production stagnated or decreased while the presence of mg2 and ca2 increases the rate of oxidant production it instead decreases the oxidant yield the hcho production decreased with increasing the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 marked red in fig 1c this observation may be due to the oxidant scavenging effect reactions 9 and 10 the enhanced reactivity of fe ii tpp and fe iv tpp by mg2 and ca2 decreases the total production of oxidant species by the reactions with fe ii tpp and h2o2 fig 1d for this reason the decreased oxidant yield in the presence of mg2 and ca2 can lower the efficiency not the rate of the contaminant oxidation indeed the percent degradation of mc lr decreased by 2 2 6 8 fig 1a and 1b in the presence of mg2 and ca2 the observed decrease was not significant compared to that of the oxidant yield fig 1c because the concentration of mc lr is low enough to be almost fully degraded by the amount of the produced oxidant the presence of mg2 and ca2 altered the ph dependency of mc lr degradation and oxidant production fig 2a and 2b mg2 and ca2 not only change the speciation of fe ii tpp fig 4 affecting the ph dependency of oxidant production fig 2b but also the speciation of the oxidant itself fe iv tpp in the absence of mg2 and ca2 the fe ii tpp o2 system led to the least degradation of mc lr at ph 8 fig 2a the same result was found for other organic contaminants such as carbamazepine and reactive black 5 kim et al 2015 which was explained by the ph dependent speciation of fe iv tpp complexes with different reactivities in the presence of mg2 and ca2 the mc lr degradation at ph 8 was greatly enhanced indicating that the fe iv tpp species dominant at this ph value shifts to the form of higher reactivity by mg2 and ca2 regardless of the presence of mg2 and ca2 the discrepancy between mc lr degradation and hcho production fig 2a and 2b can be an important evidence for the generation of fe iv a more target specific oxidant rather than oh 4 4 implications for natural water application the fe ii tpp o2 system can be an effective method to control microcystins in natural water particularly containing sufficient amounts of mg2 and ca2 the rate of mc lr degradation in natural water was much higher than that in di water at ph 7 5 13 103 folds for the tested water samples fig 5 which is a unique characteristic of the fe ii tpp o2 system owing to the effects of mg2 and ca2 in particular the typical ph values of natural waters range from 7 to 8 in which the effects of mg2 and ca2 are maximized fig 2a in many oxidation processes the degradation of contaminants is inhibited by natural organic substances that serve as oxidant scavengers ahn and yun 2019 autin et al 2013 however in the fe ii tpp o2 system at the experimental conditions tested the positive effects of mg2 and ca2 still seem to dominate over the negative effects of natural oxidant scavengers the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 showed perfect correlation with the rate of mc lr degradation in different natural waters fig 6 5 conclusions the major conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the degradation of mc lr by the fe ii tpp o2 system was greatly accelerated by the presence of mg2 and ca2 increasing the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 increased the rate of mc lr degradation by up to 4 3 and 14 8 folds respectively the effects of mg2 and ca2 were maximized at neutral ph values i e ph 7 8 2 the accelerated degradation of mc lr by the fe ii tpp o2 system with mg2 and ca2 is explained by the formation of ternary complexes of fe ii tpp with mg2 and ca2 i e fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 these new complexes are found to be stronger reductants which are more rapidly oxidized by o2 to produce reactive oxidants 3 mg2 and ca2 also interact with the resultant oxidants i e fe iv tpp species increasing their reactivity the increase in the oxidant reactivity could explain the lower oxidant yield and slightly lower degradation efficiency of mc lr and the change in the ph dependency of mc lr degradation 4 the rate of mc lr degradation by the fe ii tpp o2 system was higher in natural waters than in di water due to the effects of mg2 and ca2 which is a unique characteristic distinguished from other oxidation processes and

capable of degrading refractory organic contaminants in water this study found that magnesium and calcium ions mg2 and ca2 accelerate the degradation of micfrocystin lr mc lr the most toxic and abundant cyanotoxin by the fe ii tpp o2 system the addition of mg2 and ca2 increased the observed rate constant of mc lr degradation by up to 4 3 and 14 8 folds respectively mg2 and ca2 accelerated the mc lr degradation in the entire ph range except for the alkaline region with ph ca 10 the addition of mg2 and ca2 also reshaped the ph dependency of the mc lr degradation greatly increasing the rate of mc lr degradation at neutral ph it was found that mg2 and ca2 accelerate the reaction of fe ii tpp complexes with oxygen resulting in faster production of reactive oxidants the findings from cyclic voltammetry and potentiometric titration suggest that mg2 and ca2 form ternary complexes with fe ii tpp which exhibit higher reactivity with oxygen due to the effects of mg2 and ca2 the rate of

has been proposed as a promising strategy to increase the oxidant yield of the fe ii o2 system by preventing iron precipitation keenan and sedlak 2008b in addition the iron complexation with the

chen et al 2019 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2013 2015 our previous study also showed that the fe ii tpp o2 system can effectively degrade microcystin lr mc lr one of most toxic cyanobacterial hepatotoxins and as a result remove its toxicity kim et al 2017 this study newly found that magnesium and calcium ions mg2 and ca2 accelerate the degradation of mc lr by the fe ii tpp o2 system since mg2 and ca2 are common divalent cations that prevail in natural water they are expected to play a key role in the performance of the fe ii tpp o2 system in field applications the objectives of this study were i to elucidate the effects of mg2 and ca2 on the reactive oxidant production by the fe ii tpp o2 system as well as the resultant mc lr degradation and ii to assess the importance of these effects for natural water application for these purposes mc lr degradation and oxidant production using methanol as an oxidant probe compound were examined by varying the mg2 and ca2 concentrations

results 3 1 effects of mg2 and ca2 the degradation of mc lr by the fe ii tpp o2 system was examined in the absence and presence of mg2 and ca2 fig 1 a in the absence of mg2 and ca2 mc lr was gradually degraded over 60 min following the pseudo second order kinetics with the rate constant k obs mc lr of 0 42 m 1 min 1 also see the inset of fig 1a the addition of 1 mm mg2 and ca2 significantly accelerated the degradation of mc lr almost 90 of mc lr was degraded in 10 min and 2 min respectively in the presence of mg2 and ca2 the k obs mc lr values in the initial stage increased by 2 6 and 14 times respectively the mc lr degradation the hcho production from the oxidation of excess methanol indicating the production of reactive oxidants refer to section 2 3 and the fe ii oxidation by the fe

showed similar trends to the mc lr degradation fig 1c and 1d the rate of hcho production k obs hcho was maximized at 1 65 mm mg2 and 1 12 mm ca2 however the final concentration of hcho tended to decrease with increasing concentrations of mg2 and ca2 29 2 38 1 decrease the rate of fe ii oxidation k obs fe ii increased by 10 and 28 2 folds as the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 increased to 1 85 mm and 1 mm respectively fig 1d 3 2 ph dependency the effect of ph on mc lr degradation hcho production and fe ii oxidation in the fe ii tpp o2 system was examined at different ph values of 3 11 in

figs s8 s16 of the sd in the absence of mg2 and ca2 the rate of mc lr degradation showed a unique ph dependency i e a dip at ph 8 and two peaks at ph 6 and 9 in fig 2a also refer to fig s17a of the sd which is consistent with our previous observations kim et al 2017 the addition of mg2 and ca2 significantly increased the mc lr degradation rate over the entire ph range reshaping its ph dependency the dip at ph 8 disappeared and a peak evolved at the near point ph 7 8 fig 2a such a transformation of the ph dependency was also observed in the percent degradation of mc lr fig s17a of the sd the rate of hcho production by the fe ii tpp o2 system without mg2 and ca2 increased with increasing ph fig 2b when mg2 or ca2 were added an optimal ph appeared at 8 however at ph 7 the final concentration of hcho 60 min was clearly higher in absence of both cations fig s17b of the sd in absence of mg2 and ca2 k obs fe ii values increased with increasing ph fig 2c at ph 5 these values were much lower than those obtained in the presence of mg2 and ca2 for which maxima were obtained at ph 10 and 9 respectively 3 3 redox properties of fe ii tpp complexes the cyclic voltammograms of fe ii tpp complexes were obtained in the absence and presence of mg2 and ca2 fig 3 tpp alone showed a pair of anodic and cathodic peaks at 0 72 and 0 05 vsce respectively for the fe ii tpp complexes an additional peak was observed at 0 16 vsce which is responsible for the oxidation of fe ii tpp to fe iii tpp wang et al 2013 the counter cathodic peak was masked by the hydrogen evolution reaction that started at 0 3 vsce the addition of mg2 and ca2 shifted the peak for the oxidation of fe ii tpp toward more negative voltage values i e 0 21 and 0 23 vsce respectively refer to the inset of fig 3 3 4 speciation of fe ii tpp complexes the ph dependent speciation of fe ii tpp complexes was examined by potentiometric titration the pk a values of fe ii tpp complexes in the absence and presence of mg2

fig 5b the k obs mc lr values increased in the order di water control ph 7 5 cheonsang hoeya maegok gamak taehwa however the percent degradation of mc lr marked red in fig 5b slightly decreased in the same order to verify the effects of mg2 and ca2 in natural waters on the degradation of mc lr the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 were correlated with the rate of mc lr degradation fig 6 the

microcystins carbamazepine and reactive black 5 reaction 8 or are scavenged by fe ii tpp and h2o2 reactions 9 and 10 kim et al 2015 2017 8 fe iv tpp mc lr oxidation products 9 fe iv tpp fe ii tpp 2 fe iii tpp 10 fe iv tpp h 2 o 2 fe iii tpp ho 2 h 4 2 role of mg2 and ca2 the primary role of mg2 and ca2 in the fe ii tpp o2 system is to increase the reactivity of fe ii tpp complex which accelerates the oxidation of fe ii tpp and the subsequent oxidant production as shown in figs 1 and 2 the change in reactivity of fe ii tpp by mg2 and ca2 is believed to result from the formation of ternary complexes i e fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 the definite chemical composition and structures are unclear mg2 and ca2 are known to form strong complexes with tpp the stability constants for mg2 tpp and ca2 tpp complexes were reported to be 106 04 and 105 46 respectively watters and machen 1968 which are comparable to or slightly less than that of fe ii 107 68 reed 1969 it is plausible that mg2 and ca2 additionally interact with unbound phosphate moieties of fe ii tpp to form the ternary complexes in which tpp serves as a bridging ligand the formation of fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 complexes was evidenced by the speciation change of fe ii tpp complexes in the presence of mg2 and ca2 fig 4 the presence of mg2 and ca2 altered the species distribution reducing the number of ph dependent species from five to four probably by occupying deprotonated phosphoryl oxygen of tpp the enhanced reactivity of fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 complexes with o2 compared to the fe ii tpp complexes is believed to result from the change in electronic properties of the center ferrous iron by the altered geometry of the complexes in a similar context bernasconi and baerends 2009 have simulated changes in the o2 activation reactivity of fe ii edta complexes by taking into account the distortion of the ligand due to the protonation states indeed the redox potentials of the fe ii fe iii couple for fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 0 21 vshe and 0 23 vshe respectively were lower than that for fe ii tpp 0 16 vshe fig 3 indicating that mg2 and ca2 enhance the reducing power of fe ii tpp the higher potential shift for fe ii tpp ca2 is consistent with the greater effect of ca2 compared to mg2 figs 1 and 2 the lower redox potentials of ligand bridged dimetallic complexes than monometallic ones have been reported for several other metals callahan et al 1975 wang and fox 1994 mg2 and ca2 can also affect the reactivity of fe iv tpp produced by the fe ii tpp o2 system previous studies have reported that the electron transfer reactions of several l fe iv o 2 l ligand complexes are significantly enhanced by the addition of redox inactive metal ions such as sc3 zn2 mg2 and ca2 morimoto et al 2011 park et al 2011 this phenomenon was explained by the metal ion coupled electron transfer mechanism in which metal ion acting as a lewis acid combines with the oxo oxygen atom in l fe iv o 2 to increase the oxidation power of the fe iv species reaction 8 4 3 effects of mg2 and ca2 on mc lr degradation and oxidant production the mc lr degradation hcho production the oxidant production and fe ii oxidation by the fe ii tpp o2 system were strongly affected by the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 added fig 1b 1d increasing the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 can increase the fractions of fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 however as the ratios of mg2 and ca2 to fe ii exceed their optima fe ii in the fe ii tpp complexes may be substituted by mg2 and ca2 as a result at excessive concentrations of mg2 and ca2 the rates of mc lr degradation and oxidant production stagnated or decreased while the presence of mg2 and ca2 increases the rate of oxidant production it instead decreases the oxidant yield the hcho production decreased with increasing the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 marked red in fig 1c this observation may be due to the oxidant scavenging effect reactions 9 and 10 the enhanced reactivity of fe ii tpp and fe iv tpp by mg2 and ca2 decreases the total production of oxidant species by the reactions with fe ii tpp and h2o2 fig 1d for this reason the decreased oxidant yield in the presence of mg2 and ca2 can lower the efficiency not the rate of the contaminant oxidation indeed the percent degradation of mc lr decreased by 2 2 6 8 fig 1a and 1b in the presence of mg2 and ca2 the observed decrease was not significant compared to that of the oxidant yield fig 1c because the concentration of mc lr is low enough to be almost fully degraded by the amount of the produced oxidant the presence of mg2 and ca2 altered the ph dependency of mc lr degradation and oxidant production fig 2a and 2b mg2 and ca2 not only change the speciation of fe ii tpp fig 4 affecting the ph dependency of oxidant production fig 2b but also the speciation of the oxidant itself fe iv tpp in the absence of mg2 and ca2 the fe ii tpp o2 system led to the least degradation of mc lr at ph 8 fig 2a the same result was found for other organic contaminants such as carbamazepine and reactive black 5 kim et al 2015 which was explained by the ph dependent speciation of fe iv tpp complexes with different reactivities in the presence of mg2 and ca2 the mc lr degradation at ph 8 was greatly enhanced indicating that the fe iv tpp species dominant at this ph value shifts to the form of higher reactivity by mg2 and ca2 regardless of the presence of mg2 and ca2 the discrepancy between mc lr degradation and hcho production fig 2a and 2b can be an important evidence for the generation of fe iv a more target specific oxidant rather than oh 4 4 implications for natural water application the fe ii tpp o2 system can be an effective method to control microcystins in natural water particularly containing sufficient amounts of mg2 and ca2 the rate of mc lr degradation in natural water was much higher than that in di water at ph 7 5 13 103 folds for the tested water samples fig 5 which is a unique characteristic of the fe ii tpp o2 system owing to the effects of mg2 and ca2 in particular the typical ph values of natural waters range from 7 to 8 in which the effects of mg2 and ca2 are maximized fig 2a in many oxidation processes the degradation of contaminants is inhibited by natural organic substances that serve as oxidant scavengers ahn and yun 2019 autin et al 2013 however in the fe ii tpp o2 system at the experimental conditions tested the positive effects of mg2 and ca2 still seem to dominate over the negative effects of natural oxidant scavengers the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 showed perfect correlation with the rate of mc lr degradation in different natural waters fig 6 5 conclusions the major conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the degradation of mc lr by the fe ii tpp o2 system was greatly accelerated by the presence of mg2 and ca2 increasing the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 increased the rate of mc lr degradation by up to 4 3 and 14 8 folds respectively the effects of mg2 and ca2 were maximized at neutral ph values i e ph 7 8 2 the accelerated degradation of mc lr by the fe ii tpp o2 system with mg2 and ca2 is explained by the formation of ternary complexes of fe ii tpp with mg2 and ca2 i e fe ii tpp mg2 and fe ii tpp ca2 these new complexes are found to be stronger reductants which are more rapidly oxidized by o2 to produce reactive oxidants 3 mg2 and ca2 also interact with the resultant oxidants i e fe iv tpp species increasing their reactivity the increase in the oxidant reactivity could explain the lower oxidant yield and slightly lower degradation efficiency of mc lr and the change in the ph dependency of mc lr degradation 4 the rate of mc lr degradation by the fe ii tpp o2 system was higher in natural waters than in di water due to the effects of mg2 and ca2 which is a unique characteristic distinguished from other oxidation processes and

17689,recent studies demonstrated the practical potential of multiple beneficial reuse of ferric rich drinking water sludge ferric dws for sulfide and phosphate removal in wastewater applications in practice ferric dws is often stored on site for periods ranging from days to several weeks or even months which may affect its reuse potential through changes in iron speciation and morphology in this study we investigated for the first time the impact of ferric dws aging time on the iron speciation and morphology and its subsequent impact on its reactivity and overall sulfide and phosphate removal capacity a series of coagulation tests were conducted to generate ferric dws of a practically relevant composition by using raw influent water from a full scale drinking water treatment plant dwtp a comparison with ferric dws from 8 full scale dwtps confirmed the similitude the presence of akaganeite Œ≤ feooh was detected in ferric dws through xrd analyses independent of the dws storage time however the morphology of akaganeite changed over time from a predominant poorly crystalline phase in fresh dws 8 0 1 of total fe to a highly crystalline phase 76 3 of total fe at a sludge aging time of 30 days which was confirmed by means of rietveld refinement in xrd analyses n 3 subsequent batch tests showed that its sulfide removal capacity decreased significantly from 1 30 0 02 mmol s mmol fe day 1 to 0 60 0 01 day 30 a decrease of 54 p 0 05 the level of crystallinity however had no impact on sulfide removal kinetics most sulfide being removed within 10 minutes upon aeration of sulfide loaded ferric dws in activate sludge amorphous iron oxides species were formed independent of the initial dws crystallinity which resulted in efficient p removal at capacities similar to that of conventional fecl3 dosing keywords drinking water sludge resource recovery sulfide control phosphate removal coagulant reuse circular economy 1 introduction the majority of drinking water treatment plants dwtps rely on coagulation and flocculation for the removal of turbidity colour natural organic matter nom and pathogens from raw water bratby 2016 matilainen et al 2010 okour et al 2009 amongst the various coagulants used at dwtps the most commonly used are aluminium sulfate often refered to as alum and ferric salts i e either in the form of ferric sulfate or ferric chloride pikaar et al 2014 an unavoidable by product of coagulation flocculation is the generation of large amounts of drinking water sludge dws rich in aluminium or iron depending on the type of coagulant used babatunde and zhao 2007 as examples showing the enormous amounts produced dws generated in the united kingdom and the netherlands exceeds 130 000 and 29 700 wet tonnes respectively per year aquaminerals 2018 binnie et al 2018 management of dws incurs large costs and often comprises a substantial fraction of the operational expenditure of dwtps with landfilling often used as ultimate disposal route frias et al 2013 keeley et al 2016 therefore significant research efforts have been made focussing on coagulant recovery purification and direct reuse within the drinking water treatment process the benefits of such an approach are twofold as it results in a reduced chemical demand in terms of fresh coagulant as well as in a reduced dws production keeley et al 2014 keeley et al 2016 while the practical feasibility of various approaches including donnan dialysis prakash and sengupta 2003 liquid ion exchange sthapak et al 2008 and ion exchange with cation resin petruzzelli et al 2000 has been successfully demonstrated the relatively low coagulant prices make selective recovery and purification approaches economically challenging keeley et al 2012 moreover direct reuse within the drinking water treatment process comes with certain technical challenges as the purification process needs to adhere to stringent regulatory requirements in terms of product quality in order to safeguard human health keeley et al 2016 considering the above described limitations of direct reuse within the drinking water treatment process there is a general interest in low cost and low risk coagulant reuse approaches in this context the reuse of ferric based dws in a sewer context is of special interest iron salts are the most commonly used chemicals to combat hydrogen sulfide induced sewer corrosion a notorious and costly problem for utilities globally pikaar et al 2014 considering the high iron content of ferric based dws it has the potential to be reused in sewers for sulfide control indeed the effective reuse of ferric based dws for efficient sulfide control in laboratory scale rising main sewer reactors was demonstrated previously sun et al 2015 importantly in a very recent study the feasibility of the multiple reuse of iron rich dws for sulfide control in sewers followed by phosphate removal in wastewater treatment and sulfide control during anaerobic digestion at the downstream wastewater treatment plant wwtp was demonstrated through long term continuous experiments using a laboratory scale reactor system mimicking the urban wastewater system rebosura et al 2020 it was found that dws achieved similar treatment performance compared with fecl3 dosing in sewers in terms of sulfide control and phosphate removal rebosura et al 2020 rebosura et al 2018 while the above described studies clearly highlight the potential of beneficial reuse of ferric dws in sewers and downstream wwtps the detailed characterization and potential transformation of iron species prior to reuse was not investigated in detail such information is essential as iron chemistry is complex with potential transformations in iron speciation and morphology that may occur over time from more amorphous and reactive species that are thermodynamically unstable e g ferrihydrite and akaganeite to more crystalline and less reactive species such as goethite and hematite atkinson et al 1977 baltpurvins et al 1996 cornell et al 1989 the ultimate iron speciation and rate of transformation is complex and depends on several factors including solution ph the anions present in solution presence of oxygen and the storage temperature to our best knowledge no studies have been conducted investigating the aging of fe dws under the prevalent anaerobic conditions occurring in real life application as in a practical situation dws is often stored on site from days up to several weeks such transformation may thus occur with a potentially negative impact on the reuse ability of dws therefore this study aimed to determine the impact of the storage time on the physicochemical changes of ferric dws and subsequently its reactivity and capacity in sulfide removal in sewers and in phosphorus removal in the downstream wastewater treatment plant for this purpose a series of laboratory scale jar tests i e coagulation experiments were conducted to generate fe dws using real influent from a local water treatment plant in south east queensland and subsequently stored under anaerobic conditions to mimic the storage conditions of fe dws encountered in real life applications importantly to confirm that the produced ferric dws was of a similar composition with that obtained in real life applications we conducted an industry survey of ferric dws originating from 8 full scale dwtps with ferric chloride as coagulant in their treatment process the produced fe dws was characterized with xrd combined semi quantitative and sem eds analyses in order to investigate and quantify any changes in iron speciation and morphology in the dws at increasing sludge aging times over a period of 30 days the impact on sulfide removal in sewers and phosphate removal in activated sludge tanks was assessed through comprehensive batch sulfide and phosphate removal experiments using the produced ferric dws at different sludge aging times 2 materials and methods 2 1 coagulation experiments for the production of ferric dws coagulation experiments were conducted to produce fresh ferric dws in order to produce fe dws with a composition similar to that obtained in a practical situation surface water originating from a dam used as raw influent for a main water treatment plant in south east queensland australia was used in all coagulation experiments moreover ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o was added at a typical dosing rate commonly applied for coagulation of surface water finally an industry survey was conducted to confirm that the fe dws produced in this study is similar to that of fe dws from full scale plants see table 1 all coagulation experiments were conducted by means of jar tests using a flocculator velp scientific usa the jar tests were conducted at ambient temperatures 22 2 1 c following a standard coagulation protocol the ph of the raw influent used was 6 45 0 12 however due to the acidity of fecl3 the ph dropped to 4 1 0 3 after coagulant addition therefore prior to the jar tests simple titration experiments were performed to evaluate the volume of naoh as 1 solution needed to adjust the ph to the desired values of 5 5 0 1 at the dosing rates applied data not shown subsequent jar tests were conducted using 6 beakers filled with 1 5 l untreated surface water to which the amount of naoh determined by the titration experiments was added while the solution was mixed at a speed of 120rpm using overhead stirrers attached to the flocculator immediately afterwards the coagulant was added with rapid mixing continued for 60 seconds the initial rapid mixing to promote coagulation was followed by a period of slow mixing at 20 rpm for a duration of 20 minutes finally the solutions were allowed to settle for 30 minutes the first set of experiments was the coagulation tests using ferric chloride n 3 ferric chloride was dosed at a rate of 17 87 mg fe3 l equivalent to 86 mg l as fecl3 6h2o samples were taken for analyses of dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 specific uv absorbance suva natural organic matter nom total and soluble fe and p concentrations before and after jar testing in order to assess the treatment performance of the coagulation process the obtained water quality parameters are presented in table s1 the second set of experiments was conducted to generate sufficient fe dws for the detailed characterization and aging studies followed by sulfide and phosphate removal experiments at the end of each coagulation experiment the produced ferric dws was collected in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and immediately centrifuged at 3750 rpm for 20 minutes to produce thickened sludge with a dry solids content of 65 2 7 g l subsequently the headspace of the tubes containing the thickened ferric dws was sparged with n2 and immediately closed with a lid to ensure anaerobic conditions and stored at ambient temperatures i e 22 1 c over a period of 30 days 2 2 sludge characterization samples were taken at different sludge aging times from the fe dws storage container and stored at 18 c followed by subsequent freeze drying 50 c 0 1 millibar the freeze dried samples were ground to thin powder under anaerobic conditions and subsequently characterized through x ray diffraction xrd qualitative and semi quantitative and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds analyses xrd analyses was conducted using a d8 bruker diffractometer equipped with a Œ∏ 2Œ∏ goniometer and a position sensitive detector cu kŒ±1 radiation at Œª 1 55 √• reflections were collected within the 5 80o 2Œ∏ range with a step width of 0 02 and 1 2 seconds step of collecting time the resultant 2Œ∏ peaks were analysed with the xrd software diffrac eva version 4 and matched with the icdd pdf 4 2019 database semi quantitative xrd analyses i e rietveld refinements were conducted to evaluate the degree of crystallinity of the fe dws as a function of the sludge aging time as well as to determine the amount of different types of iron oxide in the fe dws using topas v 4 2 software for this purpose corundum Œ± al2o3 was used as an internal standard for all semi quantitative measurements following a procedure described previously salehin et al 2019 salehin et al 2020 the morphology and elemental composition of fe dws were characterized by means of sem eds analysis a high resolution scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6610 was used to obtain secondary electron micrographs at an applied accelerating voltage of 15 kv the sem was equipped with an x ray detector for elemental analysis oxford instruments 50 mm2 x max sdd x ray detector samples were places on stubs attached with high purity conductive double sided adhesive carbon tapes the samples were subsequently carbon coated using a quorum q150t turbo pumped sputter coater as a means to avoid charge build up and to improve secondary electrons signal 2 3 sulfide and phosphate removal experiments the sulfide and phosphate removal experiments were conducted using untreated sewage from a local pumping station wet well that only receives household wastewater in a residential zone brisbane queensland the sewage was collected on a weekly basis and immediately stored at 4 c the sulfide removal experiments were conducted under anaerobic conditions in gas tight perspextm cylindrical reactors with a working volume of 0 5 l whereas the phosphate removal experiments were conducted in a beaker with a working volume of 150 ml prior to use the sewage was filtered to remove any solids sparged with n2 for 30 minutes to ensure anaerobic conditions and heated up to ambient temperature at 22 1 1 c the sewage contained sulfate at concentrations of 8 5 0 8 mg s l sulfide at 2 9 0 4 mg s l phosphate at 6 1 0 6 mg po4 p l ammonium at 41 6 5 9 mg nh4 n l and a total and soluble cod at 397 2 28 3 and 245 7 10 8 mg cod l respectively prior to each experiment sulfide and phosphate were spiked to the sewage to reach an initial concentration of 20 mg l for both sulfide s and po4 p using standard reagent grade salts na2s 9h2o and kh2po4 from sigma aldrich the produced fe dws was mixed with deoxygenated demineralized water to make a slurry with a fe concentration of 2 7 g fe l the slurry was added to the reactor to reach fe concentrations ranging between 17 5 mg to 70 mg fe l depending on the experiment conducted the latter concentration equalled to fe s molar ratios of 0 5 1 and 2 1 respectively the ph levels were monitored online using a ph sensor probe ph 110 digital industrial ph orp sensor electrode all experiments were conducted in triplicate and at a constant ph of 7 1 0 1 unless specified otherwise the sulfide removal experiments were divided into 3 different sets the first set of experiments was conducted to determine the impact of sludge aging time on sulfide removal efficiency for this purpose fe dws subjected to different aging times i e 1 3 7 10 15 and 30 days were dosed to sewage at an fe s molar ratio of 0 5 1 this fe s dosing ratio was chosen to ensure sulfide is in excess so that the sulfide removal capacity of the ferric dws can be determined the second set of experiments was conducted to investigate the impact of different ph levels towards sulfide control in sewage within a range typically observed in sewage i e ph 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 for this purpose fresh fe dws day 1 was dosed to sewage at fe s molar ratio of 0 5 1 the third set of experiments was conducted to confirm that complete sulfide removal can be achieved by dosing fe dws day 1 at a fe s molar ratio of 2 1 each of the batch tests described above was conducted over a 1 hour period to ensure that stable dissolved sulfide concentrations were reached the fourth set of experiments was conducted to investigate the feasibility of regenerating in sewer dosed fe dws aiming to achieve efficient p removal in aerated activated sludge tanks of down stream wwtps for this purpose fe dws mixed sewage was fed to aerated activated sludge at a ratio of 1 1 v v a similar ratio used by gutierrez et al 2010 in which the regeneration of in sewer dosed fecl3 for p removal in downstream wwtps was investigated gutierrez et al 2010 the fe dws mixed sewage was generated using fe dws with three different sludge ages i e 1 15 and 30 days with sulfide and phosphate spiked sewage to reach initial concentrations of 20 mg l fe dws was added in slurry form to sewage at concentrations of 17 5 24 5 and 35 mg fe dws l equalling to fe s molar ratios of 0 5 1 0 7 1 and 1 1 for sludge ages of 1 15 and 30 days respectively the activated sludge was collected from a laboratory scale sequence batch reactor sbr fed with domestic sewage rebosura et al 2020 the domestic sewage contained phosphate and sulfate concentrations of 7 34 1 09 mg po4 p l and 17 90 5 07 mg so4 s l respectively after mixing the fe dws mixed sewage after sulfide removal with the activated sludge the initial molar fe p ratios during the fe dws regeneration experiments were 0 8 1 1 1 and 1 4 1 for sludge ages of 1 15 and 30 days respectively immediately after mixing the activated sludge with the fe dws mixed sewage liquid samples were taken for analysis of total fe po4 p and dissolved inorganic sulfur species i e sulfide sulfite thiosulfate and sulfate subsequently air was supplied by means of a gas frit over a 2 hour period to ensure that stable phosphate concentrations were reached liquid samples were taken at t 5 15 30 60 and 120 minutes and analysed for po4 p and dissolved inorganic sulfur species the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 chemical analyses ph and temperature were measured using a handheld meter sper scientific turbidity was measured using a portable turbidity meter tn400 watertest systems

solids ts and volatile solids vs were analysed according to standard methods apha 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 the impact of aging on the iron speciation and morphology of ferric dws fig 1 a shows the x ray diffraction patterns of the ferric dws at various aging times it can be seen that akaganeite Œ≤ feooh a chloride containing ferric oxyhydroxide mineral was the main iron oxide species present in the sludge the presence of chloride in akaganeite was confirmed through sem eds analyses fig s2 in addition to akaganeite the dws also contained between 4 10 of silica sio2 in the inorganic fraction a concentration within the range typically observed in drinking water sludge shahin et al 2019 while akaganeite was the predominant iron species present independent of the dws aging time fig 1a clearly shows the change in the morphology of akaganeite from a more amorphous day 1 to a more crystalline phase day 30 subsequent semi quantitative xrd revealed that crystalline akaganeite comprised 8 0 1 24 0 4 and 76 3 of the total fe content of the dws at a sludge age of 1 14 and 30 days respectively fig 1b our results show that natural organic matter nom i e humic and fulvic acid like substances was removed from raw water during the coagulation process and was captured within the fe dws matrix see supplementary information fig s1 it has been reported that nom is usually removed via adsorption at the anoxic oxic interfaces of iron oxyhydroxides chen et al 2014 kaiser and guggenberger 2000 liao et al 2017 riedel et al 2013 interestingly it has been reported that nom plays an important role in inducing akaganeite crystallization nesterova et al 2003 this suggests that the trapped nom within fe dws matrix may have promoted the gradual akaganeite crystallization via interstitial pores of the dws matrix further research is warranted to fundamentally understand the potential impact of nom on the aging of fe dws 3 2 impact of sludge aging on sulfide removal from sewage fig 2 a shows the impact of sludge aging time and thus the level of crystallinity of the fe dws on the sulfide removal efficiency at a constant dosing ratio of 0 5 fe dws sulfide s the figure shows that the sludge aging time had a significant impact on the sulfide removal efficiency with a decrease in dissolved sulfide removed from 13 66 0 41 to 6 34 0 51 mg s l at sludge ages of 1 and 30 days respectively p 0 05 the latter equalled to sulfide removal capacities of 1 30 0 02 mmol sulfide s mmol fe day 1 and 0 60 0 01 mmol sulfide s mmol fe day 30 see fig 2b a decrease of 53 7 1 5 interestingly in a recent study in which aged fe dws from a full scale drinking water treatment was added to a lab scale sewer reactor very similar sulfide removal capacities were observed i e 0 61 mmol sulfide s mmol fe or 1 64 mmol sulfide s mmol fe rebosura et al 2020 equally important the sulfide removal capacity obtained using fresh fe dws i e day 1 was only slightly less than the theoretical sulfide removal capacity for conventional fecl3 dosing see fig 2b previous studies reported on the increase in crystallinity of iron oxyhydroxide particles at higher floc ages dzombak and morel 1990 smith et al 2008 furthermore it was found that the increase in crystallinity was accompanied with a decrease in the surface area and active sites the latter may explain the observed decrease in sulfide removal in our experiments for further fundamental understanding as well as quantitative assessment of the particle size and any changes in surface area of the fe dws as a function of the sludge aging time bet surface area and particle size analysis as well as sequential extractions are warranted overall the results highlight a strong relation between the degree of akaganeite crystallinity and overall sulfide removal capacity albeit not affecting the fast reaction kinetics sulfide removal was found to be fast with most of the sulfide being removed within 10 minutes independent of the sludge aging time fig 2a it has been postulated that the reaction of sulfide with ferric oxide species is a surface controlled process canfield 1989 cornell et al 1989 since it is commonly accepted that amorphous iron oxides have higher surface areas than crystalline iron oxides chitrakar et al 2006 kumar et al 2019 wilfert et al 2015 this supports our finding that the sulfide removal capacity decreased at increasing sludge aging times furthermore the reaction of sulfide with ferric oxide species involves multiple steps in the first step chemical adsorption of hydrogen sulfide onto the ferric oxide surface takes place the chemi sorbed sulfide subsequently reacts with the ferric oxide thereby reducing it to soluble ferrous ions while the sulfide is oxidized to elemental sulfur afonso and stumm 1992 peiffer et al 1992 poulton 2003 poulton et al 2004 sun et al 2014 the kinetics of this so called sulfide induced reductive dissolution of iron process highly depends on the type of ferric oxides and is reported to be in the order of minutes for more reactive species such as amorphous akaganeite poulton 2003 poulton et al 2004 subsequently the formed fe2 rapidly reacts with any dissolved sulfide present in solution to form insoluble fes indeed analysis of the iron concentrations confirmed that the soluble iron concentrations were negligible throughout the duration of the experiments data not shown in addition sem eds analyses were conducted after reaction with sulfide in order to illustrate any change in morphology as well as to determine the elemental composition see supplementary information fig s4 shows that after the reaction with sulfide the surface of ferric dws significantly changed from a prevalent smooth to a very rough surface the eds elemental analyses conducted on the ferric dws particles after reaction with sulfide revealed that the iron to sulfur molar ratio fe s equalled to about 1 1 which implies that mackinawite was formed lan and butler 2014 during conventional fecl3 dosing the sewage ph has a significant impact on the iron dosing requirements to achieve the desired level of sulfide control especially around the circumneutral ph values often observed in sewers therefore we conducted an additional set of experiments in which we assessed the impact of the ph on the sulfide removal efficiency using fresh dws day 1 at a fe dws sulfide s dosing ratio of 0 5 1 fig 3 shows that the amount of sulfide removed decreased from 14 45 0 4 at ph 7 5 to 12 21 0 3 mg s l at ph 6 5 the latter equalled to theoretical sulfide removal capacities of 1 32 0 01 and 1 11 0 02 mmol sulfide s mmol fe for ph 7 5 and 6 5 respectively a significant p 0 05 reduction of 15 2 0 6 previous studies investigating the impact of the ph on sulfide precipitation in sewage using conventional iron salt dosing showed a more profound impact of the ph firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2008 for example nielsen et al 2008 found that at ph levels below 7 less than 40 of the iron salts dosed was used for sulfide removal while both the ph and sludge age affect sulfide removal efficiency our results show that the increase in crystallinity of akaganeite due to aging of the dws had a more profound impact finally an additional experiment at a dws fe sulfide s dosing ratio of 2 1 confirmed that complete sulfide removal can be achieved see supplementary fig s3 3 3 the impact of aging of dws on down stream phosphate removal in activated sludge tanks fig 4 a shows the p removal efficiency at different fe dws dosing ratios and aging times in aerated activated sludge p removal kinetics were lower for the fresh fe dws sludge the latter was most likely due to the lower fe p molar ratios and lower initial p concentration a similar observation was made in a study of gutierrez et al 2010 in which fecl3 dosed in sewers was fed to aerated activated sludge like in this study gutierrez et al 2010 importantly independent of the fe dws dosing ratios and aging time the overall phosphate removal capacity in aerated activated sludge remained constant p 0 05 see fig 4b lastly the calculated initial dissolved sulfide concentration was around 6 mg s l however dissolved sulfide was no longer detected for the remainder of the experiments due to rapid stripping and oxidation of the dissolved sulfide induced by the aeration process as such the initial presence of dissolved sulfide did not affect the p removal results under the prevalent aerobic conditions fig 4c shows the x ray diffraction patterns of fe dws at an aging time of 30 days before and after being subjected to aeration in the presence of active sludge a distinct change in morphology of the fe dws changed from a more crystalline phase to a completely amorphous phase can be observed as discussed in more detail in section 3 1 the reaction of sulfide with ferric oxides species is a surface controlled process that over time results in the formation of elemental sulfur and fes fes often referred as mackinawite is a poorly crystalline iron sulfide species moreover previous studies showed that oxidation of fe ii results in the formation of amorphous fe iii oxyhydroxides cornell and schwertmann 2003 poulton et al 2004 yuan et al 2019 thus upon aeration of sulfide loaded fe dws in the activated sludge amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide species would be formed and subsequently react with phosphate the latter strongly supports our finding that the p removal capacities was constant independent of the initial dws sludge age finally upon aeration p uptake would be accompanied with release and oxidation of sulfide to sulfate gutierrez et al 2010 the molar ratio between the amount of iron added and the phosphorus removed fe p was calculated to be 1 60 0 05 indicating that precipitation was the predominant removal mechanism interestingly this fe p molar ratio was very similar to our previous study in which virgin fecl3 was dosed to the same system i e fecl3 versus ferric dws rebosura et al 2018 it was beyond the scope of this study to fundamentally understand the mechanisms behind the transformation of crystalline akaganeite to an amorphous or poorly crystalline structure induced by aeration interestingly sun et al 2014 reported on the regeneration of purchased ferric hydroxide a commercial product of akaganeite through aeration sun et al 2014 in that study it was found that regeneration of spent ferric hydroxide through aeration resulted in the formation of amorphous ferric oxide particle albeit the underlying mechanisms behind this change in structure could not be elucidated 3 4 implications for practice in this study we investigated the impact of aging on the capacity of ferric dws as a sulfide control method in sewers to do so a series of coagulation tests were conducted to generate ferric dws using raw influent water from a full scale drinking water treatment plant the composition of the produced ferric dws was compared with analysis from 8 full scale wtps through an industry survey that latter confirmed that the ferric dws produced in this study was similar to that of ferric dws produced in full scale situations strongly supporting the practical relevance of our findings it was found that the iron oxide speciation remained constant with akaganeite Œ≤ feooh being the predominant iron oxide species present in the ferric dws independent of sludge aging time on the other hand the sludge aging time had a significant impact on the iron oxide morphology a clear change from a highly amorphous structure for freshly produced ferric dws day 1 to a more crystalline form after 30 days of storage time was observed importantly this change was accompanied with a significant decrease in sulfide removal capacity p 0 05 most likely due to a decrease in available surface sites for adsorption at increasing crystallinity kumar et al 2019 wilfert et al 2015 this finding is important with respect to real life implementation of ferric dws addition to sewers as a sulfide control method ideally fresh ferric dws produced at the drinking water treatment plant is directly fed into the surrounding sewer via a dedicated pipeline to ensure the highest sulfide removal capacity of the sludge thereby minimizing overall ferric dws requirements alternatively ferric dws can be stored on site and transported to nearby hotspot of sewer corrosion and odour complaints albeit with a decrease in sulfide removal capacity on a per unit fe basis at increasing storage times the reaction kinetics were not affected with most sulfide being removed within 10 minutes independent of the fe dws storage time considering typical hrts in sewers are in the order of several hours i e 2 6 hours the addition of fe dws is thus very suitable in a sewer context the practical relevance is further supported by the fact that discharge of drinking water sludge is adopted in various parts of the world for example about 9 and 25 of the total drinking water sludge produced in the usa and united kingdom is discharged into sewers keeley et al 2014 walsh 2009 however it is important to note that this often involves the discharge of aluminium dws and is done simply because it is the cheapest dws disposal route in these situations miyanoshita et al 2009 it has been found that aluminium dws removes phosphate when dosed to sewers makris et al 2004 another important observation is that aeration of less reactive crystalline ferric dws in the activated sludge tank of the downstream wwtps significantly changes the morphology from crystalline akaganeite to highly amorphous iron oxide species independent of the sludge aging time importantly the obtained p removal capacities were very similar to that obtained with fecl3 dosing i e 0 35 0 02 g p g fe in this study versus 0 36 0 01 g p g fe for fecl3 dosing respectively rebosura et al 2018 alum and ferric chloride are the most commonly used coagulants for the production of drinking water the process economics determined by the local coagulant price is the key factor determining the choice for water utilities between ferric chloride and alum rather than treatment performance with both coagulants meeting desired treatment performances in terms of removal of nom turbidity and colour volk et al 2000 the fact that fe dws can be beneficially reused in sewers for sulfide control may bring economic benefits for water utilities by reducing the costs for dws management and disposal costs it also reduces the chemical demand for wastewater treatment for chemical p removal in activated sludge tanks and sulfide control in digesters however there could also be increased costs in wastewater treatment such as to increased sludge handling and disposal costs and aeration costs in wastewater treatment plants due the increased solids and cod load due to dws dosing rebosura et al 2020 sun et al 2015 all of the above requires careful consideration and should be evaluated through long term field trials finally cross sectional collaboration between the water and wastewater utilities will be essential in order for creating awareness of the benefits that an integrated catchment wide coagulant dosing strategy can bring for both drinking water and wastewater systems 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the impact of aging of ferric rich drinking water sludge dws on its reactivity and capacity for sulfide removal in sewers and phosphate removal in downstream wastewater treatment plants the key findings of the work are akaganeite Œ≤ feooh was found to be the main iron oxide species in the dws independent of the sludge aging time the sludge aging time had a clear impact on the akaganeite morphology from a predominant poorly crystalline phase for fresh dws 8 0 1 crystallinity to a more crystalline phase 76 3 crystallinity at a sludge aging time of 30 days the increase of the fraction of crystalline akaganeite was associated with a significant decrease in the total sulfide removal capacity but did not affect the reaction kinetics with most sulfide being removed within the first 10 minutes sulfide driven reductive dissolution of crystalline akaganeite followed by aeration in downstream activated sludge tanks changed the akaganeite from a crystalline to a highly amorphous iron oxide species thereby

17689,recent studies demonstrated the practical potential of multiple beneficial reuse of ferric rich drinking water sludge ferric dws for sulfide and phosphate removal in wastewater applications in practice ferric dws is often stored on site for periods ranging from days to several weeks or even months which may affect its reuse potential through changes in iron speciation and morphology in this study we investigated for the first time the impact of ferric dws aging time on the iron speciation and morphology and its subsequent impact on its reactivity and overall sulfide and phosphate removal capacity a series of coagulation tests were conducted to generate ferric dws of a practically relevant composition by using raw influent water from a full scale drinking water treatment plant dwtp a comparison with ferric dws from 8 full scale dwtps confirmed the similitude the presence of akaganeite Œ≤ feooh was detected in ferric dws through xrd analyses independent of the dws storage time however the morphology of akaganeite changed over time from a predominant poorly crystalline phase in fresh dws 8 0 1 of total fe to a highly crystalline phase 76 3 of total fe at a sludge aging time of 30 days which was confirmed by means of rietveld refinement in xrd analyses n 3 subsequent batch tests showed that its sulfide removal capacity decreased significantly from 1 30 0 02 mmol s mmol fe day 1 to 0 60 0 01 day 30 a decrease of 54 p 0 05 the level of crystallinity however had no impact on sulfide removal kinetics most sulfide being removed within 10 minutes upon aeration of sulfide loaded ferric dws in activate sludge amorphous iron oxides species were formed independent of the initial dws crystallinity which resulted in efficient p removal at capacities similar to that of conventional fecl3 dosing keywords drinking water sludge resource recovery sulfide control phosphate removal coagulant reuse circular economy 1 introduction the majority of drinking water treatment plants dwtps rely on coagulation and flocculation for the removal of turbidity colour natural organic matter nom and pathogens from raw water bratby 2016 matilainen et al 2010 okour et al 2009 amongst the various coagulants used at dwtps the most commonly used are aluminium sulfate often refered to as alum and ferric salts i e either in the form of ferric sulfate or ferric chloride pikaar et al 2014 an unavoidable by product of coagulation flocculation is the generation of large amounts of drinking water sludge dws rich in aluminium or iron depending on the type of coagulant used babatunde and zhao 2007 as examples showing the enormous amounts produced dws generated in the united kingdom and the netherlands exceeds 130 000 and 29 700 wet tonnes respectively per year aquaminerals 2018 binnie et al 2018 management of dws incurs large costs and often comprises a substantial fraction of the operational expenditure of dwtps with landfilling often used as ultimate disposal route frias et al 2013 keeley et al 2016 therefore significant research efforts have been made focussing on coagulant recovery purification and direct reuse within the drinking water treatment process the benefits of such an approach are twofold as it results in a reduced chemical demand in terms of fresh coagulant as well as in a reduced dws production keeley et al 2014 keeley et al 2016 while the practical feasibility of various approaches including donnan dialysis prakash and sengupta 2003 liquid ion exchange sthapak et al 2008 and ion exchange with cation resin petruzzelli et al 2000 has been successfully demonstrated the relatively low coagulant prices make selective recovery and purification approaches economically challenging keeley et al 2012 moreover direct reuse within the drinking water treatment process comes with certain technical challenges as the purification process needs to adhere to stringent regulatory requirements in terms of product quality in order to safeguard human health keeley et al 2016 considering the above described limitations of direct reuse within the drinking water treatment process there is a general interest in low cost and low risk coagulant reuse approaches in this context the reuse of ferric based dws in a sewer context is of special interest iron salts are the most commonly used chemicals to combat hydrogen sulfide induced sewer corrosion a notorious and costly problem for utilities globally pikaar et al 2014 considering the high iron content of ferric based dws it has the potential to be reused in sewers for sulfide control indeed the effective reuse of ferric based dws for efficient sulfide control in laboratory scale rising main sewer reactors was demonstrated previously sun et al 2015 importantly in a very recent study the feasibility of the multiple reuse of iron rich dws for sulfide control in sewers followed by phosphate removal in wastewater treatment and sulfide control during anaerobic digestion at the downstream wastewater treatment plant wwtp was demonstrated through long term continuous experiments using a laboratory scale reactor system mimicking the urban wastewater system rebosura et al 2020 it was found that dws achieved similar treatment performance compared with fecl3 dosing in sewers in terms of sulfide control and phosphate removal rebosura et al 2020 rebosura et al 2018 while the above described studies clearly highlight the potential of beneficial reuse of ferric dws in sewers and downstream wwtps the detailed characterization and potential transformation of iron species prior to reuse was not investigated in detail such information is essential as iron chemistry is complex with potential transformations in iron speciation and morphology that may occur over time from more amorphous and reactive species that are thermodynamically unstable e g ferrihydrite and akaganeite to more crystalline and less reactive species such as goethite and hematite atkinson et al 1977 baltpurvins et al 1996 cornell et al 1989 the ultimate iron speciation and rate of transformation is complex and depends on several factors including solution ph the anions present in solution presence of oxygen and the storage temperature to our best knowledge no studies have been conducted investigating the aging of fe dws under the prevalent anaerobic conditions occurring in real life application as in a practical situation dws is often stored on site from days up to several weeks such transformation may thus occur with a potentially negative impact on the reuse ability of dws therefore this study aimed to determine the impact of the storage time on the physicochemical changes of ferric dws and subsequently its reactivity and capacity in sulfide removal in sewers and in phosphorus removal in the downstream wastewater treatment plant for this purpose a series of laboratory scale jar tests i e coagulation experiments were conducted to generate fe dws using real influent from a local water treatment plant in south east queensland and subsequently stored under anaerobic conditions to mimic the storage conditions of fe dws encountered in real life applications importantly to confirm that the produced ferric dws was of a similar composition with that obtained in real life applications we conducted an industry survey of ferric dws originating from 8 full scale dwtps with ferric chloride as coagulant in their treatment process the produced fe dws was characterized with xrd combined semi quantitative and sem eds analyses in order to investigate and quantify any changes in iron speciation and morphology in the dws at increasing sludge aging times over a period of 30 days the impact on sulfide removal in sewers and phosphate removal in activated sludge tanks was assessed through comprehensive batch sulfide and phosphate removal experiments using the produced ferric dws at different sludge aging times 2 materials and methods 2 1 coagulation experiments for the production of ferric dws coagulation experiments were conducted to produce fresh ferric dws in order to produce fe dws with a composition similar to that obtained in a practical situation surface water originating from a dam used as raw influent for a main water treatment plant in south east queensland australia was used in all coagulation experiments moreover ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o was added at a typical dosing rate commonly applied for coagulation of surface water finally an industry survey was conducted to confirm that the fe dws produced in this study is similar to that of fe dws from full scale plants see table 1 all coagulation experiments were conducted by means of jar tests using a flocculator velp scientific usa the jar tests were conducted at ambient temperatures 22 2 1 c following a standard coagulation protocol the ph of the raw influent used was 6 45 0 12 however due to the acidity of fecl3 the ph dropped to 4 1 0 3 after coagulant addition therefore prior to the jar tests simple titration experiments were performed to evaluate the volume of naoh as 1 solution needed to adjust the ph to the desired values of 5 5 0 1 at the dosing rates applied data not shown subsequent jar tests were conducted using 6 beakers filled with 1 5 l untreated surface water to which the amount of naoh determined by the titration experiments was added while the solution was mixed at a speed of 120rpm using overhead stirrers attached to the flocculator immediately afterwards the coagulant was added with rapid mixing continued for 60 seconds the initial rapid mixing to promote coagulation was followed by a period of slow mixing at 20 rpm for a duration of 20 minutes finally the solutions were allowed to settle for 30 minutes the first set of experiments was the coagulation tests using ferric chloride n 3 ferric chloride was dosed at a rate of 17 87 mg fe3 l equivalent to 86 mg l as fecl3 6h2o samples were taken for analyses of dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 specific uv absorbance suva natural organic matter nom total and soluble fe and p concentrations before and after jar testing in order to assess the treatment performance of the coagulation process the obtained water quality parameters are presented in table s1 the second set of experiments was conducted to generate sufficient fe dws for the detailed characterization and aging studies followed by sulfide and phosphate removal experiments at the end of each coagulation experiment the produced ferric dws was collected in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and immediately centrifuged at 3750 rpm for 20 minutes to produce thickened sludge with a dry solids content of 65 2 7 g l subsequently the headspace of the tubes containing the thickened ferric dws was sparged with n2 and immediately closed with a lid to ensure anaerobic conditions and stored at ambient temperatures i e 22 1 c over a period of 30 days 2 2 sludge characterization samples were taken at different sludge aging times from the fe dws storage container and stored at 18 c followed by subsequent freeze drying 50 c 0 1 millibar the freeze dried samples were ground to thin powder under anaerobic conditions and subsequently characterized through x ray diffraction xrd qualitative and semi quantitative and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds analyses xrd analyses was conducted using a d8 bruker diffractometer equipped with a Œ∏ 2Œ∏ goniometer and a position sensitive detector cu kŒ±1 radiation at Œª 1 55 √• reflections were collected within the 5 80o 2Œ∏ range with a step width of 0 02 and 1 2 seconds step of collecting time the resultant 2Œ∏ peaks were analysed with the xrd software diffrac eva version 4 and matched with the icdd pdf 4 2019 database semi quantitative xrd analyses i e rietveld refinements were conducted to evaluate the degree of crystallinity of the fe dws as a function of the sludge aging time as well as to determine the amount of different types of iron oxide in the fe dws using topas v 4 2 software for this purpose corundum Œ± al2o3 was used as an internal standard for all semi quantitative measurements following a procedure described previously salehin et al 2019 salehin et al 2020 the morphology and elemental composition of fe dws were characterized by means of sem eds analysis a high resolution scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6610 was used to obtain secondary electron micrographs at an applied accelerating voltage of 15 kv the sem was equipped with an x ray detector for elemental analysis oxford instruments 50 mm2 x max sdd x ray detector samples were places on stubs attached with high purity conductive double sided adhesive carbon tapes the samples were subsequently carbon coated using a quorum q150t turbo pumped sputter coater as a means to avoid charge build up and to improve secondary electrons signal 2 3 sulfide and phosphate removal experiments the sulfide and phosphate removal experiments were conducted using untreated sewage from a local pumping station wet well that only receives household wastewater in a residential zone brisbane queensland the sewage was collected on a weekly basis and immediately stored at 4 c the sulfide removal experiments were conducted under anaerobic conditions in gas tight perspextm cylindrical reactors with a working volume of 0 5 l whereas the phosphate removal experiments were conducted in a beaker with a working volume of 150 ml prior to use the sewage was filtered to remove any solids sparged with n2 for 30 minutes to ensure anaerobic conditions and heated up to ambient temperature at 22 1 1 c the sewage contained sulfate at concentrations of 8 5 0 8 mg s l sulfide at 2 9 0 4 mg s l phosphate at 6 1 0 6 mg po4 p l ammonium at 41 6 5 9 mg nh4 n l and a total and soluble cod at 397 2 28 3 and 245 7 10 8 mg cod l respectively prior to each experiment sulfide and phosphate were spiked to the sewage to reach an initial concentration of 20 mg l for both sulfide s and po4 p using standard reagent grade salts na2s 9h2o and kh2po4 from sigma aldrich the produced fe dws was mixed with deoxygenated demineralized water to make a slurry with a fe concentration of 2 7 g fe l the slurry was added to the reactor to reach fe concentrations ranging between 17 5 mg to 70 mg fe l depending on the experiment conducted the latter concentration equalled to fe s molar ratios of 0 5 1 and 2 1 respectively the ph levels were monitored online using a ph sensor probe ph 110 digital industrial ph orp sensor electrode all experiments were conducted in triplicate and at a constant ph of 7 1 0 1 unless specified otherwise the sulfide removal experiments were divided into 3 different sets the first set of experiments was conducted to determine the impact of sludge aging time on sulfide removal efficiency for this purpose fe dws subjected to different aging times i e 1 3 7 10 15 and 30 days were dosed to sewage at an fe s molar ratio of 0 5 1 this fe s dosing ratio was chosen to ensure sulfide is in excess so that the sulfide removal capacity of the ferric dws can be determined the second set of experiments was conducted to investigate the impact of different ph levels towards sulfide control in sewage within a range typically observed in sewage i e ph 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 for this purpose fresh fe dws day 1 was dosed to sewage at fe s molar ratio of 0 5 1 the third set of experiments was conducted to confirm that complete sulfide removal can be achieved by dosing fe dws day 1 at a fe s molar ratio of 2 1 each of the batch tests described above was conducted over a 1 hour period to ensure that stable dissolved sulfide concentrations were reached the fourth set of experiments was conducted to investigate the feasibility of regenerating in sewer dosed fe dws aiming to achieve efficient p removal in aerated activated sludge tanks of down stream wwtps for this purpose fe dws mixed sewage was fed to aerated activated sludge at a ratio of 1 1 v v a similar ratio used by gutierrez et al 2010 in which the regeneration of in sewer dosed fecl3 for p removal in downstream wwtps was investigated gutierrez et al 2010 the fe dws mixed sewage was generated using fe dws with three different sludge ages i e 1 15 and 30 days with sulfide and phosphate spiked sewage to reach initial concentrations of 20 mg l fe dws was added in slurry form to sewage at concentrations of 17 5 24 5 and 35 mg fe dws l equalling to fe s molar ratios of 0 5 1 0 7 1 and 1 1 for sludge ages of 1 15 and 30 days respectively the activated sludge was collected from a laboratory scale sequence batch reactor sbr fed with domestic sewage rebosura et al 2020 the domestic sewage contained phosphate and sulfate concentrations of 7 34 1 09 mg po4 p l and 17 90 5 07 mg so4 s l respectively after mixing the fe dws mixed sewage after sulfide removal with the activated sludge the initial molar fe p ratios during the fe dws regeneration experiments were 0 8 1 1 1 and 1 4 1 for sludge ages of 1 15 and 30 days respectively immediately after mixing the activated sludge with the fe dws mixed sewage liquid samples were taken for analysis of total fe po4 p and dissolved inorganic sulfur species i e sulfide sulfite thiosulfate and sulfate subsequently air was supplied by means of a gas frit over a 2 hour period to ensure that stable phosphate concentrations were reached liquid samples were taken at t 5 15 30 60 and 120 minutes and analysed for po4 p and dissolved inorganic sulfur species the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 chemical analyses ph and temperature were measured using a handheld meter sper scientific turbidity was measured using a portable turbidity meter tn400 watertest systems

solids ts and volatile solids vs were analysed according to standard methods apha 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 the impact of aging on the iron speciation and morphology of ferric dws fig 1 a shows the x ray diffraction patterns of the ferric dws at various aging times it can be seen that akaganeite Œ≤ feooh a chloride containing ferric oxyhydroxide mineral was the main iron oxide species present in the sludge the presence of chloride in akaganeite was confirmed through sem eds analyses fig s2 in addition to akaganeite the dws also contained between 4 10 of silica sio2 in the inorganic fraction a concentration within the range typically observed in drinking water sludge shahin et al 2019 while akaganeite was the predominant iron species present independent of the dws aging time fig 1a clearly shows the change in the morphology of akaganeite from a more amorphous day 1 to a more crystalline phase day 30 subsequent semi quantitative xrd revealed that crystalline akaganeite comprised 8 0 1 24 0 4 and 76 3 of the total fe content of the dws at a sludge age of 1 14 and 30 days respectively fig 1b our results show that natural organic matter nom i e humic and fulvic acid like substances was removed from raw water during the coagulation process and was captured within the fe dws matrix see supplementary information fig s1 it has been reported that nom is usually removed via adsorption at the anoxic oxic interfaces of iron oxyhydroxides chen et al 2014 kaiser and guggenberger 2000 liao et al 2017 riedel et al 2013 interestingly it has been reported that nom plays an important role in inducing akaganeite crystallization nesterova et al 2003 this suggests that the trapped nom within fe dws matrix may have promoted the gradual akaganeite crystallization via interstitial pores of the dws matrix further research is warranted to fundamentally understand the potential impact of nom on the aging of fe dws 3 2 impact of sludge aging on sulfide removal from sewage fig 2 a shows the impact of sludge aging time and thus the level of crystallinity of the fe dws on the sulfide removal efficiency at a constant dosing ratio of 0 5 fe dws sulfide s the figure shows that the sludge aging time had a significant impact on the sulfide removal efficiency with a decrease in dissolved sulfide removed from 13 66 0 41 to 6 34 0 51 mg s l at sludge ages of 1 and 30 days respectively p 0 05 the latter equalled to sulfide removal capacities of 1 30 0 02 mmol sulfide s mmol fe day 1 and 0 60 0 01 mmol sulfide s mmol fe day 30 see fig 2b a decrease of 53 7 1 5 interestingly in a recent study in which aged fe dws from a full scale drinking water treatment was added to a lab scale sewer reactor very similar sulfide removal capacities were observed i e 0 61 mmol sulfide s mmol fe or 1 64 mmol sulfide s mmol fe rebosura et al 2020 equally important the sulfide removal capacity obtained using fresh fe dws i e day 1 was only slightly less than the theoretical sulfide removal capacity for conventional fecl3 dosing see fig 2b previous studies reported on the increase in crystallinity of iron oxyhydroxide particles at higher floc ages dzombak and morel 1990 smith et al 2008 furthermore it was found that the increase in crystallinity was accompanied with a decrease in the surface area and active sites the latter may explain the observed decrease in sulfide removal in our experiments for further fundamental understanding as well as quantitative assessment of the particle size and any changes in surface area of the fe dws as a function of the sludge aging time bet surface area and particle size analysis as well as sequential extractions are warranted overall the results highlight a strong relation between the degree of akaganeite crystallinity and overall sulfide removal capacity albeit not affecting the fast reaction kinetics sulfide removal was found to be fast with most of the sulfide being removed within 10 minutes independent of the sludge aging time fig 2a it has been postulated that the reaction of sulfide with ferric oxide species is a surface controlled process canfield 1989 cornell et al 1989 since it is commonly accepted that amorphous iron oxides have higher surface areas than crystalline iron oxides chitrakar et al 2006 kumar et al 2019 wilfert et al 2015 this supports our finding that the sulfide removal capacity decreased at increasing sludge aging times furthermore the reaction of sulfide with ferric oxide species involves multiple steps in the first step chemical adsorption of hydrogen sulfide onto the ferric oxide surface takes place the chemi sorbed sulfide subsequently reacts with the ferric oxide thereby reducing it to soluble ferrous ions while the sulfide is oxidized to elemental sulfur afonso and stumm 1992 peiffer et al 1992 poulton 2003 poulton et al 2004 sun et al 2014 the kinetics of this so called sulfide induced reductive dissolution of iron process highly depends on the type of ferric oxides and is reported to be in the order of minutes for more reactive species such as amorphous akaganeite poulton 2003 poulton et al 2004 subsequently the formed fe2 rapidly reacts with any dissolved sulfide present in solution to form insoluble fes indeed analysis of the iron concentrations confirmed that the soluble iron concentrations were negligible throughout the duration of the experiments data not shown in addition sem eds analyses were conducted after reaction with sulfide in order to illustrate any change in morphology as well as to determine the elemental composition see supplementary information fig s4 shows that after the reaction with sulfide the surface of ferric dws significantly changed from a prevalent smooth to a very rough surface the eds elemental analyses conducted on the ferric dws particles after reaction with sulfide revealed that the iron to sulfur molar ratio fe s equalled to about 1 1 which implies that mackinawite was formed lan and butler 2014 during conventional fecl3 dosing the sewage ph has a significant impact on the iron dosing requirements to achieve the desired level of sulfide control especially around the circumneutral ph values often observed in sewers therefore we conducted an additional set of experiments in which we assessed the impact of the ph on the sulfide removal efficiency using fresh dws day 1 at a fe dws sulfide s dosing ratio of 0 5 1 fig 3 shows that the amount of sulfide removed decreased from 14 45 0 4 at ph 7 5 to 12 21 0 3 mg s l at ph 6 5 the latter equalled to theoretical sulfide removal capacities of 1 32 0 01 and 1 11 0 02 mmol sulfide s mmol fe for ph 7 5 and 6 5 respectively a significant p 0 05 reduction of 15 2 0 6 previous studies investigating the impact of the ph on sulfide precipitation in sewage using conventional iron salt dosing showed a more profound impact of the ph firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2008 for example nielsen et al 2008 found that at ph levels below 7 less than 40 of the iron salts dosed was used for sulfide removal while both the ph and sludge age affect sulfide removal efficiency our results show that the increase in crystallinity of akaganeite due to aging of the dws had a more profound impact finally an additional experiment at a dws fe sulfide s dosing ratio of 2 1 confirmed that complete sulfide removal can be achieved see supplementary fig s3 3 3 the impact of aging of dws on down stream phosphate removal in activated sludge tanks fig 4 a shows the p removal efficiency at different fe dws dosing ratios and aging times in aerated activated sludge p removal kinetics were lower for the fresh fe dws sludge the latter was most likely due to the lower fe p molar ratios and lower initial p concentration a similar observation was made in a study of gutierrez et al 2010 in which fecl3 dosed in sewers was fed to aerated activated sludge like in this study gutierrez et al 2010 importantly independent of the fe dws dosing ratios and aging time the overall phosphate removal capacity in aerated activated sludge remained constant p 0 05 see fig 4b lastly the calculated initial dissolved sulfide concentration was around 6 mg s l however dissolved sulfide was no longer detected for the remainder of the experiments due to rapid stripping and oxidation of the dissolved sulfide induced by the aeration process as such the initial presence of dissolved sulfide did not affect the p removal results under the prevalent aerobic conditions fig 4c shows the x ray diffraction patterns of fe dws at an aging time of 30 days before and after being subjected to aeration in the presence of active sludge a distinct change in morphology of the fe dws changed from a more crystalline phase to a completely amorphous phase can be observed as discussed in more detail in section 3 1 the reaction of sulfide with ferric oxides species is a surface controlled process that over time results in the formation of elemental sulfur and fes fes often referred as mackinawite is a poorly crystalline iron sulfide species moreover previous studies showed that oxidation of fe ii results in the formation of amorphous fe iii oxyhydroxides cornell and schwertmann 2003 poulton et al 2004 yuan et al 2019 thus upon aeration of sulfide loaded fe dws in the activated sludge amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide species would be formed and subsequently react with phosphate the latter strongly supports our finding that the p removal capacities was constant independent of the initial dws sludge age finally upon aeration p uptake would be accompanied with release and oxidation of sulfide to sulfate gutierrez et al 2010 the molar ratio between the amount of iron added and the phosphorus removed fe p was calculated to be 1 60 0 05 indicating that precipitation was the predominant removal mechanism interestingly this fe p molar ratio was very similar to our previous study in which virgin fecl3 was dosed to the same system i e fecl3 versus ferric dws rebosura et al 2018 it was beyond the scope of this study to fundamentally understand the mechanisms behind the transformation of crystalline akaganeite to an amorphous or poorly crystalline structure induced by aeration interestingly sun et al 2014 reported on the regeneration of purchased ferric hydroxide a commercial product of akaganeite through aeration sun et al 2014 in that study it was found that regeneration of spent ferric hydroxide through aeration resulted in the formation of amorphous ferric oxide particle albeit the underlying mechanisms behind this change in structure could not be elucidated 3 4 implications for practice in this study we investigated the impact of aging on the capacity of ferric dws as a sulfide control method in sewers to do so a series of coagulation tests were conducted to generate ferric dws using raw influent water from a full scale drinking water treatment plant the composition of the produced ferric dws was compared with analysis from 8 full scale wtps through an industry survey that latter confirmed that the ferric dws produced in this study was similar to that of ferric dws produced in full scale situations strongly supporting the practical relevance of our findings it was found that the iron oxide speciation remained constant with akaganeite Œ≤ feooh being the predominant iron oxide species present in the ferric dws independent of sludge aging time on the other hand the sludge aging time had a significant impact on the iron oxide morphology a clear change from a highly amorphous structure for freshly produced ferric dws day 1 to a more crystalline form after 30 days of storage time was observed importantly this change was accompanied with a significant decrease in sulfide removal capacity p 0 05 most likely due to a decrease in available surface sites for adsorption at increasing crystallinity kumar et al 2019 wilfert et al 2015 this finding is important with respect to real life implementation of ferric dws addition to sewers as a sulfide control method ideally fresh ferric dws produced at the drinking water treatment plant is directly fed into the surrounding sewer via a dedicated pipeline to ensure the highest sulfide removal capacity of the sludge thereby minimizing overall ferric dws requirements alternatively ferric dws can be stored on site and transported to nearby hotspot of sewer corrosion and odour complaints albeit with a decrease in sulfide removal capacity on a per unit fe basis at increasing storage times the reaction kinetics were not affected with most sulfide being removed within 10 minutes independent of the fe dws storage time considering typical hrts in sewers are in the order of several hours i e 2 6 hours the addition of fe dws is thus very suitable in a sewer context the practical relevance is further supported by the fact that discharge of drinking water sludge is adopted in various parts of the world for example about 9 and 25 of the total drinking water sludge produced in the usa and united kingdom is discharged into sewers keeley et al 2014 walsh 2009 however it is important to note that this often involves the discharge of aluminium dws and is done simply because it is the cheapest dws disposal route in these situations miyanoshita et al 2009 it has been found that aluminium dws removes phosphate when dosed to sewers makris et al 2004 another important observation is that aeration of less reactive crystalline ferric dws in the activated sludge tank of the downstream wwtps significantly changes the morphology from crystalline akaganeite to highly amorphous iron oxide species independent of the sludge aging time importantly the obtained p removal capacities were very similar to that obtained with fecl3 dosing i e 0 35 0 02 g p g fe in this study versus 0 36 0 01 g p g fe for fecl3 dosing respectively rebosura et al 2018 alum and ferric chloride are the most commonly used coagulants for the production of drinking water the process economics determined by the local coagulant price is the key factor determining the choice for water utilities between ferric chloride and alum rather than treatment performance with both coagulants meeting desired treatment performances in terms of removal of nom turbidity and colour volk et al 2000 the fact that fe dws can be beneficially reused in sewers for sulfide control may bring economic benefits for water utilities by reducing the costs for dws management and disposal costs it also reduces the chemical demand for wastewater treatment for chemical p removal in activated sludge tanks and sulfide control in digesters however there could also be increased costs in wastewater treatment such as to increased sludge handling and disposal costs and aeration costs in wastewater treatment plants due the increased solids and cod load due to dws dosing rebosura et al 2020 sun et al 2015 all of the above requires careful consideration and should be evaluated through long term field trials finally cross sectional collaboration between the water and wastewater utilities will be essential in order for creating awareness of the benefits that an integrated catchment wide coagulant dosing strategy can bring for both drinking water and wastewater systems 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the impact of aging of ferric rich drinking water sludge dws on its reactivity and capacity for sulfide removal in sewers and phosphate removal in downstream wastewater treatment plants the key findings of the work are akaganeite Œ≤ feooh was found to be the main iron oxide species in the dws independent of the sludge aging time the sludge aging time had a clear impact on the akaganeite morphology from a predominant poorly crystalline phase for fresh dws 8 0 1 crystallinity to a more crystalline phase 76 3 crystallinity at a sludge aging time of 30 days the increase of the fraction of crystalline akaganeite was associated with a significant decrease in the total sulfide removal capacity but did not affect the reaction kinetics with most sulfide being removed within the first 10 minutes sulfide driven reductive dissolution of crystalline akaganeite followed by aeration in downstream activated sludge tanks changed the akaganeite from a crystalline to a highly amorphous iron oxide species thereby
