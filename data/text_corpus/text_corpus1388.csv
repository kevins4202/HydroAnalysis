6940,the predictability of droughts in china was investigated using a series of statistical dynamic and hybrid models the results indicate that statistical models exhibit better skill in forecasting the standardized precipitation index in six months spi6 than dynamic models overall the ensemble streamflow prediction esp method and wavelet machine learning models outperform other statistical models in forecasting spi6 the hybrid model can improve the performance of spi6 forecast by combining statistical and dynamic models using bayesian model averaging bma method as for drought onset detection the low probability of detection pod low probability of false alarm pof and high pod high pof phenomena exist in statistical and dynamic models respectively on average less than 20 drought onsets can be detected in statistical models while less than 40 in dynamic models with more than 40 false alarms appearing in statistical models and more than 75 in dynamic models the hybrid model can slightly balance them resulting in a pod of 20 and a pof of 50 in spite of the low predictability some stations with high equitable threat score ets can be used in early drought warning under certain requirement these conclusions may help improving drought prediction at a local or national scale keywords drought onsets dynamic machine learning bma 1 introduction drought is an evolutionary phenomenon commonly beginning from precipitation deficits and can lead to tremendous socioeconomic losses such as the australia s millennium drought dijk et al 2013 the california drought griffin and anchukaitis 2014 and the sahel drought zeng 2003 china also suffered from severe drought in recent years qiu 2010 xin et al 2006 xu et al 2015 causing reduced production in agriculture and large losses in economic sectors in 2011 a total of 16 3 million hectares of crops were affected by droughts in china and the direct economic loss reached up to 15 8 billion dollars http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb zgshzhgb 201612 t20161222 776089 html therefore efficient early drought warnings and forecasts can be valuable for agricultural preparations and adaptations the existing drought forecasting methods include statistical methods aghakouchak 2014 belayneh et al 2014 dynamic models thober et al 2015 yoon et al 2012 climate teleconnections najafi et al 2012 and hybrid approaches madadgar et al 2016 however the comparison of drought prediction performances especially the question of how many droughts can be forecasted for a few months in advance has not been well studied hao et al 2017 van loon et al 2016 xu et al 2018 yuan and wood 2013 statistical forecasts of precipitation or drought indicators has commonly been used in the existing studies such as linear regression moreira et al 2008 autoregressive integrated moving average arima han et al 2010 support vector regression svr belayneh et al 2014 artificial neural network ann le et al 2017 and deep learning bai et al 2016 these linear or nonlinear methods take rainfall or drought relevant variables in previous months as inputs and the rainfall or drought indicators as outputs these models are data driven and do not rely on potential physical mechanism of climate interactions the simplicity and effectiveness in statistical models made it popular for drought prediction in global and local areas aghakouchak 2014 aghakouchak 2015 belayneh et al 2014 hao et al 2014 hao et al 2016 madadgar and moradkhani 2014 moreover some preprocessing techniques such as wavelet transformation belayneh et al 2014 and principal component analysis pca dehghani et al 2014 can improve drought forecasting accuracy to some degree dynamic models try to simulate the real atmosphere land ocean interaction and feedback from general circulation models gcms many dynamic models have been developed to forecast rainfall in the next days weeks or months in numerical weather or climate forecasts such as national centers for environmental prediction ncep coupled forecast system model version 2 cfsv2 beijing climate center climate system model 1 1 bcc csm1 1 european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf etc in recent years ensemble forecasting systems that incorporate numerous dynamic models have been developed such as the north american multi model ensemble nmme kirtman et al 2014 the subseasonal to seasonal s2s project and lead centre for long range forecast multi model ensemble lc lrfmme multi model ensembles have shown better performances and lower uncertainty relative to single dynamic models landman and beraki 2012 ma et al 2016 mo and lyon 2015 dynamic models have drawn much attention in the past decades and have made much progress in short term precipitation forecasts however the accuracy of monthly or seasonal drought forecasts in dynamic models remains low aghakouchak 2015 dehghani et al 2014 steinemann 2006 yoon et al 2012 some studies have demonstrated that combining statistical and dynamic models can improve drought forecasting accuracy madadgar et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in hybrid models how to assigning weights for statistical and dynamic parts is a major step madadgar et al 2016 used the expert advice ea algorithm to link statistical and dynamic components and the results indicated a better forecasting performance than nmme models in this study a combination of statistical and dynamic models was also integrated to form ensemble forecasts as demonstrated above there emerged a number of methods for predicting drought it is critically important to evaluate them to quantify the predictability of drought although the predictability may vary with methods data and location here we aimed to evaluate the predictability using state of the art models in china the predictability was investigated using a number of statistical dynamic climate teleconnection and hybrid models specifically the three critical questions will be explored 1 how many drought events can be forecasted for a few months in advance 2 how well do the statistical and dynamic models forecast droughts 3 whether the ensemble forecasting methods combining statistical and dynamic models can improve drought prediction performance the spatial distribution and implications of the predictability of droughts will be discussed it should be noted that the various models for drought forecasting are not directly comparable because the inputs are different in these models however it is acceptable that the comparisons were performed by a data driven method in this study in our previous work xu et al 2018 the drought predictability in china was examined using svr climate index models dynamic models and hybrid model this work can be regarded as its companion paper this study does have some differences versus previous experiments the data used in this study are station based observations instead of interpolated grids as in previous work more forecasting methods were incorporated such as benchmark models neural networks and wavelet machine learning models the experiment design and variable settings are more complete and reasonable moreover not only the prediction of the absolute value of drought indicator is performed but also the drought onsets are also forecasted drought onset prediction is particularly useful for early warning of agriculture this study can be considered as a further investigation of drought predictability in china compared to our previous work the rest of the study is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data section 3 introduces the forecasting techniques section 4 demonstrates the results and section 5 performs discussions section 6 concludes this study 2 study area and data the study area is the people s republic of china the taiwan province is not considered due to data availability fig 1 demonstrated the spatial pattern of precipitation in china and the locations of available rain gauge stations the yearly averaged precipitation is uneven with more precipitation in the south and less in the north long lasting and severe drought could happen in southern and northern china such as the yangtze river basin zhang et al 2015 and north china plain wang et al 2018 the variability of drought in china has to do with the anomaly of atmospheric circulation such as east asian summer monsoon easm yihui and chan 2005 and ei niño southern oscillation enso zhang et al 1999 the monthly rainfall observations from 313 rain gauge stations in china during 1960 2016 were obtained from china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn mul mon html the rainfall data selected in this study are complete continuous and quality checked ning et al 2016 xie et al 2007 zhai et al 2005 zhou et al 2008 the rain gauge stations form a relatively dense network and can generally reflect the drought patterns of china although there are fewer stations in western areas 3 methods the standardized precipitation index in six months spi6 was selected to represent drought severity spi6 mckee et al 1993 was computed by fitting the time series of accumulated precipitation using parametric or nonparametric distribution spi has been used in numerous literatures to characterize meteorological drought bonaccorso et al 2003 dabanlı et al 2017 hayes et al 1999 livada and assimakopoulos 2007 moreira et al 2006 sönmez et al 2005 the classification of spi6 includes mild drought 0 99 spi6 0 moderate drought 1 spi6 1 49 severe drought 1 99 spi6 1 50 and extreme drought 2 0 spi6 here spi6 was calculated using empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 to model the nonparametric distribution of precipitation as used in previous studies farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 hao et al 2014 1 a p t p t 5 p t 4 p t 3 p t 2 p t 1 p t 2 p a p t i 0 44 n 0 12 3 spi 6 t φ 1 p t where apt is the accumulated precipitation in time t pt is the monthly precipitation in month t p denotes the marginal probability i is the rank of precipitation data n is the sample size φ is the standard normal distribution function although spi is a one to one transformation of precipitation it can reflect meteorological and agricultural drought when consecutive precipitation deficiency happens for several months in this study a drought event is defined as the occurrence of spi6 less than a certain threshold for at least three continuous months here the threshold was set at 0 8 as adopted in some studies schwalm et al 2017 the probability of drought occurrence in the next three months given a non drought condition in the current month will be calculated the drought onset was considered as the first month in drought duration yuan and wood 2013 in this study teleconnection models dynamic forecasts statistical prediction and hybrid methods were verified and compared the detailed processing steps of each forecast will be elaborated in subsections table 1 listed a summary of the designed experiments in short a total of 23 models 15 statistical 7 dynamic and 1 hybrid models were used for spi6 forecasts at 1 8 month leads the forecasted spi6 can be used to recognize forecasted drought onset events and false alarms the drought onsets prediction is only evaluated for the subsequent one month for example given a non drought condition in march current month and a drought event in subsequent three months april to june the drought onset metrics are computed with regard to april since it is the beginning month of drought for the esp naïve and dynamic models the input variable is precipitation while the output spi is calculated based on the forecasted precipitation this is a two step process however the input for other models is already the spi variable and the output is generated directly the two different calculation ways may affect the results which is not going to be discussed in this study it is necessary that the seasonality handling should be the same for all the models inconsistence in seasonality handling would be unfair for comparisons therefore for consistency seasonality is no longer considered for all the models this is mainly due to two reasons one is the fact that spi6 is an accumulated index for six months and the seasonality may be weakened due to accumulation the other lies in the smaller data samples when considering seasonality which may cause under fitting for machine learning models the experiments conducted in this study did not cover all the statistical and dynamic models mentioned in the existing studies these models selected here are relatively typical in hydrometeorological time series forecasting belayneh et al 2014 fang et al 2017 harrigan et al 2018 papacharalampous et al 2017b they can generally reflect the capability of drought predictability to some degree other models may also be incorporated into the evaluation framework later 3 1 statistical models 3 1 1 support vector regression support vector machine svm vapnik 2013 is a machine learning method for classification and regression based on vc theory and the rule of structural risk minimization svm can solve nonlinear problems by incorporating kernel functions to map the input data to a high dimensional feature space which has been used in numerous drought applications liu et al 2017 tian et al 2018 assume the input data x r n a linear regression model is expressed as 4 f x w x b where is dot product w is the parameter vector and b denotes the constant term flatness in eq 4 means w should be as small as possible in ε svr ε is the margin of tolerance ignoring error less than it an optimal hyperplane can be selected by maximizing the margin subjecting to some constraints 5 min 1 2 w 2 s t y i w x i b ε w x i b y i ε eq 5 tries to find the minimal w at ε precision over the input space to overcome overfitting slack variables could be added into the equation 6 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 ι ξ i ξ i s t y i w x i b ε ξ i w x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where ξ i and ξ i are slack variables c represents the penalty factor controlling the tradeoff between minimal error and maximal margins eq 6 could be regarded as an optimization problem and can be solved by transforming it into its lagrange dual formulas the detailed deducing process could be referred to smola and schölkopf 2004 the solutions to eq 6 can be expressed as 7 f x i 1 ι a i a i x i x b where a i and a i are lagrange multipliers eq 7 is the linear svr for nonlinear regression kernel functions are used to map the input data to a high dimensional space where linear models can be applied the kernel function used in this study is radial basis function rbf 8 f x i 1 ι a i a i k x i x b 9 k rbf x z exp x z 2 2 σ 2 where σ is width parameter for drought prediction svm was employed in model 5 8 and 10 model 5 takes drought index in previous months as inputs without any other variable while model 8 considers climate indices as the only inputs the detailed large scale climate indices used in this study can be found in table s1 more information can be referred to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website https www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list the temporal resolution of the climate index data is monthly and the available data periods vary from one to another the 20 climate indices data from 1960 to 2016 were used in this study the most correlated climate indices with spi6 during the training period for each station at 1 4 month leads were demonstrated in fig s3 for illustration in model 8 four climate indices were selected as independent variables based on pcc between climate indices and target drought index during the training period instead of all indices model 10 incorporates temperature variable besides climate index and drought index in model 10 the two most correlated climate indices were selected based on pcc due to the limited training samples it should be noted that the svm models adopted here were all one step forecasts for all leads that is the forecasts were not performed step by step the data from 1960 to 2010 were chosen as the training period and 2011 2016 as the forecasting part the svr models were created using matlab r2016b https www mathworks com products new products release2016b html in the experiment some default values of c ε and σ parameters were used http ww2 mathworks cn help stats fitrsvm html s tid doc ta the box constraint parameter c was set as iqr y 1 349 where iqr y is the interquartile range of response variable y the ε tolerance was set as iqr y 1 349 which is an approximate estimation of standard deviation of y the kernel width parameter σ was determined by a heuristic subsampling procedure the same settings can also be found in recent studies peng and bai 2018 shine et al 2018 3 1 2 artificial neural network ann was found to be effective in solving nonlinear problems by incorporating a series of connected neural layers and nodes here the multilayer perceptron mlp network together with back propagation bp rumelhart et al 1986 algorithm was used the mlp network includes an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer a three layer mlp network can be explicitly kim and valdés 2003 written by 10 y k f o j 1 m w kj f h i 1 n w ji x i w jo w ko where wji is the weight in the hidden layer connecting ith neuron in the input layer and jth neuron in the hidden layer wjo is the bias for jth hidden neuron fh is the activation function of the hidden neuron wkj is the weight between the jth neuron in the hidden layer and kth neuron in the output layer wko is the bias for kth output neuron and fo is the activation function for the output neuron for drought prediction the ann model was used as a comparison of svm in model 6 9 and 11 the inputs and outputs in these models are the same with svm models and can be found in section 3 1 1 in our experiment one hidden layer was used and the hidden nodes were automatically selected in 5 10 by randomly sampling a 70 training dataset and 30 validation dataset for 10 times the most frequent hidden node number in the 10 samples was selected for forecasting the number of training epochs was set to 1000 all the ann models conducted in the study are one step forecasts and are implemented in matlab r2016b the data from 1960 to 2010 were chosen as the training period and 2011 2016 as the forecasting time 3 1 3 wavelet preprocessing wavelet analysis is a useful in modeling the variations of time and frequency in a time series it can decompose an original signal into shifted and scaled components by a scalable modulated window resulting in a multiresolution analysis several studies demonstrated considerable superiority in drought prediction by using wavelet transformation belayneh et al 2014 ramana et al 2013 the continuous wavelet transform of a signal can be expressed as 11 w a b 1 a x t ψ t b a d t where a is scale factor b denotes the translation parameter ψ is the mother wavelet and indicates complex conjugate cwt is complex and computationally expensive which is not convenient for practical use the discrete wavelet transform dwt is proposed nason and sachs 1999 to discretize the wavelet based on powers of two 12 ψ a b t 1 2 j ψ t k 2 j 2 j where j and k are parameters controlling scale and translation respectively wavelet transformation was incorporated into machine learning models to make comparisons with other models here the daubechies wavelet daubechies 1992 was employed as it shows good balance between parsimony and information richness specifically the daubechies wavelet of order 5 db5 at level 3 was adopted as shown in previous studies ramana et al 2013 the original spi6 series was decomposed into three detail series d 1 d 2 and d 3 and one approximate series a3 the decomposed four spi6 series in the last month and other variables were taken as inputs and the target spi6 series as outputs wavelet transformation coupled with svm or ann constitutes model 12 15 parameter settings of svm or ann here were consistent with sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 3 1 4 long short term memory network long short term memory network lstm was proposed hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 to solve the problem of blowing up or decaying error backflow in original recurrent neural networks rnns lstm incorporates a number of recurrently connected blocks to control the memory of each neural layer these memory blocks include three main units input output and forget gates gers et al 1999 the gates are considered as multiplicative units and can be activated or closed to control the error flow other variants of lstm may include additional states or cells zhou et al 2016 a schematic of a typical lstm memory block is shown in fig 2 the memory block in the lstm decides which information should be stored forgotten read or written to the network the forget gate layer ft determine which information should be kept by considering previous hidden state and current input and produce an output between 0 and 1 if the output is 0 the information is not retained and vice versa 13 f t σ w f h t 1 v f x t b f where ft is the forget gate state ht 1 is the hidden state at t 1 xt is the input at time t bf is the bias of the forget gate layer wf is the weight from previous hidden state to current hidden state vf is the weight from input to hidden state σ denotes the sigmoid function the input gate layer it controls which information needs to be updated and then the new information gt is added 14 i t σ w i h t 1 v i x t b i 15 g t tanh w g h t 1 v g x t b g 16 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where it is the hidden state at time t gt is the new information wi is the weight from hidden state to the input vi is the weight for the input bi is the bias for the input gate wg is the weight from hidden state to the new information vg is the weight from input to the new information bg is the bias of new information ct and ct 1 are the cell state vectors at time t and t 1 respectively finally the output gate layer ot generate the network output and the output is normalized between 1 and 1 by the previous updated cell state 17 o t σ w o h t 1 v o x t b o 18 h t o t tanh c t where ot is the output gate at time t wo is the weight from hidden state to the output vo is the weight from the input to output bo is the bias of output layer ht is the hidden state at time t the lstm has been found very useful in continuous time series processing such as word recognition and speech recognition some studies have investigated the feasibility of lstm in soil moisture modeling and agricultural applications fang et al 2017 while few of them applied it in drought forecasting here the performance of lstm in precipitation forecasts was examined mean absolute error was selected as the loss function and adam was used as the optimizer the number of hidden layers and batch size were determined by trial and error the candidate hidden layers we tested in this study are 10 50 and 100 the desirable number of hidden layers was set 50 and the batch size was set equaled to the length of the whole training dataset due to the small samples the number of training epochs was set to 1000 the lstm experiment was implemented on keras 2 1 2 and tensorflow 1 4 0 the data from 1960 to 2010 were chosen as the training period and 2011 2016 as the forecasting part 3 1 5 arfima model here the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima model box et al 2015 is also considered in our evaluation models since it is commonly used in hydrological time series forecasting papacharalampous et al 2017a papacharalampous et al 2017b sheng and chen 2009 let x 1 x 2 x 3 x t denotes a random variables and t is the time the autoregressive ar model with respect to x is expressed as 19 x t c i 1 p ϕ i x t i ε t where ϕ 1 ϕ p are autoregressive parameters c is a constant εt is the white noise term p denotes the order of the ar model the moving average ma model can be specified as 20 x t μ i 1 q θ i ε t i ε t where θ 1 θq are the moving average parameters μ is a constant εt is the white noise term q is the order of the ma model the ar and ma model can be generalized as autoregressive integrated moving average arima model 21 1 i 1 p ϕ i b i 1 b d x t u 1 i 1 q θ i b i ε t where 1 b d is a differencing operator d d is an integer order of arima model however a fractional order may be more useful in some cases therefore the arfima model can be defined based on binomial expansion with a real number d using gamma function 22 1 b d k 0 d k b k k 0 γ d 1 γ k 1 γ d 1 k b k eq 22 can be regarded as an extension of the arima model defined to represent stationary long memory models hosking 1981 therefore the general form of arima model i e the arfima model can be expressed as 23 φ b 1 b d x t θ b ε t where d 0 5 0 5 and 1 b d is the fractional differencing operator in model 3 table 1 the arfima model was used to forecast drought indicator and can serve as a baseline compared with machine learning methods the implementation of arfima model was based on the r packages arfima and forecast hyndman and khandakar 2007 as used in existing literatures papacharalampous et al 2018 tyralis and papacharalampous 2017 3 1 6 benchmark and linear models for benchmarking purposes two benchmark models and a linear regression model were included one benchmark model is based on the same monthly value of last year i e the naïve model 24 p t p t 12 for the other benchmark model the ensemble streamflow prediction esp method was adopted the basic concept of esp day 1985 is to predict the future status of a variable by simulating each potential scenario with historical data each year of historical data is a potential state of the future scenario esp is commonly regarded as a reference forecast hao et al 2014 harrigan et al 2018 the potential precipitation in the target month can be regarded as a set of monthly precipitation in previous years 25 p t p t 12 p t 24 p t 36 p t 12 n where n is historical time period considered when the precipitation in the target month is forecasted by benchmark models it is then be used to calculate spi6 for the naïve model the forecasted precipitation is combined with observed precipitation in previous months to calculate spi6 for the esp model each forecasted precipitation in the target month produces a potential drought index value these potential spi6 forecasts are averaged to generate the final prediction model 4 is a multivariate linear regression model the spi6 indices in previous six months are taken as inputs and the index in target month is the output parameters in the regression model are estimated by the ordinary least squares method the training period was set as 1960 2010 and the forecasting period was 2011 2016 all the statistical models except the arfima model are one step ahead forecasts for example spit 6 spit 5 spit 4 spit 3 spit 2 and spit 1 are used to generate the 1 month lead forecast for spit here the lead is a difference in time between an observation and a future observation hyndman and kostenko 2006 similarly spit 6 spit 5 spit 4 spit 3 spit 2 and spit 1 are used to generate the 2 month lead forecast for spit 1 the relationship between spit 6 spit 5 spit 4 spit 3 spit 2 spit 1 and spit 1 is directly modeled by statistical models this is similar till 8 month lead forecast however the multistep ahead forecast strategy was adopted in the arfima model for example an arfima model f p d q is determined by the training data spi1 spi2 spit 1 the trained model f p d q is then used to produce spit which is used to generate 1 month lead forecast for spit a new series is generated by combining the training data and the forecasted data spi1 spi2 spit 1 spit a 2 month lead forecast is produced using f p d q and the new series this process is conducted iteratively until the required lead although the multi step ahead forecasts produced by the arfima model are not directly comparable to the one step ahead forecasts produced by other statistical models it is also shown to see the forecasting performance in this study 3 2 dynamic models the nmme is a project under collaboration between multiple climate centers kirtman et al 2014 and can provide intraseasonal to seasonal to interannual isi climate forecasts globally incorporating a number of dynamic models have been found better in characterizing uncertainty versus a single model a total of 64 ensemble members in six dynamic models were used in this study table 2 the nmme can provide monthly forecasts of climate variables e g temperature and precipitation for 0 5 11 5 month leads at 1 degree resolution the 0 5 month lead means that a monthly forecast will be released in the middle of the month for example a precipitation forecast released in 15th june is the 0 5 month lead forecast for june because the released date leads june by 0 5 months for consistence with statistical models the 1 month lead forecast used in this study means the forecast was made at the beginning of the month for the next becker et al 2014 i e the 1 5 month lead in the original gcms it has been found useful in forecasting hydrometeorological variables using the nmme in existing studies barnston et al 2016 becker and van den dool 2016 shukla et al 2016 before using nmme predictions each model was bias corrected to stations by quantile mapping qm gudmundsson et al 2012 the empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs of observed and simulated precipitation in the training period were matched and the mapping relationship was then applied into the simulated precipitation in the forecasting period in model 16 21 precipitation forecasts from each dynamic model were evaluated model 20 is a simple ensemble mean of forecasted values in six dynamic models the available data in 7 dynamic models spanned from 1982 to 2016 to keep consistent with statistical models the training period is 1982 2010 and 2011 2016 as the forecasting period the hindcast period in the dynamic models indeed is the process of training model parameters it may not be appropriate to choose a time before 2010 as the forecasting period since the hindcast period ends in 2010 thus the training period was set as 1982 2010 and the forecasting period was set as 2011 2016 for the dynamic model 3 3 hybrid framework since the ensemble of multiple dynamic models showed better forecasting capability than a single dynamic model will the combination of a number of statistical and dynamic models outperform a single statistical or dynamic model especially in drought prediction in this case multiple heterogeneous models from different mechanisms will be integrated in model 23 a combination of model 1 21 was constructed model 22 was excluded from the hybrid framework as it is a linear weighting of other models and may cause a non positive problem bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical post processing method combining multiple models leamer 1978 it can reduce model uncertainty and improve out of sample predictive ability based on posterior probability assume δ is the target variable the posterior distribution of δ given data d is 26 p δ d k 1 n p δ m k d p m k d where m m 1 m 2 mn are alternative models p mk d is the posterior probability of model mk which can be expressed as 27 p m k d p d m k p m k i 1 n p d m i p m i where p mk is the prior probability p d mk is the marginal likelihood and is given by 28 p d m k p d θ i m i p θ i m i d θ i where θi is the parameters of model mi p θi mi is the prior probability of θi in model mi model 1 21 were weighted based on bma approach then a weighted sum of multiple alternative models was conducted to obtain the hybrid result the markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation gilks et al 1995 algorithm was employed to determine the posterior distribution of multiple models the implementation of bma model was based on bms package zeugner and feldkircher 2015 in r language the training period was set as 1982 2010 and the forecasting period was 2011 2016 3 4 evaluation metrics the assessment of forecasting performances are based on five statistical metrics pearson s correlation coefficient pcc root mean square error rmse probability of detection pod probability of false alarm pof and equitable threat score ets pcc and rmse can be used to evaluate how well the models forecast spi6 while pod pof and ets are capable of assessing drought onset prediction aghakouchak and mehran 2013 wilks 2011 yuan and wood 2013 the pcc measures the linear correlation between two variables x and y pcc equaling to 0 denotes no correlation while 1 represents total correlation the pcc is defined as follows 29 pc c x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the sample size xi and yi are individual samples x is the arithmetic mean of x and is given by x 1 n i 1 n x i y is the arithmetic mean of y and is given by y 1 n i 1 n y i the rmse is a measure of how close the predictions and true values or observations the formula can be expressed as 30 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n where yi is the true value or observation and ŷi is the forecasted value n is the sample size pod measures the probability of an event can be detected pof represents the probability of false alarm of an event ets takes hits misses and random chance into consideration in a score if the score falls below zero it indicates no skill in the model the perfect value of ets is 1 indicating that drought and non drought events are all correctly forecasted the specific formulas of these metrics were listed below 31 pod a a c 32 pof b a b 33 a random a b a c t 34 ets a a random a b c a random where a b and c are the number of events that are successfully forecasted false alarms and misses respectively t denotes the total events and is given as t a b c d where d is the number of the event not occurring after a forecast that it would not occur i e correct rejection arandom denotes the random hits adjusted for chance 4 results 4 1 performance of spi6 forecast for in sample period the hybrid model achieves the highest correlation fig s1 and the least error fig s2 in fitting spi6 at all leads statistical models generally show higher pcc and lower rmse than dynamic models of all the statistical models wsvm ct seems to be the best in simulating spi6 the pccs of benchmark models esp and naïve decrease quickly with increasing lead time and are close to 0 over 5 months in dynamic models nmme em exhibits better performance after averaging other dynamic models the individual dynamic models exhibit decreasing performance when the lead time increases with the correlation approaching 0 over 5 months for out of sample period the hybrid model shows the best performance in predicting spi6 for 1 5 month leads figs 3 and 4 dynamic models generally exhibit comparative correlation fig 3 but higher rmse fig 4 than statistical models with increasing lead the pcc drops and falls even below zero in some models fig 3 and the rmse increases fig 4 indicating large uncertainty models only considering climate signals svm c and ann c demonstrate little skill in forecasting spi6 the esp model has relatively high correlation for the first several leads while indicates no skill for more than 5 months wavelet preprocessing could improve the correlation in statistical models wsvm wsvm ct wann and wann ct even for more than 5 months lead fig 3 the rmses in the statistical models with wavelet transform also seem smaller than other machine learning models fig 4 4 2 performance of drought onset forecast in total 2939 drought onset events happened in 1982 2010 and 506 in 2011 2016 the in sample and out of sample capabilities of drought onset events forecast in 23 models were exhibited in fig 5 the benchmark models wavelet machine learning models dynamic models and the hybrid model can detect less than 40 drought onsets while other statistical models have little skill the in sample false alarms remain higher than 40 and some models reach up to 80 for out of sample period dynamic models model 16 22 generally own higher pod than statistical models fig 5c with a national average pod less than 40 however high false alarm ratios exist in almost all the models fig 5d the pof in dynamic models ranges between 75 and 90 while the pof in statistical models falls within 40 100 the hybrid model reduces the pof value relative to most of models fig 5d but also reduces the detection probability fig 5c for the ets metric the hybrid model shows the highest value both in in sample and out of sample periods fig 5e and f the out of sample ets value is 0 16 which is much low the benchmark models wavelet based models dynamic models and the hybrid model have higher ets values than other statistical models 4 3 performance in maps fig 6 presents in maps the probability of detected droughts overall the capabilities of detecting drought in all models remain low the pod in statistical models is generally lower than 40 and many stations own a pod below than 20 for dynamic models the majority of stations have a pod below 60 while the pod in some stations reaches up to 60 100 as for the hybrid model less than 40 droughts can be detected for most of the stations for early drought warning in agriculture a system should be capable of detecting drought with low false alarms fig 7 shows the pof of different models in statistical models like esp svm and svm ct the podfs are generally less than 20 although this seems promising the pods in these models are often low it can also be seen that false alarm ratio of the naïve model remain high in many stations while for dynamic models pofs in most of stations remain high reaching up to 60 100 although pods in dynamic models seem good for some stations in northeast china the pof is lower than 20 in dynamic models such as gfdla06 and nmme em it appears that statistical and dynamic models polarize on the forecast the low pod low pof phenomenon exists in some statistical models while the high pod high pof one shows in dynamic models the hybrid model attempts to balance them although the performance may not be satisfactory in the hybrid model the pod is slightly higher than statistical models but lower than dynamic models while the pof remains relatively higher than statistical models but lower than dynamic models as shown in fig 8 the naive model models with wavelet transformation dynamic models and the hybrid model exhibit higher ets than other models with an ets generally below 0 4 for some stations the ets may reach up to 0 6 1 0 stations with high ets have more potential in practical applications for drought warning the spatial variabilities of out of sample pccs and rmses for spi6 forecasts at 3 month lead were listed in figs 9 and 10 respectively the esp and the hybrid models have the strongest correlation with observations and the least forecasting error wavelet machine learning models also have higher correlation and less error than other models in many stations although dynamic models also have high correlation in some stations the rmse is large in central and southeast china climate index based models such as svm c and ann c have the poorest performance among all statistical models 4 4 weights in the hybrid model in the hybrid model model 1 21 are weighted by the bma method here the weights i e posterior expected values in the bma are given in fig 11 it may not be appropriate to call these weights because there are negative values but more suitable for regression parameters diks and vrugt 2010 raftery et al 1997 it can be seen that the weights are assigned to several models but not largely to a single model the coefficients in dynamic models are near zero at all leads indicating these models less important than other models 5 discussion 5 1 overall forecasting performance in spi6 forecast statistical and hybrid models have better skill than dynamic models in both in sample and out of sample periods statistical models aim at minimizing the error between observed and forecasted values intrinsically while dynamic models try to predict precipitation based on physical models the esp method shows high correlation with observed spi6 and low error for a few leads relying on mainly the initial condition the performance of esp is better than the naïve model suggesting that taking multiyear observations instead of recent single yearly value as future scenarios could be better the hybrid model combines statistical and dynamic models through weighting resulting in optimistic result in spi6 prediction the poor performance in svm c and ann c in forecasting spi6 figs 3 and 4 may be the nonsignificant connection between climate signals and accumulated precipitation in six months however incorporating climate indices did slightly improve the spi6 forecasting performance for longer lead e g 6 month but did not contribute much to the next several leads in our previous work xu et al 2018 the precipitation anomaly percentage pap index was used instead of spi6 spi6 is a statistical probability transformation of precipitation while pap relates directly to precipitation it is found that statistical models have better skill in forecasting spi6 and the hybrid model outperform statistical and dynamic models which is consistent with antecedent experiment however the climate index models svm c and ann c perform poorly in forecasting spi6 which is different from the good skill in forecasting pap the difference lies in that spi6 is an accumulated indicator for six months while pap is a monthly index climate indices may be effective predictors for monthly precipitation but may not be good signals for 6 month accumulated precipitation 5 2 forecasting capability of drought onsets dynamic models seem to be more promising in detecting drought onset than statistical models although the average pod remains low with high false alarms for practical applications in drought warning which requires high pod and low pof esp wavelet machine learning models dynamic models and hybrid model are the most promising alternatives with relatively high ets fig 5f the hybrid model makes a compromise between statistical and dynamic models it slightly improves out of sample pod relative to statistical models and reduces pof in dynamic models however the hybrid model does not obviously improve the predictive ability of drought onsets with respect to ets 5 3 spatial pattern there is no obviously geographical difference in the predictability of drought statistical models generally have low pods and low pofs while dynamic models have comparatively high pods and high pofs this can be attributed to the different mechanisms of statistical and dynamic models the low predictability of drought in both models can be improved with a better understanding of drought formation influencing factors and modeling 6 conclusion this study examined the performance of drought prediction using a series of statistical dynamic and hybrid models the results indicated that overall statistical models are more capable than dynamic models for spi6 prediction among all the statistical models the esp method and wavelet machine learning models show better performance than others in forecasting spi6 at 1 5 month leads by weighting statistical and dynamic models using bma approach the hybrid model outperforms both of them at 1 8 month leads the predictability of drought onset events varies with location and models on average less than 20 drought onset events can be detected for most of the statistical models while less than 40 for dynamic models among forecasted drought onsets more than 40 are false alarms for statistical models while more than 75 for dynamic models the hybrid model can slightly balance statistical and dynamic models with a pod of 20 and a pof of 50 the maps of forecasting capability also show the low pod low pof phenomenon in statistical models and high pod and high pof in dynamic models in spite of this some stations with high ets can be used in early drought warning under certain requirement this work provides preliminary insight of the role of statistical dynamic and hybrid models in spi6 and drought onset forecasts the predictability of drought onset was quantified using various models this may help improving drought prediction for researches in statistical and dynamic modeling drought is a complicated process driven by numerous factors such as atmospheric circulation natural variability and

6940,the predictability of droughts in china was investigated using a series of statistical dynamic and hybrid models the results indicate that statistical models exhibit better skill in forecasting the standardized precipitation index in six months spi6 than dynamic models overall the ensemble streamflow prediction esp method and wavelet machine learning models outperform other statistical models in forecasting spi6 the hybrid model can improve the performance of spi6 forecast by combining statistical and dynamic models using bayesian model averaging bma method as for drought onset detection the low probability of detection pod low probability of false alarm pof and high pod high pof phenomena exist in statistical and dynamic models respectively on average less than 20 drought onsets can be detected in statistical models while less than 40 in dynamic models with more than 40 false alarms appearing in statistical models and more than 75 in dynamic models the hybrid model can slightly balance them resulting in a pod of 20 and a pof of 50 in spite of the low predictability some stations with high equitable threat score ets can be used in early drought warning under certain requirement these conclusions may help improving drought prediction at a local or national scale keywords drought onsets dynamic machine learning bma 1 introduction drought is an evolutionary phenomenon commonly beginning from precipitation deficits and can lead to tremendous socioeconomic losses such as the australia s millennium drought dijk et al 2013 the california drought griffin and anchukaitis 2014 and the sahel drought zeng 2003 china also suffered from severe drought in recent years qiu 2010 xin et al 2006 xu et al 2015 causing reduced production in agriculture and large losses in economic sectors in 2011 a total of 16 3 million hectares of crops were affected by droughts in china and the direct economic loss reached up to 15 8 billion dollars http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb zgshzhgb 201612 t20161222 776089 html therefore efficient early drought warnings and forecasts can be valuable for agricultural preparations and adaptations the existing drought forecasting methods include statistical methods aghakouchak 2014 belayneh et al 2014 dynamic models thober et al 2015 yoon et al 2012 climate teleconnections najafi et al 2012 and hybrid approaches madadgar et al 2016 however the comparison of drought prediction performances especially the question of how many droughts can be forecasted for a few months in advance has not been well studied hao et al 2017 van loon et al 2016 xu et al 2018 yuan and wood 2013 statistical forecasts of precipitation or drought indicators has commonly been used in the existing studies such as linear regression moreira et al 2008 autoregressive integrated moving average arima han et al 2010 support vector regression svr belayneh et al 2014 artificial neural network ann le et al 2017 and deep learning bai et al 2016 these linear or nonlinear methods take rainfall or drought relevant variables in previous months as inputs and the rainfall or drought indicators as outputs these models are data driven and do not rely on potential physical mechanism of climate interactions the simplicity and effectiveness in statistical models made it popular for drought prediction in global and local areas aghakouchak 2014 aghakouchak 2015 belayneh et al 2014 hao et al 2014 hao et al 2016 madadgar and moradkhani 2014 moreover some preprocessing techniques such as wavelet transformation belayneh et al 2014 and principal component analysis pca dehghani et al 2014 can improve drought forecasting accuracy to some degree dynamic models try to simulate the real atmosphere land ocean interaction and feedback from general circulation models gcms many dynamic models have been developed to forecast rainfall in the next days weeks or months in numerical weather or climate forecasts such as national centers for environmental prediction ncep coupled forecast system model version 2 cfsv2 beijing climate center climate system model 1 1 bcc csm1 1 european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf etc in recent years ensemble forecasting systems that incorporate numerous dynamic models have been developed such as the north american multi model ensemble nmme kirtman et al 2014 the subseasonal to seasonal s2s project and lead centre for long range forecast multi model ensemble lc lrfmme multi model ensembles have shown better performances and lower uncertainty relative to single dynamic models landman and beraki 2012 ma et al 2016 mo and lyon 2015 dynamic models have drawn much attention in the past decades and have made much progress in short term precipitation forecasts however the accuracy of monthly or seasonal drought forecasts in dynamic models remains low aghakouchak 2015 dehghani et al 2014 steinemann 2006 yoon et al 2012 some studies have demonstrated that combining statistical and dynamic models can improve drought forecasting accuracy madadgar et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in hybrid models how to assigning weights for statistical and dynamic parts is a major step madadgar et al 2016 used the expert advice ea algorithm to link statistical and dynamic components and the results indicated a better forecasting performance than nmme models in this study a combination of statistical and dynamic models was also integrated to form ensemble forecasts as demonstrated above there emerged a number of methods for predicting drought it is critically important to evaluate them to quantify the predictability of drought although the predictability may vary with methods data and location here we aimed to evaluate the predictability using state of the art models in china the predictability was investigated using a number of statistical dynamic climate teleconnection and hybrid models specifically the three critical questions will be explored 1 how many drought events can be forecasted for a few months in advance 2 how well do the statistical and dynamic models forecast droughts 3 whether the ensemble forecasting methods combining statistical and dynamic models can improve drought prediction performance the spatial distribution and implications of the predictability of droughts will be discussed it should be noted that the various models for drought forecasting are not directly comparable because the inputs are different in these models however it is acceptable that the comparisons were performed by a data driven method in this study in our previous work xu et al 2018 the drought predictability in china was examined using svr climate index models dynamic models and hybrid model this work can be regarded as its companion paper this study does have some differences versus previous experiments the data used in this study are station based observations instead of interpolated grids as in previous work more forecasting methods were incorporated such as benchmark models neural networks and wavelet machine learning models the experiment design and variable settings are more complete and reasonable moreover not only the prediction of the absolute value of drought indicator is performed but also the drought onsets are also forecasted drought onset prediction is particularly useful for early warning of agriculture this study can be considered as a further investigation of drought predictability in china compared to our previous work the rest of the study is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data section 3 introduces the forecasting techniques section 4 demonstrates the results and section 5 performs discussions section 6 concludes this study 2 study area and data the study area is the people s republic of china the taiwan province is not considered due to data availability fig 1 demonstrated the spatial pattern of precipitation in china and the locations of available rain gauge stations the yearly averaged precipitation is uneven with more precipitation in the south and less in the north long lasting and severe drought could happen in southern and northern china such as the yangtze river basin zhang et al 2015 and north china plain wang et al 2018 the variability of drought in china has to do with the anomaly of atmospheric circulation such as east asian summer monsoon easm yihui and chan 2005 and ei niño southern oscillation enso zhang et al 1999 the monthly rainfall observations from 313 rain gauge stations in china during 1960 2016 were obtained from china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn mul mon html the rainfall data selected in this study are complete continuous and quality checked ning et al 2016 xie et al 2007 zhai et al 2005 zhou et al 2008 the rain gauge stations form a relatively dense network and can generally reflect the drought patterns of china although there are fewer stations in western areas 3 methods the standardized precipitation index in six months spi6 was selected to represent drought severity spi6 mckee et al 1993 was computed by fitting the time series of accumulated precipitation using parametric or nonparametric distribution spi has been used in numerous literatures to characterize meteorological drought bonaccorso et al 2003 dabanlı et al 2017 hayes et al 1999 livada and assimakopoulos 2007 moreira et al 2006 sönmez et al 2005 the classification of spi6 includes mild drought 0 99 spi6 0 moderate drought 1 spi6 1 49 severe drought 1 99 spi6 1 50 and extreme drought 2 0 spi6 here spi6 was calculated using empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 to model the nonparametric distribution of precipitation as used in previous studies farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 hao et al 2014 1 a p t p t 5 p t 4 p t 3 p t 2 p t 1 p t 2 p a p t i 0 44 n 0 12 3 spi 6 t φ 1 p t where apt is the accumulated precipitation in time t pt is the monthly precipitation in month t p denotes the marginal probability i is the rank of precipitation data n is the sample size φ is the standard normal distribution function although spi is a one to one transformation of precipitation it can reflect meteorological and agricultural drought when consecutive precipitation deficiency happens for several months in this study a drought event is defined as the occurrence of spi6 less than a certain threshold for at least three continuous months here the threshold was set at 0 8 as adopted in some studies schwalm et al 2017 the probability of drought occurrence in the next three months given a non drought condition in the current month will be calculated the drought onset was considered as the first month in drought duration yuan and wood 2013 in this study teleconnection models dynamic forecasts statistical prediction and hybrid methods were verified and compared the detailed processing steps of each forecast will be elaborated in subsections table 1 listed a summary of the designed experiments in short a total of 23 models 15 statistical 7 dynamic and 1 hybrid models were used for spi6 forecasts at 1 8 month leads the forecasted spi6 can be used to recognize forecasted drought onset events and false alarms the drought onsets prediction is only evaluated for the subsequent one month for example given a non drought condition in march current month and a drought event in subsequent three months april to june the drought onset metrics are computed with regard to april since it is the beginning month of drought for the esp naïve and dynamic models the input variable is precipitation while the output spi is calculated based on the forecasted precipitation this is a two step process however the input for other models is already the spi variable and the output is generated directly the two different calculation ways may affect the results which is not going to be discussed in this study it is necessary that the seasonality handling should be the same for all the models inconsistence in seasonality handling would be unfair for comparisons therefore for consistency seasonality is no longer considered for all the models this is mainly due to two reasons one is the fact that spi6 is an accumulated index for six months and the seasonality may be weakened due to accumulation the other lies in the smaller data samples when considering seasonality which may cause under fitting for machine learning models the experiments conducted in this study did not cover all the statistical and dynamic models mentioned in the existing studies these models selected here are relatively typical in hydrometeorological time series forecasting belayneh et al 2014 fang et al 2017 harrigan et al 2018 papacharalampous et al 2017b they can generally reflect the capability of drought predictability to some degree other models may also be incorporated into the evaluation framework later 3 1 statistical models 3 1 1 support vector regression support vector machine svm vapnik 2013 is a machine learning method for classification and regression based on vc theory and the rule of structural risk minimization svm can solve nonlinear problems by incorporating kernel functions to map the input data to a high dimensional feature space which has been used in numerous drought applications liu et al 2017 tian et al 2018 assume the input data x r n a linear regression model is expressed as 4 f x w x b where is dot product w is the parameter vector and b denotes the constant term flatness in eq 4 means w should be as small as possible in ε svr ε is the margin of tolerance ignoring error less than it an optimal hyperplane can be selected by maximizing the margin subjecting to some constraints 5 min 1 2 w 2 s t y i w x i b ε

an optimization problem and can be solved by transforming it into its lagrange dual formulas the detailed deducing process could be referred to smola and schölkopf 2004 the solutions to eq 6 can be expressed as 7 f x i 1 ι a i a i x i x b where a i and a i are lagrange multipliers eq 7 is the linear svr for nonlinear regression kernel functions are used to map the input data to a high dimensional space where linear models can be applied the kernel function used in this study is radial basis function rbf 8 f x i 1 ι a i a i k x i x b 9 k rbf x z exp x z 2 2 σ 2 where σ is width parameter for drought prediction svm was employed in model 5 8 and 10 model 5 takes drought index in previous months as inputs without any other variable while model 8 considers climate indices as the only inputs the detailed large scale climate indices used in this study can be found in table s1 more information can be referred to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website https www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list the temporal resolution of the climate index data is monthly and the available data periods vary from one to another the 20 climate indices data from 1960 to 2016 were used in this study the most correlated climate indices with spi6 during the training period for each station at 1 4 month leads were demonstrated in fig s3 for illustration in model 8 four climate indices were selected as independent variables based on pcc between climate indices and target drought index during the training period instead of all indices model 10 incorporates temperature variable besides climate index and drought index in model 10 the two most correlated climate indices were selected based on pcc due to the limited training samples it should be noted that the svm models adopted here were all one step forecasts for all leads that is the forecasts were not performed step by step the data from 1960 to 2010 were chosen as the training period and 2011 2016 as the forecasting part the svr models were created using matlab r2016b https www mathworks com products new products release2016b html in the experiment some default values of c ε and σ parameters were used http ww2 mathworks cn help stats fitrsvm html s tid doc ta the box constraint parameter c was set as iqr y 1 349 where iqr y is the interquartile range of response variable y the ε tolerance was set as iqr y 1 349 which is an approximate estimation of standard deviation of y the kernel width parameter σ was determined by a heuristic subsampling procedure the same settings can also be found in recent studies peng and bai 2018 shine et al 2018 3 1 2 artificial neural network ann was found to be effective in solving nonlinear problems by incorporating a series of connected neural layers and nodes here the multilayer perceptron mlp network together with back propagation bp rumelhart et al 1986 algorithm was used the mlp network includes an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer a three layer mlp network can be explicitly kim and valdés 2003 written by 10 y k f o j 1 m w kj f h i 1 n w ji x i w jo w ko where wji is the weight in the hidden layer connecting ith neuron in the input layer and jth neuron in the hidden layer wjo is the bias for jth hidden neuron fh is the activation function of the hidden neuron wkj is the weight between the jth neuron in the hidden layer and kth neuron in the output layer wko is the bias for kth output neuron and fo is the activation function for the output neuron for drought prediction the ann model was used as a comparison of svm in model 6 9 and 11 the inputs and outputs in these models are the same with svm models and can be found in section 3 1 1 in our experiment one hidden layer was used and the hidden nodes were automatically selected in 5 10 by randomly sampling a 70 training dataset and 30 validation dataset for 10 times the most frequent hidden node number in the 10 samples was selected for forecasting the number of training epochs was set to 1000 all the ann models conducted in the study are one step forecasts and are implemented in matlab r2016b the data from 1960 to 2010 were chosen as the training period and 2011 2016 as the forecasting time 3 1 3 wavelet preprocessing wavelet analysis is a useful in modeling the variations of time and frequency in a time series it can decompose an original signal into shifted and scaled components by a scalable modulated window resulting in a multiresolution analysis several studies demonstrated considerable superiority in drought prediction by using wavelet transformation belayneh et al 2014 ramana et al 2013 the continuous wavelet transform of a signal can be expressed as 11 w a b 1 a x t ψ t b a d t where a is scale factor b denotes the translation parameter ψ is the mother wavelet and indicates complex conjugate cwt is complex and computationally expensive which is not convenient for practical use the discrete wavelet transform dwt is proposed nason and sachs 1999 to discretize the wavelet based on powers of two 12 ψ a b t 1 2 j ψ t k 2 j 2 j where j and k are parameters controlling scale and translation respectively wavelet transformation was incorporated into machine learning models to make comparisons with other models here the daubechies wavelet daubechies 1992 was employed as it shows good balance between parsimony and information richness specifically the daubechies wavelet of order 5 db5 at level 3 was adopted as shown in previous studies ramana et al 2013 the original spi6 series was decomposed into three detail series d 1 d 2 and d 3 and one approximate series a3 the decomposed four spi6 series in the last month and other variables were taken as inputs and the target spi6 series as outputs wavelet transformation coupled with svm or ann constitutes model 12 15 parameter settings of svm or ann here were consistent with sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 3 1 4 long short term memory network long short term memory network lstm was proposed hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 to solve the problem of blowing up or decaying error backflow in original recurrent neural networks rnns lstm incorporates a number of recurrently connected blocks to control the memory of each neural layer these memory blocks include three main units input output and forget gates gers et al 1999 the gates are considered as multiplicative units and can be activated or closed to control the error flow other variants of lstm may include additional states or cells zhou et al 2016 a schematic of a typical lstm memory block is shown in fig 2 the memory block in the lstm decides which information should be stored forgotten read or written to the network the forget gate layer ft determine which information should be kept by considering previous hidden state and current input and produce an output between 0 and 1 if the output is 0 the information is not retained and vice versa 13 f t σ w f h t 1 v f x t b f where ft is the forget gate state ht 1 is the hidden state at t 1 xt is the input at time t bf is the bias of the forget gate layer wf is the weight from previous hidden state to current hidden state vf is the weight from input to hidden state σ denotes the sigmoid function the input gate layer it controls which information needs to be updated and then the new information gt is added 14 i t σ w i h t 1 v i x t b i 15 g t tanh w g h t 1 v g x t b g 16 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where it is the hidden state at time t gt is the new information wi is the weight from hidden state

bias of new information ct and ct 1 are the cell state vectors at time t and t 1 respectively finally the output gate layer ot generate the network output and the output is normalized between 1 and 1 by the previous updated cell state 17 o t σ w o h t 1 v o x t b o 18 h t o t tanh c t where ot is the output gate at time t wo is the weight from hidden state to the output vo is the weight from the input to output bo is the bias of output layer ht is the hidden state at time t the lstm has been found very useful in continuous time series processing such as word recognition and speech recognition some studies have investigated the feasibility of lstm in soil moisture modeling and agricultural applications fang et al 2017 while few of them applied it in drought forecasting here the performance of lstm in precipitation forecasts was examined mean absolute error was selected as the loss function and adam was used as the optimizer the number of hidden layers and batch size were determined by trial and error the candidate hidden layers we tested in this study are 10 50 and 100 the desirable number of hidden layers was set 50 and the batch size was set equaled to the length of the whole training dataset due to the small samples the number of training epochs was set to 1000 the lstm experiment was implemented on keras 2 1 2 and tensorflow 1 4 0 the data from 1960 to 2010 were chosen as the training period and 2011 2016 as the forecasting part 3 1 5 arfima model here the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima model box et al 2015 is also considered in our evaluation models since it is commonly used in hydrological time series forecasting papacharalampous et al 2017a papacharalampous et al 2017b sheng and chen 2009 let x 1 x 2 x 3 x t denotes a random variables and t is the time the autoregressive ar model with respect to x is expressed as 19 x t c i 1 p ϕ i x t i ε t where ϕ 1 ϕ p are autoregressive parameters c is a constant εt is the white noise term p denotes the order of the ar model the moving average ma model can be specified as 20 x t μ i 1 q θ i ε t i ε t where θ 1 θq are the moving average parameters μ is a constant εt is the white noise term q is the order of the ma model the ar and ma model can be generalized as autoregressive integrated moving average arima model 21 1 i 1 p ϕ i b i 1 b d x t u 1 i 1 q θ i b i ε t where 1 b d is a differencing operator d d is an integer order of arima model however a fractional order may be more useful in some cases therefore the arfima model can be defined based on binomial expansion with a real number d using gamma function 22 1 b d k 0 d k b k k 0 γ d 1 γ k 1 γ d 1 k b k eq 22 can be regarded as an extension of the arima model defined to represent stationary long memory models hosking 1981 therefore the general form of arima model i e the arfima model can be expressed as 23 φ b 1 b d x t θ b ε t where d 0 5 0 5 and 1 b d is the fractional differencing operator in model 3 table 1 the arfima model was used to forecast drought indicator and can serve as a baseline compared with machine learning methods the implementation of arfima model was based on the r packages arfima and forecast hyndman and khandakar 2007 as used in existing literatures papacharalampous et al 2018 tyralis and papacharalampous 2017 3 1 6 benchmark and linear models for benchmarking purposes two benchmark models and a linear regression model were included one benchmark model is based on the same monthly value of last year i e the naïve model 24 p t p t 12 for the other benchmark model the ensemble streamflow prediction esp method was adopted the basic concept of esp day 1985 is to predict the future status of a variable by simulating each potential scenario with historical data each year of historical data is a potential state of the future scenario esp is commonly regarded as a reference forecast hao et al 2014 harrigan et al 2018 the potential precipitation in the target month can be regarded as a set of monthly precipitation in previous years 25 p t p t 12 p t 24 p t 36 p t 12 n where n is historical time period considered when the precipitation in the target month is forecasted by benchmark models it is then be used to calculate spi6 for the naïve model the forecasted precipitation is combined with observed precipitation in previous months to calculate spi6 for the esp model each forecasted precipitation in the target month produces a potential drought index value these potential spi6 forecasts are averaged to generate the final prediction model 4 is a multivariate linear regression model the spi6 indices in previous six months are taken as inputs and the index in target month is the output parameters in the regression model are estimated by the ordinary least squares method the training period was set as 1960 2010 and the forecasting period was 2011 2016 all the statistical models except the arfima model are one step ahead forecasts for example spit 6 spit 5 spit 4 spit 3 spit 2 and spit 1 are used to generate the 1 month lead forecast for spit here the lead is a difference in time between an observation and a future observation hyndman and kostenko 2006 similarly spit 6 spit 5 spit 4 spit 3 spit 2 and spit 1 are used to generate the 2 month lead forecast for spit 1 the relationship between spit 6 spit 5 spit 4 spit 3 spit 2 spit 1 and spit 1 is directly modeled by statistical models this is similar till 8 month lead forecast however the multistep ahead forecast strategy was adopted in the arfima model for example an arfima model f p d q is determined by the training data spi1 spi2 spit 1 the trained model f p d q is then used to produce spit which is used to generate 1 month lead forecast for spit a new series is generated by combining the training data and the forecasted data spi1 spi2 spit 1 spit a 2 month lead forecast is produced using f p d q and the new series this process is conducted iteratively until the required lead although the multi step ahead forecasts produced by the arfima model are not directly comparable to the one step ahead forecasts produced by other statistical models it is also shown to see the forecasting performance in this study 3 2 dynamic models the nmme is a project under collaboration between multiple climate centers kirtman et al 2014 and can provide intraseasonal to seasonal to interannual isi climate forecasts globally incorporating a number of dynamic models have been found better in characterizing uncertainty versus a single model a total of 64 ensemble members in six dynamic models were used in this study table 2 the nmme can provide monthly forecasts of climate variables e g temperature and precipitation for 0 5 11 5 month leads at 1 degree resolution the 0 5 month lead means that a monthly forecast will be released in the middle of the month for example a precipitation forecast released in 15th june is the 0 5 month lead forecast for june because the released date leads june by 0 5 months for consistence with statistical models the 1 month lead forecast used in this study means the forecast was made at the beginning of the month for the next becker et al 2014 i e the 1 5 month lead in the original gcms it has been found useful in forecasting hydrometeorological variables using the nmme in existing studies barnston et al 2016 becker and van den dool 2016 shukla et al 2016 before using nmme predictions each model was bias corrected to stations by quantile mapping qm gudmundsson et al 2012 the empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs of observed and simulated precipitation in the training period were matched and the mapping relationship was then applied into the simulated precipitation in the forecasting period in model 16 21 precipitation forecasts from each dynamic model were evaluated model 20 is a simple ensemble mean of forecasted values in six dynamic models the available data in 7 dynamic models spanned from 1982 to 2016 to keep consistent with statistical models the training period is 1982 2010 and 2011 2016 as the forecasting period the hindcast period in the dynamic models indeed is the process of training model parameters it may not be appropriate to choose a time before 2010 as the forecasting period since the hindcast period ends in 2010 thus the training period was set as 1982 2010 and the forecasting period was set as 2011 2016 for the dynamic model 3 3 hybrid framework since the ensemble of multiple dynamic models showed better forecasting capability than a single dynamic model will the combination of a number of statistical and dynamic models outperform a single statistical or dynamic model especially in drought prediction in this case multiple heterogeneous models from different mechanisms will be integrated in model 23 a combination of model 1 21 was constructed model 22 was excluded from the hybrid framework as it is a linear weighting of other models and may cause a non positive problem bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical post processing method combining multiple models leamer 1978 it can reduce model uncertainty and improve out of sample predictive ability based on posterior probability assume δ is the target variable the posterior distribution of δ given data d is 26 p δ d k 1 n p δ m k d p m k d where m m 1 m 2 mn are alternative models p mk d is the posterior probability of model mk which can be expressed as 27 p m k d p d m k p m k i 1 n p d m i p m i where p mk is the prior probability p d mk is the marginal likelihood and is given by 28 p d m k p d θ i m i p θ i m i d θ i where θi is the parameters of model mi p θi mi is the prior probability of θi in model mi model 1 21 were weighted based on bma approach then a weighted sum of multiple alternative models was conducted to obtain the hybrid result the markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation gilks et al 1995 algorithm was employed to determine the posterior distribution of multiple models the implementation of bma model was based on bms package zeugner and feldkircher 2015 in r language the training period was set as 1982 2010 and the forecasting period was 2011 2016 3 4 evaluation metrics the assessment of forecasting performances are based on five statistical metrics pearson s correlation coefficient pcc root mean square error rmse probability of detection pod probability of false alarm pof and equitable threat score ets pcc and rmse can be used to evaluate how well the models forecast spi6 while pod pof and ets are capable of assessing drought onset prediction aghakouchak and mehran 2013 wilks 2011 yuan and wood 2013 the pcc measures the linear correlation between two variables x and y pcc equaling to 0 denotes no correlation while 1 represents total correlation the pcc is defined as follows 29 pc c x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the sample size xi and yi are individual samples x is the arithmetic mean of x and is given by x 1 n i 1 n x i y is the arithmetic mean of y and is given by y 1 n i 1 n y i the rmse is a measure of how close the predictions and true values or observations the formula can be expressed as 30 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n where yi is the true value or observation and ŷi is the forecasted value n is the sample size pod measures the probability of an event can be detected pof represents the probability of false alarm of an event ets takes hits misses and random chance into consideration in a score if the score falls below zero it indicates no skill in the model the perfect value of ets is 1 indicating that drought and non drought events are all correctly forecasted the specific formulas of these metrics were listed below 31 pod a a c 32 pof b a b 33 a random a b a c t 34 ets a a random a b c a random where a b and c are the number of events that are successfully forecasted false alarms and misses respectively t denotes the total events and is given as t a b c d where d is the number of the event not occurring after a forecast that it would not occur i e correct rejection arandom denotes the random hits adjusted for chance 4 results 4 1 performance of spi6 forecast for in sample period the hybrid model achieves the highest correlation fig s1 and the least error fig s2 in fitting spi6 at all leads statistical models generally show higher pcc and lower rmse than dynamic models of all the statistical models wsvm ct seems to be the best in simulating spi6 the pccs of benchmark models esp and naïve decrease quickly with increasing lead time and are close to 0 over 5 months in dynamic models nmme em exhibits better performance after averaging other dynamic models the individual dynamic models exhibit decreasing performance when the lead time increases with the correlation approaching 0 over 5 months for out of sample period the hybrid model shows the best performance in predicting spi6 for 1 5 month leads figs 3 and 4 dynamic models generally exhibit comparative correlation fig 3 but higher rmse fig 4 than statistical models with increasing lead the pcc drops and falls even below zero in some models fig 3 and the rmse increases fig 4 indicating large uncertainty models only considering climate signals svm c and ann c demonstrate little skill in forecasting spi6 the esp model has relatively high correlation for the first several leads while indicates no skill for more than 5 months wavelet preprocessing could improve the correlation in statistical models wsvm wsvm ct wann and wann ct even for more than 5 months lead fig 3 the rmses in the statistical models with wavelet transform also seem smaller than other machine learning models fig 4 4 2 performance of drought onset forecast in total 2939 drought onset events happened in 1982 2010 and 506 in 2011 2016 the in sample and out of sample capabilities of drought onset events forecast in 23 models were exhibited in fig 5 the benchmark models wavelet machine learning models dynamic models and the hybrid model can detect less than 40 drought onsets while other statistical models have little skill the in sample false alarms remain higher than 40 and some models reach up to 80 for out of sample period dynamic models model 16 22 generally own higher pod than statistical models fig 5c with a national average pod less than 40 however high false alarm ratios exist in almost all the models fig 5d the pof in dynamic models ranges between 75 and 90 while the pof in statistical models falls within 40 100 the hybrid model reduces the pof value relative to most of models fig 5d but also reduces the detection probability fig 5c for the ets metric the hybrid model shows the highest value both in in sample and out of sample periods fig 5e and f the out of sample ets value is 0 16 which is much low the benchmark models wavelet based models dynamic models and the hybrid model have higher ets values than other statistical models 4 3 performance in maps fig 6 presents in maps the probability of detected droughts overall the capabilities of detecting drought in all models remain low the pod in statistical models is generally lower than 40 and many stations own a pod below than 20 for dynamic models the majority of stations have a pod below 60 while the pod in some stations reaches up to 60 100 as for the hybrid model less than 40 droughts can be detected for most of the stations for early drought warning in agriculture a system should be capable of detecting drought with low false alarms fig 7 shows the pof of different models in statistical models like esp svm and svm ct the podfs are generally less than 20 although this seems promising the pods in these models are often low it can also be seen that false alarm ratio of the naïve model remain high in many stations while for dynamic models pofs in most of stations remain high reaching up to 60 100 although pods in dynamic models seem good for some stations in northeast china the pof is lower than 20 in dynamic models such as gfdla06 and nmme em it appears that statistical and dynamic models polarize on the forecast the low pod low pof phenomenon exists in some statistical models while the high pod high pof one shows in dynamic models the hybrid model attempts to balance them although the performance may not be satisfactory in the hybrid model the pod is slightly higher than statistical models but lower than dynamic models while the pof remains relatively higher than statistical models but lower than dynamic models as shown in fig 8 the naive model models with wavelet transformation dynamic models and the hybrid model exhibit higher ets than other models with an ets generally below 0 4 for some stations the ets may reach up to 0 6 1 0 stations with high ets have more potential in practical applications for drought warning the spatial variabilities of out of sample pccs and rmses for spi6 forecasts at 3 month lead were listed in figs 9 and 10 respectively the esp and the hybrid models have the strongest correlation with observations and the least forecasting error wavelet machine learning models also have higher correlation and less error than other models in many stations although dynamic models also have high correlation in some stations the rmse is large in central and southeast china climate index based models such as svm c and ann c have the poorest performance among all statistical models 4 4 weights in the hybrid model in the hybrid model model 1 21 are weighted by the bma method here the weights i e posterior expected values in the bma are given in fig 11 it may not be appropriate to call these weights because there are negative values but more suitable for regression parameters diks and vrugt 2010 raftery et al 1997 it can be seen that the weights are assigned to several models but not largely to a single model the coefficients in dynamic models are near zero at all leads indicating these models less important than other models 5 discussion 5 1 overall forecasting performance in spi6 forecast statistical and hybrid models have better skill than dynamic models in both in sample and out of sample periods statistical models aim at minimizing the error between observed and forecasted values intrinsically while dynamic models try to predict precipitation based on physical models the esp method shows high correlation with observed spi6 and low error for a few leads relying on mainly the initial condition the performance of esp is better than the naïve model suggesting that taking multiyear observations instead of recent single yearly value as future scenarios could be better the hybrid model combines statistical and dynamic models through weighting resulting in optimistic result in spi6 prediction the poor performance in svm c and ann c in forecasting spi6 figs 3 and 4 may be the nonsignificant connection between climate signals and accumulated precipitation in six months however incorporating climate indices did slightly improve the spi6 forecasting performance for longer lead e g 6 month but did not contribute much to the next several leads in our previous work xu et al 2018 the precipitation anomaly percentage pap index was used instead of spi6 spi6 is a statistical probability transformation of precipitation while pap relates directly to precipitation it is found that statistical models have better skill in forecasting spi6 and the hybrid model outperform statistical and dynamic models which is consistent with antecedent experiment however the climate index models svm c and ann c perform poorly in forecasting spi6 which is different from the good skill in forecasting pap the difference lies in that spi6 is an accumulated indicator for six months while pap is a monthly index climate indices may be effective predictors for monthly precipitation but may not be good signals for 6 month accumulated precipitation 5 2 forecasting capability of drought onsets dynamic models seem to be more promising in detecting drought onset than statistical models although the average pod remains low with high false alarms for practical applications in drought warning which requires high pod and low pof esp wavelet machine learning models dynamic models and hybrid model are the most promising alternatives with relatively high ets fig 5f the hybrid model makes a compromise between statistical and dynamic models it slightly improves out of sample pod relative to statistical models and reduces pof in dynamic models however the hybrid model does not obviously improve the predictive ability of drought onsets with respect to ets 5 3 spatial pattern there is no obviously geographical difference in the predictability of drought statistical models generally have low pods and low pofs while dynamic models have comparatively high pods and high pofs this can be attributed to the different mechanisms of statistical and dynamic models the low predictability of drought in both models can be improved with a better understanding of drought formation influencing factors and modeling 6 conclusion this study examined the performance of drought prediction using a series of statistical dynamic and hybrid models the results indicated that overall statistical models are more capable than dynamic models for spi6 prediction among all the statistical models the esp method and wavelet machine learning models show better performance than others in forecasting spi6 at 1 5 month leads by weighting statistical and dynamic models using bma approach the hybrid model outperforms both of them at 1 8 month leads the predictability of drought onset events varies with location and models on average less than 20 drought onset events can be detected for most of the statistical models while less than 40 for dynamic models among forecasted drought onsets more than 40 are false alarms for statistical models while more than 75 for dynamic models the hybrid model can slightly balance statistical and dynamic models with a pod of 20 and a pof of 50 the maps of forecasting capability also show the low pod low pof phenomenon in statistical models and high pod and high pof in dynamic models in spite of this some stations with high ets can be used in early drought warning under certain requirement this work provides preliminary insight of the role of statistical dynamic and hybrid models in spi6 and drought onset forecasts the predictability of drought onset was quantified using various models this may help improving drought prediction for researches in statistical and dynamic modeling drought is a complicated process driven by numerous factors such as atmospheric circulation natural variability and

6941,numerical models of soil water dynamics have been widely used in the design of soil cover systems for mine site reclamation however in most cases these models only consider water dynamics without consideration of heat dynamics for cover systems in northern climates such as those associated with oil sands mines in northern alberta canada freezing conditions exist for approximately 6 months of the year and snow melt comprises approximately 25 of annual precipitation this study attempts to assess whether a fully coupled water and heat flow model cm provides additional insights into cover performance as compared with a water flow model fm the cm and fm are developed for a monitored reclamation cover constructed over oil sands shale overburden the validated results indicated that the key limitation of the cm was its inability to simulate frozen ground infiltration this limitation results in an overestimate of snow melt runoff and does not replicate the development of perched conditions on the shale overburden surface as a result of snow melt infiltration the fm is also unable to simulate the observed infiltration of snow melt deep into the cover when snow melt is represented simply as surface precipitation in early spring following ground thaw both models are improved if snow melt infiltration is represented in the model by the preferential filling of macropores across the full depth of the cover and oxidized shale prior to ground thaw this methodology is incorporated with the cm to produce a coupled water and heat model with enhanced infiltration cm ei and with the fm to produce a flow model with enhanced infiltration fm ei the cm ei provided an improved simulation of soil temperature dynamics under frozen and unfrozen conditions as well as soil water dynamics under unfrozen conditions including the improved representation of the annual water balance components over each water year given the small difference in annual water balance components between the cm ei and fm ei modelling approaches 5 mm year it is concluded that a fm ei provides the best tool with which to assess the performance of these reclamation covers keywords snow melt infiltration surface runoff net percolation actual evapotranspiration water balance 1 introduction snow melt is a crucial component of the water balance within semi arid cold regions of the world increases in soil water storage from snow melt infiltration into frozen soils are critical to meeting vegetation water requirements through the summer months however the simulation of snow melt infiltration remains a particularly challenging problem involving coupled heat and water transport phase change processes and infiltration into macropores gray et al 2001 kelln et al 2009 suzuki 2013 the distribution of water and ice in the soil profile at the time of melt determines the amount of infiltration the distribution of infiltrating water within the soil profile and drainage of water below the frozen zone flerchinger and saxton 1989 hansson et al 2004 antonopoulos 2006 zhao et al 2016 in this paper we attempt to quantify the water balance of reclamation covers placed over saline sodic clay shale mine waste overburden at an oil sands mine in northern alberta canada the water balance has important implications for vegetation on the cover and the redistribution and export of salts produced within the overburden conventional practice has been to use numerical models to simulate soil water dynamics during the unfrozen time period i e growing season in order to interpret long term 10 year field monitoring data the winter period or snow accumulation period is neglected as the movement of water and solutes during this period is assumed to be negligible the melt period is treated as an externally applied initial or boundary condition to the model carrera hernandez et al 2011 and 2012 huang et al 2011 if applied as an initial condition the soil moisture storage in the profile is increased by an amount equivalent to the snow water equivalent swe mm if applied as a boundary condition the volume of swe is applied as an infiltration flux over a specified period of time following ground thaw usually one week one factor that complicates this is the fact that snow melt and the concomitant infiltration of melt water on these reclamation covers is generally complete one to two months prior to complete ground thaw kelln et al 2009 models have been initialized from the completion of thawing carrera hernandez et al 2011 and 2012 huang et al 2011 which removes the need to deal with frozen soils but may lead to errors in the partitioning of snowmelt into infiltration and runoff here we term models adopting this approach flow models fms fms that have been applied to reclamation covers include system dynamics models elshorbagy et al 2007 keshta et al 2010 and physically based models shurniak 2003 carrera hernandez et al 2011 huang et al 2015a fully coupled water and heat models cms have been developed to simulate flow processes in frozen soils and such models can in principle be applied to simulate snowmelt infiltration these models allow the timing of ground freezing thaw as well as water redistribution during the winter period to be simulated stahli et al 1999 there are a number of numerical models capable of simulating water and heat transport including the phase change that occurs during freezing and thawing some of these models were developed for specific applications such as the icm lytton et al 1993 and frostb guymon et al 1993 models designed for roads airstrips or similar environments other models are more general and incorporate advanced treatment of the energy transfer between the atmosphere and the soil surface examples of these models include soil jansson and halldin 1980 shaw flerchinger 2000 coup jansson and karlberg 2001 a modification of hydrus hansson et al 2004 geotop endrizzi et al 2014 and seep w geo slope international ltd 2018 most of these models are not generally designed to represent macropores and are expected to overestimate snowmelt runoff in soils which contain macropores such as the clay rich fractured soils in reclamation covers kelln et al 2009 although some of models such as hydrus do have dual porosity formulations their formulations are not able to simulate the situation in which a high water content matrix is frozen while the macropores remain empty and potential flow paths for infiltrating snow melt water aside from these limitations cms are able to track heat and water dynamics within unsaturated soil during both frozen and unfrozen conditions including the energy balance associated with the latent heat of fusion during freezing and the surface energy balance between the atmosphere and the soil the overarching aim of this study is to determine whether cms provide additional insights into cover performance compared with simpler fms the specific objectives of this paper are 1 to validate cm and fm models for a monitored reclamation cover constructed over oil sands shale overburden 2 to assess how snow melt infiltration into frozen ground can best be represented in these models recognizing the limitations in both approaches and 3 to evaluate the comparative performance of these different approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted at south bison hill sbh a reclaimed shale overburden dump constructed between 1980 and 1996 at syncrude s mildred lake mine fig 1 the dump is 2 km2 in area with a plateau rising about 60 m above the surrounding landscape after construction the overburden dump was contoured into a number of discrete watersheds and was capped with different prototype soil cover designs all the reclamation covers are comprised of an upper layer of salvaged peat mixed with glacial clay i e peat mineral mixture pmm overlaying salvaged glacial clay till gc three soil test covers were constructed in 1998 99 on a north facing 5h 1 v slope as part of a reclamation cover research program each is 50 m wide and 200 m long in the downslope direction the three covers are defined by their nominal thicknesses of pmm overlying gc a fourth soil test cover was established at a site on the plateau of sbh in 2001 the pmm gc and shale are classified as sandy loam silty loam and silty clay respectively based on the unified soil classification system huang et al 2015a the physical properties of three materials have been described in detail by meiers et al 2011 huang et al 2015a and appels et al 2017 following the placement of the soil covers the reclaimed area was planted with trembling aspen populus tremuloides michx and white spruce picea glauca moench voss kessler et al 2010 but has also developed a rich understory of a wide variety of other vegetation each cover is instrumented to monitor volumetric water content soil temperature and matric suction across the cover profile and the upper portion of the underlying shale overburden volumetric water content and matric suction are monitored using calibrated cs615 time domain reflectometry tdr sensors and cs229 thermal conductivity suction sensors campbell scientific lt usa respectively soil temperature is measured using thermistor sensors this study only focuses on the d3 cover with 20 cm of pmm overlying 80 cm of gc which represents the base case for the reclamation design being considered for this landform the model development and assessment are based on the d3 field monitoring profile which has instrumentation located at 5 20 30 55 90 115 125 145 and 170 cm soil depths fig 1c the measured soil water contents at three nodes of 125 145 and 170 cm soil depths however appeared abnormal and are not used for water dynamic model assessment interflow along the cover shale interface was measured using an interflow collection system constructed in june 2000 while surface runoff was measured using v notch weirs equipped with sonic sensors and data acquisition systems the v notch weirs are installed at a total of 4 locations along the surface drainage system for the dump including weirs within the drainage swale upstream and downstream of the cover sites the detailed descriptions of the interflow and surface runoff collection systems can be found in kelln et al 2009 a meteorological tower in the approximate centre of sbh was used to monitor air temperature relative humidity wind speed radiation and precipitation te525ws tipping bucket rain gauge campbell scientific lt usa the average temperature was 1 7 c and the average annual precipitation was 365 mm 74 mm as snow based on sbh climate data observed from 2001 to 2015 the monitoring study period nov 1 2000 to oct 31 2015 was divided into 15 water years with each water year extending from november 1 of one year to october 31 of the following year 2 2 evolution of soil properties and vegetation the hydraulic conductivity of the cover soils as well as the shallow shale overburden evolved over the first few years following cover placement due to dry wet and freeze thaw cycling meiers et al 2011 the measured field saturated hydraulic conductivity ks values of cover materials increased by one to two orders of magnitude over the first five monitoring seasons while the ks of the shallow shale increased approximately one order of magnitude over the same time period no significant change was apparent in the water retention curves wrc and hence these were assumed to remain constant during the study period the temporal variations of ks in the first five seasons 2001 2005 were incorporated into our simulations to calculate hydraulic conductivity using the van genuchten mualem equations van genuchten 1980 therefore while the value of ks was treated as a constant after 2005 vegetation was planted with an equal mix of spruce and aspen in 1999 and the aspen came to dominate fig 2 shows the evolution of lai for the plateau planted two years after the d3 cover as reported by strilesky et al 2017 the lai at this location adjacent to the d3 cover site increased from 0 55 in 2001 to approximately 4 0 in 2012 whereas the mean tree height increased from 1 0 m in 2003 to 4 8 m in 2012 strilesky et al 2017 the daily value of lai during the study period was linearly interpolated using the lai measurements shown in fig 2 and used to partition the potential evapotranspiration pet into potential evaporation pe and potential transpiration pt the fine root biomass distribution in the cover soils and upper shale at d3 was measured by van rees and jackson 2002 and van rees 2014 their results indicated that plant average maximum root depth increased from 60 cm in 2002 to 100 cm in 2012 whereas relative fine root density distribution presented changes in the profile with an obvious increase in the 15 to 40 cm soil layers in our simulations the evolution of the root depth was considered by assuming a linear increase from 20 cm in 2000 until the maximum depth of 100 cm in 2008 2 3 snowpack dynamics snow depth and swe were measured by an industry consultant o kane consultants inc 2018 in early spring feb 16 march 30 of each year except for 2002 and 2004 along transects across each cover because snowpack dynamics during the whole snow cover period in each water year are required for the cm the cold regions hydrological model crhm was used to estimate snow accumulation and melt pomeroy et al 2007 ellis et al 2010 using daily precipitation and climate data from the fort mcmurray airport fma weather station located approximately 45 km south of the study site crhm includes modules describing radiative turbulent and conductive energy exchanges to snow in open and forest environments and accounts for losses from canopy interception sublimation and wind redistribution pomeroy et al 2007 the input variables include air temperature relative humidity precipitation wind speed net radiation lai and plant height because the main vegetation species at the d3 cover are deciduous species the interception of snow by plants is expected to be low during snowfall carrera hernandez et al 2011 sublimation was not considered in this study because the highest rates of sublimation occur from intercepted snow pomeroy et al 1998 the effect of blowing snow on the redistribution of ground snow cover was ignored consistent with the spatial variation observed from the snow surveys the measured snow depths at the fma weather station were used to assess crhm outputs fig 3 compares the simulated and measured snow depth at the fma weather station along with the available measurements at the d3 cover after 2005 the simulated snow depths were always less than the measurements possibly due to missing storm events and undercatch pan et al 2016 a simple bias correction was applied to the winter precipitation such that the simulated snow depths would match the on site observations and these results are also shown in fig 3 the bias corrected snowpack simulation was used as a known upper surface condition of the cm over the winter time period 2 4 model configurations the multiphysics commercial simulation package seep w geo slope international ltd 2018 was selected for this study since it is capable of simulating both soil vegetation atmosphere transfer over the growing season as well as the surface energy balance over both frozen and unfrozen conditions it is also capable of simulating phase transformation of porewater to ice over a range of subfreezing temperatures along with the associated changes in heat capacity thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity seep w may be run for the water balance only considering water in the liquid and vapor phases only as in the fm it may also be run with coupled heat transport and water in solid liquid and vapor phases as in the cm here we describe the model governing equations and configurations for each setup 2 4 1 governing equations two systems of equations are required to mathematically describe coupled water and heat flow the one dimensional unsaturated water flow equation for freezing and thawing soil can be described using the modified richards equation as follows kim and heydinger 2002 1 θ l h t ρ i ρ l θ i t t z k h h z 1 1 ρ l q v z s where each term represents an equivalent change in volumetric

the fm model only eq 1 is solved and the second term on the left hand side is neglected 2 4 2 unfrozen soil hydraulic properties identical unfrozen hydraulic properties were used in both the cm and fm the pmm gc and shallow shale are clay rich soil materials the macroporosity observed within fmm and gc ranged from 2 5 to 5 of the total soil volume with a pore diameter larger than 75 µm kelln et al 2009 meiers et al 2011 processes such as freeze thaw cycles wet dry cycles and root penetration and bioturbation were assumed to result in the development of macroporosity the measured values of ks for the macroporosity were varied from 1 10 6 m s 2 to 6 10 6 m s 2 kell et al 2007 a bi modal wrc was used to describe the function of θl h for the pmm gc and oxidized shale while a single porosity wrc was used for the deep non oxidized shale fig 4 a the measurements of wrc for ppm and gc were conducted using the combination of cs615 time domain reflectometry tdr sensors and cs229 thermal

properties in the cm it is additionally necessary to specify how the soil hydraulic properties are modified in frozen conditions as liquid water in the pore space is replaced by ice assuming that the ice gauge pressure is fixed and that the osmotic pressure i e presence of salt is zero the change in water pressure within the liquid water of a partially frozen soil can be determined by the generalized clapeyron equation edlefsen and anderson 1943 geo slope international ltd 2018 3 dp dt ρ l l f t 0 where dp is the reduction in the equilibrium freezing pressure pa below atmospheric pressure corresponding to a reduction in temperature dt k below t0 k the freezing point of pure water at atmosphere pressure the freezing temperature for different parts of the pore space is calculated using 3 the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc determines the unfrozen water content as a function of temperature liu et al 2012 the sfcc is also affected by the presence of solutes in soil azmatch et al 2012 which decrease the freezing point of the pore water patterson and smith 1985 measured sfccs for silty clay at various solute concentrations and found the freezing point shifted from 1 0 c for a 10 g l 1 sample to 2 7 c for a 35 g l 1 sample the pmm and gc cover layers had a low aqueous solute salt concentration 0 1 1 5 g l 1 including soluble sulphate na k mg2 and ca2 while the oxidized shale pore water salt concentration ranged from 6 5 to 9 5 g l 1 and the unoxidized shale had a high salt concentration from 6 5 to 15 0 g l 1 kessler et al 2010 hilderman 2011 huang et al 2015b appels et al 2017 the freezing point for each soil was empirically estimated using the results of patterson and smith 1985 to create a freezing point temperature for pore water alone of 0 05 0 052 0 62 and 1 0 c for the pmm gc oxidized shale and non oxidized shale fig 4c respectively below the freezing point the sfcc was estimated using the following clapeyron equation based on the similarity between the rwc and sfcc azmatch et al 2012 ren et al 2017 4 ψ l f ρ w l n t 273 15 where ψ is matric potential kpa and t is the temperature k when soil temperature less than the freezing point the soil liquid water content can be determined using the sfcc fig 4c whereas the hydraulic conductivity of liquid water in frozen soil is obtained using the combination of the calculated matric suction using eq 4 and the k h relationship shown in fig 4b 2 4 4 soil thermal properties soil thermal properties are only used in the cm the bulk thermal conductivity k t kj d 1 m 1 k 1 of unfrozen and frozen soils was estimated as the volume weighted sum of the air water ice and soil phase johansen 1975 the bulk specific heat capacity c kj m 3 k 1 of unfrozen and frozen soil was estimated in the same way using the devries 1963 equation ignoring the heat capacity of air 5 c c l θ l c i θ i c s 1 n where cl ci and cs are volumetric heat capacities of liquid water ice and soil respectively and n is soil porosity in this study n was calculated using the measured soil bulk density and particle density 2 62 2 61 and 2 73 g cm 3 for ppm gc and shale respectively soil phase was equal to 1 n θl under unfrozen condition was estimated using eq 1 whereas θl and θi under the frozen condition were determined using the sfcc in fig 4c and eq 1 respectively k t and c for each dry material are shown in table 1 2 4 5 model domain eqs 1 and 2 were both solved numerically using a one dimensional finite element method for spatial discretization and finite differences for the temporal discretization the model domain was a 5 m deep profile including 0 2 m of pmm 0 8 m of gc 0 5 m of oxidized shale and 3 5 m of non oxidized shale fig 1c the spatial discretization size was 5 mm for peat mineral mixture 10 mm for gc 20 mm for oxidized shale and 50 mm for non oxidized shale the temporal step was set to be 0 02 day 2 4 6 water flow initial and boundary conditions an initial pressure head distribution developed from the observed water contents and the wrc was used as an initial condition in the model the lower boundary condition was set to be a unit gradient in addition a lateral free drainage boundary condition was specified at the cover shale interface in order to allow interflow to occur if positive pressures develop at this location the upper boundary condition was a soil vegetation atmosphere boundary which was comprised of two components the net infiltration at the ground surface and transpiration within the soil profile the net infiltration was calculated as follows 6 q p q sm q e q r q i where superscripts on water fluxes q mm d indicate rainfall p snow melt sm surface evaporation e runoff r and infiltration i transpiration was simulated using the model of feddes et al 2001 based on a specified normalized root density distribution in the profile potential plant transpiration and a water stress function huang et al 2015a the daily pet was calculated using the penman equation for evaporation from a wet surface shuttleworth 1993 the daily climatic data such as the maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity and net radiation were collected from the automated meteorological station on the d3 plot o kane consultants inc 2018 while daily wind speed at 2 m above the tree canopy was estimated using the 10 m measurements from mildred lake strilesky et al 2017 the pet was then partitioned into the pe and pt according to beer s law as a function of lai ritchie 1972 the actual soil evaporation with vegetation cover was calculated using the penman wilson equation wilson et al 1994 the snow melt flux was calculated differently for the cm and the fm for the cm the melt rate was simulated by crhm as described in section 2 3 for the fm a simple degree day method was used to calculate the snow melt flux qsm independent from the soil model it was assumed that the snowpack starts melting in the spring when air temperatures were above zero for five successive days the daily snow melt flux mm d 1 was calculated as li and simonovic 2002 carrera hernandez et al 2011 7 q sm 4 3 t air t thr where tair is air temperature and tthr is a threshold temperature equal to 0 c 2 4 7 heat transport initial and boundary conditions the initial temperature distribution was based on the observed temperature profile at the beginning of the simulation period the lower boundary condition was fixed to be 1 c at a depth of 5 m wall 2005 monitored soil temperature profiles at sbh and found that the soil temperature at the depth of 5 m was relatively constant at 1 c consistent with the average annual air temperatures at the site the upper boundary condition was set as the ground heat flux which was solved from the surface energy balance equation 8 g r n λ e t h where g is the ground heat flux kj m 2 d 1 rn is the measured net radiation flux kj m 2 d 1 λet is the latent heat flux kj m 2 d 1 and et value is calculated using water flow equation and h is the sensible heat flux kj m 2 d 1 and is calculated using the temperature at the top of the snow with snow cover or soil surface without snow cover the top temperature is determined using a non linear equation solution technique to satisfy eq 8 geo slope international ltd 2018 the upper boundary condition when the snowpack is present is a calculated conductive heat flux across the snowpack using the thermal conductivity of the snow and the air and ground surface temperatures the variations of snowpack thickness during the study period are shown in fig 3 while average snow density and thermal conductivity of snowpack were used to calculate the conductive heat transfer across the snowpack the measured snow density at the study site was ranged from 123 to 234 kg m 3 with an average of 162 kg m 3 the snowpack thermal conductivity was equal to 16 5 kj d 1 m 1 k 1 calculated using the average snow density and the empirical relationship of riche and schneebeli 2013 2 5 modifications of cm and fm as will be shown in the results section the cm model cannot simulate the infiltration of snow melt into the macropore dominated frozen ground profile as a result it was decided to adopt an alternative simplified approach to replicate the observed infiltration and redistribution of snow melt into the frozen soil profile previous work at the study site by kelln et al 2009 demonstrated that snow melt infiltration occurred into the soil macropores resulting in filling and refreezing of the macropores across the entire depth of the cover to the cover shale interface based on these observations the following methodology was adopted to simulate snow melt infiltration and redistribution within the cover snow melt is assumed to completely infiltrate if the cumulative volume of snow melt vsm is less than the available storage within the macropores over the depth of the cover and shallow oxidized shale if vsm is larger than the total available macropore storage the extra snow melt is assumed to be released as runoff over the frozen cover if the available snow melt is less than the available macropore storage then the infiltrated melt water is assumed to preferentially fill the macropores at the lower layers first the matrix pores between the macropores have a low infiltration capacity under frozen condition and infiltration into the matrix was ignored the methodology can be formulated as follows 9 v sm t 0 t n q sm d t where v sm mm is the volume of snowmelt between the start of melt t 0 and the end of melt t t n days this volume of water is partitioned sequentially between macropore storage in the layers and finally runoff 10 v os v sm v sm s os s os v sm s os 11 v g 0 v sm s os v sm s os v sm s os s g s g v sm s os s g 12 v p 0 v sm

s x mm is the macropore storage capacity within layer x and subscripts represent snowmelt sm oxidized shale os gc g pmm p and runoff r eqs 9 13 were incorporated into the cm as an external input function the new model is referred to as the coupled water and heat model with enhanced infiltration cm ei in this study as will be shown later in the case of the fm the application of snow melt as surface infiltration on unfrozen soil as described in eq 7 results in underestimation of snow melt runoff huang et al 2015a and also results in increases in water storage primarily within the upper pmm and then the gc portion of the cover profile to improve the fm the same approach i e eqs 9 13 was incorporated to establish the initial distribution of snow melt water once the ground thaws in the fm the combination of eqs 9 13 and the water dynamic model is defined as the flow model with enhanced infiltration fm ei in this study as shown in fig 4a the total macropore storage capacity of the cover and oxidized shale is approximately 52 1 mm based on the calculated macropore volumes this volume includes 11 6 mm for the pmm layer equal to 0 058 cm3 cm 3 200 mm 28 0 mm for the gc layer equal to 0 035 cm3 cm 3 800 mm and 12 5 mm for the oxidized shale equal to 0 025 cm3 cm 3 500 mm as a consequence any year with a swe greater than approximately 52 1 mm will result in runoff 3 results and discussion in this section we compare the simulations from the various models to the field observations some of these observations such as temperature are only indirectly related to the hydrological performance of the reclamation cover however simulating such observations provides confidence that the mechanisms controlling water and heat dynamics are being represented appropriately in the model therefore we examine all aspects of model performance that the data will allow we end with consideration of the water balance which is the most important metric from a cover performance standpoint 3 1 simulations of soil temperatures soil temperatures were simulated for the 15 water years of observational data using the cm and cm ei the comparisons between the measured and simulated temperatures at different depths for three example years 2005 2010 and 2015 are shown in fig 5 both models simulate nearly identical temperatures at a given depth this suggests that the enhanced snow melt infiltration with the cm ei did not have a significant impact on the energy balance the cm and cm ei models always underestimated soil temperatures during the frozen periods in the 0 90 cm profile but overestimated soil temperatures during unfrozen periods for the 0 30 cm layer this is likely due to lack of surface lfh or mulch layer in these models which might alter the rate of heat transfer in the surficial layers the presence of such layers above would decrease energy transfer from soil to air during the frozen periods and from air to soil during the unfrozen periods this would result in an overestimation of soil temperatures in the 0 30 cm layer and underestimattion of soil temperatures in the deeper layers 50 cm table 2 the small root mean square error rmse values shown in table 2 ranging from 0 9 c at 115 cm depth to 3 1 c at 5 cm depth with an average of 1 9 c indicate that the simulated and measured soil temperatures are in good agreement during the study period there also appears to be some systematic differences between the measured and simulated temperatures below a depth of 115 cm where the simulation predicts later thawing dates than observed fig 5 and table 2 the differences are larger at greater depths at a depth of 175 cm the maximum delay between the simulated and measured thawing date 40 days occurred for the 2014 water year a number of factors could cause the difference in the simulated and measured thawing dates zhao et al 2016 for example during the 2014 water year the monitored snow depth at the d3 cover was less than that at the fma weather station a shallower simulated snow cover than actual resulted in lower winter soil temperatures which required a greater time in the spring to cause thawing it is also possible that the presence of high salinity might result in a higher proportion of unfrozen water within the upper shale these differences in the sfcc would result in less stored energy within this part of the profile as a result of phase change fig 6 compares the simulated frozen temperature isotherm using cm ei with the measurement for each water year here the starting frozen temperatures were 0 05 0 052 0 62 and 1 0 c for the pmm gc oxidized shale and non oxidized shale respectively when the effect of soil salinity was taken into account fig 4c 3 2 simulations of soil water content the liquid soil water content swc was simulated for 15 complete water years using the cm and cm ei and for 15 unfrozen periods using the fm and fm ei respectively fig 7 shows the simulated and measured swc at six monitored depths for 2005 2010 and 2015 water years and unfrozen periods under unfrozen periods the four models produce very similar swc dynamics for the cover soils and any of the models appear to provide a reasonable representation of the variations in observed swc it is of note that the most dynamic and generally lower growing season swcs occurred in the shallow soil layers at depths of 5 and 20 cm within the pmm with less dynamic and generally higher swcs at deeper depths in the gc and underlying shale this is likely due in large part to the development of the rooting system over time a feature which is difficult to capture in the models the results measured by van rees 2014 indicated that fine root density distribution in d3 cover presented a large spatial variation with the maximum root depth ranging from 95 to 178 cm the relative fine root density distribution used in this model was a mean distribution which might not represent the actual fine distribution at the monitored location in addition the assumed linear growth of the maximum root depth with time might not represent the temporal variation of fine root density distribution the impact of the simple snowmelt infiltration algorithm is apparent in the simulated swc at depths below 50 cm with the cm ei the swc is increased relative to the cm since there is more infiltration and it is directly injected at deeper depths with the fm ei the swc is decreased relative to the fm because although infiltration is injected deeper the overall amount of infiltration is reduced and less than that with the fm with the fm snow melt does not produce runoff in any water year the mean differences in the simulated swc ranged from 0 006 to 0 046 cm3 cm 3 among the four models during the 15 year studied period table 3 presents the statistical results of rmse between the measured and simulated swcs during the unfrozen period for each model the accuracy of the simulations changes at different depths for each model the lowest rmse appears at the depth of 55 cm while the largest rmse appears at the depth of 5 cm the main reason is that the swc at the depth of 5 cm is sensitive to rainfall events and soil evaporation for the whole profile the four models have very similar accuracy measures with rmse values in the range of 0 040 cm3 cm 3 for the cm and cm ei to 0 042 cm3 cm 3 for the fm and fm ei these results suggest that any of the models would produce a similar representation of the dynamics in soil water content during the growing seasons 3 3 simulations of runoff table 4 shows the simulated runoff from snow melt and rainfall events for each water year using the four models the cm generated an average annual runoff of 71 mm 67 mm from snow melt 94 of swe and 4 mm from rainfall events in seep w the frozen soil hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of unfrozen soil using temperature and eq 3 watanabe and osada 2016 found that this approach underestimated liquid water content in the frozen soil which subsequently resulted in underestimation of hydraulic conductivity particularly near the melting temperature this modelling approach would result in an underestimation of snow melt infiltration and consequently an overestimation of snow melt runoff the opposite response was observed for annual runoff simulated by the fm in this case the annual average snow melt runoff was nearly non existent the simple assumption utilized in the fm is that the total snowpack volume becomes spring precipitation and results in infiltration and storage of the snow melt in the upper portion of the cover profile where it is readily available for release as transpiration the calculated snow melt runoff from the cm ei and fm ei models ranged from 0 mm in 2003 2006 and 2012 to 59 7 mm in 2008 with an average of 23 8 mm the simulated average runoff resulting from summer rainfall events was 4 6 mm for the cm ei and 1 9 mm for the fm ei the average total runoff was 28 4 mm for the cm ei and 25 7 mm for the fm ei table 4 fig 8 compares the annual total runoff simulated by cm cm ei fm and fm ei with the measurements for the period of 2001 2015 except for 2005 a year with exceptionally high summer precipitation the simulated values by the cm were larger than those measured in the case of the fm the simulated runoff was less than the measurements for all years except for 2012 when the measured runoff was only 1 0 mm the smallest value of runoff from 2003 to 2015 the simulated runoff values from the cm ei and fm ei were consistent with the field observations excluding 2005 the simulated mean runoff was 66 4 mm for cm 27 3 mm for the cm ei 2 0 mm for fm and 25 7 mm for the fm ei whereas the measured mean runoff was 24 9 mm 3 4 simulations of actual evapotranspiration fig 9 compares the cumulative eta measured during the growing season at the adjacent plateau site location as well as the simulated values using the four models the measured values were based on eddy covariance measurements ecm as reported by carey 2008 carey et al 2011 and strilesky et al 2017 the plateau is immediately adjacent to the d3 cover but had a thicker cover nominally 120 cm in thickness it was also reclaimed and revegetated approximately 2 years after the d3 cover site in addition since the plateau is elevated and relatively flat the flux tower is more exposed to wind with less runoff than the d3 cover where the average slope is 20 fig 1 the height of eddy covariance tower was adjusted at the beginning of several growing seasons 2 9 m in 2003 2 96 m in 2007 4 63 m in 2009 7 10 m in 2011 then 8 25 m in 2014 as the vegetation canopy height increased strilesky et al 2017 the differences in measured and simulated eta are unsurprising but the seasonal and interannual patterns are insightful typically the simulated cumulative eta values were less than the measured values exceptions were the growing seasons of 2004 2005 and 2007 comparing the models we see that simulated eta increases with increasing spring infiltration this is the maximum in the fm model because the soils are unfrozen and the infiltration capacity is usually above the estimated snowmelt rates next the fm ei and cm ei models have very similar et with slightly higher values for the fm ei model this is because the snowmelt infiltration is imposed on these models so is almost the same and there may be slightly less rainfall infiltration in the cm ei model when the soils are still frozen finally eta is lowest in the cm model because most of the snowmelt over frozen soils is lost to runoff 3 5 simulations of net percolation and interflow the simulated net percolation rates for each water year using four models are shown in fig 10 there are no annual direct measurements of net percolation however the previous estimates of net percolation obtained by hilderman 2011 based on profiles of the stable isotopes of water were used as the basis of comparison these isotope based estimates of net percolation were for cumulative net percolation from 1999 to 2009 at 8 locations on the d3 cover and plateau these values are presented in fig 10 as a basis of comparison to the simulated results hilderman 2011 noted that the average net percolation rate was a function of topographic position varying from a maximum of 34 1 mm a 1 at plateau locations to minimum of 3 5 mm a 1 on the d3 slope with a mean of 14 3 mm a 1 huang et al 2015b the four models had a similar range of average annual net percolation as observed by huang et al 2015b with the highest values being those obtained from the cm ei and fm models approximately 16 18 mm a 1 and somewhat lower values obtained with the cm and fm ei models approximately 13 14 mm a 1 the main reason for these differences are likely due to the increased snow melt infiltration that occurred with the cm ei and fm models the average interflow measure at the toe of the d3 cover from 2001 to 2015 was 2 6 mm a 1 only the fm model predicted any interflow in this case only 1 9 mm a 1 no attempt was made to calibrate the models to this observation given the relatively small component of the water balance that this comprises and given its sensitivity to model parameters such as the ks of the unoxidized shale or the water retention properties of the oxidized shale 4 conclusions a comparison of alternative approaches for modelling the hydrological processes in seasonally frozen soils was undertaken focusing on how various approaches to simulating snow melt infiltration may have an impact on the overall water balance components four models were applied to the field site to examine i whether additional process insights and or improvements to model performance can be achieved by simulating the entire year including the winter period with a state of the art physically based coupled flow and heat transport model and ii whether enhanced infiltration algorithms improve the water balance simulations conventional frozen soil infiltration runoff algorithms tend to overestimate runoff and underestimate infiltration the enhanced infiltration algorithms used here involve forcing infiltration into the frozen soil based on an assessment of the storage capacity of the macropores and the volume of snowmelt the models were applied to a well monitored reclamation hillslope that has been studied over a period of 15 years following its construction during which time the soils have developed and vegetation has become well established models were parameterized with field observations of soil hydraulic properties the coupled flow and heat models were able to provide a reasonable simulation of the soil temperature dynamics under both frozen and unfrozen conditions this is potentially useful information for modelling the energy balance soil cover evolution in response to freeze thaw cycles as well as geochemical processes however from a water balance perspective this information would only be useful if we have improved physically based infiltration algorithms with a conventional infiltration algorithm we found that the coupled model overpredicted runoff as expected with the enhanced infiltration algorithm the performance was improved but similar performance was achieved using the simpler water balance model whereby the winter period was not simulated explicitly while the simulations of evapotranspiration could not be rigorously validated against flux tower observations the models do predict increasing growing season evapotranspiration with increasing snowmelt infiltration consistent with general understanding and highlighting the importance of the snowmelt infiltration process the best simulations were those that applied enhanced infiltration whether or not heat transport was coupled to the flow model we conclude that with existing models that are available there is not enough benefit to the simulated water balance to justify the considerable additional effort and computational resources required to parameterize and implement a coupled flow and heat transport modelling approach our recommendation for best practice for simulating the water balance in seasonally frozen soils such as those found in reclamation covers in northern alberta is to apply water balance richards equation models to the unfrozen period of the year driven with observed or simulated snow water equivalent which is partitioned between infiltration and runoff using a simple enhanced infiltration algorithm such as was applied in this study

university for providing the eddy covariance data 
6941,numerical models of soil water dynamics have been widely used in the design of soil cover systems for mine site reclamation however in most cases these models only consider water dynamics without consideration of heat dynamics for cover systems in northern climates such as those associated with oil sands mines in northern alberta canada freezing conditions exist for approximately 6 months of the year and snow melt comprises approximately 25 of annual precipitation this study attempts to assess whether a fully coupled water and heat flow model cm provides additional insights into cover performance as compared with a water flow model fm the cm and fm are developed for a monitored reclamation cover constructed over oil sands shale overburden the validated results indicated that the key limitation of the cm was its inability to simulate frozen ground infiltration this limitation results in an overestimate of snow melt runoff and does not replicate the development of perched conditions on the shale overburden surface as a result of snow melt infiltration the fm is also unable to simulate the observed infiltration of snow melt deep into the cover when snow melt is represented simply as surface precipitation in early spring following ground thaw both models are improved if snow melt infiltration is represented in the model by the preferential filling of macropores across the full depth of the cover and oxidized shale prior to ground thaw this methodology is incorporated with the cm to produce a coupled water and heat model with enhanced infiltration cm ei and with the fm to produce a flow model with enhanced infiltration fm ei the cm ei provided an improved simulation of soil temperature dynamics under frozen and unfrozen conditions as well as soil water dynamics under unfrozen conditions including the improved representation of the annual water balance components over each water year given the small difference in annual water balance components between the cm ei and fm ei modelling approaches 5 mm year it is concluded that a fm ei provides the best tool with which to assess the performance of these reclamation covers keywords snow melt infiltration surface runoff net percolation actual evapotranspiration water balance 1 introduction snow melt is a crucial component of the water balance within semi arid cold regions of the world increases in soil water storage from snow melt infiltration into frozen soils are critical to meeting vegetation water requirements through the summer months however the simulation of snow melt infiltration remains a particularly challenging problem involving coupled heat and water transport phase change processes and infiltration into macropores gray et al 2001 kelln et al 2009 suzuki 2013 the distribution of water and ice in the soil profile at the time of melt determines the amount of infiltration the distribution of infiltrating water within the soil profile and drainage of water below the frozen zone flerchinger and saxton 1989 hansson et al 2004 antonopoulos 2006 zhao et al 2016 in this paper we attempt to quantify the water balance of reclamation covers placed over saline sodic clay shale mine waste overburden at an oil sands mine in northern alberta canada the water balance has important implications for vegetation on the cover and the redistribution and export of salts produced within the overburden conventional practice has been to use numerical models to simulate soil water dynamics during the unfrozen time period i e growing season in order to interpret long term 10 year field monitoring data the winter period or snow accumulation period is neglected as the movement of water and solutes during this period is assumed to be negligible the melt period is treated as an externally applied initial or boundary condition to the model carrera hernandez et al 2011 and 2012 huang et al 2011 if applied as an initial condition the soil moisture storage in the profile is increased by an amount equivalent to the snow water equivalent swe mm if applied as a boundary condition the volume of swe is applied as an infiltration flux over a specified period of time following ground thaw usually one week one factor that complicates this is the fact that snow melt and the concomitant infiltration of melt water on these reclamation covers is generally complete one to two months prior to complete ground thaw kelln et al 2009 models have been initialized from the completion of thawing carrera hernandez et al 2011 and 2012 huang et al 2011 which removes the need to deal with frozen soils but may lead to errors in the partitioning of snowmelt into infiltration and runoff here we term models adopting this approach flow models fms fms that have been applied to reclamation covers include system dynamics models elshorbagy et al 2007 keshta et al 2010 and physically based models shurniak 2003 carrera hernandez et al 2011 huang et al 2015a fully coupled water and heat models cms have been developed to simulate flow processes in frozen soils and such models can in principle be applied to simulate snowmelt infiltration these models allow the timing of ground freezing thaw as well as water redistribution during the winter period to be simulated stahli et al 1999 there are a number of numerical models capable of simulating water and heat transport including the phase change that occurs during freezing and thawing some of these models were developed for specific applications such as the icm lytton et al 1993 and frostb guymon et al 1993 models designed for roads airstrips or similar environments other models are more general and incorporate advanced treatment of the energy transfer between the atmosphere and the soil surface examples of these models include soil jansson and halldin 1980 shaw flerchinger 2000 coup jansson and karlberg 2001 a modification of hydrus hansson et al 2004 geotop endrizzi et al 2014 and seep w geo slope international ltd 2018 most of these models are not generally designed to represent macropores and are expected to overestimate snowmelt runoff in soils which contain macropores such as the clay rich fractured soils in reclamation covers kelln et al 2009 although some of models such as hydrus do have dual porosity formulations their formulations are not able to simulate the situation in which a high water content matrix is frozen while the macropores remain empty and potential flow paths for infiltrating snow melt water aside from these limitations cms are able to track heat and water dynamics within unsaturated soil during both frozen and unfrozen conditions including the energy balance associated with the latent heat of fusion during freezing and the surface energy balance between the atmosphere and the soil the overarching aim of this study is to determine whether cms provide additional insights into cover performance compared with simpler fms the specific objectives of this paper are 1 to validate cm and fm models for a monitored reclamation cover constructed over oil sands shale overburden 2 to assess how snow melt infiltration into frozen ground can best be represented in these models recognizing the limitations in both approaches and 3 to evaluate the comparative performance of these different approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted at south bison hill sbh a reclaimed shale overburden dump constructed between 1980 and 1996 at syncrude s mildred lake mine fig 1 the dump is 2 km2 in area with a plateau rising about 60 m above the surrounding landscape after construction the overburden dump was contoured into a number of discrete watersheds and was capped with different prototype soil cover designs all the reclamation covers are comprised of an upper layer of salvaged peat mixed with glacial clay i e peat mineral mixture pmm overlaying salvaged glacial clay till gc three soil test covers were constructed in 1998 99 on a north facing 5h 1 v slope as part of a reclamation cover research program each is 50 m wide and 200 m long in the downslope direction the three covers are defined by their nominal thicknesses of pmm overlying gc a fourth soil test cover was established at a site on the plateau of sbh in 2001 the pmm gc and shale are classified as sandy loam silty loam and silty clay respectively based on the unified soil classification system huang et al 2015a the physical properties of three materials have been described in detail by meiers et al 2011 huang et al 2015a and appels et al 2017 following the placement of the soil covers the reclaimed area was planted with trembling aspen populus tremuloides michx and white spruce picea glauca moench voss kessler et al 2010 but has also developed a rich understory of a wide variety of other vegetation each cover is instrumented to monitor volumetric water content soil temperature and matric suction across the cover profile and the upper portion of the underlying shale overburden volumetric water content and matric suction are monitored using calibrated cs615 time domain reflectometry tdr sensors and cs229 thermal conductivity suction sensors campbell scientific lt usa respectively soil temperature is measured using thermistor sensors this study only focuses on the d3 cover with 20 cm of pmm overlying 80 cm of gc which represents the base case for the reclamation design being considered for this landform the model development and assessment are based on the d3 field monitoring profile which has instrumentation located at 5 20 30 55 90 115 125 145 and 170 cm soil depths fig 1c the measured soil water contents at three nodes of 125 145 and 170 cm soil depths however appeared abnormal and are not used for water dynamic model assessment interflow along the cover shale interface was measured using an interflow collection system constructed in june 2000 while surface runoff was measured using v notch weirs equipped with sonic sensors and data acquisition systems the v notch weirs are installed at a total of 4 locations along the surface drainage system for the dump including weirs within the drainage swale upstream and downstream of the cover sites the detailed descriptions of the interflow and surface runoff collection systems can be found in kelln et al 2009 a meteorological tower in the approximate centre of sbh was used to monitor air temperature relative humidity wind speed radiation and precipitation te525ws tipping bucket rain gauge campbell scientific lt usa the average temperature was 1 7 c and the average annual precipitation was 365 mm 74 mm as snow based on sbh climate data observed from 2001 to 2015 the monitoring study period nov 1 2000 to oct 31 2015 was divided into 15 water years with each water year extending from november 1 of one year to october 31 of the following year 2 2 evolution of soil properties and vegetation the hydraulic conductivity of the cover soils as well as the shallow shale overburden evolved over the first few years following cover placement due to dry wet and freeze thaw cycling meiers et al 2011 the measured field saturated hydraulic conductivity ks values of cover materials increased by one to two orders of magnitude over the first five monitoring seasons while the ks of the shallow shale increased approximately one order of magnitude over the same time period no significant change was apparent in the water retention curves wrc and hence these were assumed to remain constant during the study period the temporal variations of ks in the first five seasons 2001 2005 were incorporated into our simulations to calculate hydraulic conductivity using the van genuchten mualem equations van genuchten 1980 therefore while the value of ks was treated as a constant after 2005 vegetation was planted with an equal mix of spruce and aspen in 1999 and the aspen came to dominate fig 2 shows the evolution of lai for the plateau planted two years after the d3 cover as reported by strilesky et al 2017 the lai at this location adjacent to the d3 cover site increased from 0 55 in 2001 to approximately 4 0 in 2012 whereas the mean tree height increased from 1 0 m in 2003 to 4 8 m in 2012 strilesky et al 2017 the daily value of lai during the study period was linearly interpolated using the lai measurements shown in fig 2 and used to partition the potential evapotranspiration pet into potential evaporation pe and potential transpiration pt the fine root biomass distribution in the cover soils and upper shale at d3 was measured by van rees and jackson 2002 and van rees 2014 their results indicated that plant average maximum root depth increased from 60 cm in 2002 to 100 cm in 2012 whereas relative fine root density distribution presented changes in the profile with an obvious increase in the 15 to 40 cm soil layers in our simulations the evolution of the root depth was considered by assuming a linear increase from 20 cm in 2000 until the maximum depth of 100 cm in 2008 2 3 snowpack dynamics snow depth and swe were measured by an industry consultant o kane consultants inc 2018 in early spring feb 16 march 30 of each year except for 2002 and 2004 along transects across each cover because snowpack dynamics during the whole snow cover period in each water year are required for the cm the cold regions hydrological model crhm was used to estimate snow accumulation and melt pomeroy et al 2007 ellis et al 2010 using daily precipitation and climate data from the fort mcmurray airport fma weather station located approximately 45 km south of the study site crhm includes modules describing radiative turbulent and conductive energy exchanges to snow in open and forest environments and accounts for losses from canopy interception sublimation and wind redistribution pomeroy et al 2007 the input variables include air temperature relative humidity precipitation wind speed net radiation lai and plant height because the main vegetation species at the d3 cover are deciduous species the interception of snow by plants is expected to be low during snowfall carrera hernandez et al 2011 sublimation was not considered in this study because the highest rates of sublimation occur from intercepted snow pomeroy et al 1998 the effect of blowing snow on the redistribution of ground snow cover was ignored consistent with the spatial variation observed from the snow surveys the measured snow depths at the fma weather station were used to assess crhm outputs fig 3 compares the simulated and measured snow depth at the fma weather station along with the available measurements at the d3 cover after 2005 the simulated snow depths were always less than the measurements possibly due to missing storm events and undercatch pan et al 2016 a simple bias correction was applied to the winter precipitation such that the simulated snow depths would match the on site observations and these results are also shown in fig 3 the bias corrected snowpack simulation was used as a known upper surface condition of the cm over the winter time period 2 4 model configurations the multiphysics commercial simulation package seep w geo slope international ltd 2018 was selected for this study since it is capable of simulating both soil vegetation atmosphere transfer over the growing season as well as the surface energy balance over both frozen and unfrozen conditions it is also capable of simulating phase transformation of porewater to ice over a range of subfreezing temperatures along with the associated changes in heat capacity thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity seep w may be run for the water balance only considering water in the liquid and vapor phases only as in the fm it may also be run with coupled heat transport and water in solid liquid and vapor phases as in the cm here we describe the model governing equations and configurations for each setup 2 4 1 governing equations two systems of equations are required to mathematically describe coupled water and heat flow the one dimensional unsaturated water flow equation for freezing and thawing soil can be described using the modified richards equation as follows kim and heydinger 2002 1 θ l h t ρ i ρ l θ i t t z k h h z 1 1 ρ l q v z s where each term represents an equivalent change in volumetric liquid water content m3 m 3 s 1 including in order from left to right the change in volumetric unfrozen water content change in volumetric ice content net liquid flux net vapor flux and a sink term

volumetric heat capacity of the soil j m 3 k 1 lf is the latent heat of freezing j kg 1 kt is soil thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 and cl is specific heat capacity of liquid water j kg 1 k 1 eqs 1 and 2 are tightly coupled due to their mutual dependence on θl θi h and t and are nonlinear because of the dependencies of h k c and kt on θl and θi for the cm model both these equations are solved for the fm model only eq 1 is solved and the second term on the left hand side is neglected 2 4 2 unfrozen soil hydraulic properties identical unfrozen hydraulic properties were used in both the cm and fm the pmm gc and shallow shale are clay rich soil materials the macroporosity observed within fmm and gc ranged from 2 5 to 5 of the total soil volume with a pore diameter larger than 75 µm kelln et al 2009 meiers et al 2011 processes such as freeze thaw cycles wet dry cycles and root penetration and bioturbation were assumed to result in the development of macroporosity the measured values of ks for the macroporosity were varied from 1 10 6 m s 2 to 6 10 6 m s 2 kell et al 2007 a bi modal wrc was used to describe the function of θl h for the pmm gc and oxidized shale while a single porosity wrc was used for the deep non oxidized shale fig 4 a the measurements of wrc for ppm and gc were conducted using the combination of cs615 time domain reflectometry tdr sensors and cs229 thermal conductivity suction sensors campbell scientific lt usa in the field while the measurements of wrc for oxidized shale and non oxidized shale were conducted using the pressure plate in the lab the k h function for each material was estimated using the measured ks values meiers et al 2011 and van genuchten mualem equations van genuchten 1980 the measured and fitted parameters of van genuchten mualem equations for each material are given in table 1 the k h relationship for each material based on the constant ks assumed for each soil after 2005 is shown in fig 4b 2 4 3 frozen soil hydraulic properties in the cm it is additionally necessary to specify how the soil hydraulic properties are modified in frozen conditions as liquid water in the pore space is replaced by ice assuming that the ice gauge pressure is fixed and that the osmotic pressure i e presence of salt is zero the change in water pressure within the liquid water of a partially frozen soil can be determined by the generalized clapeyron equation edlefsen and anderson 1943 geo slope international ltd 2018 3 dp dt ρ l l f t 0 where dp is the reduction in the equilibrium freezing pressure pa below atmospheric pressure corresponding to a reduction in temperature dt k below t0 k the freezing point of pure water at atmosphere pressure the freezing temperature for different parts of the pore space is calculated using 3 the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc determines the unfrozen water content as a function of temperature liu et al 2012 the sfcc is also affected by the presence of solutes in soil azmatch et al 2012 which decrease the freezing point of the pore water patterson and smith 1985 measured sfccs for silty clay at various solute concentrations and found the freezing point shifted from 1 0 c for a 10 g l 1 sample to 2 7 c for a 35 g l 1 sample the pmm and gc cover layers had a low aqueous solute salt concentration 0 1 1 5 g l 1 including soluble sulphate na k mg2 and ca2 while the oxidized shale pore water salt concentration ranged from 6 5 to 9 5 g l 1 and the unoxidized shale had a high salt concentration from 6 5 to 15 0 g l 1 kessler et al 2010 hilderman 2011 huang et al 2015b appels et al 2017 the freezing point for each soil was empirically estimated using the results of patterson and smith 1985 to create a freezing point temperature for pore water alone of 0 05 0 052 0 62 and 1 0 c for the pmm gc oxidized shale and non oxidized shale fig 4c respectively below the freezing point the sfcc was estimated using the following clapeyron equation based on the similarity between the rwc and sfcc azmatch et al 2012 ren et al 2017 4 ψ l f ρ w l n t 273 15 where ψ is matric potential kpa and t is the temperature k when soil temperature less than the freezing point the soil liquid water content can be determined using the sfcc fig 4c whereas the hydraulic conductivity of liquid water in frozen soil is obtained using the combination of the calculated matric suction using eq 4 and the k h relationship shown in fig 4b 2 4 4 soil thermal properties soil thermal properties are only used in the cm the bulk thermal conductivity k t kj d 1 m 1 k 1 of unfrozen and frozen soils was estimated as the volume weighted sum of the air water ice and soil phase johansen 1975 the bulk specific heat capacity c kj m 3 k 1 of unfrozen and frozen soil was estimated in the same way using the devries 1963 equation ignoring the heat capacity of air 5 c c l θ l c i θ i c s 1 n where cl ci and cs are volumetric heat capacities of liquid water ice and soil respectively and n is soil porosity in this study n was calculated using the measured soil bulk density and particle density 2 62 2 61 and 2 73 g cm 3 for ppm gc and shale respectively soil phase was equal to 1 n θl under unfrozen condition was estimated using eq 1 whereas θl and θi under the frozen condition were determined using the sfcc in fig 4c and eq 1 respectively k t and c for each dry material are shown in table 1 2 4 5 model domain eqs 1 and 2 were both solved numerically using a one dimensional finite element method for spatial discretization and finite differences for the temporal discretization the model domain was a 5 m deep profile including 0 2 m of pmm 0 8 m of gc 0 5 m of oxidized shale and 3 5 m of non oxidized shale fig 1c the spatial discretization size was 5 mm for peat mineral mixture 10 mm for gc 20 mm for oxidized shale and 50 mm for non oxidized shale the temporal step was set to be 0 02 day 2 4 6 water flow initial and boundary conditions an initial pressure head distribution developed from the observed water contents and the wrc was used as an initial condition in the model the lower boundary condition was set to be a unit gradient in addition a lateral free drainage boundary condition was specified at the cover shale interface in order to allow interflow to occur if positive pressures develop at this location the upper boundary condition was a soil vegetation atmosphere boundary which was comprised of two components the net infiltration at the ground surface and transpiration within the soil profile the net infiltration was calculated as follows 6 q p q sm q e q r q i where superscripts on water fluxes q mm d indicate rainfall p snow melt sm surface evaporation e runoff r and infiltration i transpiration was simulated using the model of feddes et al 2001 based on a specified normalized root density distribution in the profile potential plant transpiration and a water stress function huang et al 2015a the daily pet was calculated using the penman equation for evaporation from a wet surface shuttleworth 1993 the daily climatic data such as the maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity and net radiation were collected from the automated meteorological station on the d3 plot o kane consultants inc 2018 while daily wind speed at 2 m above the tree canopy was estimated using the 10 m measurements from mildred lake strilesky et al 2017 the pet was then partitioned into the pe and pt according to beer s law as a function of lai ritchie 1972 the actual soil evaporation with vegetation cover was calculated using the penman wilson equation wilson et al 1994 the snow melt flux was calculated differently for the cm and the fm for the cm the melt rate was simulated by crhm as described in section 2 3 for the fm a simple degree day method was used to calculate the snow melt flux qsm independent from the soil model it was assumed that the snowpack starts melting in the spring when air temperatures were above zero for five successive days the daily snow melt flux mm d 1 was calculated as li and simonovic 2002 carrera hernandez et al 2011 7 q sm 4 3 t air t thr where tair is air temperature and tthr is a threshold temperature equal to 0 c 2 4 7 heat transport initial and boundary conditions the initial temperature distribution was based on the observed temperature profile at the beginning of the simulation period the lower boundary condition was fixed to be 1 c at a depth of 5 m wall 2005 monitored soil temperature profiles at sbh and found that the soil temperature at the depth of 5 m was relatively constant at 1 c consistent with the average annual air temperatures at the site the upper boundary condition was set as the ground heat flux which was solved from the surface energy balance equation 8 g r n λ e t h where g is the ground heat flux kj m 2 d 1 rn is the measured net radiation flux kj m 2 d 1 λet is the latent heat flux kj m 2 d 1 and et value is calculated using water flow equation and h is the sensible heat flux kj m 2 d 1 and is calculated using the temperature at the top of the snow with snow cover or soil surface without snow cover the top temperature is determined using a non linear equation solution technique to satisfy eq 8 geo slope international ltd 2018 the upper boundary condition when the snowpack is present is a calculated conductive heat flux across the snowpack using the thermal conductivity of the snow and the air and ground surface temperatures the variations of snowpack thickness during the study period are shown in fig 3 while average snow density and thermal conductivity of snowpack were used to calculate the conductive heat transfer across the snowpack the measured snow density at the study site was ranged from 123 to 234 kg m 3 with an average of 162 kg m 3 the snowpack thermal conductivity was equal to 16 5 kj d 1 m 1 k 1 calculated using the average snow density and the empirical relationship of riche and schneebeli 2013 2 5 modifications of cm and fm as will be shown in the results section the cm model cannot simulate the infiltration of snow melt into the macropore dominated frozen ground profile as a result it was decided to adopt an alternative simplified approach to replicate the observed infiltration and redistribution of snow melt into the frozen soil profile previous work at the study site by kelln et al 2009 demonstrated that snow melt infiltration occurred into the soil macropores resulting in filling and refreezing of the macropores across the entire depth of the cover to the cover shale interface based on these observations the following methodology was adopted to simulate snow melt infiltration and redistribution within the cover snow melt is assumed to completely infiltrate if the cumulative volume of snow melt vsm is less than the available storage within the macropores over the depth of the cover and shallow oxidized shale if vsm is larger than the total available macropore storage the extra snow melt is assumed to be released as runoff over the frozen cover if the available snow melt is less than the available macropore storage then the infiltrated melt water is assumed to preferentially fill the macropores at the lower layers first the matrix pores between the macropores have a low infiltration capacity under frozen condition and infiltration into the matrix was ignored the methodology can be formulated as follows 9 v sm t 0 t n q sm d t where v sm mm is the volume of snowmelt between the start of melt t 0 and the end of melt t t n days this volume of water is partitioned sequentially between macropore storage in the layers and finally runoff 10 v os v sm v sm s os s os v sm s os 11 v g 0 v sm s os v sm s os v sm s os s g s g v sm s os s g 12 v p 0 v sm s os s g v sm s os s g v sm s os s g s p s p v sm s os s g s p 13 v p 0 v sm s os s g s p v sm s os s g s p v sm s os s g s p where v x mm is a volume of water diverted to a particular store or runoff s x mm is the macropore storage capacity within layer x and subscripts represent snowmelt sm oxidized shale os gc g pmm p and runoff r eqs 9 13 were incorporated into the cm as an external input function the new model is referred to as the coupled water and heat model with enhanced infiltration cm ei in this study as will be shown later in the case of the fm the application of snow melt as surface infiltration on unfrozen soil as described in eq 7 results in underestimation of snow melt runoff huang et al 2015a and also results in increases in water storage primarily within the upper pmm and then the gc portion of the cover profile to improve the fm the same approach i e eqs 9 13 was incorporated to establish the initial distribution of snow melt water once the ground thaws in the fm the combination of eqs 9 13 and the water dynamic model is defined as the flow model with enhanced infiltration fm ei in this study as shown in fig 4a the total macropore storage capacity of the cover and oxidized shale is approximately 52 1 mm based on the calculated macropore volumes this volume includes 11 6 mm for the pmm layer equal to 0 058 cm3 cm 3 200 mm 28 0 mm for the gc layer equal to 0 035 cm3 cm 3 800 mm and 12 5 mm for the oxidized shale equal to 0 025 cm3 cm 3 500 mm as a consequence any year with a swe greater than approximately 52 1 mm will result in runoff 3 results and discussion in this section we compare the simulations from the various models to the field observations some of these observations such as temperature are only indirectly related to the hydrological performance of the reclamation cover however simulating such observations provides confidence that the mechanisms controlling water and heat dynamics are being represented appropriately in the model therefore we examine all aspects of model performance that the data will allow we end with consideration of the water balance which is the most important metric from a cover performance standpoint 3 1 simulations of soil temperatures soil temperatures were simulated for the 15 water years of observational data using the cm and cm ei the comparisons between the measured and simulated temperatures at different depths for three example years 2005 2010 and 2015 are shown in fig 5 both models simulate nearly identical temperatures at a given depth this suggests that the enhanced snow melt infiltration with the cm ei did not have a significant impact on the energy balance the cm and cm ei models always underestimated soil temperatures during the frozen periods in the 0 90 cm profile but overestimated soil temperatures during unfrozen periods for the 0 30 cm layer this is likely due to lack of surface lfh or mulch layer in these models which might alter the rate of heat transfer in the surficial layers the presence of such layers above would decrease energy transfer from soil to air during the frozen periods and from air to soil during the unfrozen periods this would result in an overestimation of soil temperatures in the 0 30 cm layer and underestimattion of soil temperatures in the deeper layers 50 cm table 2 the small root mean square error rmse values shown in table 2 ranging from 0 9 c at 115 cm depth to 3 1 c at 5 cm depth with an average of 1 9 c indicate that the simulated and measured soil temperatures are in good agreement during the study period there also appears to be some systematic differences between the measured and simulated temperatures below a depth of 115 cm where the simulation predicts later thawing dates than observed fig 5 and table 2 the differences are larger at greater depths at a depth of 175 cm the maximum delay between the simulated and measured thawing date 40 days occurred for the 2014 water year a number of factors could cause the difference in the simulated and measured thawing dates zhao et al 2016 for example during the 2014 water year the monitored snow depth at the d3 cover was less than that at the fma weather station a shallower simulated snow cover than actual resulted in lower winter soil temperatures which required a greater time in the spring to cause thawing it is also possible that the presence of high salinity might result in a higher proportion of unfrozen water within the upper shale these differences in the sfcc would result in less stored energy within this part of the profile as a result of phase change fig 6 compares the simulated frozen temperature isotherm using cm ei with the measurement for each water year here the starting frozen temperatures were 0 05 0 052 0 62 and 1 0 c for the pmm gc oxidized shale and non oxidized shale respectively when the effect of soil salinity was taken into account fig 4c 3 2 simulations of soil water content the liquid soil water content swc was simulated for 15 complete water years using the cm and cm ei and for 15 unfrozen periods using the fm and fm ei respectively fig 7 shows the simulated and measured swc at six monitored depths for 2005 2010 and 2015 water years and unfrozen periods under unfrozen periods the four models produce very similar swc dynamics for the cover soils and any of the models appear to provide a reasonable representation of the variations in observed swc it is of note that the most dynamic and generally lower growing season swcs occurred in the shallow soil layers at depths of 5 and 20 cm within the pmm with less dynamic and generally higher swcs at deeper depths in the gc and underlying shale this is likely due in large part to the development of the rooting system over time a feature which is difficult to capture in the models the results measured by van rees 2014 indicated that fine root density distribution in d3 cover presented a large spatial variation with the maximum root depth ranging from 95 to 178 cm the relative fine root density distribution used in this model was a mean distribution which might not represent the actual fine distribution at the monitored location in addition the assumed linear growth of the maximum root depth with time might not represent the temporal variation of fine root density distribution the impact of the simple snowmelt infiltration algorithm is apparent in the simulated swc at depths below 50 cm with the cm ei the swc is increased relative to the cm since there is more infiltration and it is directly injected at deeper depths with the fm ei the swc is decreased relative to the fm because although infiltration is injected deeper the overall amount of infiltration is reduced and less than that with the fm with the fm snow melt does not produce runoff in any water year the mean differences in the simulated swc ranged from 0 006 to 0 046 cm3 cm 3 among the four models during the 15 year studied period table 3 presents the statistical results of rmse between the measured and simulated swcs during the unfrozen period for each model the accuracy of the simulations changes at different depths for each model the lowest rmse appears at the depth of 55 cm while the largest rmse appears at the depth of 5 cm the main reason is that the swc at the depth of 5 cm is sensitive to rainfall events and soil evaporation for the whole profile the four models have very similar accuracy measures with rmse values in the range of 0 040 cm3 cm 3 for the cm and cm ei to 0 042 cm3 cm 3 for the fm and fm ei these results suggest that any of the models would produce a similar representation of the dynamics in soil water content during the growing seasons 3 3 simulations of runoff table 4 shows the simulated runoff from snow melt and rainfall events for each water year using the four models the cm generated an average annual runoff of 71 mm 67 mm from snow melt 94 of swe and 4 mm from rainfall events in seep w the frozen soil hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of unfrozen soil using temperature and eq 3 watanabe and osada 2016 found that this approach underestimated liquid water content in the frozen soil which subsequently resulted in underestimation of hydraulic conductivity particularly near the melting temperature this modelling approach would result in an underestimation of snow melt infiltration and consequently an overestimation of snow melt runoff the opposite response was observed for annual runoff simulated by the fm in this case the annual average snow melt runoff was nearly non existent the simple assumption utilized in the fm is that the total snowpack volume becomes spring precipitation and results in infiltration and storage of the snow melt in the upper portion of the cover profile where it is readily available for release as transpiration the calculated snow melt runoff from the cm ei and fm ei models ranged from 0 mm in 2003 2006 and 2012 to 59 7 mm in 2008 with an average of 23 8 mm the simulated average runoff resulting from summer rainfall events was 4 6 mm for the cm ei and 1 9 mm for the fm ei the average total runoff was 28 4 mm for the cm ei and 25 7 mm for the fm ei table 4 fig 8 compares the annual total runoff simulated by cm cm ei fm and fm ei with the measurements for the period of 2001 2015 except for 2005 a year with exceptionally high summer precipitation the simulated values by the cm were larger than those measured in the case of the fm the simulated runoff was less than the measurements for all years except for 2012 when the measured runoff was only 1 0 mm the smallest value of runoff from 2003 to 2015 the simulated runoff values from the cm ei and fm ei were consistent with the field observations excluding 2005 the simulated mean runoff was 66 4 mm for cm 27 3 mm for the cm ei 2 0 mm for fm and 25 7 mm for the fm ei whereas the measured mean runoff was 24 9 mm 3 4 simulations of actual evapotranspiration fig 9 compares the cumulative eta measured during the growing season at the adjacent plateau site location as well as the simulated values using the four models the measured values were based on eddy covariance measurements ecm as reported by carey 2008 carey et al 2011 and strilesky et al 2017 the plateau is immediately adjacent to the d3 cover but had a thicker cover nominally 120 cm in thickness it was also reclaimed and revegetated approximately 2 years after the d3 cover site in addition since the plateau is elevated and relatively flat the flux tower is more exposed to wind with less runoff than the d3 cover where the average slope is 20 fig 1 the height of eddy covariance tower was adjusted at the beginning of several growing seasons 2 9 m in 2003 2 96 m in 2007 4 63 m in 2009 7 10 m in 2011 then 8 25 m in 2014 as the vegetation canopy height increased strilesky et al 2017 the differences in measured and simulated eta are unsurprising but the seasonal and interannual patterns are insightful typically the simulated cumulative eta values were less than the measured values exceptions were the growing seasons of 2004 2005 and 2007 comparing the models we see that simulated eta increases with increasing spring infiltration this is the maximum in the fm model because the soils are unfrozen and the infiltration capacity is usually above the estimated snowmelt rates next the fm ei and cm ei models have very similar et with slightly higher values for the fm ei model this is because the snowmelt infiltration is imposed on these models so is almost the same and there may be slightly less rainfall infiltration in the cm ei model when the soils are still frozen finally eta is lowest in the cm model because most of the snowmelt over frozen soils is lost to runoff 3 5 simulations of net percolation and interflow the simulated net percolation rates for each water year using four models are shown in fig 10 there are no annual direct measurements of net percolation however the previous estimates of net percolation obtained by hilderman 2011 based on profiles of the stable isotopes of water were used as the basis of comparison these isotope based estimates of net percolation were for cumulative net percolation from 1999 to 2009 at 8 locations on the d3 cover and plateau these values are presented in fig 10 as a basis of comparison to the simulated results hilderman 2011 noted that the average net percolation rate was a function of topographic position varying from a maximum of 34 1 mm a 1 at plateau locations to minimum of 3 5 mm a 1 on the d3 slope with a mean of 14 3 mm a 1 huang et al 2015b the four models had a similar range of average annual net percolation as observed by huang et al 2015b with the highest values being those obtained from the cm ei and fm models approximately 16 18 mm a 1 and somewhat lower values obtained with the cm and fm ei models approximately 13 14 mm a 1 the main reason for these differences are likely due to the increased snow melt infiltration that occurred with the cm ei and fm models the average interflow measure at the toe of the d3 cover from 2001 to 2015 was 2 6 mm a 1 only the fm model predicted any interflow in this case only 1 9 mm a 1 no attempt was made to calibrate the models to this observation given the relatively small component of the water balance that this comprises and given its sensitivity to model parameters such as the ks of the unoxidized shale or the water retention properties of the oxidized shale 4 conclusions a comparison of alternative approaches for modelling the hydrological processes in seasonally frozen soils was undertaken focusing on how various approaches to simulating snow melt infiltration may have an impact on the overall water balance components four models were applied to the field site to examine i whether additional process insights and or improvements to model performance can be achieved by simulating the entire year including the winter period with a state of the art physically based coupled flow and heat transport model and ii whether enhanced infiltration algorithms improve the water balance simulations conventional frozen soil infiltration runoff algorithms tend to overestimate runoff and underestimate infiltration the enhanced infiltration algorithms used here involve forcing infiltration into the frozen soil based on an assessment of the storage capacity of the macropores and the volume of snowmelt the models were applied to a well monitored reclamation hillslope that has been studied over a period of 15 years following its construction during which time the soils have developed and vegetation has become well established models were parameterized with field observations of soil hydraulic properties the coupled flow and heat models were able to provide a reasonable simulation of the soil temperature dynamics under both frozen and unfrozen conditions this is potentially useful information for modelling the energy balance soil cover evolution in response to freeze thaw cycles as well as geochemical processes however from a water balance perspective this information would only be useful if we have improved physically based infiltration algorithms with a conventional infiltration algorithm we found that the coupled model overpredicted runoff as expected with the enhanced infiltration algorithm the performance was improved but similar performance was achieved using the simpler water balance model whereby the winter period was not simulated explicitly while the simulations of evapotranspiration could not be rigorously validated against flux tower observations the models do predict increasing growing season evapotranspiration with increasing snowmelt infiltration consistent with general understanding and highlighting the importance of the snowmelt infiltration process the best simulations were those that applied enhanced infiltration whether or not heat transport was coupled to the flow model we conclude that with existing models that are available there is not enough benefit to the simulated water balance to justify the considerable additional effort and computational resources required to parameterize and implement a coupled flow and heat transport modelling approach our recommendation for best practice for simulating the water balance in seasonally frozen soils such as those found in reclamation covers in northern alberta is to apply water balance richards equation models to the unfrozen period of the year driven with observed or simulated snow water equivalent which is partitioned between infiltration and runoff using a simple enhanced infiltration algorithm such as was applied in this study

6942,reference evapotranspiration et 0 is an important parameter for climatological and hydrological studies as well as for agricultural water resources management in this study 7 temperature based solar radiation models were adopted to improve the makkink model for et 0 estimation in northwest china the temperature based models only require air temperature as input data which can be easily monitored in most areas around the world the applicability of the improved makkink models m1 m7 the original makkink mk model the jensen haise jh model as well as the irmak ik model were evaluated on different time scales using meteorological data obtained from 12 weather stations in northwest china the results showed that the 7 improved makkink mki models r 2 ranged 0 71 0 86 were more accurate than the 3 physical models r 2 ranged 0 64 0 76 for daily et 0 estimation at the 4 sub zones of northwest china and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 models were superior to the other models the m5 model had the best estimation accuracy for daily et 0 on daily scale followed by m7 and m6 with the r 2 median of 0 83 0 83 and 0 82 the rmse median of 0 86 0 88 and 0 89 mm d and the gpi median of 1 03 0 90 and 0 87 respectively on monthly scale the 7 mki models with relative error almost less than 20 were also better than the 3 physical models with relative error usually more than 20 at the 4 sub zones the m5 model also showed the best performance for monthly average daily et 0 estimation followed by m7 and m6 with the r 2 median of 1 00 1 00 and 1 00 the rmse median of 0 13 0 16 and 0 19 mm d and the gpi median of 0 25 0 05 and 0 02 respectively overall the estimation accuracy of the makkink model was much improved by using the temperature based solar radiation models and in northwest china m5 model which only requires temperature and relative humidity as input data is highly recommended to estimate et 0 on both daily and monthly scales keywords reference evapotranspiration solar radiation temperature makkink model northwest china 1 introduction water resources scarcity is the most limiting factor for agricultural production food security and ecological restoration in the arid climate conditions in northwest china li et al 2018 popularizing and applying precision irrigation system is of vital importance for improving the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources especially in arid areas li et al 2017 the establishment of precision irrigation system depends on the accurate evapotranspiration forecast yang et al 2016 therefore accurate meteorological data is particularly important in china only the areas above county level have standard national meteorological stations due to the expensive instruments and maintenance requirements and these stations have a certain spatial limitations with the development of modern agricultural irrigation system the research of evapotranspiration forecast under the limited input condition is a significant job which can not only improve the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources but also reduce the economic input reference evapotranspiration et 0 is a concentrated expression of the effects of various meteorological conditions on crop water requirements wang et al 2008 accurate estimation of et 0 is of vital importance not only for the study of global climate change environmental problems and evaluation of water resources but also for irrigation guidance agricultural drought monitoring and improving the utilization of agricultural water resources especially in arid regions zhang et al 2012 fan et al 2016 the application of lysimeters is often considered as an accurate and effective method for et 0 estimation however compared with the direct climate based measurement at weather stations lysimeters are unsuitable for monitoring evapotranspiration tabari et al 2012 this is not only due to their costs and complexity but also due to the limited footprint area of a typical weather station which does not provide sufficient fetch from the representative surface to make these measurements meaningful sentelhas et al 2010 in practice climatic data from a weather station are often used for et 0 estimation xing et al 2008 numerous methods have been developed for estimating et 0 from climatic data based on the assumption and input data they are roughly classified as combination based temperature based radiation based pan evaporation based and mass transfer based methods feng et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the food and agriculture organization fao version of the penman monteith pm model allen et al 1998 fao 56 pm established based on the principles of aerodynamic and energy balance has taken all influencing factors of et 0 into consideration and it is generally considered to be the best approach for estimating et 0 because of its good approximation to lysimeter observations allen et al 1998 muniandy et al 2016 however the fao 56 pm model requires many climatic variables including solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and air temperatures sometimes these input variables are incomplete or not available for a given location especially in developing countries traore et al 2010 xu et al 2017 an ideal model used for et 0 estimation should be selected based on minimal input data without affecting the estimation accuracy shih 1984 feng et al 2017a thus several simplified empirical models that require less parameters have been developed under different climate conditions such as hargreaves turc blaney criddle priestley taylor makkink fao24 radiation jensen haise and irmak models kashyap and panda 2001 xu and singh 2001 trajkovic 2007 muniandy et al 2016 xu et al 2016 in addition the air temperature and solar radiation explain a high amount of et 0 variability priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 martí et al 2015 yoder et al 2005 evaluated eight et 0 models at a humid station in southeast u s and found the best performance of fao 56 pm model followed by penman 1948 and turc models and hargreaves model showed the worst performance muniandy et al 2016 compared 26 et 0 models against lysimeter measurements at the modern agriculture centre in kluang malaysia and found the penman 1948 model from the mass transfer group was found to be the best model for estimating daily et 0 and followed by fao 56 pm makkink and szasz models from the combination based radiation based and temperature based group respectively berengena and gavilán 2005 tested several et 0 models in the semi arid region of spain and found the poor performance of priestley taylor model because the priestley taylor model was originally developed for humid areas liu et al 2017 compared 16 models for predicting et 0 against weighting lysimeter measurement at a semiarid site in china and revealed that the best combination based model fao ppp 17 penman was more accurate than the best radiation based fao 24 radiation and temperature based fao 24 blaney criddle models better performances of the combination and radiation models resulted from their incorporation of dominant factors influencing et 0 previous studies have verified the applicability of makkink jensen haise and irmak models in northwest china wu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 therefore this study chose these three models for et 0 estimation in northwest china solar radiation r s is the primary input for et 0 estimation tabari et al 2016 the best method to determine r s at any site is to install measuring instruments such as pyranometer or pyrheliometer at every specific location which is a very tedious and costly exercise besharat et al 2013 in fact the reliable measurements of r s data are relatively scarce in many developing countries due to the expensive instruments technical equipment and maintenance requirements fan et al 2018a furthermore even for those stations where r s are observed there are many r s data which are missing or lie outside the expected range due to equipment failure and other problems hunta et al 1998 abraha and savage 2008 liu et al 2009 currently only 122 among 752 national meteorological stations in china have r s measuring instruments pan et al 2013 thus the meteorological data based models depend on the most common meteorological elements including cloud cover sunshine duration air temperature and relative humidity making them the most frequently used around the world especially the sunshine based and temperature based models hargreaves and samani 1982 besharat et al 2013 hassan et al 2016 fan et al 2018b chen et al 2004 found the sunshine based models were more suitable for daily r s estimation in china compared with temperature based models and the bahel model bahel et al 1987 provided the best results followed by angström model liu et al 2009 evaluated the accuracy of 16 temperature based models including modified versions of the bristow campbell bc and the hargreaves samani hs models in northeast north china plain and northwest china and the results showed that the original bc model performed similarly to the best performing modified hs model but significantly outperformed the original hs model with a 4 7 higher accuracy in general the sunshine based models are more accurate for estimating r s than other meteorological parameter based models mostafa et al 2014 hassan et al 2016 fan et al 2018c however it is often limited by lack of sunshine duration records hassan et al 2016 in this context r s estimation models based on air temperatures are attractive and viable options almorox et al 2013 in spite of the importance of r s for estimating et 0 studies on the impact of local calibration of radiation models to improve the accuracy of the calibrated et 0 models are also significant tabari et al 2016 the main goals of this paper are to i improve the makkink model for et 0 estimation by using 7 temperature based r s models ii evaluate the estimation accuracy of makkink jensen haise irmak and the 7 improved makkink models for et 0 estimation in northwest china on different time scales and iii propose the recommended model for et 0 estimation in northwest china on different time scales 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and data set northwest china is located in the northern and northeastern tibetan plateau 73 42 110 92 e and 31 58 49 25 n covering xinjiang qinghai gansu ningxia shanxi except the southern region of shanxi and the western region of inner mongolia which approximately accounts for one third of the land area of the people s republic of china li et al 2013 the study area has abundant light and heat resources but the population distribution is extremely sparse with a fragile ecological environment and under developing economy mainly due to the arid climate ma et al 2005 the climate is dominated by continental arid conditions and is primarily influenced by westerly circulation and less influenced by east asian monsoon liu et al 2010 annual average precipitation and temperature data from 156 meteorological stations in northwest china were used for systematic cluster analysis and the northwest china was divided into 4 sub zones by considering the topography

rigorously controlled by omitting data points based on rules in liu et al 2009 the annual means of main meteorological variables during 1990 2016 are presented in table 1 2 2 calculation of reference evapotranspiration 2 2 1 fao 56 penman monteith model experimental et 0 data were unavailable at the study area therefore et 0 values estimated by fao 56 pm model were considered as the targets to validate the other models which was an acceptable and common practice in this situation feng et al 2017b the equation of fao 56 pm model is expressed as 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ

1998 2 2 2 makkink model mk de bruin 1987 introduced the simplified version of the makkink model makkink 1957 which could provide reliable estimates of et 0 using only daily r s and t observations following this approach daily et 0 can be computed as the following equation 4 e t 0 c mak 1 λ δ δ γ r s where et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm d r s is solar radiation mj m2 d λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg and cmak is an empirical coefficient depending on climate conditions de bruin 1987 suggested a value of 0 65 for the cmak 2 2 3 jensen haise model jh jensen and haise 1963 evaluated numerous evapotranspiration observations by soil sampling and derived the jensen haise model the equation is presented as follows 5 e t 0 0 025 t 0 08 r s λ 2 2 4 irmak model ik irmak

extraterrestrial radiation mj m2 d t max and t min are the maximum and minimum daily temperature c respectively p s is the atmospheric pressure at the site kpa p 0 is the atmospheric pressure at sea level kpa k r and k ra are empirical coefficients 2 annandale model annandale et al 2002 derived a model based on hargreaves samani model by considering the effects of reduced altitude and atmospheric thickness on r s 9 r s a 1 2 7 10 5 z t max t min 0 5 r a where z is the altitude of the site km and a is empirical coefficient 3 hargreaves model hargreaves and samani 1982 recommended a simple equation to estimate r s which required only maximum and minimum temperature data 10 r s a t max t min 0 5 r a 4 chen model chen et al 2004 presented the following model 11 r s a ln t max t min b r a

3 improvement of makkink model in this paper the 7 temperature based solar radiation models were adopted to replace the r s values in makkink model the empirical coefficients of the makkink models were calibrated based on the least square method using the meteorological variables during period of 1990 2010 obtained from 12 stations in northwest china the improved makkink models m1 m7 are presented in table 2 2 4 performance evaluation the accuracy and performance of the studied models to estimate et 0 were evaluated using the meteorological variables during 2011 2016 in terms of following statistical error tests coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and mean absolute error mae which are defined in the following equations

dimensionless ranging from 1 perfect fit to the worst fit 2 5 global performance indicator in order to overcome the discrepancy and to further improve the outcomes of statistical analysis a new factor proposed by despotovic et al 2015 known as global performance indicator gpi was applied which was a worthy tool to combine the effects of individual statistical indicators the equation is presented as follows 19 gp i i j 1 4 α j y j y ij where αj equals 1 for the indicator r 2 and ns while for others indicators is equal to 1 yj is the median of scaled values of indicator j yij is the scaled value of indicator j for model i higher value of gpi results in more accuracy of a model 3 results 3 1 parameters of improved makkink models the empirical parameters of the 7 improved makkink mki models were calibrated based on the least square method for et 0 estimation in northwest china and the adjusted parameters are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the calibrated a ranged between 0 11 0 20 0 09 0 18 and 0 10 0 19 for m1 m2 and m3 respectively with average of 0 16 0 14 and 0 15 respectively the calibrated a and b of m4 ranged between 0 15 to 0 11 and 0 16 1 07 respectively with average of 0 01 and 0 58 respectively the calibrated a and c of m5 ranged between 0 51 0 84 and 0 52 to 0 08 respectively with average of 0 69 and 0 24 respectively and the calibrated b were 0 00 for all the stations the calibrated a b and c of m6 ranged between 0 44 0 78 0 13 2 30 and 0 21 6 89 respectively with average of 0 58 0 64 and 1 96 respectively the calibrated a b and c of m7 ranged between 0 39 0 70 3 95 37 33 and 0 38 6 62 respectively with average of 0 58 16 63 and 1 85 respectively the regression coefficients in the presented models differed from location to location this can be due to local and seasonal changes in the type and thickness of cloud cover the effects of snow covered surfaces the concentrations of pollutants as well as the latitude besharat et al 2013 3 2 performances of et 0 models on a daily basis the statistical performances of the analyzed models in estimating daily et 0 for the 4 sub zones in northwest china are shown in table 4 the statistical results showed that the 7 mki models m1 m7 were more accurate than the 3 physical models for daily et 0 estimation at the 4 sub zones of northwest china and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 were superior to the other models in tcaz the m5 showed the best estimation accuracy among the 10 models followed by m4 and m7 with average r 2 of 0 83 0 82 and 0 82 average rmse of 0 90 0 92 and 0 92 mm d average ns of 0 83 0 82 and 0 82 average mae of 0 66 0 67 and 0 67 mm d and gpi of 1 17 1 10 and 1 06 respectively in tchaz the m5 also showed the best estimation accuracy among the 10 models followed by m4 and m7 with average r 2 of 0 84 0 82 and 0 81 average rmse of 0 88 0 93 and 0 95 mm d average ns of 0 84 0 82 and 0 81 average mae of 0 62 0 66 and 0 67 mm d and gpi of 1 39 1 18 and 1 08 respectively in pcsz the m5 had the best estimation accuracy followed by m7 and m6 with average r 2 of 0 86 0 85 and 0 84 average rmse of 0 56 0 58 and 0 58 mm d average ns of 0 86 0 84 and 0 84 average mae of 0 42 0 44 and 0 44 mm d and gpi of 0 93 0 75 and 0 74 respectively in tmsz the m5 had the best estimation accuracy followed by m7 and m6 with average r 2 of 0 80 0 78 and 0 78 average rmse of 0 91 0 94 and 0 95 mm d average ns of 0 80 0 78 and 0 78 average mae of 0 68 0 70 and 0 71 mm d and gpi of 1 12 0 94 and 0 88 respectively the mk model showed the worst performance in tcaz tchaz and tmsz followed by jh and ik models in pcsz jh model showed the worst performance followed by mk and ik models overall the m5 showed the best performance at the 4 sub zones and it was thus recommended to estimate daily et 0 in tcaz tchaz pcsz and tmsz in order to evaluate the et 0 estimation accuracy of the 10 models in northwest china boxplots with respect to performance of each model are presented in fig 2 as it can be seen from fig 2 the 7 mki models m1 m7 were also more accurate for daily et 0 estimation in northwest china compared with the 3 physical models and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 were superior to the other models in terms of daily et 0 for instance the median line of pm model was 3 50 mm d and the 7 mki models ranged between 3 39 and 3 52 mm d on average 3 44 mm d whereas the other models ranged between 2 34 and 2 88 mm d on average 2 63 mm d this implies the fact that overall the mki models could estimate the daily et 0 more accurately than the physical models at all stations in addition the daily et 0 values estimated by jh model had negative numbers which may be caused by the low temperature in winter a comparison between the values of r 2 rmse mae and ns also revealed that the 7 mki models were more accurate the median ranged between 0 77 0 83 on average 0 80 0 86 1 06 mm d on average 0 96 mm d 0 64 0 80 mm d on average 0 72 mm d and 0 75 0 83 on average 0 79 respectively while the median lines of r 2 rmse mae and ns for the 3 physical models varied between 0 69 0 74 on average 0 72 1 43 1 76 on average 1 61 mm d 1 10 1 40 on average 1 29 mm d and 0 29 0 52 on average 0 38 respectively according to the boxplots with respect to gpi the m5 had the highest median line followed by m7 m6 and m4 with median of 1 03 0 90 0 87 and 0 86 respectively while mk had the lowest median line followed by jh and ik models with median of 2 77 2 08 and 1 34 respectively this also implied that the m5 had the best estimation accuracy for daily et 0 followed by m7 m6 and m4 and m5 was further recommended to estimate daily et 0 in northwest china 3 3 performances of et 0 models on a monthly basis comparisons of monthly average daily et 0 et 0 mad and relative error re of different models for each sub zone are presented in fig 3 all the et 0 mad estimated by the studied models presented parabolic variations with lower et 0 values less than 2 12 mm d in winter dec feb and higher values more than 3 36 mm d in summer jun aug in tcaz tchaz pcsz and tmsz re values of the 7 mki models ranged 28 51 to 3 59 20 55 to 5 11 7 72 to 13 06 and 20 11 to 4 94 respectively and re values of the 3 physical models ranged 84 97 to 13 95 86 11 to 13 27 63 65 to 12 93 and 79 89 to 7 26 respectively all the models showed a higher accuracy for et 0 mad estimation in pcsz compared with the other 3 sub zones the 7 mki models were more accurate than the 3 physical models for et 0 mad estimation at the 4 sub zones in addition the 7 mki models showed a trend of higher accuracy for et 0 mad estimation during apr oct at the 4 sub zones with average re less than 5 37 5 25 7 77 and 8 05 respectively the 3 physical models also showed a higher accuracy in summer and lower accuracy in winter but the re values were obviously larger than those of the 7 mki models overall the m5 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation in tcaz pcsz and tmsz with average re of 4 16 3 12 and 3 33 respectively however the m4 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation in tchaz with average re of 2 45 these models were recommended to estimate et 0 mad for at corresponding sub zones boxplots with respect to performances of the 10 studied models are presented in fig 4 from the boxplots given in fig 4 it can be seen that the 7 mki models were also more accurate for et 0 mad estimation in northwest china and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 were superior to the other models on monthly scale in terms of et 0 mad for instance the median lines of pm model was 3 67 mm d and the 7 mki models ranged 3 54 and 3 67 mm d on average 3 61 mm d whereas those physical models ranged 2 44 3 02 mm d on average 2 74 mm d this revealed that the mk jh and ik models trended to underestimated et 0 on monthly scale obviously comparison between the values of r 2 rmse mae and ns also revealed that the 7 mki models were more accurate with the median ranging 1 00 1 00 on average 1 00 0 13 0 21 mm d on average 0 18 mm d 0 10 0 18 mm d on average 0 16 mm d and 0 99 1 00 on average 0 99 respectively while the median lines of r 2 rmse mae and ns for the 3 physical models varied 0 97 0 99 on average 0 98 1 01 1 44 on average 1 17 mm d 0 93 1 32 on average 1 07 mm d and 0 42 0 69 on average 0 57 respectively according to the boxplots with respect to gpi the m5 had the highest median line followed by m7 and m6 with median of 0 25 0 05 and 0 02 respectively however the mk model had the lowest median line followed by jh and ik models with median of 2 75 2 72 and 2 17 respectively this also implied that the m5 had the best estimation accuracy for et 0 mad estimation followed by m7 and m6 and the m5 was recommended to estimate daily et 0 mad in northwest china 4 discussion previous studies zhang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 showed that the radiation based models were more accurate than the temperature based models the calculation methods of the above models are relatively simple because they only require air temperature and solar radiation data for et 0 estimation zhang et al 2015 evaluated the applicability of 5 temperature based and radiation based models against the pm model in xinxiang china and found the irmak model showed a good performance with r 2 around 1 0 and relative error less than 20 wu et al 2016 compared 15 different models for et 0 estimation in northwest china the results showed that the makkink and irmak models can accurately estimate daily et 0 with r 2 0 73 liu et al 2017 compared 16 models for et 0 estimation in semiarid regions of china and found that jensen haise and makkink models performed well for et 0 estimation whereas the jensen haise model was more accurate than makkink model in this paper the irmak model showed the best performance for daily et 0 and et 0 mad estimation among the 3 physical models followed by jensen haise and makkink models the irmak model is a multivariate linear regression method to estimate et 0 based on the air temperature and solar radiation data which are the dominant factors influencing et 0 and it is consistent with the results in the previous research the results indicated that m5 had the best estimation accuracy for daily et 0 in northwest china followed by m7 m6 and m4 the m5 was the improved makkink model using the ei sebail radiation model the ei sebail model estimated r s based on the air temperature and relative humidity data cao et al 2011 analyzed the sensitivity of et 0 in northwest china and found that the shortwave radiation was the most sensitive variable to et 0 followed by air temperature and relative humidity with average absolute sensitivity coefficients of 0 61 0 39 and 0 33 respectively whereas wind speed had the least impact with average absolute sensitivity coefficient of 0 18 the main reason for the highest accuracy of m5 was because it took into account the effect of relative humidity while the other models did not m6 m7 and m4 also showed a good performance for et 0 estimation in northwest china the 3 models were calibrated by using the bristow campbell model goodin model and chen model which can estimate r s accurately based on the temperature difference with the exponential function and logarithmic functions respectively the estimation accuracy of m1 m2 and m3 was slightly lower than that of m4 m7 and they were improved by using the allen annandale and hargreaves models with simple monomial expressions comparing the performances of m1 m2 and m3 we can found that considering parameters such as altitude and atmospheric pressure cannot further improve the accuracy of the models yao et al 2014 evaluated 108 models for r s estimation in shanghai china the results showed that considering direct parameters such as solar altitude and sunshine duration can help improve the accuracy of the models but indirect parameters cannot for existing daily r s models multi parameter models were more accurate than single parameter models and polynomial models were more accurate than linear models in addition the 7 improved makkink models m1 m7 were more accurate than the 3 physical models makkink jensen haise and irmak for daily et 0 estimation in northwest china this was largely resulted from the calibration of empirical parameters of the 7 mki models makkink jensen haise and irmak modesl are empirical models for et 0 estimation based on air temperature and solar radiation variables although the air temperature and solar radiation are closely related to et 0 it is not completely corresponding the influencing factors of et 0 zhang et al 2018 in addition most of the existing simple empirical et 0 models can not accurately imitate the change mechanisms of et 0 because of the single input parameter which leads to a certain degree of uncertainty in these models the main way to reduce the uncertainty and improve the calculation accuracy of the simple empirical models is to localize the parameters of these models liu and pan 2012 5 conclusions in the present study 7 temperature based solar radiation models were adopted to improve the makkink model m1 m7 for et 0 estimation in northwest china based on the least square method using the meteorological variables during 1990 2010 obtained from 12 stations the applicability of the improved makkink mki models original makkink model jensen haise model

of this study are shown as follows 1 the 7 mki models r 2 ranged 0 71 0 86 were more accurate compared with the 3 physical models r 2 ranged 0 64 0 76 for daily et 0 estimation at the 4 sub zones of northwest china and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 were superior to the other models m5 showed the highest estimation accuracy in tcaz tchaz pcsz and tmsz with average r 2 of 0 83 0 84 0 86 and 0 80 average rmse of 0 90 0 88 0 56 and 0 91 mm d average ns of 0 83 0 84 0 86 and 0 80 average mae of 0 66 0 62 0 42 and 0 68 mm d and gpi of 1 17 1 39 0 93 and 1 12 respectively for the whole study region m5 also had

dec feb and higher values were in summer jun aug at the 4 sub zones the 7 mki models with re almost less than 20 also showed a better performance than the 3 physical models with re usually more than 20 m5 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation in tcaz pcsz and tmsz with average re of 4 16 3 12 and 3 33 respectively and m4 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation in tchaz with average re of 2 45 for the whole research region the m5 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation followed by m7 and m6 with the r 2 median of 1 00 1 00 and 1 00 the rmse median of 0 13 0 16 and 0 19 mm d the mae median of 0 10 0 14 and 0 17 mm d the ns median of 1 00 0 99 and 0 99 and the gpi median of 0 25 0 05 and 0 02 respectively 3 overall the present study found the mki models had a better performance for et 0 estimation in northwest china compared with the original makkink jensen haise and irmak models the m5 which only requires air temperature and relative humidity as input data is highly recommended to estimate et 0 on both daily and monthly scale acknowledgments we would like to thank the national climatic centre of the china meteorological administration for

6942,reference evapotranspiration et 0 is an important parameter for climatological and hydrological studies as well as for agricultural water resources management in this study 7 temperature based solar radiation models were adopted to improve the makkink model for et 0 estimation in northwest china the temperature based models only require air temperature as input data which can be easily monitored in most areas around the world the applicability of the improved makkink models m1 m7 the original makkink mk model the jensen haise jh model as well as the irmak ik model were evaluated on different time scales using meteorological data obtained from 12 weather stations in northwest china the results showed that the 7 improved makkink mki models r 2 ranged 0 71 0 86 were more accurate than the 3 physical models r 2 ranged 0 64 0 76 for daily et 0 estimation at the 4 sub zones of northwest china and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 models were superior to the other models the m5 model had the best estimation accuracy for daily et 0 on daily scale followed by m7 and m6 with the r 2 median of 0 83 0 83 and 0 82 the rmse median of 0 86 0 88 and 0 89 mm d and the gpi median of 1 03 0 90 and 0 87 respectively on monthly scale the 7 mki models with relative error almost less than 20 were also better than the 3 physical models with relative error usually more than 20 at the 4 sub zones the m5 model also showed the best performance for monthly average daily et 0 estimation followed by m7 and m6 with the r 2 median of 1 00 1 00 and 1 00 the rmse median of 0 13 0 16 and 0 19 mm d and the gpi median of 0 25 0 05 and 0 02 respectively overall the estimation accuracy of the makkink model was much improved by using the temperature based solar radiation models and in northwest china m5 model which only requires temperature and relative humidity as input data is highly recommended to estimate et 0 on both daily and monthly scales keywords reference evapotranspiration solar radiation temperature makkink model northwest china 1 introduction water resources scarcity is the most limiting factor for agricultural production food security and ecological restoration in the arid climate conditions in northwest china li et al 2018 popularizing and applying precision irrigation system is of vital importance for improving the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources especially in arid areas li et al 2017 the establishment of precision irrigation system depends on the accurate evapotranspiration forecast yang et al 2016 therefore accurate meteorological data is particularly important in china only the areas above county level have standard national meteorological stations due to the expensive instruments and maintenance requirements and these stations have a certain spatial limitations with the development of modern agricultural irrigation system the research of evapotranspiration forecast under the limited input condition is a significant job which can not only improve the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources but also reduce the economic input reference evapotranspiration et 0 is a concentrated expression of the effects of various meteorological conditions on crop water requirements wang et al 2008 accurate estimation of et 0 is of vital importance not only for the study of global climate change environmental problems and evaluation of water resources but also for irrigation guidance agricultural drought monitoring and improving the utilization of agricultural water resources especially in arid regions zhang et al 2012 fan et al 2016 the application of lysimeters is often considered as an accurate and effective method for et 0 estimation however compared with the direct climate based measurement at weather stations lysimeters are unsuitable for monitoring evapotranspiration tabari et al 2012 this is not only due to their costs and complexity but also due to the limited footprint area of a typical weather station which does not provide sufficient fetch from the representative surface to make these measurements meaningful sentelhas et al 2010 in practice climatic data from a weather station are often used for et 0 estimation xing et al 2008 numerous methods have been developed for estimating et 0 from climatic data based on the assumption and input data they are roughly classified as combination based temperature based radiation based pan evaporation based and mass transfer based methods feng et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the food and agriculture organization fao version of the penman monteith pm model allen et al 1998 fao 56 pm established based on the principles of aerodynamic and energy balance has taken all influencing factors of et 0 into consideration and it is generally considered to be the best approach for estimating et 0 because of its good approximation to lysimeter observations allen et al 1998 muniandy et al 2016 however the fao 56 pm model requires many climatic variables including solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and air temperatures sometimes these input variables are incomplete or not available for a given location especially in developing countries traore et al 2010 xu et al 2017 an ideal model used for et 0 estimation should be selected based on minimal input data without affecting the estimation accuracy shih 1984 feng et al 2017a thus several simplified empirical models that require less parameters have been developed under different climate conditions such as hargreaves turc blaney criddle priestley taylor makkink fao24 radiation jensen haise and irmak models kashyap and panda 2001 xu and singh 2001 trajkovic 2007 muniandy et al 2016 xu et al 2016 in addition the air temperature and solar radiation explain a high amount of et 0 variability priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 martí et al 2015 yoder et al 2005 evaluated eight et 0 models at a humid station in southeast u s and found the best performance of fao 56 pm model followed by penman 1948 and turc models and hargreaves model showed the worst performance muniandy et al 2016 compared 26 et 0 models against lysimeter measurements at the modern agriculture centre in kluang malaysia and found the penman 1948 model from the mass transfer group was found to be the best model for estimating daily et 0 and followed by fao 56 pm makkink and szasz models from the combination based radiation based and temperature based group respectively berengena and gavilán 2005 tested several et 0 models in the semi arid region of spain and found the poor performance of priestley taylor model because the priestley taylor model was originally developed for humid areas liu et al 2017 compared 16 models for predicting et 0 against weighting lysimeter measurement at a semiarid site in china and revealed that the best combination based model fao ppp 17 penman was more accurate than the best radiation based fao 24 radiation and temperature based fao 24 blaney criddle models better performances of the combination and radiation models resulted from their incorporation of dominant factors influencing et 0 previous studies have verified the applicability of makkink jensen haise and irmak models in northwest china wu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 therefore this study chose these three models for et 0 estimation in northwest china solar radiation r s is the primary input for et 0 estimation tabari et al 2016 the best method to determine r s at any site is to install measuring instruments such as pyranometer or pyrheliometer at every specific location which is a very tedious and costly exercise besharat et al 2013 in fact the reliable measurements of r s data are relatively scarce in many developing countries due to the expensive instruments technical equipment and maintenance requirements fan et al 2018a furthermore even for those stations where r s are observed there are many r s data which are missing or lie outside the expected range due to equipment failure and other problems hunta et al 1998 abraha and savage 2008 liu et al 2009 currently only 122 among 752 national meteorological stations in china have r s measuring instruments pan et al 2013 thus the meteorological data based models depend on the most common meteorological elements including cloud cover sunshine duration air temperature and relative humidity making them the most frequently used around the world especially the sunshine based and temperature based models hargreaves and samani 1982 besharat et al 2013 hassan et al 2016 fan et al 2018b chen et al 2004 found the sunshine based models were more suitable for daily r s estimation in china compared with temperature based models and the bahel model bahel et al 1987 provided the best results followed by angström model liu et al 2009 evaluated the accuracy of 16 temperature based models including modified versions of the bristow campbell bc and the hargreaves samani hs models in northeast north china plain and northwest china and the results showed that the original bc model performed similarly to the best performing modified hs model but significantly outperformed the original hs model with a 4 7 higher accuracy in general the sunshine based models are more accurate for estimating r s than other meteorological parameter based models mostafa et al 2014 hassan et al 2016 fan et al 2018c however it is often limited by lack of sunshine duration records hassan et al 2016 in this context r s estimation models based on air temperatures are attractive and viable options almorox et al 2013 in spite of the importance of r s for estimating et 0 studies on the impact of local calibration of radiation models to improve the accuracy of the calibrated et 0 models are also significant tabari et al 2016 the main goals of this paper are to i improve the makkink model for et 0 estimation by using 7 temperature based r s models ii evaluate the estimation accuracy of makkink jensen haise irmak and the 7 improved makkink models for et 0 estimation in northwest china on different time scales and iii propose the recommended model for et 0 estimation in northwest china on different time scales 2 methods

has abundant light and heat resources but the population distribution is extremely sparse with a fragile ecological environment and under developing economy mainly due to the arid climate ma et al 2005 the climate is dominated by continental arid conditions and is primarily influenced by westerly circulation and less influenced by east asian monsoon liu et al 2010 annual average precipitation and temperature data from 156 meteorological stations in northwest china were used for systematic cluster analysis and the northwest china was divided into 4 sub zones by considering the topography

evapotranspiration 2 2 1 fao 56 penman monteith model experimental et 0 data were unavailable at the study area therefore et 0 values estimated by fao 56 pm model were considered as the targets to validate the other models which was an acceptable and common practice in this situation feng et al 2017b the equation of fao 56 pm model is expressed as 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ

1998 2 2 2 makkink model mk de bruin 1987 introduced the simplified version of the makkink model makkink 1957 which could provide reliable estimates of et 0 using only daily r s and t observations

3 improvement of makkink model in this paper the 7 temperature based solar radiation models were adopted to replace the r s values in makkink model the empirical coefficients of the makkink models were calibrated based on the least square method using the meteorological variables during period of 1990 2010 obtained from 12 stations in northwest china the improved makkink models m1 m7 are presented in table 2 2 4 performance evaluation the accuracy and performance of the studied models to estimate et 0 were evaluated using the meteorological variables during 2011 2016 in terms of following statistical error tests coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and mean absolute error mae which are defined in the following equations

follows 19 gp i i j 1 4 α j y j y ij where αj equals 1 for the indicator r 2 and ns while for others indicators is equal to 1 yj is the median of scaled values of indicator j yij is the scaled value

were calibrated based on the least square method for et 0 estimation in northwest china and the adjusted parameters are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the calibrated a ranged between 0 11 0 20 0 09 0 18 and 0 10 0 19 for m1 m2 and m3 respectively with average of 0 16 0 14 and 0 15 respectively the calibrated a and b of m4 ranged between 0 15 to 0 11 and 0 16 1 07 respectively with average of 0 01 and 0 58 respectively the calibrated a and c of m5 ranged between 0 51 0 84 and 0 52 to 0 08 respectively with average of 0 69 and 0 24 respectively and the calibrated b were 0 00 for all the stations the calibrated a b and c of m6 ranged between 0 44 0 78 0 13 2 30 and 0 21 6 89 respectively with average of 0 58 0 64 and 1 96 respectively the calibrated a b and c of m7 ranged between 0 39 0 70 3 95 37 33 and 0 38 6 62 respectively with average of 0 58 16 63 and 1 85 respectively the regression coefficients in the presented models differed from location to location this can be due to local and seasonal changes in the type and thickness of cloud cover the effects of snow covered surfaces the concentrations of pollutants as well as the latitude besharat et al 2013 3 2 performances of et 0 models on a daily basis the statistical performances of the analyzed models in estimating daily et 0 for the 4 sub zones in northwest china are shown in table 4 the statistical results showed that the 7 mki models m1 m7 were more accurate than the 3 physical models for daily et 0 estimation at the 4 sub zones of northwest china and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 were superior to the other models in tcaz the m5 showed the best estimation accuracy among the 10 models followed by m4 and m7 with average r 2 of 0 83 0 82 and 0 82 average rmse of 0 90 0 92 and 0 92 mm d average ns of 0 83 0 82 and 0 82 average mae of 0 66 0 67 and 0 67 mm d and gpi of 1 17 1 10 and 1 06 respectively in tchaz the m5 also showed the best estimation accuracy among the 10 models followed by m4 and m7 with average r 2 of 0 84 0 82 and 0 81 average rmse of 0 88 0 93 and 0 95 mm d average ns of 0 84 0 82 and 0 81 average mae of 0 62 0 66 and 0 67 mm d and gpi of 1 39 1 18 and 1 08 respectively in pcsz the m5 had the best estimation accuracy followed by m7 and m6 with average r 2 of 0 86 0 85 and 0 84 average rmse of 0 56 0 58 and 0 58 mm d average ns of 0 86 0 84 and 0 84 average mae of 0 42 0 44 and 0 44 mm d and gpi of 0 93 0 75 and 0 74 respectively in tmsz the m5 had the best estimation accuracy followed by m7 and m6 with average r 2 of 0 80 0 78 and 0 78 average rmse of 0 91 0 94 and 0 95 mm d average ns of 0 80 0 78 and 0 78 average mae of 0 68 0 70 and 0 71 mm d and gpi of 1 12 0 94 and 0 88 respectively the mk model showed the worst performance in tcaz tchaz and tmsz followed by jh and ik models in pcsz jh model showed the worst performance followed by mk and ik models overall the m5 showed the best performance at the 4 sub zones and it was thus recommended to estimate daily et 0 in tcaz tchaz pcsz and tmsz in order to evaluate the et 0 estimation accuracy of the 10 models in northwest china boxplots with respect to performance of each model are presented in fig 2 as it can be seen from fig 2 the 7 mki models m1 m7 were also more accurate for daily et 0 estimation in northwest china compared with the 3 physical models and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 were superior to the other models in terms of daily et 0 for instance the median line of pm model was 3 50 mm d and the 7 mki models ranged between 3 39 and 3 52 mm d on average 3 44 mm d whereas the other models ranged between 2 34 and 2 88 mm d on average 2 63 mm d this implies the fact that overall the mki models could estimate the daily et 0 more accurately than the physical models at all stations in addition the daily et 0 values estimated by jh model had negative numbers which may be caused by the low temperature in winter a comparison between the values of r 2 rmse mae and ns also revealed that the 7 mki models were more accurate the median ranged between 0 77 0 83 on average 0 80 0 86 1 06 mm d on average 0 96 mm d 0 64 0 80 mm d on average 0 72 mm d and 0 75 0 83 on average 0 79 respectively while the median lines of r 2 rmse mae and ns for the 3 physical models varied between 0 69 0 74 on average 0 72 1 43 1 76 on average 1 61 mm d 1 10 1 40 on average 1 29 mm d and 0 29 0 52 on average 0 38 respectively according to the boxplots with respect to gpi the m5 had the highest median line followed by m7 m6 and m4 with median of 1 03 0 90 0 87 and 0 86 respectively while mk had the lowest median line followed by jh and ik models with median of 2 77 2 08 and 1 34 respectively this also implied that the m5 had the best estimation accuracy for daily et 0 followed by m7 m6 and m4 and m5 was further recommended to estimate daily et 0 in northwest china 3 3 performances of et 0 models on a monthly basis comparisons of monthly average daily et 0 et 0 mad and relative error re of different models for each sub zone are presented in fig 3 all the et 0 mad estimated by the studied models presented parabolic variations with lower et 0 values less than 2 12 mm d in winter dec feb and higher values more than 3 36 mm d in summer jun aug in tcaz tchaz pcsz and tmsz re values of the 7 mki models ranged 28 51 to 3 59 20 55 to 5 11 7 72 to 13 06 and 20 11 to 4 94 respectively and re values of the 3 physical models ranged 84 97 to 13 95 86 11 to 13 27 63 65 to 12 93 and 79 89 to 7 26 respectively all the models showed a higher accuracy for et 0 mad estimation in pcsz compared with the other 3 sub zones the 7 mki models were more accurate than the 3 physical models for et 0 mad estimation at the 4 sub zones in addition the 7 mki models showed a trend of higher accuracy for et 0 mad estimation during apr oct at the 4 sub zones with average re less than 5 37 5 25 7 77 and 8 05 respectively the 3 physical models also showed a higher accuracy in summer and lower accuracy in winter but the re values were obviously larger than those of the 7 mki models overall the m5 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation in tcaz pcsz and tmsz with average re of 4 16 3 12 and 3 33 respectively however the m4 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation in tchaz with average re of 2 45 these models were recommended to estimate et 0 mad for at corresponding sub zones boxplots with respect to performances of the 10 studied models are presented in fig 4 from the boxplots given in fig 4 it can be seen that the 7 mki models were also more accurate for et 0 mad estimation in northwest china and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 were superior to the other models on monthly scale in terms of et 0 mad for instance the median lines of pm model was 3 67 mm d and the 7 mki models ranged 3 54 and 3 67 mm d on average 3 61 mm d whereas those physical models ranged 2 44 3 02 mm d on average 2 74 mm d this revealed that the mk jh and ik models trended to underestimated et 0 on monthly scale obviously comparison between the values of r 2 rmse mae and ns also revealed that the 7 mki models were more accurate with the median ranging 1 00 1 00 on average 1 00 0 13 0 21 mm d on average 0 18 mm d 0 10 0 18 mm d on average 0 16 mm d and 0 99 1 00 on average 0 99 respectively while the median lines of r 2 rmse mae and ns for the 3 physical models varied 0 97 0 99 on average 0 98 1 01 1 44 on average 1 17 mm d 0 93 1 32 on average 1 07 mm d and 0 42 0 69 on average 0 57 respectively according to the boxplots with respect to gpi the m5 had the highest median line followed by m7 and m6 with median of 0 25 0 05 and 0 02 respectively however the mk model had the lowest median line followed by jh and ik models with median of 2 75 2 72 and 2 17 respectively this also implied that the m5 had the best estimation accuracy for et 0 mad estimation followed by m7 and m6 and the m5 was recommended to estimate daily et 0 mad in northwest china 4 discussion previous studies zhang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 showed that the radiation based models were more accurate than the temperature based models the calculation methods of the above models are relatively simple because they only require air temperature and solar radiation data for et 0 estimation zhang et al 2015 evaluated the applicability of 5 temperature based and radiation based models against the pm model in xinxiang china and found the irmak model showed a good performance with r 2 around 1 0 and relative error less than 20 wu et al 2016 compared 15 different models for et 0 estimation in northwest china the results showed that the makkink and irmak models can accurately estimate daily et 0 with r 2 0 73 liu et al 2017 compared 16 models for et 0 estimation in semiarid regions of china and found that jensen haise and makkink models performed well for et 0 estimation whereas the jensen haise model was more accurate than makkink model in this paper the irmak model showed the best performance for daily et 0 and et 0 mad estimation among the 3 physical models followed by jensen haise and makkink models the irmak model is a multivariate linear regression method to estimate et 0 based on the air temperature and solar radiation data which are the dominant factors influencing et 0 and it is consistent with the results in the previous research the results indicated that m5 had the best estimation accuracy for daily et 0 in northwest china followed by m7 m6 and m4 the m5 was the improved makkink model using the ei sebail radiation model the ei sebail model estimated r s based on the air temperature and relative humidity data cao et al 2011 analyzed the sensitivity of et 0 in northwest china and found that the shortwave radiation was the most sensitive variable to et 0 followed by air temperature and relative humidity with average absolute sensitivity coefficients of 0 61 0 39 and 0 33 respectively whereas wind speed had the least impact with average absolute sensitivity coefficient of 0 18 the main reason for the highest accuracy of m5 was because it took into account the effect of relative humidity while the other models did not m6 m7 and m4 also showed a good performance for et 0 estimation in northwest china the 3 models were calibrated by using the bristow campbell model goodin model and chen model which can estimate r s accurately based on the temperature difference with the exponential function and logarithmic functions respectively the estimation accuracy of m1 m2 and m3 was slightly lower than that of m4 m7 and they were improved by using the allen annandale and hargreaves models with simple monomial expressions comparing the performances of m1 m2 and m3 we can found that considering parameters such as altitude and atmospheric pressure cannot further improve the accuracy of the models yao et al 2014 evaluated 108 models for r s estimation in shanghai china the results showed that considering direct parameters such as solar altitude and sunshine duration can help improve the accuracy of the models but indirect parameters cannot for existing daily r s models multi parameter models were more accurate than single parameter models and polynomial models were more accurate than linear models in addition the 7 improved makkink models m1 m7 were more accurate than the 3 physical models makkink jensen haise and irmak for daily et 0 estimation in northwest china this was largely resulted from the calibration of empirical parameters of the 7 mki models makkink jensen haise and irmak modesl are empirical models for et 0 estimation based on air temperature and solar radiation variables although the air temperature and solar radiation are closely related to et 0 it is not completely corresponding the influencing factors of et 0 zhang et al 2018 in addition most of the existing simple empirical et 0 models can not accurately imitate the change mechanisms of et 0 because of the single input parameter which leads to a certain degree of uncertainty in these models the main way to reduce the uncertainty and improve the calculation accuracy of the simple empirical models is to localize the parameters of these models liu and pan 2012 5 conclusions in the present study 7 temperature based solar radiation models were adopted to improve the makkink model m1 m7 for et 0 estimation in northwest china based on the least square method using the meteorological variables during 1990 2010 obtained from 12 stations the applicability of the improved makkink mki models original makkink model jensen haise model and irmak model on different time scales were evaluated using meteorological data during 2011 2016 the model performances have been compared using the r 2 rmse mae ns re and gpi the main conclusions of this study are shown as follows 1 the 7 mki models r 2 ranged 0 71 0 86 were more accurate compared with the 3 physical models r 2 ranged 0 64 0 76 for daily et 0 estimation at the 4 sub zones of northwest china and the m4 m5 m6 and m7 were superior to the other models m5 showed the highest estimation accuracy in tcaz tchaz pcsz and tmsz with average r 2 of 0 83 0 84 0 86 and 0 80 average rmse of 0 90 0 88 0 56 and 0 91 mm d average ns of 0 83 0 84 0 86 and 0 80 average mae of 0 66 0 62 0 42 and 0 68 mm d and gpi of 1 17 1 39 0 93 and 1 12 respectively for the whole study region m5 also had the best estimation accuracy for daily et 0 followed by m7 and m6 with the r 2 median of 0 83 0 83 and 0 82 the rmse median of 0 86 0 88 and 0 89 mm d the mae median of 0 64 0 65 and 0 66 mm d the ns median of 0 83 0 82 and 0 82 and the gpi median of 1 03 0 90 and 0 87 respectively 2 all the et 0 mad estimated by the studied models presented parabolic variations with lower et 0 values in winter dec feb and higher values were in summer jun aug at the 4 sub zones the 7 mki models with re almost less than 20 also showed a better performance than the 3 physical models with re usually more than 20 m5 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation in tcaz pcsz and tmsz with average re of 4 16 3 12 and 3 33 respectively and m4 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation in tchaz with average re of 2 45 for the whole research region the m5 showed the best performance for et 0 mad estimation followed by m7 and m6 with the r 2 median of 1 00 1 00 and 1 00 the rmse median of 0 13 0 16 and 0 19 mm d the mae median of 0 10 0 14 and 0 17 mm d the ns median of 1 00 0 99 and 0 99 and the gpi median of 0 25 0 05 and 0 02 respectively 3 overall the present study found the mki models had a better performance for et 0 estimation in northwest china compared with the original makkink jensen haise and irmak models the m5 which only requires air temperature and relative humidity as input data is highly recommended to estimate et 0 on both daily and monthly scale acknowledgments we would like to thank the national climatic centre of the china meteorological administration for

6943,climate variability along with increase in the demand for water resources highlights the need for better understanding of the link between regional climate and terrestrial water storage this paper examined the variation of terrestrial water storage in relation to climatic influences over the upper blue nile ubn river basin from grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa satellite altimetry rainfall and multivariate el niño southern oscillation index mei anomaly data although there is no statistically significant α 0 05 long term trend in terrestrial water variation and rainfall in the basin lake storage twsa and rainfall p value 0 45 0 48 and 0 55 respectively in the last decade two visible droughts occurred between 2002 and 2004 and 2009 and 2010 which resulted in water deficit in the basin where below average rainfall twsa and lake height storage were observed during these periods extreme rainfall analysis from standardized precipitation index spi and strong connection between wet season rainfall lake height and twsa respectively indicate interannual terrestrial water storage dynamics in the ubn basin is strongly influenced by climate further the el niño southern oscillation enso influences rainfall in the ubn basin specifically the peak rainfall season june september which shows negative correlation r 0 62 with mei anomaly values which indicates that the el niño case positive mei values is linked to the dry conditions in the basin the findings of this study combined with studies such as socioeconomic impact of drought will facilitate better planning and management of water resources in water stressed regions furthermore this study demonstrates the application of a combination of satellite and other hydrologic data in understanding the hydro climatic condition of a remote basin keywords grace water storage satellite altimetry climate enso lake blue nile river 1 introduction climate variability is a driving factor in land surface processes e g energy exchange between land and atmosphere and hydrologic fluxes fluctuating temperature and extreme weather conditions affect availability and distribution of rainfall snowmelt river flows lake levels and groundwater levels and recharge němec and schaake 1982 seyoum et al 2015 taylor et al 2012 these factors control the amount and distribution of terrestrial water storage which plays a critical role in various ecosystem services chang and bonnette 2016 conversely water is the primary medium through which climate variability influences the ecosystem and thus the livelihood and well being of societies griebler and avramov 2015 terrestrial waters control the amount of energy transferred from land and water bodies into the atmosphere through various feedback processes and this largely depends on the availability of moisture water on the land surface bierkens and van den hurk 2007 collow et al 2014 findell and eltahir 2003 although the feedback process is not the purpose of this study understanding the relation between climate interactions and terrestrial waters is vital the east africa region has been experiencing extreme climatic conditions for the past several decades the ubn basin the upstream region of the blue nile river basin which contains large water bodies such as lake tana and major river tributaries is a major contributor to the runoff 55 of the nile flow to the main nile river the nile river one of the longest river in the world is a lifeline for millions residing in multiple countries in the region extreme climate variability drought or flooding has affected this region significantly in the past conway 2000a taye and willems 2012 severe drought that occurred in a part of this basin in ethiopia in the early 1980s and the flooding that occurred in downstream region in sudan in the late 1980s sutcliffe et al 1989 are examples of hydro climatic extremes in the region where low or high terrestrial water is recorded most recently the extreme droughts that occurred in ubn in 2003 and 2009 which have been noted in this study also identified by others bewket and conway 2007 viste et al 2013 are other examples of hydro climatic extremes occurring in the region in the most recent period sparse rainfall and longer dry spells during the wet seasons cause severe droughts while heavy rainfall is responsible for flooding in the region seleshi and camberlin 2006 sutcliffe et al 1989 multiple studies have shown that factors such as large scale oceanic atmospheric interactions land use change climate change and poor water management are causing these extreme conditions conway 2000a melesse et al 2011 however the connection between extreme climate and terrestrial water storage at a given location is still unclear further studies have indicated that future climatic change will worsen the situation especially causing a decline in the seasonal runoff by the end of the century abdo et al 2009 setegn et al 2011 large scale oceanic atmospheric interaction due to variation in sea surface temperature sst linked to rainfall or precipitation fluctuations in the tropical regions müller and roeckner 2008 and more specifically in the east african region has been evidenced by various researchers black et al 2003 nicholson and kim 1997 parhi et al 2015 in fact studies have indicated there is a strong correlation between the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomena and climate and hydrological variability in the nile basin for example eltahir 1996 has shown that about 25 of the annual flow variability of the nile is related to or associated with the enso condition further various studies have also indicated a high correlation between flooding and drought conditions and the enso in the region amarasekera et al 1997 eltahir 1996 osman et al 2001 enso is the most important oceanic atmospheric phenomenon that causes large scale climate variability in interannual time scales it is characterized by sst and surface pressure anomalies across the pacific ocean warm ssts over the eastern pacific ushers the positive el niño phase while cool ssts over the ocean causes the negative la niña phase enso has a return period of about 3 7 years generally in the study site enso is inversely correlated with the climate high rainfalls are likely to occur during the la niña phase while low rainfall is likely to occur during the el niño phase abtew et al 2009 variations in extreme climate events are expected to affect the terrestrial water storage thus understanding the relationship between terrestrial water storage characteristics and climate variability in the basin is crucial studies conducted in the wider region of equatorial east africa ashok et al 2001 behera and yamagata 2003 black et al 2003 saji et al 1999 saji and yamagata 2003 show that anomalous warming cooling over the equatorial east pacific and indian ocean is associated with enhanced suppressed rainfall amounts in this region studies implied the sst to rainfall teleconnections in the region are both temporally and spatially complex and not yet fully understood due to the lack of complete understanding of the water cycle accurate quantification and characterization of climate extremes and measuring its impact on the water cycle is still challenging feng and houser 2016 available climate indices such as palmer drought index palmer 1965 and standard precipitation index spi guttman 1999 mckee et al 1993 are insufficient to quantify the impact of climate extremes on the water cycle this is because the above indices use only climate variables e g precipitation temperature in the analysis with no consideration of the hydrological variables e g soil moisture water storage khandu et al 2016 thomas et al 2014 to get the full picture of climate water interaction measurement of the terrestrial water balance is necessary predicting the variation in terrestrial water storage of a given basin is a demanding process it requires large observational data and sophisticated models now this is possible using satellite techniques which cover a large area and provide aggregate terrestrial water variables that describe the water cycle the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite which is one of its kind measures terrestrial water storage anomaly including water on the surface and in the sub surface of the earth over a large area rodell and famiglietti 2002 grace has been used in various studies on climate and water resources awange et al 2014a b forootan et al 2014 hassan and jin 2014 khandu et al 2016 long et al 2013 2014 niu et al 2014 seyoum and milewski 2016 2017 shamsudduha et al 2017 thomas et al 2014 yang et al 2014 for example shamsudduha et al 2017 tested multiple grace products along with other data to assess the variability in tws over the upper white nile basin including lake victoria and lake kyoga basins khandu et al 2016 examined the impact of humans and climate extremes on twsa in the ganges brahmaputra meghna river basin in south asia quantitative characterization of hydrologic drought using grace was developed by thomas et al 2014 awange et al 2014a employed statistical analysis to understand climate variability caused by large scale oceanic atmospheric interactions and human impact on water storage using grace and global land data assimilation system gldas model in the main nile river sub basins further in a different study awange et al 2014b characterized regional variation of water storages over ethiopia using grace based twsa estimate along with climate indices provides a better understanding of the climate extremes and its impact on the water cycle this study focused on the source region of the nile river the upper blue nile river basin including the lake tana and examined quantitative relationship between different water storages and climate indicators using grace and ancillary data there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the data obtained from grace however combined with other data grace provides significant insights into the change in tws the study provides valuable information regarding the management of water resources in response to climate variation furthermore this study includes the combination of satellite and other hydrologic variables in understanding the hydro climatic condition of a remote basin the applicability and usefulness of satellite techniques in general are invaluable especially in such data sparse regions 2 the study area the blue nile river basin the largest tributary of the nile river is a transboundary river basin shared by countries such as ethiopia and sudan the study area the ubn basin is part of the blue nile located in ethiopia and has a total drainage area of 199 950 km2 fig 1 the ubn basin is drained by rivers such as the blue nile river locally also known as abay river and consists of major water bodies such as lake tana lake tana has an average surface area of 3000 km2 the drainage area of lake tana basin is 15 000 km2 major tributary rivers e g little abay river megech river replenish lake tana and the overflow form the lake flows into the blue nile abay river the long term annual average flow of blue nile abay river near the outlet is 115 m3 s the water from the rivers and water bodies in the basin are used for irrigation hydroelectric power production recreation and fishery production and is the backbone of the region s economy the mountainous ethiopian highland rolling ridges cliffs hilly slopes and steep valleys characterize the eastern part of the study area which is a major source of runoff and sediments for the nile river while a relatively gentle slope characterizes the topography of the western and northwestern lowlands the highlands are made of volcanic edifices underlain by sedimentary terrains that are exposed in the valleys further downstream in the western low lands metamorphic rocks cover the outcrop the elevation in the basin ranges from 500 to 4200 m a s l fig 1 the high variation in topography and elevation influences climate and hydrology of the basin the average annual rainfall in the ubn basin ranges from 1000 mm in the western lowlands to 1900 mm in the southern highland with an annual average based on 1950 2016 data rainfall of 1350 mm fig 2 the wettest months are june july august and september jjas which account for more than 70 of the annual rainfall the monsoon activity over india is a major trigger for the july september rainfall variability in the east african highlands camberlin 1997 generally rainfall characteristics in the study area are influenced by three mechanisms conway 2000a the inter tropical convergence zone itcz that drives the summer monsoon during the wet season the saharan anticyclone that generates dry warm north easterly winds during the dry season and the arabian heights that produce thermal lows during the inter seasonal periods the land use in the highland part of the basin is mostly agricultural covering more than 50 of the land while in the western part forested land largely covers the region tekleab et al 2011 3 methods and data this paper examines variation in terrestrial water storage in connection to regional climatic influences in the ubn river basin using variables that describe the water cycle and climate such as rainfall lake height fluctuation terrestrial water storage anomaly and oceanic atmospheric index a suit of publicly available satellite data such as terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa data from grace satellite lake height from satellite altimetry rainfall and multivariate el niño southern oscillation index mei departure data were used in this study 3 1 data and processing monthly rainfall time series data ranging from 1950 to 2013 with spatial resolution of 0 5 by 0 5 schneider et al 2011 was collected from global precipitation climatology centre gpcc provided by the noaa oar esrl psd boulder co usa from their website https www esrl noaa gov psd date accessed 09 01 2016 this rainfall data extended up to the year 2016 using adjusted monthly rainfall

processing centers csr jpl and gfz landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 were used to understand storage characteristics of the basin the data ranges from april 2002 to july 2016 and is corrected by the supplied scale factors to restore the signal reduced during sampling and post processing of grace data each grace pixel has spatial resolution of 1 by 1 however due to large uncertainty of grace data at this scale basin wide twsa is calculated by averaging multiple grace pixels over the basin further to maintain highest level of accuracy an ensemble mean of the three grace solutions from csr jpl and gfz processing centers were calculated grace land data are available at http grace jpl nasa gov and is supported by the nasa measures program on the scaled grace data error was calculated using leakage and measurement error data satellite based lake height data for the largest lake in the basin lake tana was derived from multiple altimetry satellites and used in the analysis the satellite altimetry data is processed by crétaux et al 2011 was obtained from hydroweb http www legos obs mip fr soa hydrologie hydroweb accessed 9 22 2016 crétaux et al 2011 used multiple satellites such as topex poseidon jason 2 geosat fo saral and envisat i to extract altimetry data the influence of long term regional climate variability due to oceanic atmospheric interaction such as the el niño southern oscillation enso was understood using multivariate enso index mei anomaly data wolter 1987 and wolter and timlin 1993 calculated mei anomaly values for each of twelve sliding bi monthly seasons using principal component analysis of six observed variables sea level pressure zonal and meridional components of the surface wind sea surface temperature surface air temperature and total cloudiness fraction of the sky over the tropical pacific https www esrl noaa gov psd enso mei data accessed 10 1 2016 using the bimonthly mei departure values the upper and lower 30 percentiles were used as a threshold to classify between the la niña and el niño conditions respectively while all values between the 30 and 70 percentiles were considered as neutral conditions in this study wolter and timlin 2011 other researchers using different enso indices made similar observation for example hanley et al 2003 defined the threshold values for el niño and la niña using the 75th and 25th percentile respectively using sst anomaly data 3 2 statistical analysis trend and correlation trends in rainfall lake water height lwh and twsa time series data were examined to check if there is any long term climatological impact on the basin seasonal interannual and long term trends calculated using two different approaches firstly long term trend analysis were conducted using the mann kendall statistical test more specifically the seasonal kendall test is used to determine whether significant changes have occurred over the study period in the basin for twsa rainfall and lake height data while taking into account the variation due to seasonal effects hirsch and slack 1984 hirsch et al 1982 various researchers suggested seasonal kendall test for use in cyclic seasonally autocorrelated environmental data hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 hess et al 2001 such as hydrological data secondly interannual trends in basin water storage change and rainfall were analyzed by decomposing the time series into seasonal trend and irregular components kendall and stuart 1983 a seasonally adjusted trend is calculated by de seasonalizing the time series so that interannual trends can be visible a linear trend is fitted to the seasonally adjusted values and significance of the linear trend slope is tested at a 95 confidence level alpha 0 05 slope is used to calculate long term average volumetric storage change in the lake and in the basin in addition grid based correlation analysis was performed to understand the spatial variability between rainfall enso lwh and tws anomaly data the correlation between rainfall and enso data was conducted using long term data from 1950 to 2016 3 3 standard precipitation index spi analysis standard precipitation index analysis is used to evaluate the impact of climate extremes e g drought on terrestrial water storages in the basin spi is a commonly used to analyze the length and intensity of drought and wet conditions in a basin which is based on analysis of fitting a long term rainfall data with a probability distribution function for more details see mckee et al 1993 and guttman 1999 for this study spi was estimated at various time scales from 1 month to 24 months and was then correlated with lwh and twsa data spi values within the range of 1 represent normal dry and wet conditions where values greater than 1 and less than 1 indicate moderate to extreme wet and dry conditions respectively for comparison purposes other data lwh and twsa were z score normalized which is the number of standard deviations from the mean using the equation zi xi mean standard deviation 4 results and discussion 4 1 water storage and trend this section describes the results of long term seasonal and interannual trend analysis of water storages and rainfall data in the basin two types of trend basin averaged and gridded were examined for rainfall and twsa time series data lwh data also tested for long term and seasonal trend there is a clear interannual dry wet cycle in rainfall and loss gain cycle in lake and terrestrial water storage time series fig 3 the mann kendall trend test results table 1 show that there is no evidence of a monotonic long term trend in lake height water storage anomaly and rainfall data p value 0 05 at 95 confidence however considering the seasonal mann kendall trend test results the lwh data show monotonic seasonal trends in one or more months of the data p value 0 005 whereas rainfall p value 0 60 and twsa p value 0 43 data show no evidence of monotonic seasonal trend at the specified confidence level though not statistically significant the kendall tau values indicated that seasonally the rainfall shows an upward trend tau value positive and so does the lake height tau value positive generally the data showed no change in long term trend however significant interannual fluctuations were observed due to climate variability in the basin discussed later on the other hand gridded trend analysis of twsa data indicates that the southwestern part of the basin has had a net loss of about 3 25 km3 of water storage while the north and northeastern section of the basin has gained about 2 75 km3 of water storages between 2002 and 2016 this also correlates with the slight increase in lake storage where the lake is located in the northeastern section of the basin generally there is no evidence of monotonic trend in the gridded twsa data in the basin at 95 confidence level table 2 spatially gridded trend test on the rainfall data also shows no statistically significant trend in a large part of the basin table 2 except close to the western boundary where rainfall shows a statistically significant declining trend generally the data shows no significant increase or decrease in the long term trend in water storages such as lwh and twsa and rainfall in the basin considering the spatial variability of twsa in the basin generally the terrestrial water gain deficit is consistent throughout the basin and largely controlled by rainfall fig 4 shows spatio temporal variability of twsa for selected wet 2007 and 2014 and dry 2004 and 2009 years in the ubn basin while the remaining years 2003 and 2010 are moderate spatially twsa is less variable in the basin this could be due to poor resolution of the grace pixels in general slight variation is observed for example in 2007 and 2014 the southern part of the basin gained relatively higher terrestrial water storage 350 mm compared to the northern 280 mm part of the basin fig 4 this is because southern section of ubn gets higher amount of seasonal rainfall compared to the northern part fig 2 also the loss in twsa is intense in the southern e g the negative twsa in march 2004 and 2007 compared to the northern section of the ubn basin temporally water storage anomaly mimics the rainfall pattern with 2 month lag peak rainfall months are july and august fig 2 while the twsa peaked in september and october fig 4 this indicates water storage in the basin is highly controlled by climate generally in terms of water storage anomaly the basin was relatively drier in 2003 2004 2009 and 2010 years this is mainly caused by a decrease in the amount of rainfall the basin is getting during peak rainy season jjas for example the annual rainfall in the basin was 1050 and 975 mm during the dry years 2002 and 2009 respectively whereas the basin was receiving between 1220 and 1400 mm in annual rainfall between 2005 and 2007 as a result in 2007 the basin gained above 300 mm in water storage while the largest gain in water storage was 100 mm in 2009 in addition the effect of severe droughts that occurred in 2002 and 2009 probably affected the water storage in subsequent years and cause loss of water storage in 2003 and 2004 and 2010 respectively these drought periods discussed below and in the next section are linked with meteorological drought related to ocean atmospheric interactions although there is no significant long term trend in water storages and climatic condition in the ubn basin considering the interannual variation in climate and water storages at least two visible droughts occurred between 2002 and 2004 and 2009 2010 that resulted in a water deficit in the basin fig 3 there is a high correlation between drought indicator index spi at 12 month time scale and lake height data fig 5 this is due to a delayed response of the lake height to rainfall variability with a delay time of approximately 9 12 months relatively longer lag time between the lake lake tana and rainfall could be due to the size and characteristics of the lake tana basin that empties water into the lake the area of the lake tana basin is 15 000 km2 and major tributary rivers of the blue nile drains this basin and flow into lake tana thus longer lag time in response to rainfall seems reasonable as compared to twsa that is a cumulative effect of water budget variables e g soil moisture with very short lag time in response to rainfall using spi at a 12 month timescale the highest correlation there is an overlap between moderate to extreme drought years spi value from 1 to 2 5 and lake height fluctuation and twsa of the basin in the aforementioned periods as shown in the fig 3 these drought periods resulted in a water deficit in the lake and in the basin fig 6 a and b show linear trends calculated for the interannual variations including lake storage fig 6a and twsa fig 6b in the basin due limitation of the grace twsa data twsa data from 2002 to 2016 has been reported whereas trends on lake storage data were analyzed starting from the year 2000 as shown in fig 6a between 2000 and 2003 there was a decline in lake storage of lake tana during this period the lake was losing about 1 10 0 17 km3 of water per year a conservative error estimate in lake storage was conducted considering a seasonal surface area variation of lake tana which varies up to 500 km2 a similar basin wide water storage deficit was observed during this time where twsa data showed a negative storage anomaly in 2002 and 2003 and it is approximately 150 mm loss in equivalent water height additionally deficit in both lake storage and basin twsa was observed between 2009 and 2010 between 2007 and 2010 there was a decline in water storage in the basin the loss in water storage from lake tana was about 0 8 0 1 km3 year during this period though the 2002 drought seems relatively less extreme as compared to that in 2009 fig 7 the rate of annual loss of water storage from lake tana between 2007 and 2010 was lower than the rate between 2000 and 2003 this is because the wet condition between 2004 and 2006 was not as strong in magnitude and duration as that in the early 2000s fig 7 therefore the lake has not fully recovered to the same level as in the early 2000s considering the basin wide water storage the basin has lost about 7 4 1 2 km3 year in twsa between 2007 and 2010 the water lost from the lake was about 12 of the total loss in basin terrestrial water storage anomaly since 2010 the lake recovered most of the water lost during the previous dry seasons between 2010 and 2016 there is no statically significant trend in both lake and basin water storage the spi result showed that the climatic condition changes from extremely dry to wet conditions between 2010 and 2015 though statistically insignificant the basin gained about 2 5 1 2 km3 per year of twsa during this period 4 2 climate link and water resources fig 7 shows spi at the 12 month time scale in red and blue area plot is superimposed with mei values dark solid line the spi indicates a recurring moderate to extreme dry condition in the basin in an interval of 5 10 years the most recent moderate to extreme dry conditions that caused a decline in water storages in the basin occurred between 2002 and 2004 and 2009 2010 using the upper lower 30 percentile mei value as a threshold the wet condition corresponds to the la niña case and the dry condition corresponds to the el niño case since the 1970s weak to strong el niño cases have matched well with moderate to extreme dry conditions e g 1972 73 1982 84 1986 88 2002 03 2009 10 in the basin with some exceptions e g 1977 78 1997 98 but still below average rainfall was observed during these periods some of the above cases were a record historical exceptional years of drought in the region for example the 1984 drought was a year of exceptionally widespread drought that occurred in the region with 2009 being the second driest year surpassed only by the 1984 drought viste et al 2013 unlike the el niño the la niña cases show weak correspondence with wet conditions in the basin this might be due to many factors controlling the occurrence amount and distribution of rainfall in the basin such as terrestrial sources of atmospheric moisture e g regional lakes and or other sources from oceanic atmospheric interactions e g the atlantic ocean indian ocean playing varying roles in different seasons conway 2000b in the wet rainy season the ubn basin receives large amount of rainfall in the boreal summer fall months between june and september jjas see the inset in fig 2 comparison of average rainfall with mei anomaly values averaged over the wet season renders a strong relationship between the two as shown in fig 8 there is a strong negative correlation pearson correlation 0 62 p value 0 00 between seasonal mei anomaly and average rainfall in the ubn basin the seasonal rainfall is decreasing from the la niña condition mei 0 5 to el niño condition mei 0 6 in fig 8 the dotted line is a linear model fitted to the data slope 15 60 and p value 0 00 and the solid line indicates the average long term seasonal jjas rainfall considering the last 66 years from 1950 to 2016 below average season rainfall has occurred in almost all cases when there was a weak to strong el niño condition mei 0 6 on the other hand it was seen that above average to extreme seasonal rainfall occurs during weak to strong la niña condition mei 0 5 with few exceptions during neutral conditions 0 5 mei anomaly 0 6 fig 9 shows regional including part of adjacent basins correlation between seasonal rainfall and mei anomaly values generally inverse relationship is observed in the region which indicates that the low high seasonal rainfall is related to el niño la niña condition with few exceptions where the correlation is not statistically significant as described in the introduction section enso is characterized by sst and pressure anomalies over the pacific the el niño phase occurs when the ssts are warm in the eastern tropical pacific ocean and the opposite phase la niña occur when they are cool there are various assumptions about the mechanism impact of enso in east africa in general it affects partly due to teleconnections with tropical atlantic and indian oceans alexander et al 2002 chiang and sobel 2002 a strong negative correlation between mei values and wet season rainfall was observed in the lake tana area and in the eastern part of the ubn basin this part of the region is highly sensitive to extreme climatic condition e g drought it was the most affected area during both the 1984 and 2009 extreme droughts with regard to other seasons the correlation between seasonal rainfall and mei anomaly values see table 3 are weak and mostly not statistically significant for example there is no statistically significant relationship between april may june amj and october november december ond rainfalls and mei anomaly values though there is a positive correlation r 0 28 between rainfall and mei anomaly in the january february march quarters there is no clear relationship between high low rainfall and enso la niña or el niño phases conditions in jfm season further the highest rainfall in jfm season occur during enso neutral condition 0 5 mei anomaly 0 6 this imply that rainfall in this season might be controlled by other ocean atmospheric conditions such as the indian ocean further lake height altimetry and grace twsa data fitted with smooth lines using locally weighted scatterplotsmoothing loess method revealed variation in water storage related to the variation in the mei anomaly values fig 10 similar to the pattern between rainfall and enso index the smoothed water storage anomaly data shows more negative deficit when mei departure values are positive the el niño case and more positive water storage anomaly surplus when mei departure values are negative the la niña case for example both lake height and basin twsa were negative storage deficit during 2002 2004 and 2009 2010 drought periods where mei departure values were positive the el niño case as stated in the above section the water storage deficit in the basin occurs as a result of low rainfall received during the peak rainy season jjas this is directly linked with strong enso signal similar studies found positive correlation between enso and grace twsa in the study region awange et al 2014a the two notable droughts that resulted in significant water storage deficit were also detected by various researches bewket and conway 2007 viste et al 2013 generally lake tana and the upper blue nile basin gains water storage when the season changes from the el niño to the la niña condition e g 2009 2011 1994 1996 the basin loses water when the season changes from stronger la niña to el niño conditions e g 1997 2003 2008 2010 generally the link between the oceanic atmospheric interaction i e enso and rainfall in the ubn basin is strong also has a clear connection between the terrestrial water storage variation and climate in the ubn basin this strong link provides valuable information regarding the management of water resources in response to extreme climatic variability 5 summary and conclusions the upper blue nile basin and the east africa region in general is highly vulnerable to extreme climatic conditions such as drought which directly affect the quantity and occurrences of terrestrial water storage in the basin major rivers e g the nile river and tributaries are the lifeline for many who live in this region a suit of publically available data including remote sensing e g twsa from grace lake height data from satellite altimetry and rainfall along with multivariate enso index time series were analyzed to investigate the impact of climatic extremes on the water storage variation in the ubn basin two notable droughts were observed between 2002 and 2004 and 2009 and 2010 which resulted in terrestrial water deficit in the basin the 2009 drought is the second severe drought on record which occurred in the region in recent history after the 1984 drought generally the mann kendall trend test indicated no statistically significant trend in rainfall similar findings by others viste et al 2013 lake height of lake tana and twsa in the basin however the interannual climate variation causing significant deficit in water storages ranging from 0 8 to 1 1 km3 year of loss in lake storage and up to 7 5 km3 year loss in basin terrestrial water storage occurred as a result of the 2003 and 2009 droughts the above listed extreme droughts and other drought events clearly correlate with enso data more specifically the wet season june september rainfall inversely correlates r 0 62 with multivariate enso index departure values higher correlation values are obtained in the eastern part of the basin as this part of the basin is highly sensitive to extreme climate fluctuations the strong link between enso indicators mei values and rainfall in the basin shows the possibility of predicting regional climate variation using data from oceanic atmospheric interactions in the pacific and thus the hydrologic cycle further comparison of mei with water storage data reveals water storage lake storage and twsa responding to regional climate signals especially the deficits are found to be coincident with the el niño cases this study quantified the impact of climate on water storage and established a link between climate and water storage using satellite based data the findings of this study combined with studies such as socioeconomic impact of drought will facilitate better planning and management of water resources in water stressed regions like the blue nile basin where marginal changes in hydrologic budgets have significant implications on the livelihood of the population furthermore this study demonstrate the application of a combination of satellite and other hydrologic data in understanding the hydro climatic condition of a remote basin 
6943,climate variability along with increase in the demand for water resources highlights the need for better understanding of the link between regional climate and terrestrial water storage this paper examined the variation of terrestrial water storage in relation to climatic influences over the upper blue nile ubn river basin from grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa satellite altimetry rainfall and multivariate el niño southern oscillation index mei anomaly data although there is no statistically significant α 0 05 long term trend in terrestrial water variation and rainfall in the basin lake storage twsa and rainfall p value 0 45 0 48 and 0 55 respectively in the last decade two visible droughts occurred between 2002 and 2004 and 2009 and 2010 which resulted in water deficit in the basin where below average rainfall twsa and lake height storage were observed during these periods extreme rainfall analysis from standardized precipitation index spi and strong connection between wet season rainfall lake height and twsa respectively indicate interannual terrestrial water storage dynamics in the ubn basin is strongly influenced by climate further the el niño southern oscillation enso influences rainfall in the ubn basin specifically the peak rainfall season june september which shows negative correlation r 0 62 with mei anomaly values which indicates that the el niño case positive mei values is linked to the dry conditions in the basin the findings of this study combined with studies such as socioeconomic impact of drought will facilitate better planning and management of water resources in water stressed regions furthermore this study demonstrates the application of a combination of satellite and other hydrologic data in understanding the hydro climatic condition of a remote basin keywords grace water storage satellite altimetry climate enso lake blue nile river 1 introduction climate variability is a driving factor in land surface processes e g energy exchange between land and atmosphere and hydrologic fluxes fluctuating temperature and extreme weather conditions affect availability and distribution of rainfall snowmelt river flows lake levels and groundwater levels and recharge němec and schaake 1982 seyoum et al 2015 taylor et al 2012 these factors control the amount and distribution of terrestrial water storage which plays a critical role in various ecosystem services chang and bonnette 2016 conversely water is the primary medium through which climate variability influences the ecosystem and thus the livelihood and well being of societies griebler and avramov 2015 terrestrial waters control the amount of energy transferred from land and water bodies into the atmosphere through various feedback processes and this largely depends on the availability of moisture water on the land surface bierkens and van den hurk 2007 collow et al 2014 findell and eltahir 2003 although the feedback process is not the purpose of this study understanding the relation between climate interactions and terrestrial waters is vital the east africa region has been experiencing extreme climatic conditions for the past several decades the ubn basin the upstream region of the blue nile river basin which contains large water bodies such as lake tana and major river tributaries is a major contributor to the runoff 55 of the nile flow to the main nile river the nile river one of the longest river in the world is a lifeline for millions residing in multiple countries in the region extreme climate variability drought or flooding has affected this region significantly in the past conway 2000a taye and willems 2012 severe drought that occurred in a part of this basin in ethiopia in the early 1980s and the flooding that occurred in downstream region in sudan in the late 1980s sutcliffe et al 1989 are examples of hydro climatic extremes in the region where low or high terrestrial water is recorded most recently the extreme droughts that occurred in ubn in 2003 and 2009 which have been noted in this study also identified by others bewket and conway 2007 viste et al 2013 are other examples of hydro climatic extremes occurring in the region in the most recent period sparse rainfall and longer dry spells during the wet seasons cause severe droughts while heavy rainfall is responsible for flooding in the region seleshi and camberlin 2006 sutcliffe et al 1989 multiple studies have shown that factors such as large scale oceanic atmospheric interactions land use change climate change and poor water management are causing these extreme conditions conway 2000a melesse et al 2011 however the connection between extreme climate and terrestrial water storage at a given location is still unclear further studies have indicated that future climatic change will worsen the situation especially causing a decline in the seasonal runoff by the end of the century abdo et al 2009 setegn et al 2011 large scale oceanic atmospheric interaction due to variation in sea surface temperature sst linked to rainfall or precipitation fluctuations in the tropical regions müller and roeckner 2008 and more specifically in the east african region has been evidenced by various researchers black et al 2003 nicholson and kim 1997 parhi et al 2015 in fact studies have indicated there is a strong correlation between the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomena and climate and hydrological variability in the nile basin for example eltahir 1996 has shown that about 25 of the annual flow variability of the nile is related to or associated with the enso condition further various studies have also indicated a high correlation between flooding and drought conditions and the enso in the region amarasekera et al 1997 eltahir 1996 osman et al 2001 enso is the most important oceanic atmospheric phenomenon that causes large scale climate variability in interannual time scales it is characterized by sst and surface pressure anomalies across the pacific ocean warm ssts over the eastern pacific ushers the positive el niño phase while cool ssts over the ocean causes the negative la niña phase enso has a return period of about 3 7 years generally in the study site enso is inversely correlated with the climate high rainfalls are likely to occur during the la niña phase while low rainfall is likely to occur during the el niño phase abtew et al 2009 variations in extreme climate events are expected to affect the terrestrial water storage thus understanding the relationship between terrestrial water storage characteristics and climate variability in the basin is crucial studies conducted in the wider region of equatorial east africa ashok et al 2001 behera and yamagata 2003 black et al 2003 saji et al 1999 saji and yamagata 2003 show that anomalous warming cooling over the equatorial east pacific and indian ocean is associated with enhanced suppressed rainfall amounts in this region studies implied the sst to rainfall teleconnections in the region are both temporally and spatially complex and not yet fully understood due to the lack of complete understanding of the water cycle accurate quantification and characterization of climate extremes and measuring its impact on the water cycle is still challenging feng and houser 2016 available climate indices such as palmer drought index palmer 1965 and standard precipitation index spi guttman 1999 mckee et al 1993 are insufficient to quantify the impact of climate extremes on the water cycle this is because the above indices use only climate variables e g precipitation temperature in the analysis with no consideration of the hydrological variables e g soil moisture water storage khandu et al 2016 thomas et al 2014 to get the full picture of climate water interaction measurement of the terrestrial water balance is necessary predicting the variation in terrestrial water storage of a given basin is a demanding process it requires large observational data and sophisticated models now this is possible using satellite techniques which cover a large area and provide aggregate terrestrial water variables that describe the water cycle the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite which is one of its kind measures terrestrial water storage anomaly including water on the surface and in the sub surface of the earth over a large area rodell and famiglietti 2002 grace has been used in various studies on climate and water resources awange et al 2014a b forootan et al 2014 hassan and jin 2014 khandu et al 2016 long et al 2013 2014 niu et al 2014 seyoum and milewski 2016 2017 shamsudduha et al 2017 thomas et al 2014 yang et al 2014 for example shamsudduha et al 2017 tested multiple grace products along with other data to assess the variability in tws over the upper white nile basin including lake victoria and lake kyoga basins khandu et al 2016 examined the impact of humans and climate extremes on twsa in the ganges brahmaputra meghna river basin in south asia quantitative characterization of hydrologic drought using grace was developed by thomas et al 2014 awange et al 2014a employed statistical analysis to understand climate variability caused by large scale oceanic atmospheric interactions and human impact on water storage using grace and global land data assimilation system gldas model in the main nile river sub basins further in a different study awange et al 2014b characterized regional variation of water storages over ethiopia using grace based twsa estimate along with climate indices provides a better understanding of the climate extremes and its impact on the water cycle this study focused on the source region of the nile river the upper blue nile river basin including the lake tana and examined quantitative relationship between different water storages and climate indicators using grace and ancillary data there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the data obtained from grace however combined with other data grace provides significant insights into the change in tws the study provides valuable information regarding the management of water resources in response to climate variation furthermore this study includes the combination of satellite and other hydrologic variables in understanding the hydro climatic condition of a remote basin the applicability and usefulness of satellite techniques in general are invaluable especially in such data sparse regions 2 the study area the blue nile river basin the largest tributary of the nile river is a transboundary river basin shared by countries such as ethiopia and sudan the study area the ubn basin is part of the blue nile located in ethiopia and has a total drainage area of 199 950 km2 fig 1 the ubn basin is drained by rivers such as the blue nile river locally also known as abay river and consists of major water bodies such as lake tana lake tana has an average surface area of 3000 km2 the drainage area of lake tana basin is 15 000 km2 major tributary rivers e g little abay river megech river replenish lake tana and the overflow form the lake flows into the blue nile abay river the long term annual average flow of blue nile abay river near the outlet is 115 m3 s the water from the rivers and water bodies in the basin are used for irrigation hydroelectric power production recreation and fishery production and is the backbone of the region s economy the mountainous ethiopian highland rolling ridges cliffs hilly slopes and steep valleys characterize the eastern part of the study area which is a major source of runoff and sediments for the nile river while a relatively gentle slope characterizes the topography of the western and northwestern lowlands the highlands are made of volcanic edifices underlain by sedimentary terrains that are exposed in the valleys further downstream in the western low lands metamorphic rocks cover the outcrop the elevation in the basin ranges from 500 to 4200 m a s l fig 1 the high variation in topography and elevation influences climate and hydrology of the basin the average annual rainfall in the ubn basin ranges from 1000 mm in the western lowlands to 1900 mm in the southern highland with an annual average based on 1950 2016 data rainfall of 1350 mm fig 2 the wettest months are june july august and september jjas which account for more than 70 of the annual rainfall the monsoon activity over india is a major trigger for the july september rainfall variability in the east african highlands camberlin 1997 generally rainfall characteristics in the study area are influenced by three mechanisms conway 2000a the inter tropical convergence zone itcz that drives the summer monsoon during the wet season the saharan anticyclone that generates dry warm north easterly winds during the dry season and the arabian heights that produce thermal lows during the inter seasonal periods the land use in the highland part of the basin is mostly agricultural covering more than 50 of the land while in the western part forested land largely covers the region tekleab et al 2011 3 methods and data this paper examines variation in terrestrial water storage in connection to regional climatic influences in the ubn river basin using variables that describe the water cycle and climate such as rainfall lake height fluctuation terrestrial water storage anomaly and oceanic atmospheric index a suit of publicly available satellite data such as terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa data from grace satellite lake height from satellite altimetry rainfall and multivariate el niño southern oscillation index mei departure data were used in this study 3 1 data and processing monthly rainfall time series data ranging from 1950 to 2013 with spatial resolution of 0 5 by 0 5 schneider et al 2011 was collected from global precipitation climatology centre gpcc provided by the noaa oar esrl psd boulder co usa from their website https www esrl noaa gov psd date accessed 09 01 2016 this rainfall data extended up to the year 2016 using adjusted monthly rainfall data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission satellite monthly trmm 3b43 v7 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 2011 the most recent version of level 3 grace data rl 05 collected from three processing centers csr jpl and gfz landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 were used to understand storage characteristics of the basin the data ranges from april 2002 to july 2016 and is corrected by the supplied scale factors to restore the signal reduced during sampling and post processing of grace data each grace pixel has spatial resolution of 1 by 1 however due to large uncertainty of grace data at this scale basin wide twsa is calculated by averaging multiple grace pixels over the basin further to maintain highest level of accuracy an ensemble mean of the three grace solutions from csr jpl and gfz processing centers were calculated grace land data are available at http grace jpl nasa gov and is supported by the nasa measures program on the scaled grace data error was calculated using leakage and measurement error data satellite based lake height data for the largest lake in the basin lake tana was derived from multiple altimetry satellites and used in the analysis the satellite altimetry data is processed by crétaux et al 2011 was obtained from hydroweb http www legos obs mip fr soa hydrologie hydroweb accessed 9 22 2016 crétaux et al 2011 used multiple satellites such as topex poseidon jason 2 geosat fo saral and envisat i to extract altimetry data the influence of long term regional climate variability due to oceanic atmospheric interaction such as the el niño southern oscillation enso was understood using multivariate enso index mei anomaly data wolter 1987 and wolter and timlin 1993 calculated mei anomaly values for each of twelve sliding bi monthly seasons using principal component analysis of six observed variables sea level pressure zonal and meridional components of the surface wind sea surface temperature surface air temperature and total cloudiness fraction of the sky over the tropical pacific https www esrl noaa gov psd enso mei data accessed 10 1 2016 using the bimonthly mei departure values the upper and lower 30 percentiles were used as a threshold to classify between the la niña and el niño conditions respectively while all values between the 30 and 70 percentiles were considered as neutral conditions in this study wolter and timlin 2011 other researchers using different enso indices made similar observation for example hanley et al 2003 defined the threshold values for el niño and la niña using the 75th and 25th percentile respectively using sst anomaly data 3 2 statistical analysis trend and correlation trends in rainfall lake water height lwh and twsa time series data were examined to check if there is any long term climatological impact on the basin seasonal interannual and long term trends calculated using two different approaches firstly long term trend analysis were conducted using the mann kendall statistical test more specifically the seasonal kendall test is used to determine whether significant changes have occurred over the study period in the basin for twsa rainfall and lake height data while taking into account the variation due to seasonal effects hirsch and slack 1984 hirsch et al 1982 various researchers suggested seasonal kendall test for use in cyclic seasonally autocorrelated environmental data hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 hess et al 2001 such as hydrological data secondly interannual trends in basin water storage change and rainfall were analyzed by decomposing the time series into seasonal trend and irregular components kendall and stuart 1983 a seasonally adjusted trend is calculated by de seasonalizing the time series so that interannual trends can be visible a linear trend is fitted to the seasonally adjusted values and significance of the linear trend slope is tested at a 95 confidence level alpha 0 05 slope is used to calculate long term average volumetric storage change in the lake and in the basin in addition grid based correlation analysis was performed to understand the spatial variability between rainfall enso lwh and tws anomaly data the correlation between rainfall and enso data was conducted using long term data from 1950 to 2016 3 3 standard precipitation index spi analysis standard precipitation index analysis is used to evaluate the impact of climate extremes e g drought on terrestrial water storages in the basin spi is a commonly used to analyze the length and intensity of drought and wet conditions in a basin which is based on analysis of fitting a long term rainfall data with a probability distribution function for more details see mckee et al 1993 and guttman 1999 for this study spi was estimated at various time scales from 1 month to 24 months and was then correlated with lwh and twsa data spi values within the range of 1 represent normal dry and wet conditions where values greater than 1 and less than 1 indicate moderate to extreme wet and dry conditions respectively for comparison purposes other data lwh and twsa were z score normalized which is the number of standard deviations from the mean using the equation zi xi mean standard deviation 4 results and discussion 4 1 water storage and trend this section describes the results of long term seasonal and interannual trend analysis of water storages and rainfall data in the basin two types of trend basin averaged and gridded were examined for rainfall and twsa time series data lwh data also tested for long term and seasonal trend there is a clear interannual dry wet cycle in rainfall and loss gain cycle in lake and terrestrial water storage time series fig 3 the mann kendall trend test results table 1 show that there is no evidence of a monotonic long term trend in lake height water storage anomaly and rainfall data p value 0 05 at 95 confidence however considering the seasonal mann kendall trend test results the lwh data show monotonic seasonal trends in one or more months of the data p value 0 005 whereas rainfall p value 0 60 and twsa p value 0 43 data show no evidence of monotonic seasonal trend at the specified confidence level though not statistically significant the kendall tau values indicated that seasonally the rainfall shows an upward trend tau value positive and so does the lake height tau value positive generally the data showed no change in long term trend however significant interannual fluctuations were observed due to climate variability in the basin discussed later on the other hand gridded trend analysis of twsa data indicates that the southwestern part of the basin has had a net loss of about 3 25 km3 of water storage while the north and northeastern section of the basin has gained about 2 75 km3 of water storages between 2002 and 2016 this also correlates with the slight increase in lake storage where the lake is located in the northeastern section of the basin generally there is no evidence of monotonic trend in the gridded twsa data in the basin at 95 confidence level table 2 spatially gridded trend test on the rainfall data also shows no statistically significant trend in a large part of the basin table 2 except close to the western boundary where rainfall shows a statistically significant declining trend generally the data shows no significant increase or decrease in the long term trend in water storages such as lwh and twsa and rainfall in the basin considering the spatial variability of twsa in the basin generally the terrestrial water gain deficit is consistent throughout the basin and largely controlled by rainfall fig 4 shows spatio temporal variability of twsa for selected wet 2007 and 2014 and dry 2004 and 2009 years in the ubn basin while the remaining years 2003 and 2010 are moderate spatially twsa is less variable in the basin this could be due to poor resolution of the grace pixels in general slight variation is observed for example in 2007 and 2014 the southern part of the basin gained relatively higher terrestrial water storage 350 mm compared to the northern 280 mm part of the basin fig 4 this is because southern section of ubn gets higher amount of seasonal rainfall compared to the northern part fig 2 also the loss in twsa is intense in the southern e g the negative twsa in march 2004 and 2007 compared to the northern section of the ubn basin temporally water storage anomaly mimics the rainfall pattern with 2 month lag peak rainfall months are july and august fig 2 while the twsa peaked in september and october fig 4 this indicates water storage in the basin is highly controlled by climate generally in terms of water storage anomaly the basin was relatively drier in 2003 2004 2009 and 2010 years this is mainly caused by a decrease in the amount of rainfall the basin is getting during peak rainy season jjas for example the annual rainfall in the basin was 1050 and 975 mm during the dry years 2002 and 2009 respectively whereas the basin was receiving between 1220 and 1400 mm in annual rainfall between 2005 and 2007 as a result in 2007 the basin gained above 300 mm in water storage while the largest gain in water storage was 100 mm in 2009 in addition the effect of severe droughts that occurred in 2002 and 2009 probably affected the water storage in subsequent years and cause loss of water storage in 2003 and 2004 and 2010 respectively these drought periods discussed below and in the next section are linked with meteorological drought related to ocean atmospheric interactions although there is no significant long term trend in water storages and climatic condition in the ubn basin considering the interannual variation in climate and water storages at least two visible droughts occurred between 2002 and 2004 and 2009 2010 that resulted in a water deficit in the basin fig 3 there is a high correlation between drought indicator index spi at 12 month time scale and lake height data fig 5 this is due to a delayed response of the lake height to rainfall variability with a delay time of approximately 9 12 months relatively longer lag time between the lake lake tana and rainfall could be due to the size and characteristics of the lake tana basin that empties water into the lake the area of the lake tana basin is 15 000 km2 and major tributary rivers of the blue nile drains this basin and flow into lake tana thus longer lag time in response to rainfall seems reasonable as compared to twsa that is a cumulative effect of water budget variables e g soil moisture with very short lag time in response to rainfall using spi at a 12 month timescale the highest correlation there is an overlap between moderate to extreme drought years spi value from 1 to 2 5 and lake height fluctuation and twsa of the basin in the aforementioned periods as shown in the fig 3 these drought periods resulted in a water deficit in the lake and in the basin fig 6 a and b show linear trends calculated for the interannual variations including lake storage fig 6a and twsa fig 6b in the basin due limitation of the grace twsa data twsa data from 2002 to 2016 has been reported whereas trends on lake storage data were analyzed starting from the year 2000 as shown in fig 6a between 2000 and 2003 there was a decline in lake storage of lake tana during this period the lake was losing about 1 10 0 17 km3 of water per year a conservative error estimate in lake storage was conducted considering a seasonal surface area variation of lake tana which varies up to 500 km2 a similar basin wide water storage deficit was observed during this time where twsa data showed a negative storage anomaly in 2002 and 2003 and it is approximately 150 mm loss in equivalent water height additionally deficit in both lake storage and basin twsa was observed between 2009 and 2010 between 2007 and 2010 there was a decline in water storage in the basin the loss in water storage from lake tana was about 0 8 0 1 km3 year during this period though the 2002 drought seems relatively less extreme as compared to that in 2009 fig 7 the rate of annual loss of water storage from lake tana between 2007 and 2010 was lower than the rate between 2000 and 2003 this is because the wet condition between 2004 and 2006 was not as strong in magnitude and duration as that in the early 2000s fig 7 therefore the lake has not fully recovered to the same level as in the early 2000s considering the basin wide water storage the basin has lost about 7 4 1 2 km3 year in twsa between 2007 and 2010 the water lost from the lake was about 12 of the total loss in basin terrestrial water storage anomaly since 2010 the lake recovered most of the water lost during the previous dry seasons between 2010 and 2016 there is no statically significant trend in both lake and basin water storage the spi result showed that the climatic condition changes from extremely dry to wet conditions between 2010 and 2015 though statistically insignificant the basin gained about 2 5 1 2 km3 per year of twsa during this period 4 2 climate link and water resources fig 7 shows spi at the 12 month time scale in red and blue area plot is superimposed with mei values dark solid line the spi indicates a recurring moderate to extreme dry condition in the basin in an interval of 5 10 years the most recent moderate to extreme dry conditions that caused a decline in water storages in the basin occurred between 2002 and 2004 and 2009 2010 using the upper lower 30 percentile mei value as a threshold the wet condition corresponds to the la niña case and the dry condition corresponds to the el niño case since the 1970s weak to strong el niño cases have matched well with moderate to extreme dry conditions e g 1972 73 1982 84 1986 88 2002 03 2009 10 in the basin with some exceptions e g 1977 78 1997 98 but still below average rainfall was observed during these periods some of the above cases were a record historical exceptional years of drought in the region for example the 1984 drought was a year of exceptionally widespread drought that occurred in the region with 2009 being the second driest year surpassed only by the 1984 drought viste et al 2013 unlike the el niño the la niña cases show weak correspondence with wet conditions in the basin this might be due to many factors controlling the occurrence amount and distribution of rainfall in the basin such as terrestrial sources of atmospheric moisture e g regional lakes and or other sources from oceanic atmospheric interactions e g the atlantic ocean indian ocean playing varying roles in different seasons conway 2000b in the wet rainy season the ubn basin receives large amount of rainfall in the boreal summer fall months between june and september jjas see the inset in fig 2 comparison of average rainfall with mei anomaly values averaged over the wet season renders a strong relationship between the two as shown in fig 8 there is a strong negative correlation pearson correlation 0 62 p value 0 00 between seasonal mei anomaly and average rainfall in the ubn basin the seasonal rainfall is decreasing from the la niña condition mei 0 5 to el niño condition mei 0 6 in fig 8 the dotted line is a linear model fitted to the data slope 15 60 and p value 0 00 and the solid line indicates the average long term seasonal jjas rainfall considering the last 66 years from 1950 to 2016 below average season rainfall has occurred in almost all cases when there was a weak to strong el niño condition mei 0 6 on the other hand it was seen that above average to extreme seasonal rainfall occurs during weak to strong la niña condition mei 0 5 with few exceptions during neutral conditions 0 5 mei anomaly 0 6 fig 9 shows regional including part of adjacent basins correlation between seasonal rainfall and mei anomaly values generally inverse relationship is observed in the region which indicates that the low high seasonal rainfall is related to el niño la niña condition with few exceptions where the correlation is not statistically significant as described in the introduction section enso is characterized by sst and pressure anomalies over the pacific the el niño phase occurs when the ssts are warm in the eastern tropical pacific ocean and the opposite phase la niña occur when they are cool there are various assumptions about the mechanism impact of enso in east africa in general it affects partly due to teleconnections with tropical atlantic and indian oceans alexander et al 2002 chiang and sobel 2002 a strong negative correlation between mei values and wet season rainfall was observed in the lake tana area and in the eastern part of the ubn basin this part of the region is highly sensitive to extreme climatic condition e g drought it was the most affected area during both the 1984 and 2009 extreme droughts with regard to other seasons the correlation between seasonal rainfall and mei anomaly values see table 3 are weak and mostly not statistically significant for example there is no statistically significant relationship between april may june amj and october november december ond rainfalls and mei anomaly values though there is a positive correlation r 0 28 between rainfall and mei anomaly in the january february march quarters there is no clear relationship between high low rainfall and enso la niña or el niño phases conditions in jfm season further the highest rainfall in jfm season occur during enso neutral condition 0 5 mei anomaly 0 6 this imply that rainfall in this season might be controlled by other ocean atmospheric conditions such as the indian ocean further lake height altimetry and grace twsa data fitted with smooth lines using locally weighted scatterplotsmoothing loess method revealed variation in water storage related to the variation in the mei anomaly values fig 10 similar to the pattern between rainfall and enso index the smoothed water storage anomaly data shows more negative deficit when mei departure values are positive the el niño case and more positive water storage anomaly surplus when mei departure values are negative the la niña case for example both lake height and basin twsa were negative storage deficit during 2002 2004 and 2009 2010 drought periods where mei departure values were positive the el niño case as stated in the above section the water storage deficit in the basin occurs as a result of low rainfall received during the peak rainy season jjas this is directly linked with strong enso signal similar studies found positive correlation between enso and grace twsa in the study region awange et al 2014a the two notable droughts that resulted in significant water storage deficit were also detected by various researches bewket and conway 2007 viste et al 2013 generally lake tana and the upper blue nile basin gains water storage when the season changes from the el niño to the la niña condition e g 2009 2011 1994 1996 the basin loses water when the season changes from stronger la niña to el niño conditions e g 1997 2003 2008 2010 generally the link between the oceanic atmospheric interaction i e enso and rainfall in the ubn basin is strong also has a clear connection between the terrestrial water storage variation and climate in the ubn basin this strong link provides valuable information regarding the management of water resources in response to extreme climatic variability 5 summary and conclusions the upper blue nile basin and the east africa region in general is highly vulnerable to extreme climatic conditions such as drought which directly affect the quantity and occurrences of terrestrial water storage in the basin major rivers e g the nile river and tributaries are the lifeline for many who live in this region a suit of publically available data including remote sensing e g twsa from grace lake height data from satellite altimetry and rainfall along with multivariate enso index time series were analyzed to investigate the impact of climatic extremes on the water storage variation in the ubn basin two notable droughts were observed between 2002 and 2004 and 2009 and 2010 which resulted in terrestrial water deficit in the basin the 2009 drought is the second severe drought on record which occurred in the region in recent history after the 1984 drought generally the mann kendall trend test indicated no statistically significant trend in rainfall similar findings by others viste et al 2013 lake height of lake tana and twsa in the basin however the interannual climate variation causing significant deficit in water storages ranging from 0 8 to 1 1 km3 year of loss in lake storage and up to 7 5 km3 year loss in basin terrestrial water storage occurred as a result of the 2003 and 2009 droughts the above listed extreme droughts and other drought events clearly correlate with enso data more specifically the wet season june september rainfall inversely correlates r 0 62 with multivariate enso index departure values higher correlation values are obtained in the eastern part of the basin as this part of the basin is highly sensitive to extreme climate fluctuations the strong link between enso indicators mei values and rainfall in the basin shows the possibility of predicting regional climate variation using data from oceanic atmospheric interactions in the pacific and thus the hydrologic cycle further comparison of mei with water storage data reveals water storage lake storage and twsa responding to regional climate signals especially the deficits are found to be coincident with the el niño cases this study quantified the impact of climate on water storage and established a link between climate and water storage using satellite based data the findings of this study combined with studies such as socioeconomic impact of drought will facilitate better planning and management of water resources in water stressed regions like the blue nile basin where marginal changes in hydrologic budgets have significant implications on the livelihood of the population furthermore this study demonstrate the application of a combination of satellite and other hydrologic data in understanding the hydro climatic condition of a remote basin 
6944,potential impact of climate change on the inland waterway transport of the mackenzie river basin mrb have been investigated through simulations of the hydrologiske byrån avdeling för vattenbalans hbv hydrological model the hbv light for the baseline 1974 2004 and future periods of 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 over the mrb driven by precipitation and air temperature data of representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of 10 global climate models statistically downscaled by the pacific climate impacts consortium using the bias correction spatial disaggregation the average onset of spring snowmelt between 2041 and 2100 is projected to occur up to two weeks earlier than the historical 1974 2004 climate projected warmer temperature and higher precipitation will lead to higher runoff for mrb in winter and spring at the expense of decreased summer streamflow and water level at fort simpson and arctic red river stations partly because projected increase in evapotranspiration will offset the projected increase in precipitation under a warmer climate navigation issues related to low water levels are expected to increase e g under rcp8 5 at arctic red river station the number of days the water level above 5 m is projected to decrease from 74 days in 1974 2000 to 42 days in the 2080s the summer durations that water levels of mrb will be at or above 3 4 and 5 m are projected to decrease by 2 8 22 2 10 0 34 5 and 16 2 43 4 respectively which mean navigation problems would increase because safe transit through mrb depends on its water levels keywords mackenzie river basin water level arctic transportation network impacts of climate change statistical downscaling hbv hydrologic model 1 introduction climate change has affected river basins worldwide both socially and environmentally including the mackenzie river basin mrb of canada the water resources of mrb are of key interest to canada and the mackenzie river provides the largest source of freshwater from north america to the arctic ocean in addition the stage of the mackenzie river plays a major role to the transportation of northern communities of northwest territories nwt e g the mackenzie river provides a critical corridor in canada s arctic transportation network during the relatively short open water season of may to october the mackenzie river carries barge traffic for supply and bulk fuel shipments to the north arctic council 2009 the mackenzie river is a major river of the world ranks 10th by length and 13th by drainage area it provides an active transportation corridor for residents because most residents living along the river travel by snowmobile on the ice cover in winter and by personal watercraft in the summer in other words the water levels of the mackenzie river play a major role to the transportation of the northern communities of nwt modern transportation is essential for our society to function but as an economic sector it is the fourth largest contributor to global greenhouse gases ghg emissions ipcc 2014 climate warming has caused extreme climate to occur more frequently worldwide including the mrb trenberth et al 2003 this study focuses on potential effects of climate change on the water level of the mackenzie river a major inland waterway transport of canada s north which is likely more sensitive to climate change impact than other modes of transport of northern canada inland waterway transport generally has a low environmental impact compared to transportation involving heavy vehicles mckinnon

warmer climate projected by ipcc 2013 an earlier spring freshet and a lower streamflow in the summer but higher in the fall could extend the navigation season of mrb to about 137 days however given the carrying capacity of the inland water transport of mrb also depends on its water level lower summer water levels in the future could offset the benefit of an extended navigation season due to climate change impact zheng and kim 2017 according to the canadian mackenzie gewex study mags stewart et al 1998 a major contributor to the global energy and water cycle exchanges gewex project which focuses on atmospheric and the hydrologic systems of mrb mrb has experienced a pronounced warming trend which could be up to 2 c per decade in some locations during winters cohen 1997 for example the annual temperature in inuvik near the arctic ocean has increased by about 3 c since the 1940s environment and natural resources gnwt 2008 in recent decades a warmer climate had resulted in various climatic and environmental changes such as more intensive storms more severe droughts less soil moisture shorter winter ice seasons significant thinning of sea ice and freshwater ice reduction in snow

gan 2013 weller et al 2005 barry and gan 2011 kuo et al 2015 each year between may october the mackenzie river provides the bulk transportation to northern communities of nwt however it was shut down about a month earlier in 2015 because of low water levels the northern transportation company battled even lower water levels with lighter loads and more barges in the second straight season of 2016 the reduced discharge and low water levels has limited the cargo carrying capacity of vessels and increased the shipping costs to the north in recent years climate change impacts could lead to greater uncertainties in future streamflow and water levels of the mackenzie kerr 1997 based on composite climate scenarios for the mrb soulis et al 1994 and kerr 1997 found that the precipitation of mrb was projected to increase which should have resulted in a higher runoff but enhanced evapotranspiration has led to lower streamflow and lake levels in the mrb they also projected that the spring ice break up will occur earlier with higher spring snowmelt runoff under climate change impact the main objective of this study is to investigate how the possible hydrologic impact of climate change on mrb will contribute to physical limitations of the critical corridor of canada s arctic transportation network the potential climate change impact on water levels of the mackenzie river a crucial factor for the inland waterway transport was simulated by the conceptual hydrologic model hbv light hydrologiske byrån avdeling för vattenbalans light seibert and vis 2012 driven by statistically downscaled

by using more and newer climate scenarios of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc of 2013 statistically downscaled by pcic the results of this study will be useful for planning the inland water transport of mrb and its future municipal infrastructure development to mitigate the potential impact of climate change with the above introduction the study site data and research methodology are given in section 2 discussion of results in section 3 and conclusions in section 4 2 study site data and methodology 2 1 study site mackenzie river basin mrb as the largest river basin of canada mrb can be divided into five main sub basins table 2 three great lakes and three major deltas the main headwaters are the columbia ice field in the jasper national park and snowfields of the upper peace river in northeastern british columbia with a huge land area of about 1 8 million km2 mrb lies between 51on to almost 70on experiences mild summers and cold winters in the south to long cold winters and short cool summers in the north stewart et al 1998 further mrb is currently experiencing a warming trend environment and natural resources gnwt 2008 mrb receives a mean annual precipitation of 410 mm with 6 to 8 months of snowfall its mean temperatures are about 25 c to 30 c in winter and 15 c in summer the annual mean evapotranspiration is about 230 mm which mainly occurs between may and october the annual mean discharge of the mackenzie river into the arctic ocean is about 9100 m3 s or approximately 180 mm per year of runoff there are six major rivers within the mrb fig 1 and table 3 the athabasca river is the upstream river and is located in the most southern area of the mrb the confluence of the athabasca river and the peace river with lake athabasca forms the peace athabasca delta the w a c bennet dam is located at the head of the peace river and has had regulated streamflow since 1967 the demands of electric power production resulted in greater winter flows in the peace river while the spring and summer peaks have been suppressed seneka 2004 the peace river flows into the slave river which enters the great slave lake the fifth largest lake in north america the mackenzie river starts at the extreme west end of the great slave lake and empties into the beaufort sea through the mackenzie delta the majority of the mackenzie river is situated within the great bear lake basin which starts at fort simpson where the liard river reaches the mackenzie river the mackenzie delta commences at a location called the point separation from which the mackenzie river splits into three major channels the east channel the middle channel and the peel channel streamflow entering the mackenzie delta is typically measured where the arctic red river enters the mackenzie river approximately 25 km upstream of point separation in this study the streamflow of the athabasca and peace river basins have been separately simulated by hbv and compared with the long term observed streamflow data of the gauging stations of fort simpson and arctic red river respectively fig 1 2 2 data water levels of the mackenzie river were analyzed over the historical baseline of 1974 2004 and the projected period of 2041 2100 daily 10 km gridded precipitation and temperature data are taken from the anusplin australian national university spline dataset of environment canada hutchinson et al 2009 the mean daily temperature was calculated as the average of the minimum and maximum temperature time series the hbv model was also calibrated using data from 31 climate stations available in the second generation of daily adjusted precipitation mekis and vincent 2011 and the second generation of homogenized temperature dataset for canada vincent et al 2012 hbv was configured by using both the gridded and areally weighted climate station data as input which yielded comparable results however hbv driven by climate station data required an additional parameter to adjust its temperature and precipitation with elevation such a model configuration was not compatible with gridded data from climate change scenarios and therefore only the model configuration and results using anusplin data are discussed here digital elevation map dem data of the mackenzie of 3arc seconds 35 93 m resolution were used to characterize the terrains of the five sub basins of mrb using elevation bands at 200 m intervals the land use information for mrb was obtained from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer terra aqua land cover type yearly l3 global 500 m sin grid product plp daac 2012 modis is a sensor mounted on the terra and aqua satellite the dataset consist of land cover classes developed from one year of remotely sensed data acquired by the terra and aqua modis sensor there are five different classification schemes in this product in this study the land cover type 5 plant functional type pft scheme which contained 12 different land cover types was chosen and reclassified to three land cover types because hbv model parameters could be specified for up to three land cover types historic daily snow water equivalent swe data between 1 november 1988 and 31 march 2016 for mrb was extracted from the globsnow dataset it contains swe estimate for the whole northern hemisphere between latitudes 35 and 85 excluding mountainous regions and greenland with a nominal spatial resolution of 25 km takala et al 2011 provide a full description of the methodology for the globsnow swe estimates within the mrb there were 2294 grids with swe data excluding water and mountainous regions the mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 was used to estimate trends that were significant at the 0 05 level trend magnitude in mm yr was estimated using the theil sen approach theil 1950 sen 1968 this study used daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature data of canada for climate change scenarios of ten gcms of cmip5 ipcc 2013 statistically downscaled by the pcic pacific climate impacts consortium table 1 pcic statistically downscaled the output of twelve global climate models gcms of ipcc 2013 of 1950 to 2100 at a resolution of 300 arc seconds which is approximately 10 km the statistical downscaling was performed using the bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd technique werner 2011 and the bias correction constructed analogues with quantile mapping reordering bccaq technique werner and cannon 2015 comparing the bcsd and bccaq method data with the canesm2 model the bcsd method resulted in an average temperature distribution that was more in line with average historical observations over the same period therefore the bcsd data was selected for all subsequent gcms a systematic description of the bcsd method can be found in werner 2011 who also summarized it in three steps a use quantile mapping to perform bias correction of the gcm fields b apply local scaling of the corrected fields to the target higher resolution of the application and c use the monthly averages of the locally scaled fields to re sample the daily historic record the bcsd method described by wood et al 2004 and maurer and hidalgo 2008 was modified and adjusted the modifications used by the pcic include incorporating monthly minimum and maximum temperatures instead of monthly mean temperatures and bias correction using detrended quantile mapping with the delta method extrapolation according to werner 2011 the bcsd method is advantageous in its ability to capture trends in the regional climate and hydrologic response as well as the transient nature of the emissions scenarios a disadvantage is that if the output data from a gcm is poor the same limitations are carried forward in the downscaling process the pcic downscaled datasets are based on gcms projections for three representative concentrated pathways rcp but only rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios were considered in this study radiative forcing in rcp4 5 peaks at about 4 5 w m2 540 ppm co2 in year 2100 rcp4 5 is comparable to the sres special report emission scenario scenario b1 with similar co2 concentrations and median temperature increases by 2100 rcp8 5 assumes a high rate of radiative forcing increase peaking at 8 5 w m2 940 ppm co2 in year 2100 rcp8 5 assumes higher co2 concentrations than sres a2 scenarios by 2100 ipcc 2007 ipcc 2013 streamflow of mrb was modelled by calibrating hbv against streamflow of five hydrometric stations separately starting first from sub basin 1 then sub basin 2 until sub basin 5 the division of the sub basins were based on the quality of available streamflow data taken from the water survey canada s hydrometric database hydat of environment canada 2013 naturalized streamflow for station 07ha001 on the peace river was obtained from the government of alberta seneka 2004 hydrometric stations downstream of the peace river with records that were likely significantly influenced by regulated flows were excluded the final hydrometric stations used in this study are given in fig 1 and table 2 stage discharge tables for fort simpson and arctic red river stations on the mackenzie river were obtained from the water survey of canada best fit nonlinear regression equations were developed from the stage discharge data and applied to convert simulated discharge values to river stages in meters 3 research methodology to study the possible impact of climate change on the inland waterway transport of the mackenzie river the hydrologiske byrån avdeling för vattenbalans hbv model bergstrom 1975 was selected to simulate the hydrological response of mrb hbv was originally developed at the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi for runoff simulation and hydrological forecasting in the early 1970s as a conceptual semi distributed rainfall runoff model for modeling catchment hydrology hbv has been used to perform various impact studies for climate change assessments kuo et al 2017 bergstrom et al 2001 vehviläinen and huttunen 1997 this study used the latest version of hbv the hbv light model of seibert and vis 2012 which is set up with three conceptual storage tanks as soil moisture zone upper and lower zones respectively it operates with daily precipitation temperature and evaporation as input data 4 the hbv light model the hbv light model consists of routines for modeling snow accumulation and snowmelt soil moisture accounting a runoff response function and a runoff routing procedure fig 2 as a semi distributed hydrologic model hbv considers spatial climate variabilities by modeling each sub basin with different temperature precipitation and evaporation time series given significant climatic and hydrologic variabilities have been observed in canada mwale et al 2009 which could be linked to climate anomalies jiang et al 2014 this is an effort to account for uncertainties associated with catchment hydrologic modeling since each sub basin may have more than one climate stations areally weighted mean daily temperature and precipitation for each sub basin were calculated using the thiessen polygon method potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated from air temperature using hamon s 1961 temperature index equation eq 1 1 pet 29 8 d e s t 273 3 where e s 0 611 e 17 27 t t 237 3 is the saturation vapor pressure kpa pet in mm day d hrs the daylight hours and t oc the mean daily temperature the snow routine accounts for snow accumulation and snowmelt by a simple degree day approach while the soil moisture routine estimates groundwater recharge and actual evaporation as a function of the water storage excessive water from precipitation and snowmelt is transformed to runoff by a response function it consists of two conceptual storages tanks that simultaneously re distribute the generated runoff as quick and slow responses respectively the recharge from the soil routine is divided into two parts the portion of the recharge added to the upper tank is computed using the parameter part the upper tank runoff the basin s quick runoff responses qu t is assumed to be the lesser value of the upper

increment variables pcalt tcalt pelev and telev when applicable are calibrated using a monte carlo calibration tool built inside the hbv light model the other two hbv model parameters cfr refreezing coefficient and cwh water holding capacity are set at 0 05 and 0 1 respectively as recommended instead of being calibrated the basin was also divided into different elevation bands for each elevation band the temperature and precipitation was adjusted with respect to its elevation above sea level by the parameter tcalt 100 m the lapse rate with the elevation telev m of temperature data and pcalt 100 m the change of precipitation with elevation pelev m of precipitation data hbv was calibrated against the observed streamflow data using anusplin data as input over the period 1 1 1974 31 12 1997 by the monte carlo approach and gap genetic algorithm powell s quadratically convergent method seibert 2000 press et al 2002 for each of the five sub basins separately the first year data of 1973 was used as spin up for hbv in order to establish proper initial conditions for the calibration and validation periods and therefore was not included in the results the monte carlo procedure performs a large number of simulations and each individual simulation is allocated random parameter values from pre defined parameter ranges this resulted in five sets of optimized hbv parameters one set for each of the five sub basins of mrb observed streamflow of mackenzie at station 10gc001 of fort simpson was the upstream site chosen in the calibration because hbv is not set up to model the mackenzie delta which is a wetland the downstream station selected for the mackenzie river was station 10lc014 of the arctic red river hbv was automatically calibrated using an objective function based on the nash sutcliffe ns coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 5 that minimizes differences between the simulated streamflow of hbv versus the observed 5 ns 1 t 1 n q obs t q sim t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where q obs is the mean observed streamflow q obs t q sim t the simulated streamflow and n the total number of time steps hbv is well calibrated with physically meaningful parameters if the ns obtained in both the calibration and validation stages are close to 1 the calibrated model was validated against observed streamflow data for the period 1 1 1998 31 12 2004 independent of the calibration experience anusplin likely is the best gridded dataset available for canada was used to calibrate hbv for mrb over the baseline period after the calibrated hbv was validated it was forced with precipitation and air temperature data downscaled by pcic using the bcsd statistical downscaling method werner and cannon 2016 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios of 10 gcms of ipcc 2013 to simulate an ensemble of hydrologic responses of mrb to climate change impact over 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2100 respectively by considering climate scenarios of many gcms of cmip5 we can estimate uncertainties associated with hydrologic responses of mrb to long term climate projections water levels of rivers can be estimated using a hydraulic model based on observed streamflow data and detailed river cross section information because of a lack of measurement on the cross section of the mackenzie river best fit nonlinear regression equations developed from the stage discharge data were applied to convert simulated future discharge to future river stages of the mackenzie in meters 5 discussion of results results were obtained for all five sub basins however in this section results are for the most part presented and discussed for the fort simpson and arctic red river stations located on the mackenzie river only because this is the focus of the study even though these two stations do not represent the mackenzie river as a whole they represent the general upstream and downstream conditions of mrb respectively 5 1 calibration and validation of hbv at the calibration validation stage the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns obtained for the calibration and validation periods for hbv ranged between 0 78 and 0 88 as shown in table 4 for the mackenzie river r2 and ns coefficient obtained for the calibration period are 0 86 and 0 84 at fort simpson and 0 88 for both statistics at arctic red river respectively the validation runs resulted in a r2 of 0 84 and ns of 0 83 at fort simpson and a r2 of 0 87 and ns of 0 86 at arctic red river selected streamflow hydrographs simulated by hbv during the validation stage for fort simpson and arctic red river are shown in fig 3 hbv accurately simulated the spring snowmelt which has a sharp peak compared to the winter flow but it marginally under simulated the falling limb of the hydrograph the simulated base flow in the winter is under simulated compared to the observed flow this could in part due to inaccurate measurements of the ice covered river in winter and in part due to the flow regulation of the w a c bennet dam instead of under simulation of snowmelt which in mrb should be minimal during winter singh et al 2009 thus for both fort simpson and arctic red river stations hbv forced with the anusplin dataset can simulate the streamflow of mrb that agree closely with the hydrometric measurements this means that hbv is well calibrated its optimized model parameters are physically meaningful and therefore there is sufficient basis to use the calibrated hbv to simulate the impact of climate change to mrb assuming mrb will be subjected to minimal landuse change and other possible human impacts in the future after hbv was calibrated and validated with the anusplin data driving hbv with pcic s statistically downscaled data for the base period generally resulted in over simulated streamflow compared to streamflow simulated using the anusplin data and observed streamflow even though the over simulation problem varies from gcm to gcm therefore the precipitation of each gcm for mrb was individually reduced by a constant factor across the entire mrb so that the mean simulated streamflow of hbv driven by the gcms precipitation data for the base period agree well with the observed historic streamflow data the precipitation adjustment factors varied between 10 and 13 for different gcms 5 2 changes of precipitation and air temperature projected changes of pcic s statistically downscaled precipitation and air temperature data under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios of 10 gcms of ipcc 2013 over 2050s and 2080s against pcic s data of the baseline period 1974 2004 are presented as percentage over fort simpson and arctic red river stations respectively fig 4 as expected the temperature is projected to increase between 2 5 c and 5 c in the 2050s and between 3 c and 8 c in the 2080s at both fort simpson and arctic red river respectively the precipitation is projected to increase between 16 and 35 in the 2050s and between 18 and 43 in the 2080s at arctic red river at fort simpson the precipitation is projected to increase between 15 and 32 in the 2050s and between 15 and 40 in the 2080s both temperature and precipitation are projected to change over a relatively wide range under rcp8 5 scenarios in 2080s see fig 4 5 3 water levels at arctic red river station the streamflow regimes and water levels at the arctic red river based on downscaled climate scenarios of ipcc 2013 are presented as boxplots representing weekly streamflow over the historic period 1974 2004 and projected changes in 2050s and 2080s as shown in fig 5 a water levels simulated from driving hbv with anusplin data over the historical period show a generally similar range than the observed streamflow in the summer the peak streamflow in the spring april and may simulated is lower and the winter base flow simulated are marginally lower than the observed which is expected partly because of the flow regulation by the w a c bennet dam on the other hand over 1974 2004 hbv driven by pcic s statistically downscaled data simulated a marginally earlier spring melt between the 14th and the 20th weeks historically the navigation season on the mackenzie river is from june to october on average between june and october the mean water level simulated by hbv using gcms data correspond well to the mean observed water levels over 1974 2004 fig 5b to present the average projected change at the arctic red station the average projected hydrograph of hbv driven by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of each gcm are shown in fig 5c and d expressed in water levels average water levels based on hbv s simulations for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios generally show a lower peak in the summer an earlier spring snowmelt and a higher winter base flow compared to the historical period water levels are consistently projected to be higher than the observed during spring april and may but generally at the expense of lower than observed summer water levels for all climate scenarios considered in both periods this is because of more rainfall and less snowfall an earlier onset of spring snowmelt and more evaporation loss in the summer under a warmer climate in the future see section 3 6 and 3 7 the winter base flow simulated are marginally lower than the observed which is partly because of the flow regulation by the w a c bennet dam compared to the historic period the peak summer water level is projected to be on average about 1 m lower and the water level is projected to remain lower throughout the summer of 2050s fig 5c similar changes are projected for the 2080s fig 5d and the spring snowmelt could occur up to 4 weeks earlier than the observed the peak flow could occur on an average by about a week earlier than the historic period but the summer water levels projected at the arctic red between june and october based on downscaled climate scenarios of access1 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 inmcm4 and mpi esm lr are about 0 5 to 1 5 m lower than observed summer water levels fig 5d for all climate scenarios of ten gcms considered the projected summer water levels vary widely up to a difference of 1 5 m between the lowest mpi esm lr and the highest mri cgcm3 projected summer water levels between these two gcms the difference in the projected water levels based on rcp8 5 is larger than that based on rcp4 5 fig 6 a d coincidentally projected water levels in the 2050s under rcp8 5 are generally comparable to projected water levels in the 2080s under rcp4 5 fig 6b and c most projected summer water levels are lower than the mean observed summer water levels the difference between observed and projected summer water levels is mostly higher under rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 and in the 2080s than in the 2050s there is generally a greater difference between projected water levels for the 2050s and the base period than projected water levels between 2050s and 2080s fig 6e fig 6a d show the range of possible streamflow diverges as we project into the distant future because differences between long term climate projections of gcms grow as we project towards the end of the 21st century e g from about 1 2 m or less in 2050s to over 2 m in 2080s under rcp8 5 in other words as expected uncertainties associated with projected water levels grow from 2050s to 2080s 5 4 water levels at fort simpson river station annual hydrographs simulated by hbv expressed as weekly water levels at fort simpson are shown in fig 7 water levels simulated at fort simpson generally agree with the observed water levels even though it marginally simulated higher water levels between august and october fig 7e hbv also marginally over simulated the spring snowmelt streamflow in april and may but it is closer to the observed at fort simpson than at arctic red river stations the marginal discrepancies could be caused by either the limitations of hbv or the accuracy of the climate data over the same historic period streamflow simulated by hbv driven by the 10 sets of statistically downscaled gcms climate data show higher simulated water levels between march and april but between june and october the mean simulated water levels using the gcms data agree well with mean observed water levels fig 7e hbv simulated a wide range of possible water levels for 1974 2004 compared to the historical observations especially during the peak flow period overall hbv simulated water levels over the base period that are generally comparable to the historical observations except during the spring snowmelt period and towards the end of summer hbv driven by gcms rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios in the 2050s and the 2080s simulated a wide range of water levels at fort simpson fig 7 which exceed the range of water levels simulated by hbv further downstream at the arctic red river station as expected under the impact of climate change hbv simulated an earlier onset of spring melt lower peak water levels and lower summer water levels at both the fort simpson and the arctic red river stations 5 5 annual and seasonal water volume it appears that under rcp climate scenarios of ipcc 2013 studied herein a shift to earlier spring freshets but lower summer flows are projected for the future navigational spring and summer seasons of mrb the average annual streamflow over 1974 2004 at fort simpson and arctic red river was 227 2 km3 and 292 3 km3 respectively table 5 the average annual streamflow is projected to decrease marginally from 1 4 to 6 4 under most climate scenarios but it could decrease by 15 0 at fort simpson in the 2080s under rcp8 5 and marginally increase by 1 0 at arctic red river in the 2080s under rcp4 5 however the average summer streamflow under all rcp climate scenarios considered is projected to decrease over 10 at fort simpson but up to 30 4 under rcp8 5 in the 2080s a similar change is projected for the arctic red river station where its streamflow is projected to decrease by 20 3 under rcp8 5 in the 2080s and about 6 5 to 8 5 under rcp4 5 in both periods and under rcp8 5 in the 2050s in contrast the average winter streamflow under all climate scenarios considered is projected to increase from 14 8 to 37 7 in both periods overall above results suggest that because of climate change impact the annual hydrograph is projected to shift the total annual streamflow is expected to decrease particularly the summer streamflow which is projected to decrease more in 2080s than in 2050s at both fort simpson and arctic red river stations however under a warmer climate the winter streamflow is projected to increase in the 2050s and even more in the 2080s at both stations overall the future streamflow of mrb is projected to increase in the winter at the expense of the summer 5 6 snow water equivalent spring snowmelt is a major source of water for mrb the average annual swe snow water equivalent at fort simpson is projected to decrease by about 15 2 and 21 3 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and to decrease by about 17 and 41 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp8 5 respectively fig 8 the average annual swe at arctic red river is projected to decrease by about 5 5 and 6 2 under rcp4 5 in the 2050s and 2080s and 9 2 and 20 1 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp8 5 respectively which are less compared to fort simpson probably because of its higher latitude location even though the winter precipitation at fort simpson is projected to increase by 27 6 under rcp8 5 and the winter water levels its swe is projected to decrease substantially in the 2080s decreasing swe trends are partly related to the tendency of an earlier onset of spring melt and more precipitation during winter will occur as rainfall instead of snowfall under a warmer climate which would increase the winter streamflow as shown in previous sections decreasing swe trends in north america have been detected from passive microwave data collected between 1979 and 2007 gan et al 2013 as expected projected decrease in swe would affect the hydrology of mrb particularly resulting in less summer streamflow 5 7 evapotranspiration the amount of actual evapotranspiration aet simulated by hbv depends on the soil moisture and the potential evapotranspiration under rcp climate scenarios the warm period is expected to begin in late march and to continue to early november similarly evaportranspiration will begin in late march peaks in july and declines until november at both stations fig 9 the annual total aet is projected to increase under all rcp climate scenarios and in both periods particularly under rcp8 5 and in the 2080s which is partly why the summer streamflow is consistently projected to decrease from 2050s to 2080s although the annual distribution of aet may only change marginally the projected increase in the annual total evapotranspiration of mrb is relatively large 13 7 34 0 compared with the projected increase of 10 3 26 2 in the mean annual precipitation which resulted in less total streamflow especially the summer 5 8 days above or at different water levels from may to october in high latitudes the presence of river ice limits shipping in the mackenzie river to a short summer ice free season which also depends on water levels and weather conditions the depth that a vessel will sink into the water depends on its load for a heavy load the depth will be greater and therefore the goods carrying capacity of a barge is directly affected by the water level of the river typically the shipping season of the mackenzie river is from may to october even though a warmer climate will lead to an earlier ice breakup in spring and later freezing in autumn in this study we chose to investigate possible changes to water levels from may to october because it has been the arctic shipping season the average number of days that water levels exceed certain thresholds between may to october under different climate change scenarios will directly affect the shipping schedule and transportation problems in the arctic changes in the timing of low water levels can also affect the northern navigation and projected reduction in water levels will incur negative impacts to commercial shipping operations in the mackenzie river zheng and kim 2017 at fort simpson and arctic red river stations the number of days that water levels will be above 3 m and 4 m are projected to decrease in the 2050s and more severely in the 2080s while the number of days that water levels above 5 m are projected to decrease marginally more in the 2080s than in the 2050s under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively see table 5 which shows ensemble mean water levels at fort simpson the number of days that water levels will be above 5 m under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 is projected to decrease by 17 8 19 4 in the 2050s and 17 1 43 4 in the 2080s they are projected to decrease by 18 9 21 6 in the 2050s and 16 2 43 2 in the 2080s at the arctic red river station for water levels above 3 m under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 the numbers of days are projected to decrease by 2 8 6 1 and 4 8 7 8 in the 2050s and 4 4 19 9 and 6 6 22 2 in the 2080s for fort simpson and arctic red river stations respectively under rcp8 5 the number of days that water levels will be above 3 m is expected to decrease by 36 days at fort simpson in the 2080s at the downstream arctic red river station the number of days the water level is projected to be lower than 3 5 m are expected to be less than at fort simpson which could affect the shipping operation further north the average duration of the navigation season under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 with a water level of 5 m or higher in the 2080s has been estimated to be 107 73 days and 62 42 days for the fort simpson and arctic red river stations respectively therefore under the potential impact of climate change especially under rcp8 5 navigation problems are expected to get worse in the 21st century because a safe transit through the mackenzie river depends on its water levels 6 summary and conclusions the potential impact of climate change on the water levels of the mackenzie river was investigated by forcing the conceptual hydrological model hbv light at five locations within the mrb with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of ten gcms statistically downscaled by pcic using the bcsd method the analyses included temperature precipitation streamflow water levels discharge volume swe the actual evapotranspiration and the number of days that water levels are above certain thresholds the time periods considered were the historic period 1974 2004 and the projected periods 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2100 under rcp4 5 climate scenarios the air temperature precipitation of mrb is projected to increase by 2 3 2 5 c 6 4 9 5 in the 2050s and 2 7 3 1 c 10 7 12 1 in the 2080s under rcp8 5 climate scenarios the air temperature precipitation of mrb is projected to increase by 2 8 3 1 c 9 8 13 2 and 4 8 5 4 c 16 1 21 0 in the 2050s and 2080s respectively in other words rcp8 5 climate scenarios project a larger change in precipitation than rcp4 5 in 2050s and 2080s based on results obtained from rcp climate scenarios temperature and precipitation are generally projected to increase to a larger extent in northern than in southern sub basins of mrb driven with gridded anusplin data the hbv light model was calibrated and validated independently against observed streamflow of fort simpson and arctic red river stations at the calibration and validation stages r2 nash sutcliffe coefficient ns obtained at fort simpson are 0 89 and 0 85 0 88 and 0 74 respectively the corresponding r2 ns obtained for the arctic red river station are 0 89 and 0 87 0 88 and 0 73 respectively under downscaled rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of 10 gcms of ipcc 2013 the streamflow and water level of the mackenzie river at fort simpson and arctic red river stations are projected to increase in winter and spring but at the expense of the summer streamflow and water level because the projected increase in evapotranspiration loss offset the projected increase in precipitation in the summer and swe is projected to decrease because more rainfall and less snowfall under warmer climate the spring streamflow and water levels are projected to increase because warming will result in an earlier onset of spring snowmelt in mrb given the projected earlier spring snowmelt but reduced water levels in the summer climate change is expected to affect the arctic ferry operations of the mackenzie river which could start earlier because a warmer climate will cause an earlier onset of spring snowmelt and higher spring discharge under rcp8 5 scenarios the number of days the water level at arctic red river station will be above 5 m is projected to decrease from 74 in 1974 2000 to only 42 days in the 2080s the total duration that water levels of the mackenzie river at fort simpson and arctic red river stations will be above or at 3 m 4 m 5 m are expected to decrease by 2 8 22 2 10 0 34 5 16 2 43 4 respectively given the summer water levels of the mackenzie are projected to decrease in the 2050s and 2080s navigation problems related to low water levels are expected to increase because safe transit through the mackenzie river depends on its water levels because statistical downscaling approaches have limitations in projecting gcms climate scenarios to a future climate as the climate data they are trained on is not necessarily the same as what the future will be an extension of this study is to use rcms to dynamically downscale rcp climate scenarios of gcms of ipcc kuo and gan 2018 have set up and fine tuned a rcm weather research forecasting wrf to downscale rcp climate scenarios of limited number of gcms given dynamic downscaling is computationally intensive and time consuming e g hanrahan et al 2014 a hydrological model will similarly be forced with downscaled rcp climate scenarios of wrf to assess the impact of climate change to the mackenzie river basin acknowledgements this study was funded by the transport canada under its northern transport adaptation initiative program and partly by the natural science and engineering research council of canada the anusplin hydat climate station data and pcic statistically downscaled rcp climate scenarios were downloaded from the websites of environment canada and pcic of university of victoria respectively the hydrologic model hbv was provided by dr seibert of university of zurich switzerland 
6944,potential impact of climate change on the inland waterway transport of the mackenzie river basin mrb have been investigated through simulations of the hydrologiske byrån avdeling för vattenbalans hbv hydrological model the hbv light for the baseline 1974 2004 and future periods of 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 over the mrb driven by precipitation and air temperature data of representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of 10 global climate models statistically downscaled by the pacific climate impacts consortium using the bias correction spatial disaggregation the average onset of spring snowmelt between 2041 and 2100 is projected to occur up to two weeks earlier than the historical 1974 2004 climate projected warmer temperature and higher precipitation will lead to higher runoff for mrb in winter and spring at the expense of decreased summer streamflow and water level at fort simpson and arctic red river stations partly because projected increase in evapotranspiration will offset the projected increase in precipitation under a warmer climate navigation issues related to low water levels are expected to increase e g under rcp8 5 at arctic red river station the number of days the water level above 5 m is projected to decrease from 74 days in 1974 2000 to 42 days in the 2080s the summer durations that water levels of mrb will be at or above 3 4 and 5 m are projected to decrease by 2 8 22 2 10 0 34 5 and 16 2 43 4 respectively which mean navigation problems would increase because safe transit through mrb depends on its water levels keywords mackenzie river basin water level arctic transportation network impacts of climate change statistical downscaling hbv hydrologic model 1 introduction climate change has affected river basins worldwide both socially and environmentally including the mackenzie river basin mrb of canada the water resources of mrb are of key interest to canada and the mackenzie river provides the largest source of freshwater from north america to the arctic ocean in addition the stage of the mackenzie river plays a major role to the transportation of northern communities of northwest territories nwt e g the mackenzie river provides a critical corridor in canada s arctic transportation network during the relatively short open water season of may to october the mackenzie river carries barge traffic for supply and bulk fuel shipments to the north arctic council 2009 the mackenzie river is a major river of the world ranks 10th by length and 13th by drainage area it provides an active transportation corridor for residents because most residents living along the river travel by snowmobile on the ice cover in winter and by personal watercraft in the summer in other words the water levels of the mackenzie river play a major role to the transportation of the northern communities of nwt modern transportation is essential for our society to function but as an economic sector it is the fourth largest contributor to global greenhouse gases ghg emissions ipcc 2014 climate warming has caused extreme climate to occur more frequently worldwide including the mrb trenberth et al 2003 this study focuses on potential effects of climate change on the water level of the mackenzie river a major inland waterway transport of canada s north which is likely more sensitive to climate change impact than other modes of transport of northern canada inland waterway transport generally has a low environmental impact compared to transportation involving heavy vehicles mckinnon 2007 to investigate the hydrologic impact of climate change to mrb sung et al 2006 simulated the future streamflow of mrb by forcing a physics based distributed hydrologic model watflood of kouwen et al 1993 with climate change scenarios of three global climate models gcms they then routed the simulated streamflow using the hydraulic routing model river 1d model of hicks and steffler 1992 under a warmer climate projected by ipcc 2013 an earlier spring freshet and a lower streamflow in the summer but higher in the fall could extend the navigation season of mrb to about 137 days however given the carrying capacity of the inland water transport of mrb also depends on its water level lower summer water levels in the future could offset the benefit of an extended navigation season due to climate change impact zheng and kim 2017 according to the canadian mackenzie gewex study mags stewart et al 1998 a major contributor to the global energy and water cycle exchanges gewex project which focuses on atmospheric and the hydrologic systems of mrb mrb has experienced a pronounced warming trend which could be up to 2 c per decade in some locations during winters cohen 1997 for example the annual temperature in inuvik near the arctic ocean has increased by about 3 c since the 1940s environment and natural resources gnwt 2008 in recent decades a warmer climate had resulted in various climatic and environmental changes such as more intensive storms more severe droughts less soil moisture shorter winter ice seasons significant thinning of sea ice and freshwater ice reduction in snow cover thawing of permafrost glaciers and ice sheets earlier onset and larger volume of spring melt runoff and increased coastal erosion of shorelines huntington and fox 2005 gan et al 2016 gobena and gan 2013 weller et al 2005 barry and gan 2011 kuo et al 2015 each year between may october the mackenzie river provides the bulk transportation to northern communities of nwt however it was shut down about a month earlier in 2015 because of low water levels the northern transportation company battled even lower water levels with lighter loads and more barges in the second straight season of 2016 the reduced discharge and low water levels has limited the cargo carrying capacity of vessels and increased the shipping costs to the north in recent years climate change impacts could lead to greater uncertainties in future streamflow and water levels of the mackenzie kerr 1997 based on composite climate scenarios for the mrb soulis et al 1994 and kerr 1997 found that the precipitation of mrb was projected to increase which should have resulted in a higher runoff but enhanced evapotranspiration has led to lower streamflow and lake levels in the mrb they also projected that the spring ice break up will occur earlier with higher spring snowmelt runoff under climate change impact the main objective of this study is to investigate how the possible hydrologic impact of climate change on mrb will contribute to physical limitations of the critical corridor of canada s arctic transportation network the potential climate change impact on water levels of the mackenzie river a crucial factor for the inland waterway transport was simulated by the conceptual hydrologic model hbv light hydrologiske byrån avdeling för vattenbalans light seibert and vis 2012 driven by statistically downscaled climate scenarios of ten gcms table 1 of the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic compared to sung et al 2006 this study estimated uncertainties associated with long term climate projections of mrb by using more and newer climate scenarios of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc of 2013 statistically downscaled by pcic the results of this study will be useful for planning the inland water transport of mrb and its future municipal infrastructure development to mitigate the potential impact of climate change with the above introduction the study site data and research methodology are given in section 2 discussion of results in section 3 and conclusions in section 4 2 study site data and methodology 2 1 study site mackenzie river basin mrb as the largest river basin of canada mrb can be divided into five main sub basins table 2 three great lakes and three major deltas the main headwaters are the columbia ice field in the jasper national park and snowfields of the upper peace river in northeastern british columbia with a huge land area of about 1 8 million km2 mrb lies between 51on to almost 70on experiences mild summers and cold winters in the south to long cold winters and short cool summers in the north stewart et al 1998 further mrb is currently experiencing a warming trend environment and natural resources gnwt 2008 mrb receives a mean annual precipitation of 410 mm with 6 to 8 months of snowfall its mean temperatures are about 25 c to 30 c in winter and 15 c in summer the annual mean evapotranspiration is about 230 mm which mainly occurs between may and october the annual mean discharge of the mackenzie river into the arctic ocean is about 9100 m3 s or approximately 180 mm per year of runoff there are six major rivers within the mrb fig 1 and table 3 the athabasca river is the upstream river and is located in the most southern area of the mrb the confluence of the athabasca river and the peace river with lake athabasca forms the peace athabasca delta the w a c bennet dam is located at the head of the peace river and has had regulated streamflow since 1967 the demands of electric power production resulted in greater winter flows in the peace river while the spring and summer peaks have been suppressed seneka 2004 the peace river flows into the slave river which enters the great slave lake the fifth largest lake in north america the mackenzie river starts at the extreme west end of the great slave lake and empties into the beaufort sea through the mackenzie delta the majority of the mackenzie river is situated within the great bear lake basin which starts at fort simpson where the liard river reaches the mackenzie river the mackenzie delta commences at a location called the point separation from which the mackenzie river splits into three major channels the east channel the middle channel and the peel channel streamflow entering the mackenzie delta is typically measured where the arctic red river enters the mackenzie river approximately 25 km upstream of point separation in this study the streamflow of the athabasca and peace river basins have been separately simulated by hbv and compared with the long term observed streamflow data of the gauging stations of fort simpson and arctic red river respectively fig 1 2 2 data water levels of the mackenzie river were analyzed over the historical baseline of 1974 2004 and the projected period of 2041 2100 daily 10 km gridded precipitation and temperature data are taken from the anusplin australian national university spline dataset of environment canada hutchinson et al 2009 the mean daily temperature was calculated as the average of the minimum and maximum temperature time series the hbv model was also calibrated using data from 31 climate stations available in the second generation of daily adjusted precipitation mekis and vincent 2011 and the second generation of homogenized temperature dataset for canada vincent et al 2012 hbv was configured by using both the gridded and areally weighted climate station data as input which yielded comparable results however hbv driven by climate station data required an additional parameter to adjust its temperature and precipitation with elevation such a model configuration was not compatible with gridded data from climate change scenarios and therefore only the model configuration and results using anusplin data are discussed here digital elevation map dem data of the mackenzie of 3arc seconds 35 93 m resolution were used to characterize the terrains of the five sub basins of mrb using elevation bands at 200 m intervals the land use information for mrb was obtained from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer terra aqua land cover type yearly l3 global 500 m sin grid product plp daac 2012 modis is a sensor mounted on the terra and aqua satellite the dataset consist of land cover classes developed from one year of remotely sensed data acquired by the terra and aqua modis sensor there are five different classification schemes in this product in this study the land cover type 5 plant functional type pft scheme which contained 12 different land cover types was chosen and reclassified to three land cover types because hbv model parameters could be specified for up to three land cover types historic daily snow water equivalent swe data between 1 november 1988 and 31 march 2016 for mrb was extracted from the globsnow dataset it contains swe estimate for the whole northern hemisphere between latitudes 35 and 85 excluding mountainous regions and greenland with a nominal spatial resolution of 25 km takala et al 2011 provide a full description of the methodology for the globsnow swe estimates within the mrb there were 2294 grids with swe data excluding water and mountainous regions the mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 was used to estimate trends that were significant at the 0 05 level trend magnitude in mm yr was estimated using the theil sen approach theil 1950 sen 1968 this study used daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature data of canada for climate change scenarios of ten gcms of cmip5 ipcc 2013 statistically downscaled by the pcic pacific climate impacts consortium table 1 pcic statistically downscaled the output of twelve global climate models gcms of ipcc 2013 of 1950 to 2100 at a resolution of 300 arc seconds which is approximately 10 km the statistical downscaling was performed using the bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd technique werner 2011 and the bias correction constructed analogues with quantile mapping reordering bccaq technique werner and cannon 2015 comparing the bcsd and bccaq method data with the canesm2 model the bcsd method resulted in an average temperature distribution that was more in line with average historical observations over the same period therefore the bcsd data was selected for all subsequent gcms a systematic description of the bcsd method can be found in werner 2011 who also summarized it in three steps a use quantile mapping to perform bias correction of the gcm fields b apply local scaling of the corrected fields to the target higher resolution of the application and c use the monthly averages of the locally scaled fields to re sample the daily historic record the bcsd method described by wood et al 2004 and maurer and hidalgo 2008 was modified and adjusted the modifications used by the pcic include incorporating monthly minimum and maximum temperatures instead of monthly mean temperatures and bias correction using detrended quantile mapping with the delta method extrapolation according to werner 2011 the bcsd method is advantageous in its ability to capture trends in the regional climate and hydrologic response as well as the transient nature of the emissions scenarios a disadvantage is that if the output data from a gcm is poor the same limitations are carried forward in the downscaling process the pcic downscaled datasets are based on gcms projections for three representative concentrated pathways rcp but only rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios were considered in this study radiative forcing in rcp4 5 peaks at about 4 5 w m2 540 ppm co2 in year 2100 rcp4 5 is comparable to the sres special report emission scenario scenario b1 with similar co2 concentrations and median temperature increases by 2100 rcp8 5 assumes a high rate of radiative forcing increase peaking at 8 5 w m2 940 ppm co2 in year 2100 rcp8 5 assumes higher co2 concentrations than sres a2 scenarios by 2100 ipcc 2007 ipcc 2013 streamflow of mrb was modelled by calibrating hbv against streamflow of five hydrometric stations separately starting first from sub basin 1 then sub basin 2 until sub basin 5 the division of the sub basins were based on the quality of available streamflow data taken from the water survey canada s hydrometric database hydat of environment canada 2013 naturalized streamflow for station 07ha001 on the peace river was obtained from the government of alberta seneka 2004 hydrometric stations downstream of the peace river with records that were likely significantly influenced by regulated flows were excluded the final hydrometric stations used in this study are given in fig 1 and table 2 stage discharge tables for fort simpson and arctic red river stations on the mackenzie river were obtained from the water survey of canada best fit nonlinear regression equations were developed from the stage discharge data and applied to convert simulated discharge values to river stages in meters 3 research methodology to study the possible impact of climate change on the inland waterway transport of the mackenzie river the hydrologiske byrån avdeling för vattenbalans hbv model bergstrom 1975 was selected to simulate the hydrological response of mrb hbv was originally developed at the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi for runoff simulation and hydrological forecasting in the early 1970s as a conceptual semi distributed rainfall runoff model for modeling catchment hydrology hbv has been used to perform various impact studies for climate change assessments kuo et al 2017 bergstrom et al 2001 vehviläinen and huttunen 1997 this study used the latest version of hbv the hbv light model of seibert and vis 2012 which is set up with three conceptual storage tanks as soil moisture zone upper and lower zones respectively it operates with daily precipitation temperature and evaporation as input data 4 the hbv light model the hbv light model consists of routines for modeling snow accumulation and snowmelt soil moisture accounting a runoff response function and a runoff routing procedure fig 2 as a semi distributed hydrologic model hbv considers spatial climate variabilities by modeling each sub basin with different temperature precipitation and evaporation time series given significant climatic and hydrologic variabilities have been observed in canada mwale et al 2009 which could be linked to climate anomalies jiang et al 2014 this is an effort to account for uncertainties associated with catchment hydrologic modeling since each sub basin may have more than one climate stations areally weighted mean daily temperature and precipitation for each sub basin were calculated using the thiessen polygon method potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated from air temperature using hamon s 1961 temperature index equation eq 1 1 pet 29 8 d e s t 273 3 where e s 0 611 e 17 27 t t 237 3 is the saturation vapor pressure kpa pet in mm day d hrs the daylight hours and t oc the mean daily temperature the snow routine accounts for snow accumulation and snowmelt by a simple degree day approach while the soil moisture routine estimates groundwater recharge and actual evaporation as a function of the water storage excessive water from precipitation and snowmelt is transformed to runoff by a response function it consists of two conceptual storages tanks that simultaneously re distribute the generated runoff as quick and slow responses respectively the recharge from the soil routine is divided into two parts the portion of the recharge added to the upper tank is computed using the parameter part the upper tank runoff the basin s quick runoff responses qu t is assumed to be the lesser value of the upper

increment variables pcalt tcalt pelev and telev when applicable are calibrated using a monte carlo calibration tool built inside the hbv light model the other two hbv model parameters cfr refreezing coefficient and cwh water holding capacity are set at 0 05 and 0 1 respectively as recommended instead of being calibrated the basin was also divided into different elevation bands for each elevation band the temperature and precipitation was adjusted with respect to its elevation above sea level by the parameter tcalt 100 m the lapse rate with the elevation telev m of temperature data and pcalt 100 m the change of precipitation with elevation pelev m of precipitation data hbv was calibrated against the observed streamflow data using anusplin data as input over the period 1 1 1974 31 12 1997 by the monte carlo approach and gap genetic algorithm powell s quadratically convergent method seibert 2000 press et al 2002 for each of the five sub basins separately the first year data of 1973 was used as spin up for hbv in order to establish proper initial conditions for the calibration and validation periods and therefore was not included in the results the monte carlo procedure performs a large number of simulations and each individual simulation is allocated random parameter values from pre defined parameter ranges this resulted in five sets of optimized hbv parameters one set for each of the five sub basins of mrb observed streamflow of mackenzie at station 10gc001 of fort simpson was the upstream site chosen in the calibration because hbv is not set up to model the mackenzie delta which is a wetland the downstream station selected for the mackenzie river was station 10lc014 of the arctic red river hbv was automatically calibrated using an objective function based on the nash sutcliffe ns coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 5 that minimizes differences between the simulated streamflow of hbv versus the observed 5 ns 1 t 1 n q obs t q sim t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where q obs is the mean observed streamflow q obs t q sim t the simulated streamflow and n the total number of time steps hbv is well calibrated with physically meaningful parameters if the ns obtained in both the calibration and validation stages are close to 1 the calibrated model was validated against observed streamflow data for the period 1 1 1998 31 12 2004 independent of the calibration experience anusplin likely is the best gridded dataset available for canada was used to calibrate hbv for mrb over the baseline period after the calibrated hbv was validated it was forced with precipitation and air temperature data downscaled by pcic using the bcsd statistical downscaling method werner and cannon 2016 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios of 10 gcms of ipcc 2013 to simulate an ensemble of hydrologic responses of mrb to climate change impact over 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2100 respectively by considering climate scenarios of many gcms of cmip5 we can estimate uncertainties associated with hydrologic responses of mrb to long term climate projections water levels of rivers can be estimated using a hydraulic model based on observed streamflow data and detailed river cross section information because of a lack of measurement on the cross section of the mackenzie river best fit nonlinear regression equations developed from the stage discharge data were applied to convert simulated future discharge to future river stages of the mackenzie in meters 5 discussion of results results were obtained for all five sub basins however in this section results are for the most part presented and discussed for the fort simpson and arctic red river stations located on the mackenzie river only because this is the focus of the study even though these two stations do not represent the mackenzie river as a whole they represent the general upstream and downstream conditions of mrb respectively 5 1 calibration and validation of hbv at the calibration validation stage the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns obtained for the calibration and validation periods for hbv ranged between 0 78 and 0 88 as shown in table 4 for the mackenzie river r2 and ns coefficient obtained for the calibration period are 0 86 and 0 84 at fort simpson and 0 88 for both statistics at arctic red river respectively the validation runs resulted in a r2 of 0 84 and ns of 0 83 at fort simpson and a r2 of 0 87 and ns of 0 86 at arctic red river selected streamflow hydrographs simulated by hbv during the validation stage for fort simpson and arctic red river are shown in fig 3 hbv accurately simulated the spring snowmelt which has a sharp peak compared to the winter flow but it marginally under simulated the falling limb of the hydrograph the simulated base flow in the winter is under simulated compared to the observed flow this could in part due to inaccurate measurements of the ice covered river in winter and in part due to the flow regulation of the w a c bennet dam instead of under simulation of snowmelt which in mrb should be minimal during winter singh et al 2009 thus for both fort simpson and arctic red river stations hbv forced with the anusplin dataset can simulate the streamflow of mrb that agree closely with the hydrometric measurements this means that hbv is well calibrated its optimized model parameters are physically meaningful and therefore there is sufficient basis to use the calibrated hbv to simulate the impact of climate change to mrb assuming mrb will be subjected to minimal landuse change and other possible human impacts in the future after hbv was calibrated and validated with the anusplin data driving hbv with pcic s statistically downscaled data for the base period generally resulted in over simulated streamflow compared to streamflow simulated using the anusplin data and observed streamflow even though the over simulation problem varies from gcm to gcm therefore the precipitation of each gcm for mrb was individually reduced by a constant factor across the entire mrb so that the mean simulated streamflow of hbv driven by the gcms precipitation data for the base period agree well with the observed historic streamflow data the precipitation adjustment factors varied between 10 and 13 for different gcms 5 2 changes of precipitation and air temperature projected changes of pcic s statistically downscaled precipitation and air temperature data under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios of 10 gcms of ipcc 2013 over 2050s and 2080s against pcic s data of the baseline period 1974 2004 are presented as percentage over fort simpson and arctic red river stations respectively fig 4 as expected the temperature is projected to increase between 2 5 c and 5 c in the 2050s and between 3 c and 8 c in the 2080s at both fort simpson and arctic red river respectively the precipitation is projected to increase between 16 and 35 in the 2050s and between 18 and 43 in the 2080s at arctic red river at fort simpson the precipitation is projected to increase between 15 and 32 in the 2050s and between 15 and 40 in the 2080s both temperature and precipitation are projected to change over a relatively wide range under rcp8 5 scenarios in 2080s see fig 4 5 3 water levels at arctic red river station the streamflow regimes and water levels at the arctic red river based on downscaled climate scenarios of ipcc 2013 are presented as boxplots representing weekly streamflow over the historic period 1974 2004 and projected changes in 2050s and 2080s as shown in fig 5 a water levels simulated from driving hbv with anusplin data over the historical period show a generally similar range than the observed streamflow in the summer the peak streamflow in the spring april and may simulated is lower and the winter base flow simulated are marginally lower than the observed which is expected partly because of the flow regulation by the w a c bennet dam on the other hand over 1974 2004 hbv driven by pcic s statistically downscaled data simulated a marginally earlier spring melt between the 14th and the 20th weeks historically the navigation season on the mackenzie river is from june to october on average between june and october the mean water level simulated by hbv using gcms data correspond well to the mean observed water levels over 1974 2004 fig 5b to present the average projected change at the arctic red station the average projected hydrograph of hbv driven by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of each gcm are shown in fig 5c and d expressed in water levels average water levels based on hbv s simulations for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios generally show a lower peak in the summer an earlier spring snowmelt and a higher winter base flow compared to the historical period water levels are consistently projected to be higher than the observed during spring april and may but generally at the expense of lower than observed summer water levels for all climate scenarios considered in both periods this is because of more rainfall and less snowfall an earlier onset of spring snowmelt and more evaporation loss in the summer under a warmer climate in the future see section 3 6 and 3 7 the winter base flow simulated are marginally lower than the observed which is partly because of the flow regulation by the w a c bennet dam compared to the historic period the peak summer water level is projected to be on average about 1 m lower and the water level is projected to remain lower throughout the summer of 2050s fig 5c similar changes are projected for the 2080s fig 5d and the spring snowmelt could occur up to 4 weeks earlier than the observed the peak flow could occur on an average by about a week earlier than the historic period but the summer water levels projected at the arctic red between june and october based on downscaled climate scenarios of access1 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 inmcm4 and mpi esm lr are about 0 5 to 1 5 m lower than observed summer water levels fig 5d for all climate scenarios of ten gcms considered the projected summer water levels vary widely up to a difference of 1 5 m between the lowest mpi esm lr and the highest mri cgcm3 projected summer water levels between these two gcms the difference in the projected water levels based on rcp8 5 is larger than that based on rcp4 5 fig 6 a d coincidentally projected water levels in the 2050s under rcp8 5 are generally comparable to projected water levels in the 2080s under rcp4 5 fig 6b and c most projected summer water levels are lower than the mean observed summer water levels the difference between observed and projected summer water levels is mostly higher under rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 and in the 2080s than in the 2050s there is generally a greater difference between projected water levels for the 2050s and the base period than projected water levels between 2050s and 2080s fig 6e fig 6a d show the range of possible streamflow diverges as we project into the distant future because differences between long term climate projections of gcms grow as we project towards the end of the 21st century e g from about 1 2 m or less in 2050s to over 2 m in 2080s under rcp8 5 in other words as expected uncertainties associated with projected water levels grow from 2050s to 2080s 5 4 water levels at fort simpson river station annual hydrographs simulated by hbv expressed as weekly water levels at fort simpson are shown in fig 7 water levels simulated at fort simpson generally agree with the observed water levels even though it marginally simulated higher water levels between august and october fig 7e hbv also marginally over simulated the spring snowmelt streamflow in april and may but it is closer to the observed at fort simpson than at arctic red river stations the marginal discrepancies could be caused by either the limitations of hbv or the accuracy of the climate data over the same historic period streamflow simulated by hbv driven by the 10 sets of statistically downscaled gcms climate data show higher simulated water levels between march and april but between june and october the mean simulated water levels using the gcms data agree well with mean observed water levels fig 7e hbv simulated a wide range of possible water levels for 1974 2004 compared to the historical observations especially during the peak flow period overall hbv simulated water levels over the base period that are generally comparable to the historical observations except during the spring snowmelt period and towards the end of summer hbv driven by gcms rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios in the 2050s and the 2080s simulated a wide range of water levels at fort simpson fig 7 which exceed the range of water levels simulated by hbv further downstream at the arctic red river station as expected under the impact of climate change hbv simulated an earlier onset of spring melt lower peak water levels and lower summer water levels at both the fort simpson and the arctic red river stations 5 5 annual and seasonal water volume it appears that under rcp climate scenarios of ipcc 2013 studied herein a shift to earlier spring freshets but lower summer flows are projected for the future navigational spring and summer seasons of mrb the average annual streamflow over 1974 2004 at fort simpson and arctic red river was 227 2 km3 and 292 3 km3 respectively table 5 the average annual streamflow is projected to decrease marginally from 1 4 to 6 4 under most climate scenarios but it could decrease by 15 0 at fort simpson in the 2080s under rcp8 5 and marginally increase by 1 0 at arctic red river in the 2080s under rcp4 5 however the average summer streamflow under all rcp climate scenarios considered is projected to decrease over 10 at fort simpson but up to 30 4 under rcp8 5 in the 2080s a similar change is projected for the arctic red river station where its streamflow is projected to decrease by 20 3 under rcp8 5 in the 2080s and about 6 5 to 8 5 under rcp4 5 in both periods and under rcp8 5 in the 2050s in contrast the average winter streamflow under all climate scenarios considered is projected to increase from 14 8 to 37 7 in both periods overall above results suggest that because of climate change impact the annual hydrograph is projected to shift the total annual streamflow is expected to decrease particularly the summer streamflow which is projected to decrease more in 2080s than in 2050s at both fort simpson and arctic red river stations however under a warmer climate the winter streamflow is projected to increase in the 2050s and even more in the 2080s at both stations overall the future streamflow of mrb is projected to increase in the winter at the expense of the summer 5 6 snow water equivalent spring snowmelt is a major source of water for mrb the average annual swe snow water equivalent at fort simpson is projected to decrease by about 15 2 and 21 3 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and to decrease by about 17 and 41 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp8 5 respectively fig 8 the average annual swe at arctic red river is projected to decrease by about 5 5 and 6 2 under rcp4 5 in the 2050s and 2080s and 9 2 and 20 1 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp8 5 respectively which are less compared to fort simpson probably because of its higher latitude location even though the winter precipitation at fort simpson is projected to increase by 27 6 under rcp8 5 and the winter water levels its swe is projected to decrease substantially in the 2080s decreasing swe trends are partly related to the tendency of an earlier onset of spring melt and more precipitation during winter will occur as rainfall instead of snowfall under a warmer climate which would increase the winter streamflow as shown in previous sections decreasing swe trends in north america have been detected from passive microwave data collected between 1979 and 2007 gan et al 2013 as expected projected decrease in swe would affect the hydrology of mrb particularly resulting in less summer streamflow 5 7 evapotranspiration the amount of actual evapotranspiration aet simulated by hbv depends on the soil moisture and the potential evapotranspiration under rcp climate scenarios the warm period is expected to begin in late march and to continue to early november similarly evaportranspiration will begin in late march peaks in july and declines until november at both stations fig 9 the annual total aet is projected to increase under all rcp climate scenarios and in both periods particularly under rcp8 5 and in the 2080s which is partly why the summer streamflow is consistently projected to decrease from 2050s to 2080s although the annual distribution of aet may only change marginally the projected increase in the annual total evapotranspiration of mrb is relatively large 13 7 34 0 compared with the projected increase of 10 3 26 2 in the mean annual precipitation which resulted in less total streamflow especially the summer 5 8 days above or at different water levels from may to october in high latitudes the presence of river ice limits shipping in the mackenzie river to a short summer ice free season which also depends on water levels and weather conditions the depth that a vessel will sink into the water depends on its load for a heavy load the depth will be greater and therefore the goods carrying capacity of a barge is directly affected by the water level of the river typically the shipping season of the mackenzie river is from may to october even though a warmer climate will lead to an earlier ice breakup in spring and later freezing in autumn in this study we chose to investigate possible changes to water levels from may to october because it has been the arctic shipping season the average number of days that water levels exceed certain thresholds between may to october under different climate change scenarios will directly affect the shipping schedule and transportation problems in the arctic changes in the timing of low water levels can also affect the northern navigation and projected reduction in water levels will incur negative impacts to commercial shipping operations in the mackenzie river zheng and kim 2017 at fort simpson and arctic red river stations the number of days that water levels will be above 3 m and 4 m are projected to decrease in the 2050s and more severely in the 2080s while the number of days that water levels above 5 m are projected to decrease marginally more in the 2080s than in the 2050s under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively see table 5 which shows ensemble mean water levels at fort simpson the number of days that water levels will be above 5 m under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 is projected to decrease by 17 8 19 4 in the 2050s and 17 1 43 4 in the 2080s they are projected to decrease by 18 9 21 6 in the 2050s and 16 2 43 2 in the 2080s at the arctic red river station for water levels above 3 m under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 the numbers of days are projected to decrease by 2 8 6 1 and 4 8 7 8 in the 2050s and 4 4 19 9 and 6 6 22 2 in the 2080s for fort simpson and arctic red river stations respectively under rcp8 5 the number of days that water levels will be above 3 m is expected to decrease by 36 days at fort simpson in the 2080s at the downstream arctic red river station the number of days the water level is projected to be lower than 3 5 m are expected to be less than at fort simpson which could affect the shipping operation further north the average duration of the navigation season under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 with a water level of 5 m or higher in the 2080s has been estimated to be 107 73 days and 62 42 days for the fort simpson and arctic red river stations respectively therefore under the potential impact of climate change especially under rcp8 5 navigation problems are expected to get worse in the 21st century because a safe transit through the mackenzie river depends on its water levels 6 summary and conclusions the potential impact of climate change on the water levels of the mackenzie river was investigated by forcing the conceptual hydrological model hbv light at five locations within the mrb with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of ten gcms statistically downscaled by pcic using the bcsd method the analyses included temperature precipitation streamflow water levels discharge volume swe the actual evapotranspiration and the number of days that water levels are above certain thresholds the time periods considered were the historic period 1974 2004 and the projected periods 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2100 under rcp4 5 climate scenarios the air temperature precipitation of mrb is projected to increase by 2 3 2 5 c 6 4 9 5 in the 2050s and 2 7 3 1 c 10 7 12 1 in the 2080s under rcp8 5 climate scenarios the air temperature precipitation of mrb is projected to increase by 2 8 3 1 c 9 8 13 2 and 4 8 5 4 c 16 1 21 0 in the 2050s and 2080s respectively in other words rcp8 5 climate scenarios project a larger change in precipitation than rcp4 5 in 2050s and 2080s based on results obtained from rcp climate scenarios temperature and precipitation are generally projected to increase to a larger extent in northern than in southern sub basins of mrb driven with gridded anusplin data the hbv light model was calibrated and validated independently against observed streamflow of fort simpson and arctic red river stations at the calibration and validation stages r2 nash sutcliffe coefficient ns obtained at fort simpson are 0 89 and 0 85 0 88 and 0 74 respectively the corresponding r2 ns obtained for the arctic red river station are 0 89 and 0 87 0 88 and 0 73 respectively under downscaled rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios of 10 gcms of ipcc 2013 the streamflow and water level of the mackenzie river at fort simpson and arctic red river stations are projected to increase in winter and spring but at the expense of the summer streamflow and water level because the projected increase in evapotranspiration loss offset the projected increase in precipitation in the summer and swe is projected to decrease because more rainfall and less snowfall under warmer climate the spring streamflow and water levels are projected to increase because warming will result in an earlier onset of spring snowmelt in mrb given the projected earlier spring snowmelt but reduced water levels in the summer climate change is expected to affect the arctic ferry operations of the mackenzie river which could start earlier because a warmer climate will cause an earlier onset of spring snowmelt and higher spring discharge under rcp8 5 scenarios the number of days the water level at arctic red river station will be above 5 m is projected to decrease from 74 in 1974 2000 to only 42 days in the 2080s the total duration that water levels of the mackenzie river at fort simpson and arctic red river stations will be above or at 3 m 4 m 5 m are expected to decrease by 2 8 22 2 10 0 34 5 16 2 43 4 respectively given the summer water levels of the mackenzie are projected to decrease in the 2050s and 2080s navigation problems related to low water levels are expected to increase because safe transit through the mackenzie river depends on its water levels because statistical downscaling approaches have limitations in projecting gcms climate scenarios to a future climate as the climate data they are trained on is not necessarily the same as what the future will be an extension of this study is to use rcms to dynamically downscale rcp climate scenarios of gcms of ipcc kuo and gan 2018 have set up and fine tuned a rcm weather research forecasting wrf to downscale rcp climate scenarios of limited number of gcms given dynamic downscaling is computationally intensive and time consuming e g hanrahan et al 2014 a hydrological model will similarly be forced with downscaled rcp climate scenarios of wrf to assess the impact of climate change to the mackenzie river basin acknowledgements this study was funded by the transport canada under its northern transport adaptation initiative program and partly by the natural science and engineering research council of canada the anusplin hydat climate station data and pcic statistically downscaled rcp climate scenarios were downloaded from the websites of environment canada and pcic of university of victoria respectively the hydrologic model hbv was provided by dr seibert of university of zurich switzerland
