15755,microplastics mps have been frequently detected in effluent wastewater and sludge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps the discharge and agricultural application of which represent a primary source of environmental mps contamination as important as quantitative removal is changes of physicochemical characteristics of mps e g shapes sizes density crystallinity in wwtps are crucial to their environmental behaviors and risks and have not been put enough attention yet this review is therefore to provide a current overview on the changes of physicochemical characteristics of mps in wwtps and their corresponding environmental risks the changes of physicochemical characteristics as well as the underlying mechanisms of mps in different successional wastewater and sludge treatment stages that mainly driven by mechanical e g mixing pumping filtering chemical e g flocculation advanced oxidation ultraviolet radiation thermal hydrolysis incineration and lime stabilization biological e g activated sludge process anaerobic digestion composition and their combination effects were first recapitulated then the inevitable correlations between physicochemical characteristics of mps and their environmental behaviors e g migration adsorption and risks e g animals plants microbes are comprehensively discussed with particular emphasis on the leaching of additives and physicochemical

unveiled in the future are prospected the physicochemical properties of mps change after passing through wwtp leading to subsequent changes in co contaminant adsorption migration and toxicity this could threaten our ecosystems and human health and must be worth investigating graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plant microplastics physicochemical characteristics sludge treatment environmental risks data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction microplastics mps are usually defined as small particles 5 mm which are decomposed into little particles fibers and fragments due to weathering grinding and biochemical degradation auta et al 2017 owing to their small size and difficulty in recycling mps are accumulating in the environment at an uncontrollable rate gunaalan et al 2020 without action 12 billion tons of plastic will be detected and flocked by 2050 geyer et al 2017 so far researchers have found that mps are present and accumulating in surface water deep sea sediments organisms and soil blaesing and amelung 2018 drummond et al 2020 su et al 2019 vroom et al 2017 in general mps have been recognized as emerging pollutants in the environment and their sources and fate are attracting extensive attention from their researchers therefore microplastic pollution is far more serious than we think and it is worth worrying about wwtps have been shown to be the main way that mps are released into the water environment most mps are discharged into sewage due to daily activities for instance residues such as toothpaste detergents and body washes end up in wwtps sun et al 2019 existing research proves that about 99 9 of mps can be removed in wwtps bayo et al 2020 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 however the removal rate depending on the treatment units employed and process moreover sewage quality particle size and existing analytical techniques may also make differences due to the large amount of sewage discharge 2 106 particles day of mps were detected to enter the water body even if the content of mps in the effluent is very low sun et al 2019 the tragic result is that more mps are accumulating in the environment despite the high removal rate the result is that 70 98 of the mps are transferred to the sludge liu et al 2021a this suggests that sludge from wwtps may be one out of a multitude reasons why mps accumulate in soil fresh water and marine environments field investigation shows that mps in wwtps are affected by mechanic wear oxidation biodegradation and other factors during various treatment processes these processes may alter plastic characteristic including morphology mechanic strength oxygen contents molecular weight etc in addition oligomers and oxygen containing intermediates can be liberated from the aging process through scission and oxidation of the polymer chains several studies have shown that mps after wastewater treated had different properties compared with virgin mps for example mechanical wear in the removal stage of gravel and grease biodegradation of microorganisms in the active and anaerobic sludge and uv oxidation may lead to changes in microplastic structure e g shapes sizes density crystallinity li et al 2019b mao et al 2020 meanwhile physicochemical properties of mps will also be affected by various parameters wastewater sludge treatment process and microbial species he et al 2021 this suggests that wastewater and sludge treatment technologies may have an important impact on the physicochemical properties of mps most of the existing studies focus on the removal rate of mps and the impact of mps on sewage and sludge however the changes and fate of mps themselves have not been completely discussed hence it is necessary to understand the potential impact of physicochemical properties on mps and specific change mechanisms in the process of sewage and sludge treatment for example intrinsic characteristics of mps like persistence ubiquity size shape leaching of additives and the diversity of adsorptive environmental chemicals of mps may influence migration and distribution the factors discussed above are more likely to have a significant impact on the environment of rivers lakes and soils for instance the increase in average molecular weight surface roughness and the specific surface area of mps is beneficial for the adsorption of pollutants especially the absorption of persistent organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls collivignarelli et al 2021 mps as hydrophobic materials are also easily attached by microorganisms to formed biofilm changing the adsorption performance of pollutants meanwhile the additives and intermediates of the mps are also released showing high rise potential toxicity the reduction of microplastic particle size makes it easier to be swallowed by organisms of different nutritional levels resulting in the difference of microplastic distribution in environment understanding the changes in physicochemical properties of mps in wwtps is helpful to assess the fate of mps as noticed before knowing the changed physicochemical properties of mps is limited on account of the complex process parameters of wwtps vary in shape size and additives on mps themselves therefore the purpose of this review is systematically summarized the changes in the physicochemical properties of mps and try to determine the potential future studies of these changes after they release into the environment changed physicochemical properties of mps were first discussed to identify the effects of wwtps on mps the occurrence movement and change mechanism of mps were investigated in different key therapeutic techniques this view pays attention on the properties of different mps in shapes sizes density and chemistry in addition the risks of changed mps were also compared with naturally aging mps to the environments the extension of this review to the impact of mps after changes will support to better recognize the toxicology of mps on humans and thus the impact on society so the consequence has guiding significance for the scientific comprehension of microplastic fate in wwtps 2 changes in microplastic physicochemical characteristics in wastewater treatment 2 1 aging behavior of mps during primary treatment 2 1 1 grille the function principle of the grille in wastewater treatment is physical interception it is divided into coarse grille 16 25 mm and fine grille 3 10 mm to intercept and treat floating objects and suspended objects in wastewater the physical properties of mps are mainly changed in grille process due to numerous quantities it may result fine grille to clog zhang et al 2020b due to their blockage and huge surface area and hydrophobicity mps have enough time to adsorb agents zhang and chen 2020 as result the mobility of mps will be affected with the changes in density at this stage the properties of aging mps have not much research 2 1 2 coagulation and primary sedimentation mps are mainly removed by primary sedimentation techniques most suspended mps were also removed during this process the non settling mps attach to the flocs causing their density to increase and settle to the bottom along with the flocs the specific analysis is that mps are able to interact with flocculants because of charge neutralization adsorption and scavenging flocculation lapointe et al 2020 xu et al 2021a for example metal flocculants combine with negatively charged mps neutralize the original charge on the surface of mps reduce electrostatic repulsion and thus destabilize mps positively charged coagulant hydrolyzed monomers can adsorb surrounding negatively charged mps to form flocs with the increase of floc particle size and density strong swept flocculation is formed during coagulation resulting in amorphous precipitates discussions also illustrate that the smaller particles generated by the shearing force during the mechanical mixing stage causes the mps to be rubbed li et al 2019a due to friction mps collide with silica sand and break up so the small particles has a high proportion in wwtp song et al 2017 hence processes of mixing pumping or bubbling the wastewater might bring the mechanical abrasion to the mps a small amount of references were observed that the surface properties of mps have undergone mechanical wear in the grit tank and the results show that there are mainly physical changes and little changes in chemical properties table 1 few researches explored the impact on mps in primary treatment 2 2 aging behavior of mps during secondary treatment 2 2 1 biological treatment the biological treatment of sewage is to make use of the oxidative decomposition and transformation function of microorganisms so that the pollutants in sewage are degraded and transformed he et al 2022 x liu et al 2021c luo et al 2021b 2021c it also works with mps microorganisms only work if there is a certain degree of aging on the surface of the mps pajk et al 2012 however large number of references has proved that the surface weathering behavior of mps has existed before entering the biological treatment tank which provides the possibility of biodegradation li et al 2021 observed that chain breaking and oxidation were found by biological treatment in the aeration tank causing carbonyl or hydroxyl groups increased and glass transition temperature tg decrease on mps the surface of mps was severely worn became very rough and even cracked to form fragments meanwhile the ps mps are easier to age than pe mps pa mps because the most abundant microorganisms for pa mps and pe mps are saccharibacteriai while for ps mps flavobacterium however only 4 of pp polymer was degraded by rhodococcus within 40 d auta et al 2018 so the microorganisms cannot effectively degrade mps at the existing hydraulic retention time unless there are other synergistic effects liu et al 2021b some references also reported changes in surface size functional groups roughness and relative density of pollutants by covering mps with biofilms fig 1 liu et al 2019b due to the hydrophobicity of mps microorganisms often attach to the surface of mps first the biofilm itself has some oxygen containing components that increase the heterogeneity of the surface of mps and change its surface hydrophobicity the second is that some microorganisms can degrade some plastics resulting in chain scission and oxidation shabbir et al 2020 observed the surface roughness and the number and area of pores increased due to the formation of biofilms weight and density of mps may also change due to biofilm formation oberbeckmann et al 2015 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 observed that the properties of biofilm coated mps were changed with less hydrophobic and more buoyant meanwhile the large specific surface of mps have provide more reactive group which react with o2 and ros would be produced guan et al 2020 ros production provides the possibility to accelerate the aging of mps this conclusion was also confirmed by tian et al 2022 the highly reactive singlet oxygen radical finally triggered the accelerated degradation of ps even in anaerobic condition ros can be generated at the retained submicromolar concentration the specific changes depend on the type of mps still need further research 2 3 aging behavior of mps during tertiary treatment 2 3 1 uv disinfection photochemistry is considered to be an important factor in the aging of hydrocarbon polymers in ultraviolet disinfection the presence of mps can not only block the penetration of ultraviolet light in water but also react with them shen et al 2021b in general ultraviolet disinfection occurs mainly in the outer layer of mps with depths in the μm range because the high crystallinity of mps leads to light scattering and reflection reducing the light penetration distance ter halle et al 2017 mps have been reported to induce morphological variations and chemical chain scission under long term uv exposure na et al 2021 as reported by cai et al 2018 granular oxidation on the surface of the particles resulted in cracks or flakes which led to more easy fracture resulting in smaller mps or nanoplastics similar phenomenon was observed by many researchers song et al 2017 mps are easily broken into sub micron or nanoscale plastics that cannot be detected by the existing technology which deserves people s attention the crystallinity of ps mps has also been observed to increase meanwhile the prime ps mps are regular and smooth spheres with time rise the roughness increased and more pores were observed on the surface of mps in addition the contact angles of mps were significantly reduced indicating that ultraviolet disinfection can easily change the hydrophobicity of their surfaces and the adhesion and mineralization rate of microorganisms were improved chamas et al 2020 lin et al 2020 in addition the elasticity and rigidity of mps were also observed to decrease and increase by uv irradiation iñiguez et al 2018 furthermore the performance of ultraviolet disinfection process may be affected disease causing microorganisms can be exposed to ultraviolet radiation and inactivated by damaging dna conduction but suspended mps protect them from uv radiation shen et al 2021b therefore further adjustment of disinfection parameters is required 2 3 2 ozone disinfection ozone disinfection a general tertiary wastewater treatment process can react with polymers to form free radical oxides leading to broken of polymer chains rodríguez et al 2008 for example pp mps whose β chain is broken forms alkene end groups and peroxy radicals and rearranges to form ketone groups resulting in molecular weight loss xu et al 2021b ozone disinfection also alters the physical and mechanical properties of mps for example after ozone disinfection the surface tension hydrophilicity and adhesion of pe mps pp mps and pet mps increased ozen et al 2002 he et al 2015 observed that cracks appeared on the pp mps surface and mechanical strength decreased leading to release of smaller mps luo et al 2021 observed that glass transition temperatures of low density ldph mps changed from 134 1 5 9 c to 121 8 1 6 c and ldph mps are more prone to aging under high temperature conditions meanwhile compared with the pristine ldph mps with smooth surface the mps in the presence of ozone are observed to have increased surface roughness and a wider distribution the pristine ldph mps distribution height is only about 73 nm this phenomenon may influence the downstream reaction and fate of these mps 2 3 3 chlorine disinfection wwtps often use chlorine for disinfection mps are not completely resistant to chlorine attack very likely may cause changes in physicochemical properties including surface oxidation and release of contaminants such as additives kelkar et al 2019 basically chemical degradation of hdpe mps and pp mps were virtually non existent in wwtps due to the disinfection conditions was not strong enough but ps mps were an exception it can still degrade at low concentrations chlorine might break existing bonds and introduced new ones ccl the newly formed cl ch2 ch bond may increase toxicity and hydrophobicity of mps leading to greater adsorption and accumulation of harmful pollutants wang et al 2018 moreover the chlorination oxidative degradation of ps mps is proportional to the free chlorine content qin et al 2022 observed the changes in the physicochemical properties of ps mps during the disinfection process in drinking water the particle size did not alter but the surface of ps mps becomes rougher and even pits and cracks are formed under the chlorine treatment condition research suggests that the surface roughness of ps mps is intently related to boundary curvature choi et al 2020 surface roughness and undulations are consistent with a large number of abrupt points on the surface of mps little is known about the effects of chlorine disinfection on mps and more work needs to be done in the future to explain the effects of mps on human 2 3 4 fenton oxidation treatment due to its strong oxidizing properties fenton s reagent can oxidize mps even at a low rate of oxidation liu et al 2019a investigated the ps mps and hdpe mps accelerated by fenton treatments the surfaces of original ps mps and hdpe mps were smooth and cracks and the pits are generated on the surface of mps and aggravate with time 30 d luo et al 2021 observed the changes of ldpe mps after fenton oxidation and found that microplastic surface presented clear fragmentation and cracks which made it rough and presented more layered structures owing to the formation of cracks and voids free radicals ho and oxygen are provided with the opportunity for further contact with the interior of the mps thereby further oxidizing the ldpe mps munoz et al 2021 investigated fenton oxidation of ps mps pet mps pp mps and hdpe mps 80 c ph 3 the oxygen surface groups hydrophilicity and wettability were observed increased meanwhile mps with low density were initially observed to float on the surface and as the oxidation progressed some mps began to sink for practical applications many researchers have modified fenton s system miao et al 2020 used electro fenton like system uses tio2 graphite as cathode molecular weight of pvc mps from 46 260 to 28 470 and the intensities of ch and ccl bonds were weak at the same time it was also observed that the shedding of organic matter indirectly promoted the dechlorinating of pvc mps the appearance of pvc mps changed from initial smooth to rough surface with large pores and depressions on the electro catalytic treatment temperature played a vital role recently hu et al 2022 optimized the fenton system aided by a hydrothermal process carbonyl formation and crystallinity are reduced due to the unwinding stretching and oxidation of microplastic chains as the reaction progresses mps is accompanied by various morphological changes from aggregate into larger pieces into larger cavities even smaller particles fig 2 showed the main aging factors on mps most of the existing experiments use the original or commercial mps but there is a certain gap in the actual mps and more practical simulations are needed 3 changes in microplastic physicochemical characteristics in sludge treatment most mps in wwtps will migrate to sludge and be mixed with sludge into the environment sludge treatment may cause changes in the physicochemical properties of mps fig 3 according to different treatment methods this section mainly summarizes the physicochemical characteristics of mps in the process of sludge treatment and disposal and explains the mechanism in detail 3 1 effects of physical aging on mps 3 1 1 hydrothermal sludge hydrothermal pretreatment is used to improve sludge dehydration performance and anaerobic digestion performance fu et al 2022 liu et al 2020c shi et al 2021b numerous researches have been shown that the physicochemical properties of mps changed after hydrothermal treatment pe mps ps mps and pet mps were observed to degrade to a certain extent with the average cod release is pet mps pe mps ps mps as pet was not resistant to hydrothermal treatment and was more easily degraded the products analyzed by gc ms were mainly terephthalic acid tpa and ethylene glycol the surface of pe mps and ps mps are smoothed first and then produce small pores however the surface morphology of pet mps after hydrothermal treatment is completely different from that of pe mps and ps mps at 180 c pet mps surface becomes coarser over time at 220 c with the increase of reaction time pet mps gradually break into smaller fibrous substances with a flaky morphology when the temperature rises to 260 c the pet mps decompose into fine powders li et al 2021 other studies have also found that the plastic surfaces in the sludge show high levels of wear or erosion and are very brittle zeng et al 2022 on the one hand the microplastic surface may be rough due to the adhesion of sludge particles on the other hand the surface of the three mps may be more fragmented due to the depolymerization promoting effect of the sludge system li et al 2021 also demonstrated that the protein component in the sludge promoted the hydrolysis of mps while the polysaccharide component in the sludge inhibited the hydrolysis of mps the possible reason is that the polysaccharide group recombination easily formed stable aromatization substances which hindered the hydrolysis of mps to sum up hydrothermal treatment of sludge as a potential treatment process has been widely studied thence it is essential to investigate the influence of sludge hydrothermal treatment on the physicochemical changes of mps to explain clearly the potential environmental risks of mps in the sludge treated process and offer a scientific basis for the feasibility of mps control 3 1 2 pyrolysis pyrolysis was observed to be an important process leading to change of physicochemical properties of mps with the increase of temperature and reaction time the degree of pyrolysis of mps gradually intensifies pp mps and pe mps completely degrade when the pyrolysis temperature reaches 450 c ni et al 2020 however the degree of degradation is mainly affected by pyrolysis temperature after pyrolysis at 150 c pe mps were combined with sludge and cracks and irregular deformation lines appeared with increasing pyrolysis temperature to 350 c the damage of particles becomes more serious the particle size decreased and the surface appeared abrasive and foaming phenomenon after pyrolysis at 450 c the particle size decreases obviously and the surface characteristics change greatly becoming rough and uneven ni et al 2020 mps were also found to hydrolyze more easily commercially used plastics often include harmful contents such as estrogen which are often released into the environment as temperatures rise yang et al 2011 different methods may change the way of combination with sludge and the potential risk of sludge pyrolysis to the application of pyrolysis residue is considered to be an important mechanism for the release of mps from sludge to the environment which needs further study 3 1 3 incineration the most widely accepted view is that incineration permanently removes waste but a recent study found that the some plastic fibers are not completely burned and are present in the bottom ash which means that subsequent treatment will result in mps being released into the environment again incineration generally degrades mps directly turning them into carbon dioxide and water geyer et al 2017 however there are some unburned mps in low ash which are discharged into the environment by reuse yang et al 2021 observed the concentration of mps in bottom ash is about 1 9 565 n kg but it is particularly easily overlooked among them pp mps and ps mps are the two types with the largest proportion of the nine types mps in bottom ash are mainly granular because flakes and fragments have a larger contact surface they are easily to be completely burnt and melt into spheroids which hinder heat transfer large number of mps in the bottom ash increased and particles and fragments became irregular in shape had rough edges and irregular holes indicating that indicating that mps were broken into more small particles shen et al 2021a found that the surface of the debris has obvious tearing and bulging than natural decomposition which increased the possibility of nanoplastic generation 3 2 effects of chemical aging on mps 3 2 1 lime stabilization there are few relevant studies on whether the lime stabilization treatment has an impact on the physicochemical properties of mps only mahon et al 2017 investigated the influence of lime stabilization ls on microplastic properties in the sludge dewatering and conditioning process the chemical agent calcine is usually added which will make the sludge microplastic fragmentation smaller particle size and physical characteristics change after stabilized treatment of lime mps were broken and spalling the morphology of unknown mps and hdpe mps was observed to be fragmented and flaky in addition due to shear force the content of fiber with smaller particle size increased after lime stabilization this may be due to alkaline hydrolysis ph temperature and mechanical stirring and further discussion is still require to determine the possible cause and potential effects of pre shear forces meanwhile wear and brittleness of mps were observed after ls which may lead to smaller formation of mps which also requires further study lime stabilization may produce secondary mps and discharged into ambient water under centrifugation existing studies estimating the effects of secondary mps have not been reported much lime may interfere the content of mps in the determination process so the accuracy of the concentration of mps needs to be improved 3 3 effects of biological aging on mps 3 3 1 anaerobic digestion in the green economic environment anaerobic digestion has become the main method of sludge treatment fan et al 2020 x liu et al 2021c luo et al 2022 nie et al 2021 the combined attack of biology and chemistry increases the surface roughness of mps resulting in surface stripping of mps du et al 2020 compared with the original mps the mps in the sludge were rougher and contained more voids and more co and oh functional groups were also detected on the surface li et al 2019a due to polymer chain degradation the molecular weight and mechanic intensity of mps decrease shabbir et al 2020 in general mps is difficult to be biodegraded in sludge treatment systems and only partial forms of mps are degradable by anaerobic digestion mahon et al 2017 meanwhile the leached byproducts of mps can be observed during anaerobic digestion of was wei et al 2019b in addition induction of ros is also a factor contributing to the changes in mps wei et al 2021b submicromolar oxygen reacts with the surface active sites of mps to produce ros by fenton reaction and disproportionation the generated h2o2 can react with the reduced iron to produce ros i e oh zhang et al 2020c confirmed this conclusion when the pet content increased more ros were noticed in the cells and the highest amount even reached 17 3 contrasted with the blank group physical conditions such as agitation and temperature may affect the surface characteristics of mps in sludge lu et al 2022 cole et al 2013 demonstrated that the combination use of ph and temperature and mechanical agitation will promote the fragmentation of mps producing secondary mps and increasing the number of small size microplastic particles 3 3 2 compost mps are mostly bio transformed during composting due to the presence of microorganisms xu et al 2021c microorganisms mainly attach to the microplastic surface causing in increased brittleness and abundance of mps the presence of microorganisms causes changes in the surface tension and structure of mps and secreted enzymes also promote changes zhang et al 2020a observed that the abundance finished products reduced reduced abundance proved that mps were broken down into smaller pieces during composting and existing technology limits the determination of small sized mps blaesing and amelung 2018 chen et al 2020 investigated the changes in ps mps using hyper thermophilic composting technology and long chains of ps mps were observed to break resulting in a decrease in molecular weight the surface chemical composition of ps mps was observed to increase oxygen content with the emergence of c o and c o functional groups ps mps hydrophobicity was also observed to decrease reducing the bioresistance of bacteria meanwhile the surface morphology of mps had also changed cracks were noticed on the ps mps and ldph mps surface at 40 c and large surface damage appeared at 70 c with large pits and voids alassali et al 2018 chen et al 2020 furthermore the compost is composed of an outer oxide layer and an inner anoxic core area which leads to the existence of a large number of reducing contents and microbes in the compost such as iron containing compounds humus and corresponding reducing microbes xie et al 2020 yang et al 2016 therefore compost can provide a large amount of free radicals providing more possibilities for humification and changes in mps abundant free radicals were detected spontaneously by xing et al 2022 abundant free radicals were detected spontaneously by row et al involved ho and its precursors like o2 or h2o2 the existence of free radicals and reactive oxygen species in sludge composting accelerated the oxidative degradation of mps the molecular weights decrease from 18 to 27 and carbonyl index value rise from 0 23 to 0 52 numerous studies have reported the concentration of mps in composting but the specific changes in physicochemical properties including particle size shape and chemical properties as well as the ratio of microbial community changes in the process of composting have not been elaborated in much detail 4 vital role of physicochemical characteristics of mps from wastewater treatment plants in their environmental risks physicochemical properties of microplastic treated with wastewater and sludge have been observed to change such as shape size polymer type density additives and chemical properties this chapter discussed the effects of aging mps on organisms from the perspectives of toxicity accumulation fluidity and persistence and systematically summarizes the relationship between aging mps and environmental risks table 2 the fate of aging mps in the environment may change when they are released affecting ecosystems and human health fig 4 4 1 shape the shape of mps can change dramatically after passing through wwtps mahon et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2020c li et al 2018 detected mps in sludge from 28 wwtps in china and found the proportion of fibers and particles increased from 17 7 and 2 5 to 30 3 and 5 6 in effluent in wastewater treated process fibers are more likely to entangle with flocs than debris and end up entering and staying in the sludge affecting their mobility and bioavailability porter et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 this indicates that the bioavailability of mps around the wwtps will change significantly and the distribution and fate of mps will change again sherlock et al 2022 observed the guts of chicks downstream of the wwtp were full of fiber whereas in contrast the guts of control chicks were observed to have diverse mps including 15 of virgin plastic debris meanwhile the shape of mps also changes their sinking behavior van melkebeke et al 2020 used common mps such as spheres films and fibers to simulate the settling behavior the result is that the theoretical value is much higher than the measured value analysis of the reasons found that theoretical evaluations often use standardized spherical particles while in practical situation mps have complex and diverse shapes which should be considered within the scope of environmental risks furthermore since mps with different shapes have inconsistent sharpness and uniformity they are likely to have distinct impact on cells and biology such as toxicity etc choi et al 2021 observed that hdpe mps did not produce major toxicity to cells due to their smooth surface but they induced immune reaction in pbmcs and promoted pbmc divergence in addition due to their sharp edges high curvature changes and more debris the ldpe mps after grinding resulted in increased cytotoxicity inflammation and hemolysis in fact the shapes of mps treated with sewage and sludge are more diverse with different characteristics that could affect ecosystems and human health since mps are mixed with sludge there are some mps that cannot be detected by the existing technology and further detection technology optimization is required meanwhile fish and algae have been reported but more research is needed to reveal the link between shape change and environmental risks 4 2 size mps change in size after passing through wwtps resulting in smaller mps lehtiniemi et al 2018 particle size of mps is an important factor affecting their properties and migration ability many predators cannot distinguish similar sized prey from particulate matter so mps can be ingested by organisms for example small size can promote the uptake of mps by browne et al 2008 particle size also affects the adsorption behavior of pollutants because smaller particles have larger surface area rochman et al 2015 munoz et al 2021 investigated the adsorption capacity of diclofenac and metronidazole with microplastic size ranging from 20 μm to 1000 μm it was found that the adsorption ability grow with the reducing of microplastic size this is an important feature and the potential role of mps as carriers of pollutants in the aquatic environment must be considered as plastic fragments are expected to degrade further into smaller dimensions even into the nanoplastic zhang et al 2017 observed the toxicity of mps with different particle sizes to microalgae skeletonema costatum and found that the inhibition rate of on microalgae growth of mps with a common particle diameter of 1 um was 39 7 while mps with a common particle diameter of 1 mm had no effect on microalgae because mps with smaller particle size can be more easily adsorbed on cell surface and embedded into microalgae cells to inhibit the growth of microalgae this phenomenon not only change the migration capacity of mps but also may lead toxicity to organisms huang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 concentrations of mps of 50 100 um or even smaller particle size may be underestimated due to technical limitations sun et al 2021 in addition the sedimentation velocity of mps has also been confirmed to be related to particle size kowalski et al 2016 the distribution characteristics and migration capacity of mps will theoretically change which requires further observation and testing 4 3 density the density of mps can determine which organisms ingest them but transform in the physicochemical characteristics of mps caused by wastewater and sludge treatment will alter the type of microbial ingestion mps with a density less than freshwater may be ingested by organisms living in the upper water and conversely they may be ingested by benthic organisms recently researchers have now observed something different as the mps passes through wwtps microbes attach to it and grow forming a biofilm the transport behaviors of mps such as sedimentation and suspension will change the density of mps due to the loading of biological biofilm jahnke et al 2017 semcesen and wells 2021 observed that the formation of biofilms resulted in increased density of pe mps causing the pe mps suspended in freshwater lakes to sink thu ha et al 2020 observed that the suspended state of pe mps changes after the formation of the biofilm and gradually sinks at the same time the release of additives and the appearance of streaks stripes cracks and voids emerge on the surface of mps after aging leading to adsorption of pollutants both cause transform in the density of mps drummond et al 2020 but it is not clear how aging changes the fate and migration of mps in the environment moreover aging mps have ability to heteroaggregation polymerize with phytoplankton lagarde et al 2016 found that after only 20 days of exposure pp mps combined with microalgae and exopolysaccharides to form heteroaggregates which changed the density of pp mps and changed its migration path sink meanwhile mps can also accumulate in sludge other organic or soluble contents can also cause density rise up and affect migration in the long term behavior and migration of mps in the environment will change along different paths due to biological contamination aging and heterogeneous polymerization further experiments are needed to integrate the effects of wastewater and sludge treatment on mps to realistic simulates the performance of highly diverse mps and large plastic particles in the water environment 4 4 leachate many discussions have shown that the surface structure and chemical composition of mps can be changed after treated with wastewater and sludge aging leading additives and small molecule organics were released into the environment from mps chen et al 2020 dong et al 2020 liu et al 2020b wei et al 2021a studies have found that some additive can directly destroy microbial cells and inhibit the activity of key enzymes related to biochemical reactions and defense oxidative stress affecting microbial activities in the digestive apparatus for example bpa is the main chemical leached from pvc mps and the cumulative amount follows a saturation curve it interferes with the normal function of the endocrine system affects human health and the anaerobic digestion of sludge by leaching bpa from mps halden 2010 wei et al 2019a paluselli et al 2019 found that phthalates were released into the environment in the aging process of mps which are toxic and carcinogenic to human health gardon et al 2020 observed the effect of additives mainly phthalates released by aging mps spat collector and synthetic rope on pearl oyster in 100 g l leaching solution 60 inhibition rate and 82 mortality rate were observed at the stage of embryonic development into larva this further confirmed that the change of physicochemical property of mps may lead to the release of leachate moreover the leaching of additives is easily affected by the environment for example luo et al 2021 observed that the aging process accelerated the liberate of lead chromate but the leaching performance under acidic conditions was higher than that under moderate conditions and high concentration of nacl was conducive to the leaching process luo et al 2020a in addition mps derived dissolved organic matter mps dom released by mps also enhances the risk to exposed biota for example shi et al 2021a found that mps dom is mainly composed of 4 4 dihydroxybenzophenone dhb p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba and methylphenylalanine mep which also helps on estrogenic activity therefore it is important to learn the relationship between the properties of aging plastics and leachate as well as the association with environmental risks 4 5 chemical properties various oxygen containing groups are formed on the surface of mps after treated with wastewater and sludge aging sun et al 2020 this may increase the adsorption properties of mps and become carriers of toxic substances dramatically changing their environmental behavior toxicity and bioavailability ziajahromi et al 2016 li et al 2019a observed that aging can affect their adsorption capacity such as the ability of mps to bind contaminants such as atorvastatin and amlodipine su et al 2021 also found that the aging process can enhance the potential of mps as antibiotic resistance gene carriers liu et al 2022 observed that naturally aged mps had higher adsorption capacity for pb ii similar phenomenon was observed by many researchers when aging mps are in contact with organic pollutants they will adsorb and collect pollutants and then transfer them to living organisms resulting in the accumulation of pollutants in living organisms abduro ogo et al 2022 for example huang et al 2021 studied the effects of mps combined with β blocker propranolol prp on red tilapia and found that aging mps increased prp accumulation in the brain of red tilapia by 82 3 indicating that aging mps may lead to drug accumulation in organisms oxygen containing functional groups can also promote the negative charge of mps further promoting the dispersion and toxicity of mps fu et al 2019 aged ps was observed to enhance the inhibition of microalgae chlorella vulgaris 22 35 rather than the original inhibition rate 10 28 due to the increased ssa and surface charge leading to the absorption of more ps by microalgae chlorella vulgaris however it s also possible that aging mps could be beneficial to microbes zou et al 2020 examined the toxic effects of aging mps pa mps on young zebrafish primitive pa mps was observed to significantly inhibit skeletal muscle development in zebrafish while aging pa mps and leaching did not the increased migration capacity of mps promoted the removal of pollutants but increased the contamination distance of mps these results once again pointed out the impact of aging mps on environmental risks 5 concluding remarks and future perspectives mps are weathered by factors such as mechanical wear chemical oxidation and biodegradation during various treatment processes in wwtps these processes may most likely alter microplastic characteristics including morphology mechanical strength oxygen content molecular weight etc in this review the physicochemical properties and fate of mps in wwtps are discussed the main conclusions are 1 the specific changes of mps in physicochemical properties depend on various wastewater treated processes in the process of wastewater treatment physical wear of mps was main happened in primary treatment process but there are few reports about it biological treatment processes have a small impact on mps depending on the type of microorganism and the key treatment technology a small number of references observed that mps were degraded by some functional bacteria but the degradation of mps was very slow the tertiary treatment process mainly uses strong oxidants for disinfection and the effect on physicochemical properties of mps is most significant so relatively rough and oxygen containing functional groups were appeared on surface of mps resulting in changes in morphology and chemical characteristics 2 according to the treatment conditions sludge treatment can be divided into physical chemical and biological processes results suggest that treatment processes may have an effect a large number of mps is recycled in the last waste sludge different from primary mps sludge based mps have obvious aging characteristics the surface of sludge mps is rougher with increased specific surface area and contains oxygen containing functional groups like co and oh larger average particle size of mps was observed in sludge than that of mps in wastewater 3 aging mps may change the adsorption potential of mps to organic pollutants heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms and then altering their migratory capacity and toxicity at the same time wastewater and sludge treatment processes not only affect the surface characteristics of plastic fragments but also the leaching of chemical additives such as pigments stabilizers flame retardants antioxidants and plasticizers etc thus the fate of aging mps may change when they are released into the environment leading to altered potential risks to human health and the environment regarding the research on mps in wwtps there are still many problems that need to be further studied to better reduce mps the problems that require be paying attention to and solving in the future are as follows 1 although the research relating to changes of physicochemical characteristics of mps have been sporadically conducted but most of them focused on the effects from individual treatment process full life cycle assessments on the aging of physicochemical characteristics of mps in wwtps are lost in addition the specific parameters of each treatment process would also affect the physicochemical properties of mps the influence of hydraulic retention time salinity organics concentration and other process parameters in dynamic situations on the physicochemical properties of mps should be further evaluated 2 most studies have discussed the effects on ecosystems and human health of mps using artificial model mps as research ontology but the distinction between the influences of mps underwent wastewater and sludge treatment and the effect of artificial model mps on the environment is not well understood particularly whether there is a significant differentiation in the relationship between mps and environmental risk after treatment with wastewater and sludge deserves to be further investigated to reflect better the environmental actual situation 3 due to the differences in sampling methodology among researchers the data obtained at different sampling times and different sampling points may vary greatly meanwhile the extraction and detection techniques of mps can obviously influence the results of quantitative recognition therefore it is impossible to directly compare the research results among scholars and establish unified microplastic sample collection classification standards and detection methods standardize the expression method of microplastic abundance 4 in recent years vast quantities of discussions have been conducted to reduce the amount of mps in the treatment of sewage and sludge also some mps removal strategies such as air floatation filtration and adsorption have been developed apart from the quantitative removal future efforts targeting to reduce the environmental risks related physicochemical characteristics

15755,microplastics mps have been frequently detected in effluent wastewater and sludge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps the discharge and agricultural application of which represent a primary source of environmental mps contamination as important as quantitative removal is changes of physicochemical characteristics of mps e g shapes sizes density crystallinity in wwtps are crucial to their environmental behaviors and risks and have not been put enough attention yet this review is therefore to provide a current overview on the changes of physicochemical characteristics of mps in wwtps and their corresponding environmental risks the changes of physicochemical characteristics as well as the underlying mechanisms of mps in different successional wastewater and sludge treatment stages that mainly driven by mechanical e g mixing pumping filtering chemical e g flocculation advanced oxidation ultraviolet radiation thermal hydrolysis incineration and lime stabilization biological e g activated sludge process anaerobic digestion composition and their combination effects were first recapitulated then the inevitable correlations between physicochemical characteristics of mps and their environmental behaviors e g migration adsorption and risks e g animals plants microbes are comprehensively discussed with particular emphasis on the leaching of additives and physicochemical characteristics that affect the co exist pollutants behavior of mps in wwtps on environmental risks finally knowing the summarized above some relating unanswered questions and concerns that need to be unveiled in the future are prospected the physicochemical properties of mps change after passing through wwtp leading to subsequent changes in co contaminant adsorption migration and toxicity this could threaten our ecosystems and human health and must be worth investigating graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plant microplastics physicochemical characteristics sludge treatment environmental risks data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction microplastics mps are usually defined as small particles 5 mm which are decomposed into little particles fibers and fragments due to weathering grinding and biochemical degradation auta et al 2017 owing to their small size and difficulty in recycling mps are accumulating in the environment at an uncontrollable rate gunaalan et al 2020 without action 12 billion tons of plastic will be detected and flocked by 2050 geyer et al 2017 so far researchers have found that mps are present and accumulating in surface water deep sea sediments organisms and soil blaesing and amelung 2018 drummond et al 2020 su et al 2019 vroom et al 2017 in general mps have been recognized as emerging pollutants in the environment and their sources and fate are attracting extensive attention from their researchers therefore microplastic pollution is far more serious than we think and it is worth worrying about wwtps have been shown to be the main way that mps are released into the water environment most mps are discharged into sewage due to daily activities for instance residues such as toothpaste detergents and body washes end up in wwtps sun et al 2019 existing research proves that about 99 9 of mps can be removed in wwtps bayo et al 2020 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 however the removal rate depending on the treatment units employed and process moreover sewage quality particle size and existing analytical techniques may also make differences due to the large amount of sewage discharge 2 106 particles day of mps were detected to enter the water body even if the content of mps in the effluent is very low sun et al 2019 the tragic result is that more mps are accumulating in the environment despite the high removal rate the result is that 70 98 of the mps are transferred to the sludge liu et al 2021a this suggests that sludge from wwtps may be one out of a multitude reasons why mps accumulate in soil fresh water and marine environments field investigation shows that mps in wwtps are affected by mechanic wear oxidation biodegradation and other factors during various treatment processes these processes may alter plastic characteristic including morphology mechanic strength oxygen contents molecular weight etc in addition oligomers and oxygen containing intermediates can be liberated from the aging process through scission and oxidation of the polymer chains several studies have shown that mps after wastewater treated had different properties compared with virgin mps for example mechanical wear in the removal stage of gravel and grease biodegradation of microorganisms in the active and anaerobic sludge and uv oxidation may lead to changes in microplastic structure e g shapes sizes density crystallinity li et al 2019b mao et al 2020 meanwhile physicochemical properties of mps will also be affected by various parameters wastewater sludge treatment process and microbial species he et al 2021 this suggests that wastewater and sludge treatment technologies may have an important impact on the physicochemical properties of mps most of the existing studies focus on the removal rate of mps and the impact of mps on sewage and sludge however the changes and fate of mps themselves have not been completely discussed hence it is necessary to understand the potential impact of physicochemical properties on mps and specific change mechanisms in the process of sewage and sludge treatment for example intrinsic characteristics of mps like persistence ubiquity size shape leaching of additives and the diversity of adsorptive environmental chemicals of mps may influence migration and distribution the factors discussed above are more likely to have a significant impact on the environment of rivers lakes and soils for instance the increase in average molecular weight surface roughness and the specific surface area of mps is beneficial for the adsorption of pollutants especially the absorption of persistent organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls collivignarelli et al 2021 mps as hydrophobic materials are also easily attached by microorganisms to formed biofilm changing the adsorption performance of pollutants meanwhile the additives and intermediates of the mps are also released showing high rise potential toxicity the reduction of microplastic particle size makes it easier to be swallowed by organisms of different nutritional levels resulting in the difference of microplastic distribution in environment understanding the changes in physicochemical properties of mps in wwtps is helpful to assess the fate of mps as noticed before knowing the changed physicochemical properties of mps is limited on account of the complex process parameters of wwtps vary in shape size and additives on mps themselves therefore the purpose of this review is systematically summarized the changes in the physicochemical properties of mps and try to determine the potential future studies of these changes after they release into the environment changed physicochemical properties of mps were first discussed to identify the effects of wwtps on mps the occurrence movement and change mechanism of mps were investigated in different key therapeutic techniques this view pays attention on the properties of different mps in shapes sizes density and chemistry in addition the risks of changed mps were also compared with naturally aging mps to the environments the extension of this review to the impact of mps after changes will support to better recognize the toxicology of mps on humans and thus the impact on society so the consequence has guiding significance for the scientific comprehension of microplastic fate in wwtps 2 changes in microplastic physicochemical characteristics in wastewater treatment 2 1 aging behavior of mps during primary treatment 2 1 1 grille the function principle of the grille in wastewater treatment is physical interception it is divided into coarse grille 16 25 mm and fine grille 3 10 mm to intercept and treat floating objects and suspended objects in wastewater the physical properties of mps are mainly changed in grille process due to numerous quantities it may result fine grille to clog zhang et al 2020b due to their blockage and huge surface area and hydrophobicity mps have enough time to adsorb agents zhang and chen 2020 as result the mobility of mps will be affected with the changes in density at this stage the properties of aging mps have not much research 2 1 2 coagulation and primary sedimentation mps are mainly removed by primary sedimentation techniques most suspended mps were also removed during this process the non settling mps attach to the flocs causing their density to increase and settle to the bottom along with the flocs the specific analysis is that mps are able to interact with flocculants because of charge neutralization adsorption and scavenging flocculation lapointe et al 2020 xu et al 2021a for example metal flocculants combine with negatively charged mps neutralize the original charge on the surface of mps reduce electrostatic repulsion and thus destabilize mps positively charged coagulant hydrolyzed monomers can adsorb surrounding negatively charged mps to form flocs with the increase of floc particle size and density strong swept flocculation is formed during coagulation resulting in amorphous precipitates discussions also illustrate that the smaller particles generated by the shearing force during the mechanical mixing stage causes the mps to be rubbed li et al 2019a due to friction mps collide with silica sand and break up so the small particles has a high proportion in wwtp song et al 2017 hence processes of mixing pumping or bubbling the wastewater might bring the mechanical abrasion to the mps a small amount of references were observed that the surface properties of mps have undergone mechanical wear in the grit tank and the results show that there are mainly physical changes and little changes in chemical properties table 1 few researches explored the impact on mps in primary treatment 2 2 aging behavior of mps during secondary treatment 2 2 1 biological treatment the biological treatment of sewage is to make use of the oxidative decomposition and transformation function of microorganisms so that the pollutants in sewage are degraded and transformed he et al 2022 x liu et al 2021c luo et al 2021b 2021c it also works with mps microorganisms only work if there is a certain degree of aging on the surface of the mps pajk et al 2012 however large number of references has proved that the surface weathering behavior of mps has existed before entering the biological treatment tank which provides the possibility of biodegradation li et al 2021 observed that chain breaking and oxidation were found by biological treatment in the aeration tank causing carbonyl or hydroxyl groups increased and glass transition temperature tg decrease on mps the surface of mps was severely worn became very rough and even cracked to form fragments meanwhile the ps mps are easier to age than pe mps pa mps because the most abundant microorganisms for pa mps and pe mps are saccharibacteriai while for ps mps flavobacterium however only 4 of pp polymer was degraded by rhodococcus within 40 d auta et al 2018 so the microorganisms cannot effectively degrade mps at the existing hydraulic retention time unless there are other synergistic effects liu et al 2021b some references also reported changes in surface size functional groups roughness and relative density of pollutants by covering mps with biofilms fig 1 liu et al 2019b due to the hydrophobicity of mps microorganisms often attach to the surface of mps first the biofilm itself has some oxygen containing components that increase the heterogeneity of the surface of mps and change its surface hydrophobicity the second is that some microorganisms can degrade some plastics resulting in chain scission and oxidation shabbir et al 2020 observed the surface roughness and the number and area of pores increased due to the formation of biofilms weight and density of mps may also change due to biofilm formation oberbeckmann et al 2015 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 observed that the properties of biofilm coated mps were changed with less hydrophobic and more buoyant meanwhile the large specific surface of mps have provide more reactive group which react with o2 and ros would be produced guan et al 2020 ros production provides the possibility to accelerate the aging of mps this conclusion was also confirmed by tian et al 2022 the highly reactive singlet oxygen radical finally triggered the accelerated degradation of ps even in anaerobic condition ros can be generated at the retained submicromolar concentration the specific changes depend on the type of mps still need further research 2 3 aging behavior of mps during tertiary treatment 2 3 1 uv disinfection photochemistry is considered to be an important factor in the aging of hydrocarbon polymers in ultraviolet disinfection the presence of mps can not only block the penetration of ultraviolet light in water but also react with them shen et al 2021b in general ultraviolet disinfection occurs mainly in the outer layer of mps with depths in the μm range because the high crystallinity of mps leads to light scattering and reflection reducing the light penetration distance ter halle et al 2017 mps have been reported to induce morphological variations and chemical chain scission under long term uv exposure na et al 2021 as reported by cai et al 2018 granular oxidation on the surface of the particles resulted in cracks or flakes which led to more easy fracture resulting in smaller mps or nanoplastics similar phenomenon was observed by many researchers song et al 2017 mps are easily broken into sub micron or nanoscale plastics that cannot be detected by the existing technology which deserves people s attention the crystallinity of ps mps has also been observed to increase meanwhile the prime ps mps are regular and smooth spheres with time rise the roughness increased and more pores were observed on the surface of mps in addition the contact angles of mps were significantly reduced indicating that ultraviolet disinfection can easily change the hydrophobicity of their surfaces and the adhesion and mineralization rate of microorganisms were improved chamas et al 2020 lin et al 2020 in addition the elasticity and rigidity of mps were also observed to decrease and increase by uv irradiation iñiguez et al 2018 furthermore the performance of ultraviolet disinfection process may be affected disease causing microorganisms can be exposed to ultraviolet radiation and inactivated by damaging dna conduction but suspended mps protect them from uv radiation shen et al 2021b therefore further adjustment of disinfection parameters is required 2 3 2 ozone disinfection ozone disinfection a general tertiary wastewater treatment process can react with polymers to form free radical oxides leading to broken of polymer chains rodríguez et al 2008 for example pp mps whose β chain is broken forms alkene end groups and peroxy radicals and rearranges to form ketone groups resulting in molecular weight loss xu et al 2021b ozone disinfection also alters the physical and mechanical properties of mps for example after ozone disinfection the surface tension hydrophilicity and adhesion of pe mps pp mps and pet mps increased ozen et al 2002 he et al 2015 observed that cracks appeared on the pp mps surface and mechanical strength decreased leading to release of smaller mps luo et al 2021 observed that glass transition temperatures of low density ldph mps changed from 134 1 5 9 c to 121 8 1 6 c and ldph mps are more prone to aging under high temperature conditions meanwhile compared with the pristine ldph mps with smooth surface the mps in the presence of ozone are observed to have increased surface roughness and a wider distribution the pristine ldph mps distribution height is only about 73 nm this phenomenon may influence the downstream reaction and fate of these mps 2 3 3 chlorine disinfection wwtps often use chlorine for disinfection mps are not completely resistant to chlorine attack very likely may cause changes in physicochemical properties including surface oxidation and release of contaminants such as additives kelkar et al 2019 basically chemical degradation of hdpe mps and pp mps were virtually non existent in wwtps due to the disinfection conditions was not strong enough but ps mps were an exception it can still degrade at low concentrations chlorine might break existing bonds and introduced new ones ccl the newly formed cl ch2 ch bond may increase toxicity and hydrophobicity of mps leading to greater adsorption and accumulation of harmful pollutants wang et al 2018 moreover the chlorination oxidative degradation of ps mps is proportional to the free chlorine content qin et al 2022 observed the changes in the physicochemical properties of ps mps during the disinfection process in drinking water the particle size did not alter but the surface of ps mps becomes rougher and even pits and cracks are formed under the chlorine treatment condition research suggests that the surface roughness of ps mps is intently related to boundary curvature choi et al 2020 surface roughness and undulations are consistent with a large number of abrupt points on the surface of mps little is known about the effects of chlorine disinfection on mps and more work needs to be done in the future to explain the effects of mps on human 2 3 4 fenton oxidation treatment due to its strong oxidizing properties fenton s reagent can oxidize mps even at a low rate of oxidation liu et al 2019a investigated the ps mps and hdpe mps accelerated by fenton treatments the surfaces of original ps mps and hdpe mps were smooth and cracks and the pits are generated on the surface of mps and aggravate with time 30 d luo et al 2021 observed the changes of ldpe mps after fenton oxidation and found that microplastic surface presented clear fragmentation and cracks which made it rough and presented more layered structures owing to the formation of cracks and voids free radicals ho and oxygen are provided with the opportunity for further contact with the interior of the mps thereby further oxidizing the ldpe mps munoz et al 2021 investigated fenton oxidation of ps mps pet mps pp mps and hdpe mps 80 c ph 3 the oxygen surface groups hydrophilicity and wettability were observed increased meanwhile mps with low density were initially observed to float on the surface and as the oxidation progressed some mps began to sink for practical applications many researchers have modified fenton s system miao et al 2020 used electro fenton like system uses tio2 graphite as cathode molecular weight of pvc mps from 46 260 to 28 470 and the intensities of ch and ccl bonds were weak at the same time it was also observed that the shedding of organic matter indirectly promoted the dechlorinating of pvc mps the appearance of pvc mps changed from initial smooth to rough surface with large pores and depressions on the electro catalytic treatment temperature played a vital role recently hu et al 2022 optimized the fenton system aided by a hydrothermal process carbonyl formation and crystallinity are reduced due to the unwinding stretching and oxidation of microplastic chains as the reaction progresses mps is accompanied by various morphological changes from aggregate into larger pieces into larger cavities even smaller particles fig 2 showed the main aging factors on mps most of the existing experiments use the original or commercial mps but there is a certain gap in the actual mps and more practical simulations are needed 3 changes in microplastic physicochemical characteristics in sludge treatment most mps in wwtps will migrate to sludge and be mixed with sludge into the environment sludge treatment may cause changes in the physicochemical properties of mps fig 3 according to different treatment methods this section mainly summarizes the physicochemical characteristics of mps in the process of sludge treatment and disposal and explains the mechanism in detail 3 1 effects of physical aging on mps 3 1 1 hydrothermal sludge hydrothermal pretreatment is used to improve sludge dehydration performance and anaerobic digestion performance fu et al 2022 liu et al 2020c shi et al 2021b numerous researches have been shown that the physicochemical properties of mps changed after hydrothermal treatment pe mps ps mps and pet mps were observed to degrade to a certain extent with the average cod release is pet mps pe mps ps mps as pet was not resistant to hydrothermal treatment and was more easily degraded the products analyzed by gc ms were mainly terephthalic acid tpa and ethylene glycol the surface of pe mps and ps mps are smoothed first and then produce small pores however the surface morphology of pet mps after hydrothermal treatment is completely different from that of pe mps and ps mps at 180 c pet mps surface becomes coarser over time at 220 c with the increase of reaction time pet mps gradually break into smaller fibrous substances with a flaky morphology when the temperature rises to 260 c the pet mps decompose into fine powders li et al 2021 other studies have also found that the plastic surfaces in the sludge show high levels of wear or erosion and are very brittle zeng et al 2022 on the one hand the microplastic surface may be rough due to the adhesion of sludge particles on the other hand the surface of the three mps may be more fragmented due to the depolymerization promoting effect of the sludge system li et al 2021 also demonstrated that the protein component in the sludge promoted the hydrolysis of mps while the polysaccharide component in the sludge inhibited the hydrolysis of mps the possible reason is that the polysaccharide group recombination easily formed stable aromatization substances which hindered the hydrolysis of mps to sum up hydrothermal treatment of sludge as a potential treatment process has been widely studied thence it is essential to investigate the influence of sludge hydrothermal treatment on the physicochemical changes of mps to explain clearly the potential environmental risks of mps in the sludge treated process and offer a scientific basis for the feasibility of mps control 3 1 2 pyrolysis pyrolysis was observed to be an important process leading to change of physicochemical properties of mps with the increase of temperature and reaction time the degree of pyrolysis of mps gradually intensifies pp mps and pe mps completely degrade when the pyrolysis temperature reaches 450 c ni et al 2020 however the degree of degradation is mainly affected by pyrolysis temperature after pyrolysis at 150 c pe mps were combined with sludge and cracks and irregular deformation lines appeared with increasing pyrolysis temperature to 350 c the damage of particles becomes more serious the particle size decreased and the surface appeared abrasive and foaming phenomenon after pyrolysis at 450 c the particle size decreases obviously and the surface characteristics change greatly becoming rough and uneven ni et al 2020 mps were also found to hydrolyze more easily commercially used plastics often include harmful contents such as estrogen which are often released into the environment as temperatures rise yang et al 2011 different methods may change the way of combination with sludge and the potential risk of sludge pyrolysis to the application of pyrolysis residue is considered to be an important mechanism for the release of mps from sludge to the environment which needs further study 3 1 3 incineration the most widely accepted view is that incineration permanently removes waste but a recent study found that the some plastic fibers are not completely burned and are present in the bottom ash which means that subsequent treatment will result in mps being released into the environment again incineration generally degrades mps directly turning them into carbon dioxide and water geyer et al 2017 however there are some unburned mps in low ash which are discharged into the environment by reuse yang et al 2021 observed the concentration of mps in bottom ash is about 1 9 565 n kg but it is particularly easily overlooked among them pp mps and ps mps are the two types with the largest proportion of the nine types mps in bottom ash are mainly granular because flakes and fragments have a larger contact surface they are easily to be completely burnt and melt into spheroids which hinder heat transfer large number of mps in the bottom ash increased and particles and fragments became irregular in shape had rough edges and irregular holes indicating that indicating that mps were broken into more small particles shen et al 2021a found that the surface of the debris has obvious tearing and bulging than natural decomposition which increased the possibility of nanoplastic generation 3 2 effects of chemical aging on mps 3 2 1 lime stabilization there are few relevant studies on whether the lime stabilization treatment has an impact on the physicochemical properties of mps only mahon et al 2017 investigated the influence of lime stabilization ls on microplastic properties in the sludge dewatering and conditioning process the chemical agent calcine is usually added which will make the sludge microplastic fragmentation smaller particle size and physical characteristics change after stabilized treatment of lime mps were broken and spalling the morphology of unknown mps and hdpe mps was observed to be fragmented and flaky in addition due to shear force the content of fiber with smaller particle size increased after lime stabilization this may be due to alkaline hydrolysis ph temperature and mechanical stirring and further discussion is still require to determine the possible cause and potential effects of pre shear forces meanwhile wear and brittleness of mps were observed after ls which may lead to smaller formation of mps which also requires further study lime stabilization may produce secondary mps and discharged into ambient water under centrifugation existing studies estimating the effects of secondary mps have not been reported much lime may interfere the content of mps in the determination process so the accuracy of the concentration of mps needs to be improved 3 3 effects of biological aging on mps 3 3 1 anaerobic digestion in the green economic environment anaerobic digestion has become the main method of sludge treatment fan et al 2020 x liu et al 2021c luo et al 2022 nie et al 2021 the combined attack of biology and chemistry increases the surface roughness of mps resulting in surface stripping of mps du et al 2020 compared with the original mps the mps in the sludge were rougher and contained more voids and more co and oh functional groups were also detected on the surface li et al 2019a due to polymer chain degradation the molecular weight and mechanic intensity of mps decrease shabbir et al 2020 in general mps is difficult to be biodegraded in sludge treatment systems and only partial forms of mps are degradable by anaerobic digestion mahon et al 2017 meanwhile the leached byproducts of mps can be observed during anaerobic digestion of was wei et al 2019b in addition induction of ros is also a factor contributing to the changes in mps wei et al 2021b submicromolar oxygen reacts with the surface active sites of mps to produce ros by fenton reaction and disproportionation the generated h2o2 can react with the reduced iron to produce ros i e oh zhang et al 2020c confirmed this conclusion when the pet content increased more ros were noticed in the cells and the highest amount even reached 17 3 contrasted with the blank group physical conditions such as agitation and temperature may affect the surface characteristics of mps in sludge lu et al 2022 cole et al 2013 demonstrated that the combination use of ph and temperature and mechanical agitation will promote the fragmentation of mps producing secondary mps and increasing the number of small size microplastic particles 3 3 2 compost mps are mostly bio transformed during composting due to the presence of microorganisms xu et al 2021c microorganisms mainly attach to the microplastic surface causing in increased brittleness and abundance of mps the presence of microorganisms causes changes in the surface tension and structure of mps and secreted enzymes also promote changes zhang et al 2020a observed that the abundance finished products reduced reduced abundance proved that mps were broken down into smaller pieces during composting and existing technology limits the determination of small sized mps blaesing and amelung 2018 chen et al 2020 investigated the changes in ps mps using hyper thermophilic composting technology and long chains of ps mps were observed to break resulting in a decrease in molecular weight the surface chemical composition of ps mps was observed to increase oxygen content with the emergence of c o and c o functional groups ps mps hydrophobicity was also observed to decrease reducing the bioresistance of bacteria meanwhile the surface morphology of mps had also changed cracks were noticed on the ps mps and ldph mps surface at 40 c and large surface damage appeared at 70 c with large pits and voids alassali et al 2018 chen et al 2020 furthermore the compost is composed of an outer oxide layer and an inner anoxic core area which leads to the existence of a large number of reducing contents and microbes in the compost such as iron containing compounds humus and corresponding reducing microbes xie et al 2020 yang et al 2016 therefore compost can provide a large amount of free radicals providing more possibilities for humification and changes in mps abundant free radicals were detected spontaneously by xing et al 2022 abundant free radicals were detected spontaneously by row et al involved ho and its precursors like o2 or h2o2 the existence of free radicals and reactive oxygen species in sludge composting accelerated the oxidative degradation of mps the molecular weights decrease from 18 to 27 and carbonyl index value rise from 0 23 to 0 52 numerous studies have reported the concentration of mps in composting but the specific changes in physicochemical properties including particle size shape and chemical properties as well as the ratio of microbial community changes in the process of composting have not been elaborated in much detail 4 vital role of physicochemical characteristics of mps from wastewater treatment plants in their environmental risks physicochemical properties of microplastic treated with wastewater and sludge have been observed to change such as shape size polymer type density additives and chemical properties this chapter discussed the effects of aging mps on organisms from the perspectives of toxicity accumulation fluidity and persistence and systematically summarizes the relationship between aging mps and environmental risks table 2 the fate of aging mps in the environment may change when they are released affecting ecosystems and human health fig 4 4 1 shape the shape of mps can change dramatically after passing through wwtps mahon et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2020c li et al 2018 detected mps in sludge from 28 wwtps in china and found the proportion of fibers and particles increased from 17 7 and 2 5 to 30 3 and 5 6 in effluent in wastewater treated process fibers are more likely to entangle with flocs than debris and end up entering and staying in the sludge affecting their mobility and bioavailability porter et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 this indicates that the bioavailability of mps around the wwtps will change significantly and the distribution and fate of mps will change again sherlock et al 2022 observed the guts of chicks downstream of the wwtp were full of fiber whereas in contrast the guts of control chicks were observed to have diverse mps including 15 of virgin plastic debris meanwhile the shape of mps also changes their sinking behavior van melkebeke et al 2020 used common mps such as spheres films and fibers to simulate the settling behavior the result is that the theoretical value is much higher than the measured value analysis of the reasons found that theoretical evaluations often use standardized spherical particles while in practical situation mps have complex and diverse shapes which should be considered within the scope of environmental risks furthermore since mps with different shapes have inconsistent sharpness and uniformity they are likely to have distinct impact on cells and biology such as toxicity etc choi et al 2021 observed that hdpe mps did not produce major toxicity to cells due to their smooth surface but they induced immune reaction in pbmcs and promoted pbmc divergence in addition due to their sharp edges high curvature changes and more debris the ldpe mps after grinding resulted in increased cytotoxicity inflammation and hemolysis in fact the shapes of mps treated with sewage and sludge are more diverse with different characteristics that could affect ecosystems and human health since mps are mixed with sludge there are some mps that cannot be detected by the existing technology and further detection technology optimization is required meanwhile fish and algae have been reported but more research is needed to reveal the link between shape change and environmental risks 4 2 size mps change in size after passing through wwtps resulting in smaller mps lehtiniemi et al 2018 particle size of mps is an important factor affecting their properties and migration ability many predators cannot distinguish similar sized prey from particulate matter so mps can be ingested by organisms for example small size can promote the uptake of mps by browne et al 2008 particle size also affects the adsorption behavior of pollutants because smaller particles have larger surface area rochman et al 2015 munoz et al 2021 investigated the adsorption capacity of diclofenac and metronidazole with microplastic size ranging from 20 μm to 1000 μm it was found that the adsorption ability grow with the reducing of microplastic size this is an important feature and the potential role of mps as carriers of pollutants in the aquatic environment must be considered as plastic fragments are expected to degrade further into smaller dimensions even into the nanoplastic zhang et al 2017 observed the toxicity of mps with different particle sizes to microalgae skeletonema costatum and found that the inhibition rate of on microalgae growth of mps with a common particle diameter of 1 um was 39 7 while mps with a common particle diameter of 1 mm had no effect on microalgae because mps with smaller particle size can be more easily adsorbed on cell surface and embedded into microalgae cells to inhibit the growth of microalgae this phenomenon not only change the migration capacity of mps but also may lead toxicity to organisms huang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 concentrations of mps of 50 100 um or even smaller particle size may be underestimated due to technical limitations sun et al 2021 in addition the sedimentation velocity of mps has also been confirmed to be related to particle size kowalski et al 2016 the distribution characteristics and migration capacity of mps will theoretically change which requires further observation and testing 4 3 density the density of mps can determine which organisms ingest them but transform in the physicochemical characteristics of mps caused by wastewater and sludge treatment will alter the type of microbial ingestion mps with a density less than freshwater may be ingested by organisms living in the upper water and conversely they may be ingested by benthic organisms recently researchers have now observed something different as the mps passes through wwtps microbes attach to it and grow forming a biofilm the transport behaviors of mps such as sedimentation and suspension will change the density of mps due to the loading of biological biofilm jahnke et al 2017 semcesen and wells 2021 observed that the formation of biofilms resulted in increased density of pe mps causing the pe mps suspended in freshwater lakes to sink thu ha et al 2020 observed that the suspended state of pe mps changes after the formation of the biofilm and gradually sinks at the same time the release of additives and the appearance of streaks stripes cracks and voids emerge on the surface of mps after aging leading to adsorption of pollutants both cause transform in the density of mps drummond et al 2020 but it is not clear how aging changes the fate and migration of mps in the environment moreover aging mps have ability to heteroaggregation polymerize with phytoplankton lagarde et al 2016 found that after only 20 days of exposure pp mps combined with microalgae and exopolysaccharides to form heteroaggregates which changed the density of pp mps and changed its migration path sink meanwhile mps can also accumulate in sludge other organic or soluble contents can also cause density rise up and affect migration in the long term behavior and migration of mps in the environment will change along different paths due to biological contamination aging and heterogeneous polymerization further experiments are needed to integrate the effects of wastewater and sludge treatment on mps to realistic simulates the performance of highly diverse mps and large plastic particles in the water environment 4 4 leachate many discussions have shown that the surface structure and chemical composition of mps can be changed after treated with wastewater and sludge aging leading additives and small molecule organics were released into the environment from mps chen et al 2020 dong et al 2020 liu et al 2020b wei et al 2021a studies have found that some additive can directly destroy microbial cells and inhibit the activity of key enzymes related to biochemical reactions and defense oxidative stress affecting microbial activities in the digestive apparatus for example bpa is the main chemical leached from pvc mps and the cumulative amount follows a saturation curve it interferes with the normal function of the endocrine system affects human health and the anaerobic digestion of sludge by leaching bpa from mps halden 2010 wei et al 2019a paluselli et al 2019 found that phthalates were released into the environment in the aging process of mps which are toxic and carcinogenic to human health gardon et al 2020 observed the effect of additives mainly phthalates released by aging mps spat collector and synthetic rope on pearl oyster in 100 g l leaching solution 60 inhibition rate and 82 mortality rate were observed at the stage of embryonic development into larva this further confirmed that the change of physicochemical property of mps may lead to the release of leachate moreover the leaching of additives is easily affected by the environment for example luo et al 2021 observed that the aging process accelerated the liberate of lead chromate but the leaching performance under acidic conditions was higher than that under moderate conditions and high concentration of nacl was conducive to the leaching process luo et al 2020a in addition mps derived dissolved organic matter mps dom released by mps also enhances the risk to exposed biota for example shi et al 2021a found that mps dom is mainly composed of 4 4 dihydroxybenzophenone dhb p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba and methylphenylalanine mep which also helps on estrogenic activity therefore it is important to learn the relationship between the properties of aging plastics and leachate as well as the association with environmental risks 4 5 chemical properties various oxygen containing groups are formed on the surface of mps after treated with wastewater and sludge aging sun et al 2020 this may increase the adsorption properties of mps and become carriers of toxic substances dramatically changing their environmental behavior toxicity and bioavailability ziajahromi et al 2016 li et al 2019a observed that aging can affect their adsorption capacity such as the ability of mps to bind contaminants such as atorvastatin and amlodipine su et al 2021 also found that the aging process can enhance the potential of mps as antibiotic resistance gene carriers liu et al 2022 observed that naturally aged mps had higher adsorption capacity for pb ii similar phenomenon was observed by many researchers when aging mps are in contact with organic pollutants they will adsorb and collect pollutants and then transfer them to living organisms resulting in the accumulation of pollutants in living organisms abduro ogo et al 2022 for example huang et al 2021 studied the effects of mps combined with β blocker propranolol prp on red tilapia and found that aging mps increased prp accumulation in the brain of red tilapia by 82 3 indicating that aging mps may lead to drug accumulation in organisms oxygen containing functional groups can also promote the negative charge of mps further promoting the dispersion and toxicity of mps fu et al 2019 aged ps was observed to enhance the inhibition of microalgae chlorella vulgaris 22 35 rather than the original inhibition rate 10 28 due to the increased ssa and surface charge leading to the absorption of more ps by microalgae chlorella vulgaris however it s also possible that aging mps could be beneficial to microbes zou et al 2020 examined the toxic effects of aging mps pa mps on young zebrafish primitive pa mps was observed to significantly inhibit skeletal muscle development in zebrafish while aging pa mps and leaching did not the increased migration capacity of mps promoted the removal of pollutants but increased the contamination distance of mps these results once again pointed out the impact of aging mps on environmental risks 5 concluding remarks and future perspectives mps are weathered by factors such as mechanical wear chemical oxidation and biodegradation during various treatment processes in wwtps these processes may most likely alter microplastic characteristics including morphology mechanical strength oxygen content molecular weight etc in this review the physicochemical properties and fate of mps in wwtps are discussed the main conclusions are 1 the specific changes of mps in physicochemical properties depend on various wastewater treated processes in the process of wastewater treatment physical wear of mps was main happened in primary treatment process but there are few reports about it biological treatment processes have a small impact on mps depending on the type of microorganism and the key treatment technology a small number of references observed that mps were degraded by some functional bacteria but the degradation of mps was very slow the tertiary treatment process mainly uses strong oxidants for disinfection and the effect on physicochemical properties of mps is most significant so relatively rough and oxygen containing functional groups were appeared on surface of mps resulting in changes in morphology and chemical characteristics 2 according to the treatment conditions sludge treatment can be divided into physical chemical and biological processes results suggest that treatment processes may have an effect a large number of mps is recycled in the last waste sludge different from primary mps sludge based mps have obvious aging characteristics the surface of sludge mps is rougher with increased specific surface area and contains oxygen containing functional groups like co and oh larger average particle size of mps was observed in sludge than that of mps in wastewater 3 aging mps may change the adsorption potential of mps to organic pollutants heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms and then altering their migratory capacity and toxicity at the same time wastewater and sludge treatment processes not only affect the surface characteristics of plastic fragments but also the leaching of chemical additives such as pigments stabilizers flame retardants antioxidants and plasticizers etc thus the fate of aging mps may change when they are released into the environment leading to altered potential risks to human health and the environment regarding the research on mps in wwtps there are still many problems that need to be further studied to better reduce mps the problems that require be paying attention to and solving in the future are as follows 1 although the research relating to changes of physicochemical characteristics of mps have been sporadically conducted but most of them focused on the effects from individual treatment process full life cycle assessments on the aging of physicochemical characteristics of mps in wwtps are lost in addition the specific parameters of each treatment process would also affect the physicochemical properties of mps the influence of hydraulic retention time salinity organics concentration and other process parameters in dynamic situations on the physicochemical properties of mps should be further evaluated 2 most studies have discussed the effects on ecosystems and human health of mps using artificial model mps as research ontology but the distinction between the influences of mps underwent wastewater and sludge treatment and the effect of artificial model mps on the environment is not well understood particularly whether there is a significant differentiation in the relationship between mps and environmental risk after treatment with wastewater and sludge deserves to be further investigated to reflect better the environmental actual situation 3 due to the differences in sampling methodology among researchers the data obtained at different sampling times and different sampling points may vary greatly meanwhile the extraction and detection techniques of mps can obviously influence the results of quantitative recognition therefore it is impossible to directly compare the research results among scholars and establish unified microplastic sample collection classification standards and detection methods standardize the expression method of microplastic abundance 4 in recent years vast quantities of discussions have been conducted to reduce the amount of mps in the treatment of sewage and sludge also some mps removal strategies such as air floatation filtration and adsorption have been developed apart from the quantitative removal future efforts targeting to reduce the environmental risks related physicochemical characteristics

15756,dissolved organic matter dom plays an essential role in the global carbon biogeochemical cycle for aquatic ecosystems the complexity of dom compounds contributes to the accurate monitoring of its sources and compositions from large scale patterns to microscopic molecular groups here this study demonstrates the diverse sources and compositions for humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes for large scale regions across china with the linkage to optical components and molecular high resolution mass spectrometry properties the total fluorescence intensity of colored dom cdom for humic rich lake regions 0 176 raman unit r u is significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the protein rich lake region 0 084 r u the combined percentages of cdom absorption variance explained by the anthropogenic

significantly higher than that from the protein like lakes 47 484 5 638 respectively the more complex molecular composition with higher aromaticity occurred in the humic rich lakes than in the protein rich lakes the increasing anthropogenic effects would significantly enhance the sources transformation and biodegradation of terrestrial dom and link to the greenhouse gas emission and the carbon cycle in inland waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dom ft icr ms lake carbon cycle data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom with autochthonous and allochthonous origins as one of the largest pools of carbon cycling in freshwater ecosystems plays a ubiquitous role in biogeochemical processes and ultimately affects the global carbon cycles jaffé et al 2014 meng et al 2013a huang et al 2017 the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom a significant fraction of dom with optical functions absorption of the ultraviolet and visible region and parts with fluorescent properties could be used as a potential proxy to assess the organic pollution and human activities effects at large spatial scales chen et al 2003 stedmon and bro 2008 shang et al 2021 many regions across china have been undergoing rapid social development and urbanization li et al 2018 shang et al 2021 which would increase the pollutants from waste discharges and fuel carbon emissions in addition cdom could produce an unpleasant smell to influence the water quality and form carcinogenic by products to increase the risk of causing cancer zhou et al 2015 shang et al 2021 however the complexity of cdom compounds limits understanding of the accurate monitoring of cdom sources and compositions for large scale patterns ishii and boyer 2012 wang et al 2015 cdom is closely linked to the relative concentration of dom and is generally used to assess the relative levels of dom especially dissolved organic carbon doc and trace the sources cycling biogeochemical processes via the optical properties of aquatic environments hestir et al 2015 generally the allochthonous cdom primarily consists of humic substances and autochthonous sources includes more protein like and tryptophan like components through terrestrial input in situ primary production photo degradation and biological transformation processes in natural waters mostofa et al 2009 the utilization of excitation emission matrices eems of cdom with the techniques of parallel factor parafac analysis is widely considered to be a sensitive way to elucidate the qualitative fraction variations of fluorescent cdom fdom components for inland waters e g lyu et al 2020 in recent decades fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms with ultra high resolving power and accuracy is becoming a powerful tool to study the molecular composition for dom samples of inland waters e g he et al 2020a with the help of the aromaticity index ai molecular lability index mlb and the classification of multiple molecular groups including polycyclic aromatics highly aromatic and unsaturated compounds and saturated compounds ft icr ms is helpful to demonstrate the bioavailability and degree of refractory degradation for aquatic dom import and degradation processes for carbon biogeochemical cycles koch and dittmar 2006 he et al 2020b studies have found that the contributions of humic substances account for 14 90 of total dom in lakes e g mostofa et al 2009 therefore many studies have started to address the significant variations in the spatial and temporal cdom concentration and sources in reservoirs and lakes through the absorption and fluorescence properties zhou et al 2017 shang et al 2019 both humic like and protein like components were widely detected in fdom from various aquatic ecosystems e g lakes reservoirs and rivers however little is known about the detailed differences in composition sources and factors between humic like matters and protein like matters of dom for large scale regions thus studies are needed for characterizing the linkage between dom components and their factors to quantify the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle from both large scale regional and molecular perspectives wang et al 2015 cdom is one of the most critical optically active components of dom its chemical composition sources and photochemical or microbial processes are affected by natural and anthropogenic stressors shank et al 2010 shang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 du et al 2021 the climate conditions and landscape properties are highly structured in space over regional to global scales and a strong influence of these factors should induce spatially structured patterns in lake dom at large spatial scales hijmans et al 2005 lapierre et al 2016 the significant variations of regional patterns such as climate factors and geographical locations along with the land use and land cover change lulc would bring terrestrial input of organic pollutants to aquatic systems and also affect its photochemical transformation tzortziou et al 2015 yates et al 2019 shao and wang 2020 moreover the increase of urbanization development with the lulc would influence the variations of terrestrial organic composition and microbial degradation processes aufdenkampe et al 2011 studies have shown that the land use types contribute to dom chemical and compositional complexity wilson and xenopoulos 2009 piirsoo et al 2012 lambert et al 2015 meanwhile human disturbance such as sewage and industrial wastewater discharge also affects the dom loadings significantly graeber et al 2015 yates et al 2019 even though these concepts have been well proposed for past decades which and to what extent these landscape and environmental drivers would affect dom composition and sources in large scale regions remain elusive the unaddressed gap would affect the large scale spatial structuring of lake carbon cycling lapierre et al 2016 in the current stage the study of cdom distribution of lakes across china generally centered on regional classical lakes or rivers the potential factors for the large scale regional variations have not been recognized comprehensively moreover the linkages among the cdom sources greenhouse gas emissions ghgs and sediment organic carbon burial have not been investigated in previous studies which would be critical for considering the regional carbon cycling models in this study the eems with parafac analysis and ft icr ms are combined to understand dom compositions sources and the spatial distribution for lakes across china the main objectives are to a evaluate the variations in dom composition and distribution across national scale regions b determine the primary climate landscape and anthropogenic drivers over large spatial regions across china c explore the main factors natural versus anthropogenic on the lake dom chemistry across china 2 methods and materials 2 1 study sites and field sampling the lakes of china are well classified into five spatial region patterns due to the significant variations in land cover types and climate conditions ma et

correlation analysis was conducted using spss statistics 22 0 to explore relationships between humic rich sources and protein rich sources of lake dom across china meanwhile results with p values lower than 0 05 were reported as significant in the linear regression and one way anova analyses 3 results 3 1 the distribution of cdom absorption and fluorescence intensities in this study the eem parafac analysis of the lakes across china is carried out and three dom components are identified including c1 humic like component ex em 250 nm 438 nm c2 humic like component ex em 230 nm 430 nm and c3 protein like component ex em 280 nm 325 nm c1 component is similar to humic like c peak which is widely observed in natural waters coble 1996 2007 stedmon et al 2011 c2 component is considered as the fulvic origin or the terrestrially derived humic like products stedmon and markager 2005 massicotte and frenette 2011 kothawala et al 2015 c3 component in the uva region overlaps the peak t for tryptophan protein like sources coble 1996 walker et al 2013 the lakes are operationally defined as humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes according to the parafac result based on decision tree method and the consideration of land use and the heihe tengchong line the detailed method is shown in the si the total fluorescence intensity ft for humic rich lake regions 0 176 0 032 r u is significantly higher than that of the protein rich lake region 0 084 0 011 r u p 0 05 the comparison of fluorescence intensity for c1 c2 and c3 among regions is shown in fig 2 significant differences between humic rich and protein rich lakes are observed among and within the regions p 0 05 the mean acdom 254 ranged from 13 95 to 44 71 m 1 among five lake regions the mean acdom 254 in humic rich lakes 26 54 m 1 is significantly higher than that of protein rich lakes 16 32 m 1 in the same regions fig 2b the significant differences in acdom 254 in humic rich lakes are observed among regions in terms of seasons humic rich lakes are dominant for spring summer and autumn fig s5 in terms of the individual lake we have done the result comparisons for eight lakes for four seasons fig s6 it is found that the fluorescence components of dom of a single lake changed for different seasons which is likely caused by the changing hydrological and climate conditions for small scale regions and this study would focus on the external annual natural and anthropogenic factors for average dom components across four seasons in large scale regions 3 2 the pca of cdom fluorescence properties of lakes across china the fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 for all lake water samples in five lake regions across china which help determine the degree of separation between the humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes were further investigated by pca the two pca axes pc1 and pc2 explained 93 73 of the total variance in the dataset with component 1 and component 2 accounting for 67 03 and 26 70 respectively fig 3 a the protein like component c3 shows the positive loadings on pc2 with more contribution of sunlight in contrast the humic like components c1 and c2 show the negative loadings on pc2 with more allochothonous sources and human disturbance which could be used to address the apparent separation of the variances regarding the classification of lake types it is evident that the protein rich lakes are centered in the same direction as c3 while the humic rich lakes are focused on the same trend of c2 and c1 the pc1 and pc2 show a general clustering of humic rich types and protein rich lakes with component 1 scores in the range of 0 75 4 5 and component 2 scores ranging from 1 0 to 1 5 fig 3 in terms of lake regions the protein rich samples from tqr lakes were generally clustered along the positive axis of component 1 whereas the water samples from the other four region lakes were generally scattered with high negative component 2 scores fig 3b 3 3 the composition and sources of cdom in lakes across china the composition and sources of dom would be reflected by the cdom absorption and fluorescence properties m bix310 hix including the overall aromaticity the proportion of autochthonous and allochthonous dom and aquatic biological activity the significant differences for averaged m autochthonous index bix310 and hix are respectively observed between the humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes p 0 05 and the values are shown in table 1 meanwhile for the lake regions the comparison of humic rich types and protein rich types is shown in table 2 the averaged hix m and bix310 in tqr are significantly different from that of other lake regions nlr elr mxr and ygr p 0 05 the significant variances of averaged hix m and bix310 between humic like types and protein like types in the same regions are shown as well p 0 05 for both humic rich types and protein rich types the fluorescence components c1 c2 and c3 show an important relation to cdom absorption doc concentration and m p 0 01 the m value is negatively correlated to the c1 component but is positively correlated to the c3 component the humic like c1 is significantly related to fluorescent indices in humic like lakes while protein like component c3 is more related to hix and bix310 in protein rich lakes p 0 01 table 3 3 4 the main factors contributing to cdom composition the natural factors precipitation sunlight anthropogenic factors wastewater discharge sewage discharge and fertilizer usage land use proportion and aquatic water quality parameters chla tsm ph salinity etc would mutually contribute to the variance of dom composition and sources that could be reflected on the changes of cdom absorption and fluorescence intensities the variability of cdom absorption and fluorescence in various regions can result from multiple socioeconomic and climatic factors fig 4 the combined percentages of cdom absorption variance explained by the anthropogenic and climatic variables across the five lake regions of nlr ygr mxr elr and tqr were 86 25 82 57 80 23 88 55 and 87 72 respectively meanwhile the percentages of humic like and protein like variances c1 c2 and c3 explained by the anthropogenic and climatic variables in different regions are higher than 65 for the nlr region cdom absorption and fluorescence variances are mostly affected by doc concentration farmland fertilizer usage and precipitation for ygr except doc precipitation and sunlight contribute to the fluorescent component of dom significantly in terms of mxr doc concentration chla concentration construction and sewage discharge affect the cdom component primarily in the region of elr the percentages of the construction area and sewage discharge are critical factors to protein like components however in the high altitude area of tqr sunlight time salinity and precipitation contribute to the humic like components and protein like components with a large proportion significantly 3 5 characterization of molecular dom complexity by ft icr ms the ft icr ms analyses for inland lakes across china showed that 10 128 and 9071 formulas on average were detected as significantly different from the humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes respectively table s1 p 0 05 the cho formulae were most abundant regarding peak count followed by chon chos and chons formulae for all lakes table s1 the averaged relative intensity percentage of chos chons formula from humic rich lakes 90 831 10 561 was significantly higher than that from the protein rich lakes 47 484 5 638 respectively fig 5 the comparison for molecular parameters table s1 demonstrated that higher averaged m z ai and low mlb occurred in the humic rich lakes meanwhile in terms of the compound grouped fractions higher averaged abundances of black carbon polyphenols highly unsaturated and cram occurred in humic rich lakes while higher unsaturated aliphatics compounds peptides sugars and saturated fatty acids in protein rich lakes the pca results explained 73 51 of the total variances of the proportion of intensity weighted parameters cho chon chos etc while 60 16 of the total variances of the formulae groups could be explained with pc1 and pc2 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 the natural conditions contributed to spatial variations in dom sources the effects of geographical domains and meteorology on the dom composition and absorption coefficients in inland waters have been recognized fig 4 the significant correlation between c2 and hix in humic rich lakes and the similar correlation between c3 and bix310 show the variability of dom sources in different types of lakes table 3 p 0 05 in the same regions the humic rich lakes trends to contain more aromatic organic compounds and higher humification levels compared with the local protein rich lakes which illustrates that the protein rich lakes have more newly produced dom with high biological activities from aquatic biodegradation tables 1 and 2 helms et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 shi et al 2020 the surrounding soil type and soil nutrient would influence the cdom composition of lakes through allochthonous humic like substances butman et al 2014 in terms of climatic conditions the mean monthly precipitation value is more correlated to c2 and m in humic rich lakes rc2 0 675 rm 0 643 p 0 01 than that of protein rich lakes rc1 0 305 rm 0 411 p 0 05 which demonstrate the humification and export of humic like materials would increase with the rainfall than that of protein like materials especially in humic rich lakes during the rainfall events song et al 2019 lyu et al 2021 the significant contribution of precipitation to humic like c1 components in five regions illustrates that surface runoff likely increases the export of terrestrial dom from the surface soil layer shi et al 2020 lee et al 2019 generally the mean monthly precipitation of humic rich lakes 99 5 13 1 mm is significantly higher than that of protein rich lakes 83 7 35 6 mm which would demonstrate that the fast flushing after intense precipitation would deliver more humic like matters with the increasing water residence time declined groundwater level and microbial degradation activities from soils lyu et al 2021 most protein rich lakes are located in high altitude areas or with strong sunlight intensity the significant contribution of sunlight duration to the decreasing c1 components rc1 0 532 p 0 05 in protein rich lakes indicates that solar radiation would decrease the humic like fluorescent components of cdom significantly and increase the relative content of protein like components shang et al 2019 the correlation coefficient between sunlight duration and decreasing hix in protein rich lakes slope 0 662 p 0 05 is higher than that of humic rich lakes slope 0 452 p 0 05 which illustrate the humification level tended to decrease sharply in the protein rich lakes for strong sunlight with the preferred degradation processes and the release of small molecular weight cdom mostofa et al 2009 shao and wang 2020 4 2 the influences of anthropogenic factors on dom variations in lake regions the dom in lakes is generally affected by anthropogenic factors including the land use of watersheds and human activities besides the natural conditions sobek et al 2007 xia and zhang 2011 in this study the dom absorption and fluorescent components are affected by various anthropogenic activities and land use types in different regions the percentage of land use for humic rich lakes is significantly higher than that of protein rich lakes p 0 05 the protein rich lakes are distributed in the regions with more bare land area and the c3 component is significantly related to bare land area r 0 67 p 0 05 also according to the heihe tengchong population line fig s4 the protein rich lakes are generally distributed in the northwest of the line 87 and the humic rich lakes are generally distributed in the southeast of the line 83 in the eastern regions of china increasing anthropogenic land use farmland and fertilizer usage contributes significantly to the terrestrial humic like c1 component and cdom concentration which indicate the agricultural activities as the dominant land use type to export more terrestrial humic like dom and nutrients to lakes across these regions antony et al 2017 morling et al 2017 roebuck et al 2020 sankar et al 2020 moreover our result that the construction and sewage discharge has a higher contribution to the protein like dom component across different regions indicates human activities are essential sources of importing fdom to lakes with rapid social development meng et al 2013a cohen et al 2014 liu et al 2020 human activities likely contribute both allochthonous terrestrial and autochthonous dom to all lakes for the observed tight correlation between c1 c3 and sewage wastewater discharge in all sampled lakes p 0 05 the decreasing m with increasing sewage discharge for protein rich lakes p 0 05 indicated that the dom in protein rich lakes is contributed by urbanization significantly besides the natural sunlight conditions liu et al 2020 therefore anthropogenic factors and natural factors such as land use human activities precipitation and sunlight contribute to variations for dom components between humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes comprehensively for the overall trend however the detailed seasonal variations in dom components should consider seasonal climate and hydrological conditions for different locations 4 3 the linkage between molecular composition and dom sources with the optical and molecular composition obtained in the same study the linkage between optical and molecular composition is explored the high s contained formulae chos and chons and n contained formulae chon2 and chon3 for humic rich lakes table s1 also suggest the high abundances of heteroatoms organic matter input from agricultural activities and urbanization in the effluent gonsior et al 2017 he et al 2019 meanwhile the correlations between c3 and s contained formulae n contained formulae fig 6a indicate the strong coupling between the production of newly produced autochthonous organic matter and the anthropogenic derived sources in protein rich lakes the humic like components c1 and c2 are highly correlated to formulae groups usually with higher molecular weight including black carbon like compounds polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds the protein rich lakes are characterized by high percentages of smaller molecular peptides sugars and saturated fatty acids which are possibly photo degraded products with higher biolability and strong autochthonous algal or phytoplankton activities and microbial processes stubbins and dittmar 2015 d andrilli et al 2015 the strong autochthonous signature from the molecular level in protein rich lakes is also consistent with higher bix values observed the significant negative correlation between c3 and ai p 0 05 suggests that the newly produced molecular formulas from protein like lakes tend to be more bioavailable for microbial activity in contrast the humic rich lakes contain more aromatic formulas with a higher degree of aromaticity and humification the terrestrial humic like component c2 is closed related to the percentage of black c and polyphenols fig 6b which indicates the high aromatic levels for anthropogenic input from human sewage related organic matter or vascular plant derived terrestrial organic matters jaffé et al 2014 seidel et al 2015 he et al 2019 he et al 2020b for humic rich lakes the significant correlation p 0 05 between c2 and ai hix indicates that the humic like organic matter with a high mass range was dominant in dom compositional compounds meanwhile higher percentages of o3s and o5s compounds and unsaturated aliphatic compounds in protein rich lakes demonstrated that the sewage and crop runoff or surfactant like compounds from human activities likely contributed significantly to protein like cdom in addition to the freshwater phytoplankton or algae derived autochthonous dom he et al 2019 wang et al 2019 variations of complex dom sources with severe anthropogenic input for inland lakes across china are characterized on both fluorescence and molecular levels therefore combining multiple complementary methods could provide a better perspective of dom cycling in inland water at the regional scale 4 4 implications for carbon cycling in inland waters and further considerations freshwaters are considered as an important source of greenhouse gasses ghgs li et al 2018 generally released from soils to surface waters and rapidly evaded into the atmosphere as physical gas exchange oquist et al 2009 the changes in cdom sources and compositions are related to the biogeochemical cycle and energy flow of ecosystems williams et al 2016 and are involved in the carbon budget potentially affecting ghgs emissions zhou et al 2018 emilson et al 2018 however the variations of cdom sources within regions due to the various anthropogenic and natural stressors would affect the spatiotemporal variability of aqueous carbon processing li et al 2018 in our study the carbon emissions for administrative regions of humic rich lakes are significantly higher than those of the protein rich lakes fig 7 p 0 05 which indicates that fuel carbon emissions co2 emissions for fossil fuel raw coal crude oil natural gas cement along with economic development would affect the cdom fluorescence as the fossil fuel compounds and secondary organic aerosol from terrestrial imports are detected in waters mitra et al 2017 as the humic rich lakes are generally located in the east of china 40 of the population from the seventh census of china with rapid urbanization this result indicates that humic rich lakes trends to be formed in the regions with more anthropogenic activities while protein rich lakes are located in the western regions 27 of the population from the seventh census of china with a low density of population and few human activities with extreme climate conditions based on the rda analysis of natural and anthropogenic conditions for cdom fluorescence components the rda analysis explains 69 2 of the variations the humic like cdom are positively correlated to fossil fuel gas emission and precipitation while sunlight contributes to the protein like c3 components fig 8 a the significant correlation between humic like components and fossil fuel gas emission p 0 05 indicates that the anthropogenic carbon emission is a path to import organic matter to water surface through the land atmospheric and water atmospheric exchange yu et al 2018 the humic like components are positively related to the primary and secondary industries that generally are the dominant industry structure in less developed regions with more usage of fossil fuel which demonstrates that the composition of dom could be a potential proxy to reflect the intensity of regional industry structure and levels of economic development shang et al 2021 to explore the relationships between cdom fluorescent components and the aqueous carbon cycles the datasets for doc storage annual co2 equivalents carbon burial capacity and organic carbon accumulation rate of five lake regions of china are collected from previous studies table 4 the rda analysis explains 65 1 of the variations fig 8 the humic like components are positively correlated to the organic carbon accumulation rate ocar and the ocar is previously demonstrated to be related to socio economics and temperature yu et al 2018 we suggest that dom derived from human activities is important for carbon burial in lakes stackpoole et al 2014 for instances the dom compounds with carboxylic and hydroxylic groups usually biologically recalcitrant are preferred to be adsorbed on mineral surface of particles and finally deposited in sediments kothawala et al 2012 moreover previous research showed that there was a positive relationship between the contents of recalcitrant doc and total oc in sediments schmidt et al 2009 wang et al 2021 therefore our result indicates that the humic rich lakes trend to become increasing carbon pools along with increasing anthropogenic activities and precipitation heathcote et al 2015 meanwhile the humic like component c1 or c2 is related to annual co2 equivalents indicating that humic substances with high terrestrial influence promote more heterotrophic co2 production than in lake production acting as a nutrient subsidy to suppressing primary production due to light attenuation allesson et al 2020 the highest ocar for elr and lowest ocar for tqr observed here table 4 and in a previous study zhang et al 2017 are likely caused by that the developed region of elr has gone through more soil erosion river damming and eutrophication kastowski et al 2011 while the tqr is located at high altitude with low annual temperature and has low primary productivity the significant amount of doc storage and annual co2 equivalents in tqr is likely related to the terrestrial import based on climate change ran et al 2021 therefore the carbon cycles for chinese inland waters must consider the significant regional variations observed in this study according to previous studies table 4 the sum of doc storage and carbon burial capacity for five lake regions exceed the annual co2 equivalents which may demonstrate the importance of chinese lakes for carbon sink keller et al 2021 and more accurate measurements of organic carbon sources gas emission and burial capacity are needed for better constraining the carbon cycles for both regional and global scales 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the variations of dom sources and compositions for lakes across china from large scale distribution to molecular scale analysis significant variations in optical properties and molecular composition including cdom absorption properties fluorescent parameters and molecular complexity are observed between protein rich lakes and humic rich lakes the significant spatial variation of factors influencing cdom components in different regions is mainly caused by natural conditions and anthropogenic activities however the dominant influencing factors differ across five regions and between protein like and humic rich lakes the complex molecular variations for humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes are observed and the alterations of spatial sources and molecular composition of dom in inland lakes are linked to protein like components and humic like components these spatial variations are essential to consider to better quantify the role of chinese inland waters in the global carbon cycle the combination of multiple complementary methods in this study provides a comprehensive perspective of dom cycling in inland water at the regional scale and helps predict the changes in dom sources with the increasing anthropogenic input at larger globalization scales nevertheless further studies need to explore the source specific markers and the degradation process photochemical or microbial degradation related to molecular abundances at the regional scale to better understand the dom signatures with the complex linkage of natural and anthropogenic influences declaration of competing

15756,dissolved organic matter dom plays an essential role in the global carbon biogeochemical cycle for aquatic ecosystems the complexity of dom compounds contributes to the accurate monitoring of its sources and compositions from large scale patterns to microscopic molecular groups here this study demonstrates the diverse sources and compositions for humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes for large scale regions across china with the linkage to optical components and molecular high resolution mass spectrometry properties the total fluorescence intensity of colored dom cdom for humic rich lake regions 0 176 raman unit r u is significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the protein rich lake region 0 084 r u the combined percentages of cdom absorption variance explained by the anthropogenic and climatic variables across the five lake regions of northeastern lake region nlr yungui plateau lake region ygr inner mongolia xinjiang lake region mxr eastern lake region elr and tibetan qinghai plateau lake region tqr were 86 25 82 57 80 23 88 55 and 87 72 respectively the averaged relative intensity percentages of chos and chons formulas from humic rich lakes 90 831 10 561 were significantly higher than that from the protein like lakes 47 484 5 638 respectively the more complex molecular composition with higher aromaticity occurred in the humic rich lakes than in the protein rich lakes the increasing anthropogenic effects would significantly enhance the sources transformation and biodegradation of terrestrial dom and link to the greenhouse gas emission and the carbon cycle in inland waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dom ft icr ms lake carbon cycle data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom with autochthonous and allochthonous origins as one of the largest pools of carbon cycling in freshwater ecosystems plays a ubiquitous role in biogeochemical processes and ultimately affects the global carbon cycles jaffé et al 2014 meng et al 2013a huang et al 2017 the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom a significant fraction of dom with optical functions absorption of the ultraviolet and visible region and parts with fluorescent properties could be used as a potential proxy to assess the organic pollution and human activities effects at large spatial scales chen et al 2003 stedmon and bro 2008 shang et al 2021 many regions across china have been undergoing rapid social development and urbanization li et al 2018 shang et al 2021 which would increase the pollutants from waste discharges and fuel carbon emissions in addition cdom could produce an unpleasant smell to influence the water quality and form carcinogenic by products to increase the risk of causing cancer zhou et al 2015 shang et al 2021 however the complexity of cdom compounds limits understanding of the accurate monitoring of cdom sources and compositions for large scale patterns ishii and boyer 2012 wang et al 2015 cdom is closely linked to the relative concentration of dom and is generally used to assess the relative levels of dom especially dissolved organic carbon doc and trace the sources cycling biogeochemical processes via the optical properties of aquatic environments hestir et al 2015 generally the allochthonous cdom primarily consists of humic substances and autochthonous sources includes more protein like and tryptophan like components through terrestrial input in situ primary production photo degradation and biological transformation processes in natural waters mostofa et al 2009 the utilization of excitation emission matrices eems of cdom with the techniques of parallel factor parafac analysis is widely considered to be a sensitive way to elucidate the qualitative fraction variations of fluorescent cdom fdom components for inland waters e g lyu et al 2020 in recent decades fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms with ultra high resolving power and accuracy is becoming a powerful tool to study the molecular composition for dom samples of inland waters e g he et al 2020a with the help of the aromaticity index ai molecular lability index mlb and the classification of multiple molecular groups including polycyclic aromatics highly aromatic and unsaturated compounds and saturated compounds ft icr ms is helpful to demonstrate the bioavailability and degree of refractory degradation for aquatic dom import and degradation processes for carbon biogeochemical cycles koch and dittmar 2006 he et al 2020b studies have found that the contributions of humic substances account for 14 90 of total dom in lakes e g mostofa et al 2009 therefore many studies have started to address the significant variations in the spatial and temporal cdom concentration and sources in reservoirs and lakes through the absorption and fluorescence properties zhou et al 2017 shang et al 2019 both humic like and protein like components were widely detected in fdom from various aquatic ecosystems e g lakes reservoirs and rivers however little is known about the detailed differences in composition sources and factors between humic like matters and protein like matters of dom for large scale regions thus studies are needed for characterizing the linkage between dom components and their factors to quantify the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle from both large scale regional and molecular perspectives wang et al 2015 cdom is one of the most critical optically active components of dom its chemical composition sources and photochemical or microbial processes are affected by natural and anthropogenic stressors shank et al 2010 shang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 du et al 2021 the climate conditions and landscape properties are highly structured in space over regional to global scales and a strong influence of these factors should induce spatially structured patterns in lake dom at large spatial scales hijmans et al 2005 lapierre et al 2016 the significant variations of regional patterns such as climate factors and geographical locations along with the land use and land cover change lulc would bring terrestrial input of organic pollutants to aquatic systems and also affect its photochemical transformation tzortziou et al 2015 yates et al 2019 shao and wang 2020 moreover the increase of urbanization development with the lulc would influence the variations of terrestrial organic composition and microbial degradation processes aufdenkampe et al 2011 studies have shown that the land use types contribute to dom chemical and compositional complexity wilson and xenopoulos 2009 piirsoo et al 2012 lambert et al 2015 meanwhile human disturbance such as sewage and industrial wastewater discharge also affects the dom loadings significantly graeber et al 2015 yates et al 2019 even though these concepts have been well proposed for past decades which and to what extent these landscape and environmental drivers would affect dom composition and sources in large scale regions remain elusive the unaddressed gap would affect the large scale spatial structuring of lake carbon cycling lapierre et al 2016 in the current stage the study of cdom distribution of lakes across china generally centered on regional classical lakes or rivers the potential factors for the large scale regional variations have not been recognized comprehensively moreover the linkages among the cdom sources greenhouse gas emissions ghgs and sediment organic carbon burial have not been investigated in previous studies which would be critical for considering the regional carbon cycling models in this study the eems with parafac analysis and ft icr ms are combined to understand dom compositions sources and the spatial distribution for lakes across china the main objectives are to a evaluate the variations in dom composition and distribution across national scale regions b determine the primary climate landscape and anthropogenic drivers over large spatial regions across china c explore the main factors natural versus anthropogenic on the lake dom chemistry across china 2 methods and materials 2 1 study sites and field sampling the lakes of china are well classified into five spatial region patterns due to the significant variations in land cover types and climate conditions ma et

contribution of driving factors to trends in cdom and fluorescence components of fdom for different regions is conducted through random forest regression with r studio in addition a spearman correlation analysis was conducted using spss statistics 22 0 to explore relationships between humic rich sources and protein rich sources of lake dom across china meanwhile results with p values lower than 0 05 were reported as significant in the linear regression and one way anova analyses 3 results 3 1 the distribution of cdom absorption and fluorescence intensities in this study the eem parafac analysis of the lakes across china is carried out and three dom components are identified including c1 humic like component ex em 250 nm 438 nm c2 humic like component ex em 230 nm 430 nm and c3 protein like component ex em 280 nm 325 nm c1 component is similar to humic like c peak which is widely observed in natural waters coble 1996 2007 stedmon et al 2011 c2 component is considered as the fulvic origin or the terrestrially derived humic like products stedmon and markager 2005 massicotte and frenette 2011 kothawala et al 2015 c3 component in the uva region overlaps the peak t for tryptophan protein like sources coble 1996 walker et al 2013 the lakes are operationally defined as humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes according to the parafac result based on decision tree method and the consideration of land use and the heihe tengchong line the detailed method is shown in the si the total fluorescence intensity ft for humic rich lake regions 0 176 0 032 r u is significantly higher than that of the protein rich lake region 0 084 0 011 r u p 0 05 the comparison of fluorescence intensity for c1 c2 and c3 among regions is shown in fig 2 significant differences between humic rich and protein rich lakes are observed among and within the regions p 0 05 the mean acdom 254 ranged from 13 95 to 44 71 m 1 among five lake regions the mean acdom 254 in humic rich lakes 26 54 m 1 is significantly higher than that of protein rich lakes 16 32 m 1 in the same regions fig 2b the significant differences in acdom 254 in humic rich lakes are observed among regions in terms of seasons humic rich lakes are dominant for spring summer and autumn fig s5 in terms of the individual lake we have done the result comparisons for eight lakes for four seasons fig s6 it is found that the fluorescence components of dom of a single lake changed for different seasons which is likely caused by the changing hydrological and climate conditions for small scale regions and this study would focus on the external annual natural and anthropogenic factors for average dom components across four seasons in large scale regions 3 2 the pca of cdom fluorescence properties of lakes across china the fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 for all lake water samples in five lake regions across china which help determine the degree of separation between the humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes were further investigated by pca the two pca axes pc1 and pc2 explained 93 73 of the total variance in the dataset with component 1 and component 2 accounting for 67 03 and 26 70 respectively fig 3 a the protein like component c3 shows the positive loadings on pc2 with more contribution of sunlight in contrast the humic like components c1 and c2 show the negative loadings on pc2 with more allochothonous sources and human disturbance which could be used to address the apparent separation of the variances regarding the classification of lake types it is evident that the protein rich lakes are centered in the same direction as c3 while the humic rich lakes are focused on the same trend of c2 and c1 the pc1 and pc2 show a general clustering of humic rich types and protein rich lakes with component 1 scores in the range of 0 75 4 5 and component 2 scores ranging from 1 0 to 1 5 fig 3 in terms of lake regions the protein rich samples from tqr lakes were generally clustered along the positive axis of component 1 whereas the water samples from the other four region lakes were generally scattered with high negative component 2 scores fig 3b 3 3 the composition and sources of cdom in lakes across china the composition and sources of dom would be reflected by the cdom absorption and fluorescence properties m bix310 hix including the overall aromaticity the proportion of autochthonous and allochthonous dom and aquatic biological activity the significant differences for averaged m autochthonous index bix310 and hix are respectively observed between the humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes p 0 05 and the values are shown in table 1 meanwhile for the lake regions the comparison of humic rich types and protein rich types is shown in table 2 the averaged hix m and bix310 in tqr are significantly different from that of other lake regions nlr elr mxr and ygr p 0 05 the significant variances of averaged hix m and bix310 between humic like types and protein like types in the same regions are shown as well p 0 05 for both humic rich types and protein rich types the fluorescence components c1 c2 and c3 show an important relation to cdom absorption doc concentration and m p 0 01 the m value is negatively correlated to the c1 component but is positively correlated to the c3 component the humic like c1 is significantly related to fluorescent indices in humic like lakes while protein like component c3 is more related to hix and bix310 in protein rich lakes p 0 01 table 3 3 4 the main factors contributing to cdom composition the natural factors precipitation sunlight anthropogenic factors wastewater discharge sewage discharge and fertilizer usage land use proportion and aquatic water quality parameters chla tsm ph salinity etc would mutually contribute to the variance of dom composition and sources that could be reflected on the changes of cdom absorption and fluorescence intensities the variability of cdom absorption and fluorescence in various regions can result from multiple socioeconomic and climatic factors fig 4 the combined percentages of cdom absorption variance explained by the anthropogenic and climatic variables across the five lake regions of nlr ygr mxr elr and tqr were 86 25 82 57 80 23 88 55 and 87 72 respectively meanwhile the percentages of humic like and protein like variances c1 c2 and c3 explained by the anthropogenic and climatic variables in different regions are higher than 65 for the nlr region cdom absorption and fluorescence variances are mostly affected by doc concentration farmland fertilizer usage and precipitation for ygr except doc precipitation and sunlight contribute to the fluorescent component of dom significantly in terms of mxr doc concentration chla concentration construction and sewage discharge affect the cdom component primarily in the region of elr the percentages of the construction area and sewage discharge are critical factors to protein like components however in the high altitude area of tqr sunlight time salinity and precipitation contribute to the humic like components and protein like components with a large proportion significantly 3 5 characterization of molecular dom complexity by ft icr ms the ft icr ms analyses for inland lakes across china showed that 10 128 and 9071 formulas on average were detected as significantly different from the humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes respectively table s1 p 0 05 the cho formulae were most abundant regarding peak count followed by chon chos and chons formulae for all lakes table s1 the averaged relative intensity percentage of chos chons formula from humic rich lakes 90 831 10 561 was significantly higher than that from the protein rich lakes 47 484 5 638 respectively fig 5 the comparison for molecular parameters table s1 demonstrated that higher averaged m z ai and low mlb occurred in the humic rich lakes meanwhile in terms of the compound grouped fractions higher averaged abundances of black carbon polyphenols highly unsaturated and cram occurred in humic rich lakes while higher unsaturated aliphatics compounds peptides sugars and saturated fatty acids in protein rich lakes the pca results explained 73 51 of the total variances of the proportion of intensity weighted parameters cho chon chos etc while 60 16 of the total variances of the formulae groups could be explained with pc1 and pc2 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 the natural conditions contributed to spatial variations in dom sources the effects of geographical domains and meteorology on the dom composition and absorption coefficients in inland waters have been recognized fig 4 the significant correlation between c2 and hix in humic rich lakes and the similar correlation between c3 and bix310 show the variability of dom sources in different types of lakes table 3 p 0 05 in the same regions the humic rich lakes trends to contain more aromatic organic compounds and higher humification levels compared with the local protein rich lakes which illustrates that the protein rich lakes have more newly produced dom with high biological activities from aquatic biodegradation tables 1 and 2 helms et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 shi et al 2020 the surrounding soil type and soil nutrient would influence the cdom composition of lakes through allochthonous humic like substances butman et al 2014 in terms of climatic conditions the mean monthly precipitation value is more correlated to c2 and m in humic rich lakes rc2 0 675 rm 0 643 p 0 01 than that of protein rich lakes rc1 0 305 rm 0 411 p 0 05 which demonstrate the humification and export of humic like materials would increase with the rainfall than that of protein like materials especially in humic rich lakes during the rainfall events song et al 2019 lyu et al 2021 the significant contribution of precipitation to humic like c1 components in five regions illustrates that surface runoff likely increases the export of terrestrial dom from the surface soil layer shi et al 2020 lee et al 2019 generally the mean monthly precipitation of humic rich lakes 99 5 13 1 mm is significantly higher than that of protein rich lakes 83 7 35 6 mm which would demonstrate that the fast flushing after intense precipitation would deliver more humic like matters with the increasing water residence time declined groundwater level and microbial degradation activities from soils lyu et al 2021 most protein rich lakes are located in high altitude areas or with strong sunlight intensity the significant contribution of sunlight duration to the decreasing c1 components rc1 0 532 p 0 05 in protein rich lakes indicates that solar radiation would decrease the humic like fluorescent components of cdom significantly and increase the relative content of protein like components shang et al 2019 the correlation coefficient between sunlight duration and decreasing hix in protein rich lakes slope 0 662 p 0 05 is higher than that of humic rich lakes slope 0 452 p 0 05 which illustrate the humification level tended to decrease sharply in the protein rich lakes for strong sunlight with the preferred degradation processes and the release of small molecular weight cdom mostofa et al 2009 shao and wang 2020 4 2 the influences of anthropogenic factors on dom variations in lake regions the dom in lakes is generally affected by anthropogenic factors including the land use of watersheds and human activities besides the natural conditions sobek et al 2007 xia and zhang 2011 in this study the dom absorption and fluorescent components are affected by various anthropogenic activities and land use types in different regions the percentage of land use for humic rich lakes is significantly higher than that of protein rich lakes p 0 05 the protein rich lakes are distributed in the regions with more bare land area and the c3 component is significantly related to bare land area r 0 67 p 0 05 also according to the heihe tengchong population line fig s4 the protein rich lakes are generally distributed in the northwest of the line 87 and the humic rich lakes are generally distributed in the southeast of the line 83 in the eastern regions of china increasing anthropogenic land use farmland and fertilizer usage contributes significantly to the terrestrial humic like c1 component and cdom concentration which indicate the agricultural activities as the dominant land use type to export more terrestrial humic like dom and nutrients to lakes across these regions antony et al 2017 morling et al 2017 roebuck et al 2020 sankar et al 2020 moreover our result that the construction and sewage discharge has a higher contribution to the protein like dom component across different regions indicates human activities are essential sources of importing fdom to lakes with rapid social development meng et al 2013a cohen et al 2014 liu et al 2020 human activities likely contribute both allochthonous terrestrial and autochthonous dom to all lakes for the observed tight correlation between c1 c3 and sewage wastewater discharge in all sampled lakes p 0 05 the decreasing m with increasing sewage discharge for protein rich lakes p 0 05 indicated that the dom in protein rich lakes is contributed by urbanization significantly besides the natural sunlight conditions liu et al 2020 therefore anthropogenic factors and natural factors such as land use human activities precipitation and sunlight contribute to variations for dom components between humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes comprehensively for the overall trend however the detailed seasonal variations in dom components should consider seasonal climate and hydrological conditions for different locations 4 3 the linkage between molecular composition and dom sources with the optical and molecular composition obtained in the same study the linkage between optical and molecular composition is explored the high s contained formulae chos and chons and n contained formulae chon2 and chon3 for humic rich lakes table s1 also suggest the high abundances of heteroatoms organic matter input from agricultural activities and urbanization in the effluent gonsior et al 2017 he et al 2019 meanwhile the correlations between c3 and s contained formulae n contained formulae fig 6a indicate the strong coupling between the production of newly produced autochthonous organic matter and the anthropogenic derived sources in protein rich lakes the humic like components c1 and c2 are highly correlated to formulae groups usually with higher molecular weight including black carbon like compounds polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds the protein rich lakes are characterized by high percentages of smaller molecular peptides sugars and saturated fatty acids which are possibly photo degraded products with higher biolability and strong autochthonous algal or phytoplankton activities and microbial processes stubbins and dittmar 2015 d andrilli et al 2015 the strong autochthonous signature from the molecular level in protein rich lakes is also consistent with higher bix values observed the significant negative correlation between c3 and ai p 0 05 suggests that the newly produced molecular formulas from protein like lakes tend to be more bioavailable for microbial activity in contrast the humic rich lakes contain more aromatic formulas with a higher degree of aromaticity and humification the terrestrial humic like component c2 is closed related to the percentage of black c and polyphenols fig 6b which indicates the high aromatic levels for anthropogenic input from human sewage related organic matter or vascular plant derived terrestrial organic matters jaffé et al 2014 seidel et al 2015 he et al 2019 he et al 2020b for humic rich lakes the significant correlation p 0 05 between c2 and ai hix indicates that the humic like organic matter with a high mass range was dominant in dom compositional compounds meanwhile higher percentages of o3s and o5s compounds and unsaturated aliphatic compounds in protein rich lakes demonstrated that the sewage and crop runoff or surfactant like compounds from human activities likely contributed significantly to protein like cdom in addition to the freshwater phytoplankton or algae derived autochthonous dom he et al 2019 wang et al 2019 variations of complex dom sources with severe anthropogenic input for inland lakes across china are characterized on both fluorescence and molecular levels therefore combining multiple complementary methods could provide a better perspective of dom cycling in inland water at the regional scale 4 4 implications for carbon cycling in inland waters and further considerations freshwaters are considered as an important source of greenhouse gasses ghgs li et al 2018 generally released from soils to surface waters and rapidly evaded into the atmosphere as physical gas exchange oquist et al 2009 the changes in cdom sources and compositions are related to the biogeochemical cycle and energy flow of ecosystems williams et al 2016 and are involved in the carbon budget potentially affecting ghgs emissions zhou et al 2018 emilson et al 2018 however the variations of cdom sources within regions due to the various anthropogenic and natural stressors would affect the spatiotemporal variability of aqueous carbon processing li et al 2018 in our study the carbon emissions for administrative regions of humic rich lakes are significantly higher than those of the protein rich lakes fig 7 p 0 05 which indicates that fuel carbon emissions co2 emissions for fossil fuel raw coal crude oil natural gas cement along with economic development would affect the cdom fluorescence as the fossil fuel compounds and secondary organic aerosol from terrestrial imports are detected in waters mitra et al 2017 as the humic rich lakes are generally located in the east of china 40 of the population from the seventh census of china with rapid urbanization this result indicates that humic rich lakes trends to be formed in the regions with more anthropogenic activities while protein rich lakes are located in the western regions 27 of the population from the seventh census of china with a low density of population and few human activities with extreme climate conditions based on the rda analysis of natural and anthropogenic conditions for cdom fluorescence components the rda analysis explains 69 2 of the variations the humic like cdom are positively correlated to fossil fuel gas emission and precipitation while sunlight contributes to the protein like c3 components fig 8 a the significant correlation between humic like components and fossil fuel gas emission p 0 05 indicates that the anthropogenic carbon emission is a path to import organic matter to water surface through the land atmospheric and water atmospheric exchange yu et al 2018 the humic like components are positively related to the primary and secondary industries that generally are the dominant industry structure in less developed regions with more usage of fossil fuel which demonstrates that the composition of dom could be a potential proxy to reflect the intensity of regional industry structure and levels of economic development shang et al 2021 to explore the relationships between cdom fluorescent components and the aqueous carbon cycles the datasets for doc storage annual co2 equivalents carbon burial capacity and organic carbon accumulation rate of five lake regions of china are collected from previous studies table 4 the rda analysis explains 65 1 of the variations fig 8 the humic like components are positively correlated to the organic carbon accumulation rate ocar and the ocar is previously demonstrated to be related to socio economics and temperature yu et al 2018 we suggest that dom derived from human activities is important for carbon burial in lakes stackpoole et al 2014 for instances the dom compounds with carboxylic and hydroxylic groups usually biologically recalcitrant are preferred to be adsorbed on mineral surface of particles and finally deposited in sediments kothawala et al 2012 moreover previous research showed that there was a positive relationship between the contents of recalcitrant doc and total oc in sediments schmidt et al 2009 wang et al 2021 therefore our result indicates that the humic rich lakes trend to become increasing carbon pools along with increasing anthropogenic activities and precipitation heathcote et al 2015 meanwhile the humic like component c1 or c2 is related to annual co2 equivalents indicating that humic substances with high terrestrial influence promote more heterotrophic co2 production than in lake production acting as a nutrient subsidy to suppressing primary production due to light attenuation allesson et al 2020 the highest ocar for elr and lowest ocar for tqr observed here table 4 and in a previous study zhang et al 2017 are likely caused by that the developed region of elr has gone through more soil erosion river damming and eutrophication kastowski et al 2011 while the tqr is located at high altitude with low annual temperature and has low primary productivity the significant amount of doc storage and annual co2 equivalents in tqr is likely related to the terrestrial import based on climate change ran et al 2021 therefore the carbon cycles for chinese inland waters must consider the significant regional variations observed in this study according to previous studies table 4 the sum of doc storage and carbon burial capacity for five lake regions exceed the annual co2 equivalents which may demonstrate the importance of chinese lakes for carbon sink keller et al 2021 and more accurate measurements of organic carbon sources gas emission and burial capacity are needed for better constraining the carbon cycles for both regional and global scales 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the variations of dom sources and compositions for lakes across china from large scale distribution to molecular scale analysis significant variations in optical properties and molecular composition including cdom absorption properties fluorescent parameters and molecular complexity are observed between protein rich lakes and humic rich lakes the significant spatial variation of factors influencing cdom components in different regions is mainly caused by natural conditions and anthropogenic activities however the dominant influencing factors differ across five regions and between protein like and humic rich lakes the complex molecular variations for humic rich lakes and protein rich lakes are observed and the alterations of spatial sources and molecular composition of dom in inland lakes are linked to protein like components and humic like components these spatial variations are essential to consider to better quantify the role of chinese inland waters in the global carbon cycle the combination of multiple complementary methods in this study provides a comprehensive perspective of dom cycling in inland water at the regional scale and helps predict the changes in dom sources with the increasing anthropogenic input at larger globalization scales nevertheless further studies need to explore the source specific markers and the degradation process photochemical or microbial degradation related to molecular abundances at the regional scale to better understand the dom signatures with the complex linkage of natural and anthropogenic influences declaration of competing

15757,fluctuations in the anaerobic digestion ad organic loading rate olr cause shocks to the ad microbiome which lead to unstable methane productivity managing these fluctuations requires a larger digester which is impractical for community scale applications limiting the potential of ad in advancing a circular economy to allow operation of small scale ad while managing olr fluctuations we need to tackle the issue through elucidation of the microbial community dynamics via 16s rrna gene sequencing this study elucidated the interrelation of the ad performance and the dynamics of the microbial interactions within its microbiome in response to repeated high olr shocks at different frequencies the olr shocks were equivalent to 4 times the baseline olr of 2 g vs l d we found that less frequent organic load shocks result to deterioration of methane productivity co occurrence network analysis shows that this coincides with the breakdown of the microbiome network structure this suggests loss of microbial interactions necessary in maintaining stable ad identification of species influencing the network structure revealed that a species under the genus anaerovorax has the greatest influence while orders spirochaetales and synergistales represent the greatest number of the influential species we inferred that the impact imposed by the olr shocks shifted the microbiome activity towards biochemical pathways that are not contributing to methane production establishing a small scale ad system that permits olr fluctuations would require developing an ad microbiome resilient to infrequent organic loading shocks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioinformatics biomethane microbiome network metagenome organic loading rate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction organic loading rate olr is one of the key process parameters that influence the performance of anaerobic digestion ad systems ferguson et al 2016 xu et al 2018 it is primarily dictated by the waste treatment demand which may fluctuate considerably especially in practical small scale installations jo et al 2021 t a s et al 2020 on the other hand deliberate fluctuation of the olr supports opportunities for on demand biogas generation by matching the biogas production rate with the forecasted energy demand leading to higher csommercial viability of ad operations lafratta et al 2020 however fluctuations in olr cause shocks to the ad microbiome leading to unstable operations due to resulting imbalances in the biochemical processes occurring within ad lessner 2009 wang et al 2017 handling these olr fluctuations would require a digester with a large volume and with an excessive safety factor in such a case the number of microorganisms in the digester will be more than the number required to handle the baseline olr the excess number of microorganisms could be responsible in handling any additional load brought about by the olr fluctuations this arrangement is feasible in theory although impractical especially for the small scale community digesters there is a drive to proliferate community digesters as it allows management of wastes generated domestically while also allowing generation of electricity from combustion of the biogas produced through the anerobic digestion of wastes this activates circular economy within communities however feasible application of community scale digesters would require it to have the capability of handling olr fluctuations brought about by variations in waste treatment demand and or the variations in the composition of feedstock i e considering the quantitative breakdown of the organic matter content in any given feedstock while maintaining a compact or a small scale installation a more effective approach would be to tackle the issue from the ad microbiome level through elucidation of the microbial community dynamics via 16s rrna gene sequencing and to develop a strategy to train the microbiome to enhance its capability and flexibility in handling high organic load shocks previous studies have primarily examined the changes in the microbial community composition in response to stepwise increase in olr the stepwise increase in olr aims to acclimatize the microbial community to high olr conditions de vrieze et al 2013 ferguson et al 2016 razaviarani and buchanan 2014 acclimatization of the ad microbiome has been reported to be important in proliferating microbial groups that utilize specific types of substrates even at high olr conditions without deterioration of methane productivity kang et al 2021 kurade et al 2020 xing et al 2020 while most studies focused on the microbiome response to stepwise increase in olr only few studies have examined the effect of olr fluctuations or repeated high olr shocks reports on the ad response to pulse feeding i e intermittent introduction of feed into the digester at a given frequency state that pulse feeding enhanced the functional stability of the ad microbiome as well as the methane productivity de vrieze et al 2013 kang et al 2021 however the pulse feeding conducted in previous studies did not simulate the repeated high organic load shocks that will adversely impact the microbiome stability and consequently lead to loss of methane productivity this is because the pulse feeding operations were generally conducted at normally low organic loading rates e g pulse feeding equivalent to 1 0 g cod l d de vrieze et al 2013 the operational case in which repeated high organic load shocks were simulated impacting the digester operations has still not been considered moreover a deep and quantitative investigation on the response of the microbiome to the repeated high organic load shocks has not been conducted previously to fully understand the phenomena and be able to arrive at an appropriate operational plan for ad that will be resilient against repeated high organic load shocks it is necessary to tackle the problem through more thorough holistic and quantitative means our previous studies have shown that the microbial community can change in as short a period as 3 days even with high organic loading shocks that do not inhibit ad mercado et al 2022 based on these results the ad microbiome is expected to readapt to the lower organic load after a load shock in a short period of time and then the microbiome would have to readapt again when another load shock is introduced therefore we hypothesize that applying the load shocks repeatedly at high frequency would result to the ad microbiome not being able to sufficiently readapt to the rapidly changing conditions and eventually result to deterioration of methane productivity the objective of this study is to elucidate the interrelation of the ad performance and the dynamics of the microbial interactions within the ad microbiome through co occurrence network analysis in response to repeated high organic load shocks at different frequencies 2 materials and methods 2 1 ad sludge acclimatization the ad sludge was collected from a mesophilic 37 c ad operating at the hokubu sludge treatment center located in yokohama kanagawa prefecture japan the ad sludge was acclimatized in a 36 l custom made reactor 24 l total sludge volume with dog food bitawan japan pet food co ltd and soluble starch 5 1 by wt at a final olr of 2 g volatile solids vs l d this substrate mix was selected to simulate a homogeneous food waste which is a prevalent feedstock in ad as well as easily degradable compared to the use of more hardly degradable feedstock in which the rate limiting step is typically the hydrolysis step the use of more easily degradable feedstock brings in greater complexity in maintaining the balance between various ad pathways leading to greater difficulty in handling fluctuating loads gonzalez et al 2018 uthirakrishnan et al 2021 the substrate mix used has a carbon to nitrogen c n ratio of 25 which is within the previously reported optimal range of 20 30 parkin and owen 1986 acclimatization was conducted at mesophilic conditions 37 c with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 30 d the acclimatization process was conducted for 72d prior to using the sludge as inoculum for the fed batch runs the acclimatization data is provided as supplementary data fig s3 2 2 fed batch reactors and experimental design fed batch semi continuous ad operations were simulated in 500 ml glass flask reactors hario science co ltd japan with a sludge volume of 300 ml and headspace of 84 ml the flasks were plugged with silicone plugs no 13 as one corporation japan the reactors were equipped with liquid sampling glass tubes and biogas outlet glass tubes which pass through the silicone plugs the liquid sampling tubes were connected to a butyl rubber tubing that were clipped for isolation during reactor operation to maintain anaerobic condition the biogas outlet tubes were connected to 1 l aluminum gas bags model cek 3 gl sciences inc japan via 1 meter length butyl rubber tubing the use of butyl rubber material for the tubing minimizes loss of biogas via diffusion through porous material that is often a problem with the use of silicone tubing for gas applications nine 9 reactors were initially filled with 300 ml of the acclimatized sludge control runs c 0 were conducted in 3 reactors operated at a

incubator shaker operated at 37 c and 100 rpm the high olr corresponded to 8 g vs l d while the baseline olr corresponded to 2 g vs l d the reactors were operated for a total of 42 days during which sampling and feeding were conducted once a day at the same time of the day 2 3 biogas and ad sludge analyses biogas volume collected in the aluminum gas bags were measured every day using a dry gas

performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with an uv 2075 detector jasco corporation tokyo japan and sugar sh g sh1011 column shodex tokyo japan operated at 50 c the mobile phase used was 5 0 mm h2so4 with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the hplc was calibrated with a minimum standard concentration of 0 0625 g l for each volatile acid the sludge ph was measured using laquatwin ph 22b horiba

influential species 3 results and discussion 3 1 ad performance the average daily methane production from each of the experimental runs e 2 e 4 and e 8 and the control run c 0 are presented in fig 2 the methane production from the control run c 0 was stable with an average methane production of 0 49 0 01 l ch4 l reactor d the corresponding average methane yield was 276 4 0 8 ml ch4 g vs this yield is equivalent to 57 6 0 2 of the calculated theoretical methane yield of 480 ml ch4 g vs using the bmpthatc model mohamed et al 2018 the stable and efficient conversion of substrate in the control run c 0 assures its reliability as a baseline for comparison with the experimental runs the e 2 runs in which the high olr was applied every 2 days exhibited an average methane production of 1 14 0 10 l ch4 l reactor d at the middle stage from day 11 to day 26 which further increased to an average methane production of 1 28 0 09 l ch4 l reactor d at the later stage from day 27 to day 42 that is coherent with that of the organic load applied on the other hand the e 4 runs in which the high olr was applied every 4 days showed deterioration in methane production towards the end of the run which an average methane production of 0 80 0 09 l ch4 l reactor d at the later stage of the run the e 8 runs in which the high olr was applied at the least frequency i e every 8 days showed the worst deterioration in methane production in which lower methane production compared to the other experimental runs was observed with an average methane production of 0 46 0 06 l ch4 l reactor d at the later stage its methane production continued to deteriorate and showed lower productivity even compared with the control run after day 30 this implies that lower frequency of high organic load shocks i e high olr applied every 8 days e 8 simulate a more impactful shock to the system which imposes higher stress to the ad microbiome leading to lower methane productivity this observation is in contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher frequency of applied organic load shocks leads to greater impact to the ad microbiome leading to deterioration in methane productivity as we will elaborate further in this paper there are various factors at play which ultimately lead to the observed phenomenon interestingly there was marginal accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas observed across all the runs fig 3 correspondingly the ad sludge ph across all the runs was stable throughout the experiment we speculate that the minimal accumulation of vfas despite the deterioration in methane productivity was due to the potential shift of the microbiome activity towards biochemical pathways that produce other products that are not contributing to a net methane production in ad the balance among the main pathways including hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis in crucial to maintain a stable methane production carmona cabello et al 2018 a complex substrate in ad would contain a certain mixture of carbohydrates proteins and lipids that needs to be hydrolyzed to produce sugars amino acids and long chain fatty acids lcfas these will then have to be further broken down into volatile fatty acids vfas comprising mainly of acetic acid butanoate and propanoate finally the acetate carbon dioxide and hydrogen are utilized to produce methane although methane is often the primary product being pursued for ad systems operated for biogas production certain by products that are not commonly reported with studies concerning methane fermentation may also be produced hunter et al 2021 we deem that these by products may be formed through side reactions that do not contribute to the net production of methane hence competing with the process of methane fermentation for instance carbohydrates can be converted to terpenes phenolics flavonoids and carotenoids carmona cabello et al 2018 sindhu et al 2019 sugars that do not get broken down to vfas may be converted to furans di carboxylic acids hydrocarboxylic acids and alcohols carmona cabello et al 2018 esteban and ladero 2018 sindhu et al 2019 propanoate and butanoate may also be used as chemical components to synthesize medium chain fatty acids hunter et al 2021 acetate may be transformed to glycine through a strategic energy conserving pathway performed by certain groups of bacteria zhu et al 2020 acetate carbon dioxide and hydrogen the chemical components required for methanogenic pathways may also be utilized in a methanogenesis competing sulfur reduction and iron fe iii reduction pathways forouzanmehr et al 2021 hao 2003 lovley and phillips 1987 pan et al 2021 in the experimental run e 8 despite the loss of methane productivity no vfa accumulation was observed from this we speculate that pathways that produce the previously described by products might have been activated more than the pathways leading to the production of methane we further speculate that the more impactful shock imposed to the ad microbiome at e 8 condition led to the disruption of previously stable microbial interactions necessary for activating the pathways that ultimately supports methane production 3 2 microbial community progression the microbial community progression of across the 4 runs are presented in bump charts fig 4 order bacteroidales appears to be consistently prominent across all runs indicating its potential role in maintaining the stability of ad in our previous study we found that bacteroidales dominated major ad pathways regardless of variations in the organic load applied mercado et al 2022 its prevalence and important ecological role in the ad microbiome have been also widely reported mei et al 2020 shah et al 2015 sun et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 with its broad diversity some groups within the order bacteroidales are saccharolytic while others perform proteolytic roles mei et al 2020 further breakdown of order bacteroidales into species level is provided as supplementary data fig s4 also supplementary taxonomic bar charts are provided in fig s5 1 and fig s5 2 within the dominating order bacteroidales macellibacteroides genus was initially the prominent group across all the runs this genus which has reported presence in sewage sludge was also reported for its production of acetate and succinate as primary fermentation products through the degradation of organic matter shah et al 2015 sun et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 prolixibacteraceae family started to show co prominence with macellibacteroides at the middle stage of the runs this microbial group is known for its common presence in sewage sludge and also was also reported for its role in degrading complex organic substrates wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 at the later stage of the runs rikenellaceae family showed drastic increase in prominence with the most drastic increase observed in e 8 runs rikenellaceae also commonly reported in ad microbiome is a known fermentative bacterial group that breaks down carbohydrates into propionate and succinate as main products and also has been reported for its potential role in glycerol degradation lendormi et al 2022 nakasaki et al 2020 order coriobacteriales showed increased abundance across all the runs with higher relative abundance in experimental runs i e e 2 e 4 and e 8 moreover order synergistales exhibited a relatively consistent pattern of prominence across all semi continuous flask runs in general these groups show sustained prominence in all runs despite the repeated shock loads on the other hand there are certain groups that have a characteristic change in abundance and prominence towards the later stage of the run which may explain the differences in the ad performance one of those is spirochaetales which maintained its high abundance in the runs other than e 8 also peptostreptococcales tissierellales was only present in e 8 at the later phase of the run which may indicate its contribution to the observed deterioration in methane productivity for e 8 towards the end of the run the current interpretation of the microbial community progress relies on the identification of individual microbial groups that exhibit characteristic prominence patterns however microbial groups with relatively low abundance in the community also have the possibility of having significant roles in the overall functionality of the microbiome zhao et al 2021 also given the complexities in the ad microbiome which also involves microbial interactions that ultimately impact the corresponding ad performance e g methane productivity it is necessary to also dig deeper and elucidate the dynamics of these microbial interactions this was conducted through the analysis of the changes in microbiome networks 3 3 changes in microbiome networks co occurrence analysis was conducted to assess the probability of a pair of microbial species existing together in a certain set of environmental condition this allows for a more structured approach in analyzing dynamics in microbial community by minimizing the influence of certain microbial species only appearing by chance during the experiment griffith et al 2016 although these analyses provide important insights on the interactions within microbial communities based on a statistical approach these do not directly reflect biological causality hirano and takemoto 2019 with this considered the results and interpretations presented should be approached as hypothetical statements derived from the statistical analyses the results of this analysis combined with the calculated network topology statistics were used to generate directed networks directed networks in contrast to undirected networks offers the advantage of more detailed network representation and deeper network elucidation by also considering the influence of the directionality of the interactions between species leicht and newman 2008 the changes in the microbiome networks with time for each of the runs are presented fig 5 three 3 time periods representing the early day 0 to 10 middle day 11 to 26 and later day 27 to 43 stages were selected to effectively represent the changes in the microbial networks utilizing sufficient data for statistical analysis fig s1 it was observed that the control run exhibited sustained modularity throughout the run with an average of 0 030 the modularity index at the later stage of the run did not drop relative to the rest of the networks in this study the modularity indices were taken as relative indicators in which the calculated absolute values of modularity indices for all the generated networks were contrasted with one another as the basis for the network analysis varies per study direct comparison of absolute values with other related studies would not be straightforward the observed variations in the network structure of the control throughout the run despite the constant operating conditions may be brought about by the re adaptation of the microbiome to the new environment orellana et al 2019 that is the adaptation of the microbiome in the acclimatized sludge from the 36 l acclimatization reactor to the flask reactor environment the changes may also be brought about by the stochastic effects in which the microbial community is said to have some level of inherent variation in composition or inter species interactions that is outside of what can be determined beforehand in contrast to deterministic effects zhou et al 2013 the partial break in network structure of e 2 i e the run with high olr applied every 2 days during the middle stage of the run may be explained by the adjustment of the microbiome to high total cumulative organic load and the succeeding high methane productivity henceforth among all the runs e 2 received the highest accumulated organic load given it has the highest frequency of fluctuations to high organic loading rate the initial response of the microbiome to this high organic load was directly observed in the relatively lower methane productivity of e 2 at the early stage of the run however the microbiome within the run e 2 was able to build up methane productivity from the middle stage and it was able to sustain such productivity until the end of the run given this the observed switch in productivity of e 2 from the middle stage of the run may be correlated with the observed partial break in the network structure in the middle stage of e 2 a drop in modularity was observed in e 4 i e the run with high olr applied every 4 days this was brought about by the large number of nodes exhibiting high eigenvector centrality 0 6 at the later stage of the run the nodes represent species belonging to various microbial groups with the greatest number of high eigenvector centrality species belonging to orders bacteroidales pedosphaerales spirochaetales and anaerolineales the shift in the eigenvector centrality towards the nodes in the top module i e the module with highest number of nodes suggests the possible movement of the network structure towards an imbalance in microbiome functionality these imbalanced microbial interactions may explain the drop in methane productivity for e 4 at the later stage lastly a drastic drop in modularity was observed in e 8 i e the run with high olr applied every 8 days at the later stage of the run which indicate loss of network connectivity between interacting microbial species the deterioration in the microbiome network structure in e 8 imply that less frequent organic load shocks impose a higher impact to the ad microbiome the higher impact leads to the breakdown of the microbial interactions necessary for maintaining stable ad operations which eventually lead to loss of methane productivity previous reports support the use of the network modularity as indicator of microbial community stability and robustness gilarranz et al 2017 hernández et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 the topological characteristics of microbial networks in various ecosystems has been of interest as these were found to correspond well to other microbial activity indicators or even health related effects for example the loss of network connectivity of the human skin microbiome has been linked to progression of certain skin diseases mousavi et al 2021 moreover high modularity has been linked with highly functional microbial networks in which the microbial community exhibited higher resistance against antibiotic stress zhao et al 2021 furthermore the association of the decrease in modularity with the decrease in microbial functionality has also been reported in a study elucidating the changes in the microbial co occurrence networks within the soil microbiome in which compost tannery sludge was applied to causing perturbation stress to the microbiome ishimoto et al 2021 this study provides further evidence of the correlation of the ad microbiome network structure with its performance specifically its response towards repeated organic load shocks which has been not previously reported and discussed in detail moving into further detail with the impact of the repeated organic load shock on the microbial interactions in ad it is of interest to identify the specific microbial groups that influenced the changes observed in the overall microbiome network the influential species were identified by filtering the microbial species that were consistently present in the major modules top 2 modules represented by the nodes colored magenta and blue in the network diagrams shown in fig 5 throughout the course of the proven to be stable control run c 0 and the early and middle stages of the run e 8 that were eventually broken off from the network structure at the later stage of e 8 i e the run that eventually failed and loss its methane productivity these microbial groups influence the stability of the network structure required to maintain stable ad the list of the filtered out influential species and the corresponding module and eigenvector centrality progression are presented fig 6 the species were listed in order of its initial eigenvector centrality in the control run c 0 with the one having the highest eigenvector centrality listed on top the corresponding modules to which the species belongs to and moves to through the 3 stages early middle later considered in this study are represented by the colors of the boxes connected by arrows for each run c 0 or e 8 the left most boxes represent the early phase the middle boxes represent the middle phase and the right most boxes represent the later phase the white circles inside the boxes represent the corresponding magnitude of eigenvector centrality of the particular node noting that 1 node 1 species at a given stage within the runs from this analysis we found that a species of genus anaerovorax which belongs to the order peptostreptococcales tissierellales has the greatest influence on the network structure among the rest of the species with its high eigenvector centrality at the early stage and diminished eigenvector centrality at the later stage of e 8 anaerovorax is a strictly anaerobic fermentative bacteria commonly found in ad systems che et al 2022 kong et al 2022 matthies et al 2000 this genus has been reported to be involved in protein degradation to butyrate matthies et al 2000 supaphol et al 2011 moreover spirochaetales and synergistales represent the greatest number of the identified influential species the genus thermovirga of the order synergistales has been reported to be commonly detected in ad systems and it is also a known syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob he et al 2020 shan et al 2017 the break out of these crucial species which perform important fermentative and syntrophic functions from the microbial network suggests loss of the corresponding ad functions necessary for completing the ad biochemical pathway chain towards production of methane 4 conclusions this study elucidated the interrelation of the ad performance and the dynamics of the microbial interactions within the ad microbiome in response to repeated high organic load shocks at different frequencies we found that less frequent organic load shocks impose higher impact to the microbiome this led to the breakdown of the microbiome network structure necessary to maintain stable ad performance which eventually resulted to loss of methane productivity the network structure breakdown and the corresponding loss of methane production suggest shift in microbiome activity towards production of other products that are not contributing to net methane production results from this study provide a deep and quantitative investigation of the response of the microbiome to repeated high organic load shocks which allows further development of an appropriate ad operational plan which builds the resilience of the microbiome against the adverse effects of olr fluctuations

15757,fluctuations in the anaerobic digestion ad organic loading rate olr cause shocks to the ad microbiome which lead to unstable methane productivity managing these fluctuations requires a larger digester which is impractical for community scale applications limiting the potential of ad in advancing a circular economy to allow operation of small scale ad while managing olr fluctuations we need to tackle the issue through elucidation of the microbial community dynamics via 16s rrna gene sequencing this study elucidated the interrelation of the ad performance and the dynamics of the microbial interactions within its microbiome in response to repeated high olr shocks at different frequencies the olr shocks were equivalent to 4 times the baseline olr of 2 g vs l d we found that less frequent organic load shocks result to deterioration of methane productivity co occurrence network analysis shows that this coincides with the breakdown of the microbiome network structure this suggests loss of microbial interactions necessary in maintaining stable ad identification of species influencing the network structure revealed that a species under the genus anaerovorax has the greatest influence while orders spirochaetales and synergistales represent the greatest number of the influential species we inferred that the impact imposed by the olr shocks shifted the microbiome activity towards biochemical pathways that are not contributing to methane production establishing a small scale ad system that permits olr fluctuations would require developing an ad microbiome resilient to infrequent organic loading shocks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioinformatics biomethane microbiome network metagenome organic loading rate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction organic loading rate olr is one of the key process parameters that influence the performance of anaerobic digestion ad systems ferguson et al 2016 xu et al 2018 it is primarily dictated by the waste treatment demand which may fluctuate considerably especially in practical small scale installations jo et al 2021 t a s et al 2020 on the other hand deliberate fluctuation of the olr supports opportunities for on demand biogas generation by matching the biogas production rate with the forecasted energy demand leading to higher csommercial viability of ad operations lafratta et al 2020 however fluctuations in olr cause shocks to the ad microbiome leading to unstable operations due to resulting imbalances in the biochemical processes occurring within ad lessner 2009 wang et al 2017 handling these olr fluctuations would require a digester with a large volume and with an excessive safety factor in such a case the number of microorganisms in the digester will be more than the number required to handle the baseline olr the excess number of microorganisms could be responsible in handling any additional load brought about by the olr fluctuations this arrangement is feasible in theory although impractical especially for the small scale community digesters there is a drive to proliferate community digesters as it allows management of wastes generated domestically while also allowing generation of electricity from combustion of the biogas produced through the anerobic digestion of wastes this activates circular economy within communities however feasible application of community scale digesters would require it to have the capability of handling olr fluctuations brought about by variations in waste treatment demand and or the variations in the composition of feedstock i e considering the quantitative breakdown of the organic matter content in any given feedstock while maintaining a compact or a small scale installation a more effective approach would be to tackle the issue from the ad microbiome level through elucidation of the microbial community dynamics via 16s rrna gene sequencing and to develop a strategy to train the microbiome to enhance its capability and flexibility in handling high organic load shocks previous studies have primarily examined the changes in the microbial community composition in response to stepwise increase in olr the stepwise increase in olr aims to acclimatize the microbial community to high olr conditions de vrieze et al 2013 ferguson et al 2016 razaviarani and buchanan 2014 acclimatization of the ad microbiome has been reported to be important in proliferating microbial groups that utilize specific types of substrates even at high olr conditions without deterioration of methane productivity kang et al 2021 kurade et al 2020 xing et al 2020 while most studies focused on the microbiome response to stepwise increase in olr only few studies have examined the effect of olr fluctuations or repeated high olr shocks reports on the ad response to pulse feeding i e intermittent introduction of feed into the digester at a given frequency state that pulse feeding enhanced the functional stability of the ad microbiome as well as the methane productivity de vrieze et al 2013 kang et al 2021 however the pulse feeding conducted in previous studies did not simulate the repeated high organic load shocks that will adversely impact the microbiome stability and consequently lead to loss of methane productivity this is because the pulse feeding operations were generally conducted at normally low organic loading rates e g pulse feeding equivalent to 1 0 g cod l d de vrieze et al 2013 the operational case in which repeated high organic load shocks were simulated impacting the digester operations has still not been considered moreover a deep and quantitative investigation on the response of the microbiome to the repeated high organic load shocks has not been conducted previously to fully understand the phenomena and be able to arrive at an appropriate operational plan for ad that will be resilient against repeated high organic load shocks it is necessary to tackle the problem through more thorough holistic and quantitative means our previous studies have shown that the microbial community can change in as short a period as 3 days even with high organic loading shocks that do not inhibit ad mercado et al 2022 based on these results the ad microbiome is expected to readapt to the lower organic load after a load shock in a short period of time and then the microbiome would have to readapt again when another load shock is introduced therefore we hypothesize that applying the load shocks repeatedly at high frequency would result to the ad microbiome not being able to sufficiently readapt to the rapidly changing conditions and eventually result to deterioration of methane productivity the objective of this study is to elucidate the interrelation of the ad performance and the dynamics of the microbial interactions within the ad microbiome through co occurrence network analysis in response to repeated high organic load shocks at different frequencies 2 materials and methods 2 1 ad sludge acclimatization the ad sludge was collected from a mesophilic 37 c ad operating at the hokubu sludge treatment center located in yokohama kanagawa prefecture japan the ad sludge was acclimatized in a 36 l custom made reactor 24 l total sludge volume with dog food bitawan japan pet food co ltd and soluble starch 5 1 by wt at a final olr of 2 g volatile solids vs l d this substrate mix was selected to simulate a homogeneous food waste which is a prevalent feedstock in ad as well as easily degradable compared to the use of more hardly degradable feedstock in which the rate limiting step is typically the hydrolysis step the use of more easily degradable feedstock brings in greater complexity in maintaining the balance between various ad pathways leading to greater difficulty in handling fluctuating loads gonzalez et al 2018 uthirakrishnan et al 2021 the substrate mix used has a carbon to nitrogen c n ratio of 25 which is within the previously reported optimal range of 20 30 parkin and owen 1986 acclimatization was conducted at mesophilic conditions 37 c with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 30 d the acclimatization process was conducted for 72d prior to using the sludge as inoculum for the fed batch runs the acclimatization data is provided as supplementary data fig s3 2 2 fed batch reactors and experimental design fed batch semi continuous ad operations were simulated in 500 ml glass flask reactors hario science co ltd japan with a sludge volume of 300 ml and headspace of 84 ml the flasks were plugged

tubes were connected to a butyl rubber tubing that were clipped for isolation during reactor operation to maintain anaerobic condition the biogas outlet tubes were connected to 1 l aluminum gas bags model cek 3 gl sciences inc japan via 1 meter length butyl rubber tubing the use of butyl rubber material for the tubing minimizes loss of biogas via diffusion through porous material that is often a problem with the use of silicone tubing for gas applications nine 9 reactors were initially filled with 300 ml of the acclimatized sludge control runs c 0 were conducted in 3 reactors operated at a

incubator shaker operated at 37 c and 100 rpm the high olr corresponded to 8 g vs l d while the baseline olr corresponded to 2 g vs l d the reactors were operated for a total of 42 days during which sampling and feeding were conducted once a day at the same time of the day 2 3 biogas and ad sludge analyses biogas volume collected in the aluminum gas bags were measured every day using a dry gas

performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with an uv 2075 detector jasco corporation tokyo japan and sugar sh g sh1011 column shodex tokyo japan operated at 50 c the mobile phase used was 5 0 mm h2so4 with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the hplc was calibrated with a minimum standard concentration of 0 0625 g l for each volatile acid the sludge ph was measured using laquatwin ph 22b horiba

influential species 3 results and discussion 3 1 ad performance the average daily methane production from each of the experimental runs e 2 e 4 and e 8 and the control run c 0 are presented in fig 2 the methane production from the control run c 0 was stable with an average methane production of 0 49 0 01 l ch4 l reactor d the corresponding average methane yield was 276 4 0 8 ml ch4 g vs this yield is equivalent to 57 6 0 2 of the calculated theoretical methane yield of 480 ml ch4 g vs using the bmpthatc model mohamed et al 2018 the stable and efficient conversion of substrate in the control run c 0 assures its reliability as a baseline for comparison with the experimental runs the e 2 runs in which the high olr was applied every 2 days exhibited an average methane production of 1 14 0 10 l ch4 l reactor d at the middle stage from day 11 to day 26 which further increased to an average methane production of 1 28 0 09 l ch4 l reactor d at the later stage from day 27 to day 42 that is coherent with that of the organic load applied on the other hand the e 4 runs in which the high olr was applied every 4 days showed deterioration in methane production towards the end of the run which an average methane production of 0 80 0 09 l ch4 l reactor d at the later stage of the run the e 8 runs in which the high olr was applied at the least frequency i e every 8 days showed the worst deterioration in methane production in which lower methane production compared to the other experimental runs was observed with an average methane production of 0 46 0 06 l ch4 l reactor d at the later stage its methane production continued to deteriorate and showed lower productivity even compared with the control run after day 30 this implies that lower frequency of high organic load shocks i e high olr applied every 8 days e 8 simulate a more impactful shock to the system which imposes higher stress to the ad microbiome leading to lower methane productivity this observation is in contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher frequency of applied organic load shocks leads to greater impact to the ad microbiome leading to deterioration in methane productivity as we will elaborate further in this paper there are various factors at play which ultimately lead to the observed phenomenon interestingly there was marginal accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas observed across all the runs fig 3 correspondingly the ad sludge ph across all the runs was stable throughout the experiment we speculate that the minimal accumulation of vfas despite the deterioration in methane productivity was due to the potential shift of the microbiome activity towards biochemical pathways that produce other products that are not contributing to a net methane production in ad the balance among the main pathways including hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis in crucial to maintain a stable methane production carmona cabello et al 2018 a complex substrate in ad would contain a certain mixture of carbohydrates proteins and lipids that needs to be hydrolyzed to produce sugars amino acids and long chain fatty acids lcfas these will then have to be further broken down into volatile fatty acids vfas comprising mainly of acetic acid butanoate and propanoate finally the acetate carbon dioxide and hydrogen are utilized to produce methane although methane is often the primary product being pursued for ad systems operated for biogas production certain by products that are not commonly reported with studies concerning methane fermentation may also be produced hunter et al 2021 we deem that these by products may be formed through side reactions that do not contribute to the net production of methane hence competing with the process of methane fermentation for instance carbohydrates can be converted to terpenes phenolics flavonoids and carotenoids carmona cabello et al 2018 sindhu et al 2019 sugars that do not get broken down to vfas may be converted to furans di carboxylic acids hydrocarboxylic acids and alcohols carmona cabello et al 2018 esteban and ladero 2018 sindhu et al 2019 propanoate and butanoate may also be used as chemical components to synthesize medium chain fatty acids hunter et al 2021 acetate may be transformed to glycine through a strategic energy conserving pathway performed by certain groups of bacteria zhu et al 2020 acetate carbon dioxide and hydrogen the chemical components required for methanogenic pathways may also be utilized in a methanogenesis competing sulfur reduction and iron fe iii reduction pathways forouzanmehr et al 2021 hao 2003 lovley and phillips 1987 pan et al 2021 in the experimental run e 8 despite the loss of methane productivity no vfa accumulation was observed from this we speculate that pathways that produce the previously described by products might have been activated more than the pathways leading to the production of methane we further speculate that the more impactful shock imposed to the ad microbiome at e 8 condition led to the disruption of previously stable microbial interactions necessary for activating the pathways that ultimately supports methane production 3 2 microbial community progression the microbial community progression of across the 4 runs are presented in bump charts fig 4 order bacteroidales appears to be consistently prominent across all runs indicating its potential role in maintaining the stability of ad in our previous study we found that bacteroidales dominated major ad pathways regardless of variations in the organic load applied mercado et al 2022 its prevalence and important ecological role in the ad microbiome have been also widely reported mei et al 2020 shah et al 2015 sun et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 with its broad diversity some groups within the order bacteroidales are saccharolytic while others perform proteolytic roles mei et al 2020 further breakdown of order bacteroidales into species level is provided as supplementary data fig s4 also supplementary taxonomic bar charts are provided in fig s5 1 and fig s5 2 within the dominating order bacteroidales macellibacteroides genus was initially the prominent group across all the runs this genus which has reported presence in sewage sludge was also reported for its production of acetate and succinate as primary fermentation products through the degradation of organic matter shah et al 2015 sun et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 prolixibacteraceae family started to show co prominence with macellibacteroides at the middle stage of the runs this microbial group is known for its common presence in sewage sludge and also was also reported for its role in degrading complex organic substrates wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 at the later stage of the runs rikenellaceae family showed drastic increase in prominence with the most drastic increase observed in e 8 runs rikenellaceae also commonly reported in ad microbiome is a known fermentative bacterial group that breaks down carbohydrates into propionate and succinate as main products and also has been reported for its potential role in glycerol degradation lendormi et al 2022 nakasaki et al 2020 order coriobacteriales showed increased abundance across all the runs with higher relative abundance in experimental runs i e e 2 e 4 and e 8 moreover order synergistales exhibited a relatively consistent pattern of prominence across all semi continuous flask runs in general these groups show sustained prominence in all runs despite the repeated shock loads on the other hand there are certain groups that have a characteristic change in abundance and prominence towards the later stage of the run which may explain the differences in the ad performance one of those is spirochaetales which maintained its high abundance in the runs other than e 8 also peptostreptococcales tissierellales was only present in e 8 at the later phase of the run which may indicate its contribution to the observed deterioration in methane productivity for e 8 towards the end of the run the current interpretation of the microbial community progress relies on the identification of individual microbial groups that exhibit characteristic prominence patterns however microbial groups with relatively low abundance in the community also have the possibility of having significant roles in the overall functionality of the microbiome zhao et al 2021 also given the complexities in the ad microbiome which also involves microbial interactions that ultimately impact the corresponding ad performance e g methane productivity it is necessary to also dig deeper and elucidate the dynamics of these microbial interactions this was conducted through the analysis of the changes in microbiome networks 3 3 changes in microbiome networks co occurrence analysis was conducted to assess the probability of a pair of microbial species existing together in a certain set of environmental condition this allows for a more structured approach in analyzing dynamics in microbial community by minimizing the influence of certain microbial species only appearing by chance during the experiment griffith et al 2016 although these analyses provide important insights on the interactions within microbial communities based on a statistical approach these do not directly reflect biological causality hirano and takemoto 2019 with this considered the results and interpretations presented should be approached as hypothetical statements derived from the statistical analyses the results of this analysis combined with the calculated network topology statistics were used to generate directed networks directed networks in contrast to undirected networks offers the advantage of more detailed network representation and deeper network elucidation by also considering the influence of the directionality of the interactions between species leicht and newman 2008 the changes in the microbiome networks with time for each of the runs are presented fig 5 three 3 time periods representing the early day 0 to 10 middle day 11 to 26 and later day 27 to 43 stages were selected to effectively represent the changes in the microbial networks utilizing sufficient data for statistical analysis fig s1 it was observed that the control run exhibited sustained modularity throughout the run with an average of 0 030 the modularity index at the later stage of the run did not drop relative to the rest of the networks in this study the modularity indices were taken as relative indicators in which the calculated absolute values of modularity indices for all the generated networks were contrasted with one another as the basis for the network analysis varies per study direct comparison of absolute values with other related studies would not be straightforward the observed variations in the network structure of the control throughout the run despite the constant operating conditions may be brought about by the re adaptation of the microbiome to the new environment orellana et al 2019 that is the adaptation of the microbiome in the acclimatized sludge from the 36 l acclimatization reactor to the flask reactor environment the changes may also be brought about by the stochastic effects in which the microbial community is said to have some level of inherent variation in composition or inter species interactions that is outside of what can be determined beforehand in contrast to deterministic effects zhou et al 2013 the partial break in network structure of e 2 i e the run with high olr applied every 2 days during the middle stage of the run may be explained by the adjustment of the microbiome to high total cumulative organic load and the succeeding high methane productivity henceforth among all the runs e 2 received the highest accumulated organic load given it has the highest frequency of fluctuations to high organic loading rate the initial response of the microbiome to this high organic load was directly observed in the relatively lower methane productivity of e 2 at the early stage of the run however the microbiome within the run e 2 was able to build up methane productivity from the middle stage and it was able to sustain such productivity until the end of the run given this the observed switch in productivity of e 2 from the middle stage of the run may be correlated with the observed partial break in the network structure in the middle stage of e 2 a drop in modularity was observed in e 4 i e the run with high olr applied every 4 days this was brought about by the large number of nodes exhibiting high eigenvector centrality 0 6 at the later stage of the run the nodes represent species belonging to various microbial groups with the greatest number of high eigenvector centrality species belonging to orders bacteroidales pedosphaerales spirochaetales and anaerolineales the shift in the eigenvector centrality towards the nodes in the top module i e the module with highest number of nodes suggests the possible movement of the network structure towards an imbalance in microbiome functionality these imbalanced microbial interactions may explain the drop in methane productivity for e 4 at the later stage lastly a drastic drop in modularity was observed in e 8 i e the run with high olr applied every 8 days at the later stage of the run which indicate loss of network connectivity between interacting microbial species the deterioration in the microbiome network structure in e 8 imply that less frequent organic load shocks impose a higher impact to the ad microbiome the higher impact leads to the breakdown of the microbial interactions necessary for maintaining stable ad operations which eventually lead to loss of methane productivity previous reports support the use of the network modularity as indicator of microbial community stability and robustness gilarranz et al 2017 hernández et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 the topological characteristics of microbial networks in various ecosystems has been of interest as these were found to correspond well to other microbial activity indicators or even health related effects for example the loss of network connectivity of the human skin microbiome has been linked to progression of certain skin diseases mousavi et al 2021 moreover high modularity has been linked with highly functional microbial networks in which the microbial community exhibited higher resistance against antibiotic stress zhao et al 2021 furthermore the association of the decrease in modularity with the decrease in microbial functionality has also been reported in a study elucidating the changes in the microbial co occurrence networks within the soil microbiome in which compost tannery sludge was applied to causing perturbation stress to the microbiome ishimoto et al 2021 this study provides further evidence of the correlation of the ad microbiome network structure with its performance specifically its response towards repeated organic load shocks which has been not previously reported and discussed in detail moving into further detail with the impact of the repeated organic load shock on the microbial interactions in ad it is of interest to identify the specific microbial groups that influenced the changes observed in the overall microbiome network the influential species were identified by filtering the microbial species that were consistently present in the major modules top 2 modules represented by the nodes colored magenta and blue in the network diagrams shown in fig 5 throughout the course of the proven to be stable control run c 0 and the early and middle stages of the run e 8 that were eventually broken off from the network structure at the later stage of e 8 i e the run that eventually failed and loss its methane productivity these microbial groups influence the stability of the network structure required to maintain stable ad the list of the filtered out influential species and the corresponding module and eigenvector centrality progression are presented fig 6 the species were listed in order of its initial eigenvector centrality in the control run c 0 with the one having the highest eigenvector centrality listed on top the corresponding modules to which the species belongs to and moves to through the 3 stages early middle later considered in this study are represented by the colors of the boxes connected by arrows for each run c 0 or e 8 the left most boxes represent the early phase the middle boxes represent the middle phase and the right most boxes represent the later phase the white circles inside the boxes represent the corresponding magnitude of eigenvector centrality of the particular node noting that 1 node 1 species at a given stage within the runs from this analysis we found that a species of genus anaerovorax which belongs to the order peptostreptococcales tissierellales has the greatest influence on the network structure among the rest of the species with its high eigenvector centrality at the early stage and diminished eigenvector centrality at the later stage of e 8 anaerovorax is a strictly anaerobic fermentative bacteria commonly found in ad systems che et al 2022 kong et al 2022 matthies et al 2000 this genus has been reported to be involved in protein degradation to butyrate matthies et al 2000 supaphol et al 2011 moreover spirochaetales and synergistales represent the greatest number of the identified influential species the genus thermovirga of the order synergistales has been reported to be commonly detected in ad systems and it is also a known syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob he et al 2020 shan et al 2017 the break out of these crucial species which perform important fermentative and syntrophic functions from the microbial network suggests loss of the corresponding ad functions necessary for completing the ad biochemical pathway chain towards production of methane 4 conclusions this study elucidated the interrelation of the ad performance and the dynamics of the microbial interactions within the ad microbiome in response to repeated high organic load shocks at different frequencies we found that less frequent organic load shocks impose higher impact to the microbiome this led to the breakdown of the microbiome network structure necessary to maintain stable ad performance which eventually resulted to loss of methane productivity the network structure breakdown and the corresponding loss of methane production suggest shift in microbiome activity towards production of other products that are not contributing to net methane production results from this study provide a deep and quantitative investigation of the response of the microbiome to repeated high organic load shocks which allows further development of an appropriate ad operational plan which builds the resilience of the microbiome against the adverse effects of olr fluctuations

15758,s iv based advanced oxidation process has been applied for contaminants remediation however as a traditional source of sulfite so3 2 na2so3 is extremely soluble in water resulting in a high concentration of so3 2 to quench the generated reactive oxygen species ros in this work caso3 was introduced instead of na2so3 for its slow released so3 2 ability and fe iii caso3 system was established for the removal of trichloroethylene tce and other organic contaminants the degradation efficiency of tce reached 94 0 and tce could be completely dechlorinated and mineralized while the removal of other contaminants was all over 85 0 at the optimal tested conditions through epr detection ros scavenging and probe tests and quantification of ros amounts it was concluded that the dominant ros in fe iii caso3 system were so4 and 1o2 of which the transformation mechanism of so4 to 1o2 was revealed and demonstrated comprehensively the synergistic contaminants degradation performance in different sulfur iron containing systems and in the presence of oxidants was evaluated the effects of various solution conditions were assessed and fe iii caso3 system was of higher resistance on complex solution matrixes suggesting the broad spectrum and application perspective for the remediation of complex contaminants in actual water keywords calcium sulfite singlet oxygen removal mechanisms broad spectrum reactivity groundwater remediation 1 introduction as the efficient and eco friendly technology advanced oxidation processes aops have been paid close attention for contaminants removal in which hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxodisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms are extensively applied as fenton or fenton like oxidants barb et al 1949 pignatello et al 2006 simultaneously the above oxidants need to be further activated through thermal ultrasonic or transition metal activation to generate reactive oxygen species ros of which ho e0 2 7 v and so4 e0 2 6 v have been widely recognized as powerful ros responsible for contaminants degradation kusic et al 2011 compared to other activation methods transition metal activation has the advantages of no external light or heat source requirement mild reaction conditions and rapid oxidation for the removal of contaminants at natural environment yang et al 2020 nevertheless some drawbacks still restrict the practical applications of aops such as 1 iron sludge aggregation and precipitation 2 narrow applicable ph range and 3 high cost of oxidants fu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhang and zhou 2019 several attempts have been employed successfully to avoid the above issues for instance traditional fe ii is replaced by some slow released iron sources such as nano zero valent iron nzvi and ferrous sulfide fes du et al 2016 song et al 2019 meanwhile some researchers have synthesized the sulfidized nanoscale zero valent iron s nzvi which possesses high reaction property than nzvi and fe ii and has been applied for groundwater remediation xu et al 2019 2021 besides some chelating agents and reductants are involved in the process of fe ii regeneration huang et al 2021 xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021a moreover to our delight some non radical degradation pathways have been investigated which were of low ph dependence and featured a wide ph range of application li et al 2022 however the high cost of oxidants is inevitable recently s iv aops are regarded as substitutions for traditional aops based on peroxides h2o2 pds and pms as far as we know sulfite ion so3 2 could also react with some metal ions to generate ho and so4 through a series of complex radical chain reactions table 1 on the one hand as the source and precursor of so4 the costs of persulfates 2056 per ton for pds and 852 per ton for pms are higher than that of sulfite 434 per ton for sodium sulfite and the persulfates will tend to generate more by products as well on the other hand the median lethal dose ld50 of sodium sulfite na2so3 is 3560 mg kg 1 while the values for h2o2 pds and pms are only about 376 802 and 673 mg kg 1 respectively which indicate the low toxicity and feasibility of s iv aops rao et al 2021b zhou et al 2018 sun et al chose fe vi na2so3 system to remove n n diethyl 3 toluamide and gained 78 removal in 10 s sun et al 2018 besides guo et al found that more than 90 of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol removal achieved in fe iii na2so3 system in the presence of ultraviolet guo et al 2013 although the low cost and low toxicity of na2so3 make it possible to be a substitute for peroxides the requirement of na2so3 dosage in different aops is hard to determine at a low concentration level the amount of ros generated from so3 2 is insufficient to degrade the targets and on the contrary the high dosage of so3 2 will consume the ros produced in s iv aops through a series of chain reactions eqs 1 2 in table 1 rao et al 2021a shao et al 2019 as the product of flue gas desulfurization process calcium sulfite caso3 is cheap and readily available thus the application of caso3 is in accord with the concept of resource utilization and green reuse notably the solubility of na2so3 reaches up to 30 7 g 100 g h2o 25 c while the value in caso3 is only 0 007 g 100 g h2o which reveals the potential of caso3 to be so3 2 source through sustained release in solution and continuous generation of ros li et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 up to now the major radicals induced in s iv aops are ho and so4 but the researches on other non radical species are rare and their contributions are always ignored li et al 2016 singlet oxygen 1o2 has been reported as a highly selective oxidation species especially when pms is applied as the oxidant li et al 2022 liu et al 2019 peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2015 however the contribution of 1o2 in s iv aops is still unclear and the generation mechanism of 1o2 via chain reactions has not been clearly elucidated yet accordingly in this research trichloroethylene tce a representative of chlorinated hydrocarbons in contaminated groundwater and soil and other organic contaminants are selected as the targets to explore their degradation performance in different s iv aops systems namely fe iii caso3 and fe iii na2so3 systems this study is 1 to compare the degradation performance and kinetics of tce in fe iii caso3 and fe iii na2so3 systems so as to clarify the superiority of caso3 2 to demonstrate the contributions and transformation mechanisms of iron and sulfur species 3 to identify the major ros responsible for tce degradation and quantify their concentrations and contributions to tce removal in fe iii caso3 system 4 to evaluate the dechlorination mineralization and to propose degradation pathways of tce 5 to assess the influences of complex solution matrixes on tce degradation 6 to reveal the synergistic removal performance of sulfur iron containing substances 7 to evaluate the broad spectrum reactivity of fe iii caso3 system for other organic contaminants degradation and 8 to explore the synergistic effect in the presence of oxidants h2o2 fe iii caso3 pds fe iii caso3 and pms fe iii caso3 systems 2

from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china calcium sulfite caso3 90 0 and sodium sulfite anhydrous na2so3 98 0 were obtained from macklin reagent co ltd shanghai china all the reagents were used without purification the detailed information of reagents was provided in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures tce stock solution 1 5 mm was prepared in water in a 100 ml volumetric flask and stirred for 12 h firstly 25 ml tce was taken out from the stock solution and added into a 250 ml sealed reactor initial tce concentration was 0 15 mm in the reactor with almost no headspace except two outlets for dosing and sampling after that the pre determined mass of fe2 so4 3 and caso3 were simultaneously poured into the reactor to start the reaction the stirring speed and the reaction temperature were controlled at 600 r min and 20 0 5 c respectively in the synergistic tests with oxidants h2o2 pds pms etc the oxidants fe2 so4 3 and caso3 were added simultaneously to start the reaction at the desired time 1 0 ml sample was taken out and mixed with 1 0 ml n hexane immediately then the mixture was vibrated for 5 min and stood still for another 5 min before being extracted in a vial for analysis when in the presence of surfactants 0 2 ml sample was taken out and mixed with 2 8 ml n hexane if needed ions anions and cations scavengers or surfactants were added before fe2 so4 3 and caso3 to explore their influences on contaminant degradation a modified dtnb method was applied to measure the concentration of so3 2 dong et al 2019a in brief after filtration 1 0 ml sample was mixed with 2 0 ml dtnb 1 0 mm 1 0 ml edta 1 0 mm and 5 0 ml phosphatic buffer 40 mm ph 7 then stood still for 5 min before analysis to detect the dechlorination of tce 5 0 ml sample was taken out and mixed with 1 0 ml methanol then stood still for 12 h before analysis as for toc measurement at least 10 ml sample was taken out and injected into a toc vial immediately for analysis the initial ph of solution was measured before the addition of fe2 so4 3 and caso3 naoh 1 0 mm or h2so4 1 0 mm was used for ph adjustment when needed and all the initial ph was unadjusted if not specified 2 3 analytical methods gas chromatography gc was applied to analyze the concentration of tce the temperatures of the oven injector and detector were set at 100 c 220 c and 240 c respectively the generation of ho and so4 were determined by ba and formaldehyde hcho methods xue et al 2019a yang et al 2015 1o2 concentration was analyzed by a dpbf method zhou et al 2021c the concentrations of fe ii so3 2 hso5 and dpbf were measured by a uv spectrophotometer at the wavelengths of 512 412 352 and 410 nm respectively electron paramagnetic resonance epr was employed for ros detection the details of the above analytical methods could be obtained in text s2 and table s1 all the equations involved in this article were listed in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of tce degradation in different s iv aops systems the degradation performance of tce in different s iv aops systems was investigated parameter values under various experimental conditions were listed in table s2 tce initial concentration was set as 0 15 mm and the concentrations of fe iii na2so3 and caso3 were 0 30 1 5 and 1 5 mm respectively as shown in fig 1 a tce losses in the control group and adsorption group were less than 9 7 in 3 h in fe iii na2so3 system tce removal displayed two phases a rapid stage in the first 2 min and a subsequent slow stage in the rest of time and finally only 42 1 tce removal was achieved to our pleasure compared with na2so3 the presence of caso3 greatly enhanced tce removal the reaction proceeded continuously in 3 h and the degradation of tce could reach 94 0 in fe iii caso3 system meanwhile the pattern of tce degradation in different conditions followed a pseudo second order kinetic model and the calculated rate constant kobs in fe iii caso3 system reached 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 which was much higher than that in fe iii na2so3 system 0 0432 mm 1 min 1 indicating the better tce removal performance by caso3 against na2so3 fig 1 b and table s3 subsequently the effect of reagent dosages on tce degradation was investigated fig s1 first the dosage of caso3 was fixed to 1 5 mm and as fe iii dosage was elevated from 0 15 mm to 0 30 mm tce removal promoted from 79 2 to 94 0 fig s1 a when the dosage was further increased to 0 75 mm and 1 5 mm the degradation of tce dropped to 55 6 and 39 3 respectively which resulted from the fact that excessive fe iii or generated fe ii would compete for ros with the target contaminant zhang et al 2015 when fe iii dosage was set as 0 30 mm tce removal increased from 64 6 to 76 3 and 94 0 with caso3 dosage increased from 0 3 mm to 0 75 mm and 1 50 mm fig s1 b the performance of tce degradation decreased to 84 9 when the caso3 dosage was increased to 2 25 mm this result could be elucidated through the reactions in table 1 eqs 1 2 owing to the scavenge function of excessive so3 2 for ros fig s1 c the dosing mode of reagents was of great significance in actual groundwater remediation therefore fe iii or caso3 was added in triple dosing mode and their total concentrations were consistent with the single dosing mode generally the contaminant removal in multiple dosing mode was superior to the single dosing mode in aops dong et al 2020b xue et al 2019b however as illustrated in fig s2 although the process was of slight difference the performance of tce degradation and kobs were basically the same in 3 h no matter how the dosing modes were the above phenomenon demonstrated that caso3 could sustainedly release so3 2 in solution and continuously generate ros for tce removal ensuring the reaction long lasting nevertheless in fe iii na2so3 system only when na2so3 was added in multiple dosing mode could tce removal be improved which was inconvenient in actual groundwater remediation fig s1 d 3 2 contribution and transformation mechanisms of iron and sulfur species it has been reported that the in situ generated fe ii has an extraordinary promoting effect on fe iii sulfite system zhou et al 2014 fe iii could react with so3 2 and then the formed feso3 complex decomposed to fe ii through eqs 3 4 in table 1 the generation of fe ii followed the trend of increase in the first 5 min then gradually decline to almost zero fig s3 a the maximum of fe ii produced in fe iii caso3 system was about 31 5 μm while the fe ii formed in fe iii na2so3 system was only 5 8 μm which was in accordance with the performance of tce removal indicating the crucial role of in situ generated fe ii in the systems ros generation was mainly attributed to a series of radical chain reactions and the reaction between the in situ generated fe ii and hso5 eq 6 caso3 could sustainedly release so3 2 in solution this moderate concentration of so3 2 could not only continuously produce the in situ fe ii but also act as the reductant for fe ii regeneration while in the presence of the same mole of na2so3 the excessive amount of so3 2 had more tendency to quench the in situ generated so4 and fe ii rather than to regenerate fe ii rao et al 2021a shao et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 therefore fe iii caso3 system showed a promoted fe ii generation than fe iii na2so3 system the key role of fe ii was further proved in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline monohydrate o phen or 2 2 bipyridine bpy in fe iii caso3 system to verify their inhibition on tce degradation both o phen and bpy could combine with fe ii to form stable complexes ali et al 2021 dong et al 2020b as displayed in fig s3 b and fig s3 c with the addition of 0 3 mm and 1 5 mm bpy tce removal was inhibited from 94 0 to 56 8 and 9 4 kobs from 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 to 0 0675 and 0 0039 mm 1 min 1 respectively and in the presence of o phen the inhibition of tce removal was 31 1 from 94 0 to 62 9 and 77 4 from 94 0 to 16 6 and kobs decreased to 0 1301 and 0 0338 mm 1 min 1 revealing the significance of fe ii generation therefore tce removal in fe ii caso3 system was conducted likewise and the results elucidated that fe ii had the ability to directly activate caso3 at the different molar ratio which proved the pivotal role of fe ii once more fig s3 d the concentration of so3 2 was measured in both fe iii caso3 and fe iii na2so3 systems in the solo na2so3 group so3 2 concentration was immediately increased to 1 50 mm and then dropped slowly in 3 h due to the oxidation of dissolved oxygen do to form so4 2 whereas so3 2 in the solo caso3 group was increased slowly and continually in the first 1 h and reached to around 0 80 mm fig s4 during tce degradation the consumption of so3 2 in fe iii na2so3 system was of extreme speediness and the residual so3 2 maintained at a low level after 15 min fig 2 on the one hand the high concentration of so3 2 would consume do in the involvement of the chain reactions for ros and on the other hand excessive so3 2 played the role as the ros scavenger thus the low tce removal occurred eq 13 what inspired us was that so3 2 in fe iii caso3 system was firstly increased and then decreased softly via the precipitation dissolution equilibrium eq 5 as a result of which the effect of tce removal was more excellent rao et al 2021a meanwhile hso5 generation in the two systems was observed fig s5 a in fe iii na2so3 system the amount of the generated hso5 was around 2 0 μm and then soon exhausted by fe ii to form various ros eq 6 however the generation of hso5 in fe iii caso3 system initially raised to 3 3 μm and then consumed in 15 min while after 30 min the amount of hso5 increased again and finally maintained at around 1 0 μm resulting from 1 the sustained release of so3 2 by caso3 and 2 the exhausted fe ii responsible for hso5 activation as shown in fig s5 b after the reaction s species in na2so3 could be all transformed to so4 2 while s species in caso3 were firstly transformed to so4 2 and then formed caso4 precipitation through eq 7 which would not increase the salinity of soil and groundwater so4 2 calculated so4 2 measured so4 2 fe2 so4 3 3 3 mechanism of fe iii caso3 system for tce removal 3 3 1 ros involved in fe iii caso3 system according to the previous researches ho so4 o2 and even 1o2 were observed in aops for contaminant degradation to determine the contributions of different ros tert butyl alcohol tba was selected for ho scavenging ktba ho 5 2 108 m 1 s 1 ktba so4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 and isopropanol ipa was introduced for ho and so4 quenching owing to its high reactivity for both ho kipa ho 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 kipa so4 8 2 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 gu et al 2018 liu et al 2022 yuan et al 2014 besides chloroform cf can act as the scavenger for o2 ko2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 and furfuryl alcohol ffa has high reaction rate constants k for both ho and 1o2 with the k values of 1 5 1010 and 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 respectively teel and watts 2002 zhang et al 2020 as exhibited in fig 3 a the presence of 50 mm cf had a negligible impact on tce removal from 94 0 to 88 4 demonstrating that o2 was not the dominant ros in fe iii caso3 system the inhibition of 100 mm tba was not likewise obvious and the degradation of tce decreased to 83 6 in 180 min different phenomenon occurred that tce removal was almost completely inhibited from 94 0 to 14 3 with the addition of 100 mm ipa which indicated that so4 generated from radical chain reactions had significant contribution to tce degradation moreover combined the inhibition of tba from 94 0 to 83 6 with ffa from 94 0 to 14 5 it could be deduced that 1o2 played a crucial role in the remediation of tce as well which had never been reported yet in s iv aops meanwhile kobs of tce degradation under different conditions were 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 without scavenger r2 0 9969 0 0149 mm 1 min 1 100 mm ipa r2 0 9570 0 3097 mm 1 min 1 100 mm tba r2 0 9808 0 5417 mm 1 min 1 50 mm cf r2 0 9969 and 0 0213 mm 1 min 1 10 mm ffa r2 0 9956 respectively further epr tests were applied to intuitively identify ros generated in fe iii caso3 system at the reaction time of 1 5 10 and 15 min in fig 3 b the typical three line signal was attributed to 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpox adduct the product that was potentially generated from dmpo direct oxidation by 1o2 harbour et al 1980 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 simultaneously the characteristic dmpo so4 adduct was observed with the six peak height ratio of 1 1 1 1 1 1 and the intensity of the peaks initially enhanced then weaken in the first 15 min temp 1o2 adduct emerged synchronously and the intensity was gradually strengthened in 15 min comparing the dmpo so4 with temp 1o2 it was concluded that the intensity of dmpo so4 decreased with the increased intensity of temp 1o2 which signified that there might be a transformation channel from so4 to 1o2 fig 3 c notably dmpo oh adduct was easy to be captured due to its long half life about 2 6 h whereas no typical four line signal peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 was detected demonstrating that the generation of ho in fe iii caso3 system could be neglectable davies et al 1992 finkelstein et al 1980 in addition based on the recent researches it might be high valence transition metal ions such as fe iv and cu iv rather than cognitive reactive species that were responsible for contaminants removal in transition metal based aops dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was introduced as the probe compound in which the decomposition of pmso was an equal mole with the generation of pmso2 when oxidized by fe iv apparently the yield of pmso2 generation at the entire test period were all less than 1 0 fig s6 the extremely low conversion efficiency of pmso indicated that the contribution of fe iv was of little significance 3 3 2 quantification of dominant ros responsible for tce degradation the steady state concentrations of ho so4 and 1o2 were quantified through the kinetics analysis and calculation when nb ba and dpbf were employed as the probes nb ba and dpbf degradation patterns fitted well with the pseudo first order model and their rate constants kobs were presented in fig s7 and text s3 consequently the steady state concentration of ho was calculated to be 9 1 10 13 m while so4 and 1o2 were determined to be 1 5 10 11 and 5 4 10 11 m which were at least an order of magnitude larger than that of ho corresponding with the results of quenching and epr tests thus the marginal contribution of ho was verified once more and could be ignorable whereafter the concentrations of ros at the desired time 0 2 5 10 15 30 60 120 and 180 min were measured p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba was the specific product derived from ba by ho oxidation and the conversion molar ratio between p hba and ho was around 1 5 87 eq 8 xue et al 2019a tba could be effectively oxidized by so4 and ho to form hcho flyunt et al 2003 yang et al 2015 the conversion factor between ho or so4 and hcho was both around 2 1 eqs 9 10 thus the generation of so4 was determined via eq 11 1o2 concentration was qualified by a dpbf method jiang et al 2020 zhou et al 2021c in brief the consumption of dpbf and 1o2 were of equal mol eq 12 all the probes were excessive and enough to expend ros as shown in fig s8 a the concentrations of ho so4 and 1o2 in 180 min accumulated to 11 7 188 1 and 500 0 μm respectively with the order of 1o2 so4 ho to elucidate the generation mechanism of 1o2 the concentration of 1o2 was further quantified in the presence of ipa and tba respectively fig s8 b in the control group the generation of 1o2 was inappreciable in the absence of fe iii and caso3 when tba was introduced in fe iii caso3 system 1o2 concentration was still 443 9 μm indicating that 1o2 was not originated from ho in contrast with the participation of ipa 1o2 yield dramatically decreased to 66 9 μm which was in line with the quenching tests epr analysis and steady state concentration calculation these results for the first time innovatively demonstrated that 1o2 was principally derived from so4 3 3 3 the controversial role of 1o2 from the results above so4 and 1o2 were responsible for tce removal nevertheless the role of 1o2 on contaminants degradation was debatable duan et al 2021 lee et al 2020 ren et al 2022 these controversies usually lied in the following three aspects 1 the appearance of triplet signal in epr test was not entirely owing to the contribution of 1o2 2 ffa as the scavenger of 1o2 could directly react with pms hso5 so as to lead the low removal performance rather than 1o2 quenching effect 3 the current 1o2 identification techniques were not full fledged to avoid the misunderstanding of 1o2 role ipa tba and ffa were introduced in epr tests in the presence of tba the intensity of temp 1o2 was almost identical with the absence of scavenger fig s9 a on the contrary the addition of ipa or ffa extremely impaired the peak intensity simultaneously verifying the generation of 1o2 and the non negligible role of so4 recently deuterium oxide d2o was widely used to estimate the role of 1o2 in aops the lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 32 μs was greatly longer than that in h2o 2 μs and the reaction kinetics would increase when d2o was applied as the solvent gorman and rodgers 1981 luo et al 2019 obviously the peak of the typical temp 1o2 adduct was highly intensified in d2o solution φ d2o 50 fig s9 b as for the degradation performance although the removal efficiency of tce was basically the same the calculated value of kobs in d2o 1 4888 mm 1 min 1 was much larger than that in h2o 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 fig 9 c furthermore ffa decompositions ffa 0 10 mm in different concentrations of pms hso5 were investigated as well the decomposition of ffa boosted from 1 6 to 78 9 when the concentration of pms increased from 0 01 mm to 10 mm fig s10 the maximum pms hso5 generated in fe iii caso3 system was less than 0 004 mm as a result of which this tiny amount of hso5 would not directly oxidize ffa fig s5 a however in 1o2 scavenging test the consumption of ffa reached up to 43 3 revealing that ffa was indeed decomposed not by pms hso5 but by 1o2 and 1o2 did play an important part for tce removal fig s10 conservatively as the diverse 1o2 scavengers ffa l histidine l his k1o2 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 sodium azide nan3 k1o2 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 temp k1o2 3 1 108 m 1 s 1 and β carotene k1o2 2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 hardly oxidized by pms were separately added to further quench 1o2 and their concentrations were all set as 10 mm as shown in fig s9 d the inhibition on tce removal was so apparent that the contribution of 1o2 to tce degradation was to be reckoned with strongly 3 4 tce removal mechanisms in fe iii caso3 system 3 4 1 tce dechlorination mineralization and degradation pathways the liberation of cl was measured and if the volatile component of tce was taken into account the dechlorination of tce was calculated to be 95 8 which illustrated that tce was completely dechlorinated fig 4 a through toc analysis tce 0 0 15 mm toc 0 3 65 mg l 1 toc removal was modified to 91 7 fig 4 b reflecting the complete tce mineralization although it has been reported that the mineralization extent in 1o2 based aops was always despondent to our great relief the synergistic performance of 1o2 coupled with so4 in this research could fully mineralize tce peng et al 2021 the intermediates during the tce degradation were also explored table s4 dichloroacetic acid dcaa oxalic acid oa and formic acid fa were captured by ion chromatography ic while trace amounts of vinyl chloride vc carbon tetrachloride ct and chloroform cf were detected through gc ms analysis fig s11 based on the results above three main tce degradation pathways were derived fig 4 c scheme i tce was firstly turned into c cl 2ch oh cl through hydroxylation and electrophilic addition by so4 attack li et al 2007 subsequently c cl 2ch oh cl 1 on one hand was transformed to c oh clch cl 2 by isomerization then further hydroxylated and oxidized to dcaa intermediate a and oa intermediate b while 2 on the other hand c cl 2ch oh cl was converted to dichloroacetaldehyde c2h2cl2o and glyoxal c2h2o2 via hydrogenation hydroxylation and tautomerism chu et al 2021 sun et al 2021 then oa was likewise generated from glyoxal by so4 and 1o2 c c bonds in the formed oa were broken by ros and fa intermediate c was produced finally fa was further oxidized to co2 and h2o dong et al 2019b scheme ii the generated c cl 2ch oh cl was converted to ccl3ch oh cl by the addition of free cl through oxidation and bond cleavage ccl3 was generated while ct intermediate d and cf intermediate e were formed by the addition of cl and hydrogenation respectively jiang et al 2018 later on the above two intermediates were transformed to dichlorocarbene ccl2 which was quite unstable and turned into co2 and h2o as a result of hydrolysis meanwhile part of ccl2 was combined to generate perchloroethylene pce by self polymerization and then further completely oxidized and mineralized tang et al 2019 scheme iii firstly vc intermediate f was generated from tce by oxidation substitution and loss of cl then vc turned into c oh clch3 as a result of electrophilic addition and isomerization further acetic acid was produced via oxidation and tautomerism eventually acetic acid was further oxidized to co2 and h2o zhou et al 2021b 3 4 2 toxicity evaluation of intermediates the toxicological properties of intermediates were assessed by qsar prediction through toxicity estimation software tool t e s t the acute toxicities of different intermediates were determined by the ld50 of rats oral table s5 the details were shown in fig s12 and text s4 based on the toxicity assessment some hazardous intermediates were generated with higher toxicity to our satisfaction their concentrations were extremely low and from ic and toc analyses tce and the intermediates could be entirely dechlorinated and mineralized eventually notably more emphasis should be paid to mineralization rather than degradation efficiency alone in the future so as to search for a green and low toxic degradation pathway on contaminants removal 3 4 3 ros transformation mechanism the mechanism of ros transformation was illustrated in fig 5 firstly the feso3 complex was generated by the combination of fe iii and so3 2 then decomposed to fe ii and so3 spontaneously eqs 3 4 zhou et al 2018 later the produced so3 was rapidly oxidized to so5 by o2 eq 13 buxton et al 1988 subsequently the generated so5 1 reacted with so3 2 or fe ii to produce hso5 2 self polymerized to form s2o8 2 and o2 3 self polymerized to generate so4 and released o2 and 4 transformed to so4 in the presence of so3 2 eqs 14 18 rao et al 2021b so4 could be likewise produced by the catalysis of in situ generated fe ii towards hso5 or s2o8 2 eqs 6 and 19 meanwhile hso5 could be decomposed to o2 and 1o2 under the alkaline condition caused by the dissolution of caso3 eqs 20 21 1o2 could also be transformed from hso5 through eqs 22 24 zhou et al 2015 besides it has been reported that ca ii had the potential ability for 1o2 generation which might be another reason for more amount of 1o2 generation in fe iii caso3 system than that in fe iii na2so3 system nardello et al 1998 pan et al 2018 moreover it had been testified in section 3 3 that there was a conversion from so4 to 1o2 thus the pathways were deduced and demonstrated in eqs 25 27 the synergistic oxidation of so4 and 1o2 was responsible for tce degradation and tce could be completely dechlorinated and mineralized eventually 3 5 effects of various solution matrixes 3 5 1 influence of do the influence of do on tce removal was studied it could be concluded from fig s13 a that tce removal under nitrogen n2 environment 84 2 was slightly lower than that under air environment 94 0 while kobs value was almost an order of magnitude lower 0 9252 versus 0 1073 mm 1 min 1 the concentration of do was measured at the desired time fig s13 b in fe iii caso3 air system do sharply dropped to 0 mg l 1 in the first 5 min for so3 oxidation to so5 and in the rest of time do concentration increased gently through eqs 16 17 and 20 in fe iii caso3 n2 system do maintained at an extremely low concentration in the first 30 min and then gradually increased eqs 16 17 and 20 in addition the consumption of so3 2 in the presence of n2 was monitored and as shown in fig s13 c so3 2 concentration was lower than that in the presence of air at the entire period indicating the lack of so3 oxidation in the absence of sufficient do to sum up the participation of sufficient do had the positive effect on ros generation and tce degradation 3 5 2 effects of initial solution ph and coexisting ions it is recognized that fe based aops are sensitive to the initial ph of the solution thus tce degradation at different initial ph 2 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 was evaluated zhang and zhou 2019 tce losses by volatilization adsorption and flocculation at different initial phs could be ignored table s6 the detailed tce removal performance and the ph values in the reaction were shown in fig s14 to our delight tce removal was over 85 0 at the ph range of 3 0 11 0 while 64 9 of tce was degraded at ph 2 0 which might be caused by the decomposition of so3 2 in high h concentration fig 6 a generally the removal efficiency of contaminants would be cut down in alkaline condition however 90 4 and 93 7 of tce could be restored at the initial ph of 9 0 and 11 0 respectively which could be interpreted by the acceleration of 1o2 in alkaline condition through eq 21 based on the results above the drawback of poor degradation in alkaline condition could be overcome by the application of fe iii caso3 system the impact of coexisting ions at various concentration levels namely 1 0 10 and 100 mm on the remediation of tce was conducted and the results were illustrated in text s5 and fig 6 b and c in brief compared to traditional fe based aops fe iii caso3 system had the advantages of higher tolerance to the alkaline ph environment and coexistence of cations and anions 3 5 3 influence of surfactants in the remediation of soil and groundwater in actual contaminated sites surfactant solubilization technology was often applied in combination with aops thus the influence of surfactants on tce removal including tween 80 tw 80 polyoxyethylene lauryl ether brij 35 and triton x 100 tx 100 were investigated lamichhane et al 2017 as shown in fig s15 a tce removal decreased from 94 0 to 91 8 77 3 and 61 5 in the presence of 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 tw 80 from 94 0 to 90 3 74 2 and 49 8 in the presence of brij 35 and from 94 0 to 89 1 68 3 and 40 5 in the presence of tx 100 demonstrating that surfactants had negative effect on tce removal however compared to our previous researches the tce degradation performance in fe iii caso3 system was superior and of higher resistance on surfactants sun et al 2020 zhou et al 2021b 3 5 4 effects of humic acid ha and different sources of water the effect of ha was explored tce removal maintained to 93 5 91 1 90 6 and 90 7 in the participation of 1 0 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 ha respectively revealing the influence of ha could be neglected this result was consistent with the researches that ha had poor reactivity with 1o2 fig 15 b luo et al 2019 further ultrapure water uw was replaced by deionized water dw tap water tw river water rw and actual groundwater aw to assess the remediation ability of fe iii caso3 system on different sources of water fig 15 c tce degradation in tw was almost the same with that in uw while kobs in tw 0 0933 mm 1 min 1 and rw 0 1029 mm 1 min 1 were much lower than that in uw 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 these negative effects were mainly derived from the buffering capacity of tw and rw and when the reaction time expanded to 300 min tce removal could reach 89 3 and 87 2 as for aw only 53 5 of tce removal was obtained due to the anions cl and hco3 and buffering effects fortunately ideal tce removal efficiency could be achieved by properly enlarging the reagent ratio or adjusting the initial solution ph ph0 5 fig s15 d 3 6 removal performance of other organic contaminants in fe iii caso3 system in the remediation of actual contaminated sites the composition of contaminants was complex and diverse therefore typical chcs including tce pce ct 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca 1 2 dichloroethane dca 1 2 3 trichloropropane tcp and dichloromethane dcm benzene series including benzene b toluene t ethylbenzene e and xylene x and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs including naphthalene nap phenanthrene phe and fluoranthene flt were selected as target contaminants to evaluate their removal performance in fe iii caso3 system yu et al 2018 the concentrations of chcs and btex were set as 0 15 mm while nap 0 10 mm phe 1 0 mg l 1 and flt 0 2 mg l 1 concentrations were set as their maximum solubility in water the parameter values on other organic contaminants removal were exhibited in table s7 as shown in fig 7 and fig s16 the system had high reactivity and degradation performance for the organic contaminants with unsaturated bonds especially on tce 94 0 pce 86 0 btex 95 1 98 0 93 5 and 88 0 for b t e and x respectively nap 93 4 phe 97 4 and flt 99 9 while the removal efficiency on ct tca and dcm were relatively low which were not well restored as desired and had to be further investigated 3 7 comparison of tce removal performance in multiple combination systems 3 7 1 synergistic degradation in different sulfur iron containing substances firstly the tce removal performance in different fe iii sulfur containing systems was evaluated by replacing caso3 with na2so3 sodium bisulfite nahso3 sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 sodium dithionite na2s2o4 and sodium sulfide na2s respectively as illustrated in fig 8 a tce removal in various systems were 94 0 in fe iii caso3 42 1 in fe iii na2so3 53 1 in fe iii nahso3 16 7 in fe iii na2s2o3 52 0 in fe iii na2s2o4 and 27 0 in fe iii na2s among which caso3 coupled with fe iii showed the most favorable reactivity on tce through cost calculation and toxicity analysis caso3 had the largest ld50 value and almost the lowest cost which was more suitable for the remediation in actual contaminated sites fig 8 c meanwhile fe iii was substituted with zero valent iron zvi ferrous sulfide fes iron pyrite fes2 fe ii ferroferric oxide fe3o4 and potassium ferrate k2feo4 fe vi respectively 75 5 36 9 23 0 82 1 11 6 94 0 and 42 4 of tce were removed in zvi caso3 fes caso3 fes2 caso3 fe ii caso3 fe3o4 caso3 fe iii caso3 and fe vi caso3 systems respectively thereinto fe iii had the highest catalytic activity for tce degradation fig 8 b further the permutation and combination of sulfur containing coupled with iron containing on tce removal were tested the degradation efficiencies of tce were illustrated in fig 8 d and table s8 as a result of which fe iii caso3 was the most efficient system whereas the combination of fe3o4 coupled with na2s2o4 was of the worst performance 3 7 2 synergistic degradation of tce in the presence of oxidants caso3 could likewise react as the reductant for fe ii generation thus to assess the synergistic degradation performance of tce in the presence of oxidants h2o2 pds and pms were introduced as oxidants in fe iii caso3 system respectively the detailed removal efficiencies were shown in text s6 and table s9 in ternary systems tce removal followed the order pds 96 1 pms 88 3 h2o2 74 8 which could be explained that so3 2 was inclined to directly react with pms or h2o2 and had the great tendency to quench ros generated rather than served for fe ii generation fig s17 zhou et al 2021a subsequently the participation of oxidants in different fe iii sulfur containing systems was studied as well and the results showed the great application prospective of caso3 in aops for the remediation of contaminated sites fig s17 4 conclusion in this work as a slow released so3 2 source caso3 was introduced in s iv based aops as a substitute for na2so3 and the performance kinetics and mechanisms of tce degradation in fe iii caso3 system were investigated tce removal was greatly enhanced to 94 0 by applying caso3 instead of na2so3 while only 42 1 of tce degradation efficiency could be achieved in fe iii na2so3 system tce could be completely dechlorinated and mineralized to co2 h2o and cl eventually in fe iii caso3 system via three main degradation pathways the significance of in situ fe ii generation was clarified and fe ii could initiate a series of radical chain reactions for tce degradation meanwhile the major ros responsible for tce removal were so4 and 1o2 of which part of 1o2 was transformed from so4 among different sulfur iron containing systems fe iii caso3 system had the best reactivity and degradation performance on tce the synergistic tce removal in the presence of oxidants was likewise explored and the order of removal efficiency in different oxidant environments followed an order of pds pms h2o2 the application of fe iii caso3 has higher resistance on complex solution matrixes and possesses broad spectrum reactivity for other organic contaminants demonstrating the application perspective for the remediation of complex contaminants in actual water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

15758,s iv based advanced oxidation process has been applied for contaminants remediation however as a traditional source of sulfite so3 2 na2so3 is extremely soluble in water resulting in a high concentration of so3 2 to quench the generated reactive oxygen species ros in this work caso3 was introduced instead of na2so3 for its slow released so3 2 ability and fe iii caso3 system was established for the removal of trichloroethylene tce and other organic contaminants the degradation efficiency of tce reached 94 0 and tce could be completely dechlorinated and mineralized while the removal of other contaminants was all over 85 0 at the optimal tested conditions through epr detection ros scavenging and probe tests and quantification of ros amounts it was concluded that the dominant ros in fe iii caso3 system were so4 and 1o2 of which the transformation mechanism of so4 to 1o2 was revealed and demonstrated comprehensively the synergistic contaminants degradation performance in different sulfur iron containing systems and in the presence of oxidants was evaluated the effects of various solution conditions were assessed and fe iii caso3 system was of higher resistance on complex solution matrixes suggesting the broad spectrum and application perspective for the remediation of complex contaminants in actual water keywords calcium sulfite singlet oxygen removal mechanisms broad spectrum reactivity groundwater remediation 1 introduction as the efficient and eco friendly technology advanced oxidation processes aops have been paid close attention for contaminants removal in which hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxodisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms are extensively applied as fenton or fenton like oxidants barb et al 1949 pignatello et al 2006 simultaneously the above oxidants need to be further activated through thermal ultrasonic or transition metal activation to generate reactive oxygen species ros of which ho e0 2 7 v and so4 e0 2 6 v have been widely recognized as powerful ros responsible for contaminants degradation kusic et al 2011 compared to other activation methods transition metal activation has the advantages of no external light or heat source requirement mild reaction conditions and rapid oxidation for the removal of contaminants at natural environment yang et al 2020 nevertheless some drawbacks still restrict the practical applications of aops such as 1 iron sludge aggregation and precipitation 2 narrow applicable ph range and 3 high cost of oxidants fu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhang and zhou 2019 several attempts have been employed successfully to avoid the above issues for instance traditional fe ii is replaced by some slow released iron sources such as nano zero valent iron nzvi and ferrous sulfide fes du et al 2016 song et al 2019 meanwhile some researchers have synthesized the sulfidized nanoscale zero valent iron s nzvi which possesses high reaction property than nzvi and fe ii and has been applied for groundwater remediation xu et al 2019 2021 besides some chelating agents and reductants are involved in the process of fe ii regeneration huang et al 2021 xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021a moreover to our delight some non radical degradation pathways have been investigated which were of low ph dependence and featured a wide ph range of application li et al 2022 however the high cost of oxidants is inevitable recently s iv aops are regarded as substitutions for traditional aops based on peroxides h2o2 pds and pms as far as we know sulfite ion so3 2 could also react with some metal ions to generate ho and so4 through a series of complex radical chain reactions table 1 on the one hand as the source and precursor of so4 the costs of persulfates 2056 per ton for pds and 852 per ton for pms are higher than that of sulfite 434 per ton for sodium sulfite and the persulfates will tend to generate more by products as well on the other hand the median lethal dose ld50 of sodium sulfite na2so3 is 3560 mg kg 1 while the values for h2o2 pds and pms are only about 376 802 and 673 mg kg 1 respectively which indicate the low toxicity and feasibility of s iv aops rao et al 2021b zhou et al 2018 sun et al chose fe vi na2so3 system to remove n n diethyl 3 toluamide and gained 78 removal in 10 s sun et al 2018 besides guo et al found that more than 90 of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol removal achieved in fe iii na2so3 system in the presence of ultraviolet guo et al 2013 although the low cost and low toxicity of na2so3 make it possible to be a substitute for peroxides the requirement of na2so3 dosage in different aops is hard to determine at a low concentration level the amount of ros generated from so3 2 is insufficient to degrade the targets and on the contrary the high dosage of so3 2 will consume the ros produced in s iv aops through a series of chain reactions eqs 1 2 in table 1 rao et al 2021a shao et al 2019 as the product of flue gas desulfurization process calcium sulfite caso3 is cheap and readily available thus the application of caso3 is in accord with the concept of resource utilization and green reuse notably the solubility of na2so3 reaches up to 30 7 g 100 g h2o 25 c while the value in caso3 is only 0 007 g 100 g h2o which reveals the potential of caso3 to be so3 2 source through sustained release in solution and continuous generation of ros li et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 up to now the major radicals induced in s iv aops are ho and so4 but the researches on other non radical species are rare and their contributions are always ignored li et al 2016 singlet oxygen 1o2 has been reported as a highly selective oxidation species especially when pms is applied as the oxidant li et al 2022 liu et al 2019 peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2015 however the contribution of 1o2 in s iv aops is still unclear and the generation mechanism of 1o2 via chain reactions has not been clearly elucidated yet accordingly in this research trichloroethylene tce a representative of chlorinated hydrocarbons in contaminated groundwater and soil and other organic contaminants are selected as the targets to explore their degradation performance in different s iv aops systems namely fe iii caso3 and fe iii na2so3 systems this study is 1 to compare the degradation performance and kinetics of tce in fe iii caso3 and fe iii na2so3 systems so as to clarify the superiority of caso3 2 to demonstrate the contributions and transformation mechanisms of iron and sulfur species 3 to identify the major ros responsible for tce degradation and quantify their concentrations and contributions to tce removal in fe iii caso3 system 4 to evaluate the dechlorination mineralization and to propose degradation pathways of tce 5 to assess the influences of complex solution matrixes on tce degradation 6 to reveal the synergistic removal performance of sulfur iron containing substances 7 to evaluate the broad spectrum reactivity of fe iii caso3 system for other organic contaminants degradation and 8 to explore the synergistic effect in the presence of oxidants h2o2 fe iii caso3 pds fe iii caso3 and pms fe iii caso3 systems 2

from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china calcium sulfite caso3 90 0 and sodium sulfite anhydrous na2so3 98 0 were obtained from macklin reagent co ltd shanghai china all the reagents were used without purification the detailed information of reagents was provided in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures tce stock solution 1 5 mm was prepared in water in a 100 ml volumetric flask and stirred for 12 h firstly 25 ml tce was taken out from the stock solution and added into a 250 ml sealed reactor initial tce concentration was 0 15 mm in the reactor with almost no headspace except two outlets for dosing and sampling after that the pre determined mass of fe2 so4 3 and caso3 were simultaneously poured into the reactor to start the reaction the stirring speed and the reaction temperature were controlled at 600 r min and 20 0 5 c respectively in the synergistic tests with oxidants h2o2 pds pms etc the oxidants fe2 so4 3 and caso3 were added simultaneously to start the reaction at the desired time 1 0 ml sample was taken out and mixed with 1 0 ml n hexane immediately then the mixture was vibrated for 5 min and stood still for another 5 min before being extracted in a vial for analysis when in the presence of surfactants 0 2 ml sample was taken out and mixed with 2 8 ml n hexane if needed ions anions and cations scavengers or surfactants were added before fe2 so4 3 and caso3 to explore their influences on contaminant degradation a modified dtnb method was applied to measure the concentration of so3 2 dong et al 2019a in brief after filtration 1 0 ml sample was mixed with 2 0 ml dtnb 1 0 mm 1 0 ml edta 1 0 mm and 5 0 ml phosphatic buffer 40 mm ph 7 then stood still for 5 min before analysis to detect the dechlorination of tce 5 0 ml sample was taken out and mixed with 1 0 ml methanol then stood still for 12 h before analysis as for toc measurement at least 10 ml sample was taken out and injected into a toc vial immediately for analysis the initial ph of solution was measured before the addition of fe2 so4 3 and caso3 naoh 1 0 mm or h2so4 1 0 mm was used for ph adjustment when needed and all the initial ph was unadjusted if not specified 2 3 analytical methods gas chromatography gc was applied to analyze the concentration of tce the temperatures of the oven injector and detector were set at 100 c 220 c and 240 c respectively the generation of ho and so4 were determined by ba and formaldehyde hcho methods xue et al 2019a yang et al 2015 1o2 concentration was analyzed by a dpbf method zhou et al 2021c the concentrations of fe ii so3 2 hso5 and dpbf were measured by a uv spectrophotometer at the wavelengths of 512 412 352 and 410 nm respectively electron paramagnetic resonance epr was employed for ros detection the details of the above analytical methods could be obtained in text s2 and table s1 all the equations involved in this article were listed in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of tce degradation in different s iv aops systems the degradation performance of tce in different s iv aops systems was investigated parameter values under various experimental conditions were listed in table s2 tce initial concentration was set as 0 15 mm and the concentrations of fe iii na2so3 and caso3 were 0 30 1 5 and 1 5 mm respectively as shown in fig 1 a tce losses in the control group and adsorption group were less than 9 7 in 3 h in fe iii na2so3 system tce removal displayed two phases a rapid stage in the first 2 min and a subsequent slow stage in the rest of time and finally only 42 1 tce removal was achieved to our pleasure compared with na2so3 the presence of caso3 greatly enhanced tce removal the reaction proceeded continuously in 3 h and the degradation of tce could reach 94 0 in fe iii caso3 system meanwhile the pattern of tce degradation in different conditions followed a pseudo second order kinetic model and the calculated rate constant kobs in fe iii caso3 system reached 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 which was much higher than that in fe iii na2so3 system 0 0432 mm 1 min 1 indicating the better tce removal performance by caso3 against na2so3 fig 1 b and table s3 subsequently the effect of reagent dosages on tce degradation was investigated fig s1 first the dosage of caso3 was fixed to 1 5 mm and as fe iii dosage was elevated from 0 15 mm to 0 30 mm tce removal promoted from 79 2 to 94 0 fig s1 a when the dosage was further increased to 0 75 mm and 1 5 mm the degradation of tce dropped to 55 6 and 39 3 respectively which resulted from the fact that excessive fe iii or generated fe ii would compete for ros with the target contaminant zhang et al 2015 when fe iii dosage was set as 0 30 mm tce removal increased from 64 6 to 76 3 and 94 0 with caso3 dosage increased from 0 3 mm to 0 75 mm and 1 50 mm fig s1 b the performance of tce degradation decreased to 84 9 when the caso3 dosage was increased to 2 25 mm this result could be elucidated through the reactions in table 1 eqs 1 2 owing to the scavenge function of excessive so3 2 for ros fig s1 c the dosing mode of reagents was of great significance in actual groundwater remediation therefore fe iii or caso3 was added in triple dosing mode and their total concentrations were consistent with the single dosing mode generally the contaminant removal in multiple dosing mode was superior to the single dosing mode in aops dong et al 2020b xue et al 2019b however as illustrated in fig s2 although the process was of slight difference the performance of tce degradation and kobs were basically the same in 3 h no matter how the dosing modes were the above phenomenon demonstrated that caso3 could sustainedly release so3 2 in solution and continuously generate ros for tce removal ensuring the reaction long lasting nevertheless in fe iii na2so3 system only when na2so3 was added in multiple dosing mode could tce removal be improved which was inconvenient in actual groundwater remediation fig s1 d 3 2 contribution and transformation mechanisms of iron and sulfur species it has been reported that the in situ generated fe ii has an extraordinary promoting effect on fe iii sulfite system zhou et al 2014 fe iii could react with so3 2 and then the formed feso3 complex decomposed to fe ii through eqs 3 4 in table 1 the generation of fe ii followed the trend of increase in the first 5 min then gradually decline to almost zero fig s3 a the maximum of fe ii produced in fe iii caso3 system was about 31 5 μm while the fe ii formed in fe iii na2so3 system was only 5 8 μm which was in accordance with the performance of tce removal indicating the crucial role of in situ generated fe ii in the systems ros generation was mainly attributed to a series of radical chain reactions and the reaction between the in situ generated fe ii and hso5 eq 6 caso3 could sustainedly release so3 2 in solution this moderate concentration of so3 2 could not only continuously produce the in situ fe ii but also act as the reductant for fe ii regeneration while in the presence of the same mole of na2so3 the excessive amount of so3 2 had more tendency to quench the in situ generated so4 and fe ii rather than to regenerate fe ii rao et al 2021a shao et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 therefore fe iii caso3 system showed a promoted fe ii generation than fe iii na2so3 system the key role of fe ii was further proved in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline monohydrate o phen or 2 2 bipyridine bpy in fe iii caso3 system to verify their inhibition on tce degradation both o phen and bpy could combine with fe ii to form stable complexes ali et al 2021 dong et al 2020b as displayed in fig s3 b and fig s3 c with the addition of 0 3 mm and 1 5 mm bpy tce removal was inhibited from 94 0 to 56 8 and 9 4 kobs from 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 to 0 0675 and 0 0039 mm 1 min 1 respectively and in the presence of o phen the inhibition of tce removal was 31 1 from 94 0 to 62 9 and 77 4 from 94 0 to 16 6 and kobs decreased to 0 1301 and 0 0338 mm 1 min 1 revealing the significance of fe ii generation therefore tce removal in fe ii caso3 system was conducted likewise and the results elucidated that fe ii had the ability to directly activate caso3 at the different molar ratio which proved the pivotal role of fe ii once more fig s3 d the concentration of so3 2 was measured in both fe iii caso3 and fe iii na2so3 systems in the solo na2so3 group so3 2 concentration was immediately increased to 1 50 mm and then dropped slowly in 3 h due to the oxidation of dissolved oxygen do to form so4 2 whereas so3 2 in the solo caso3 group was increased slowly and continually in the first 1 h and reached to around 0 80 mm fig s4 during tce degradation the consumption of so3 2 in fe iii na2so3 system was of extreme speediness and the residual so3 2 maintained at a low level after 15 min fig 2 on the one hand the high concentration of so3 2 would consume do in the involvement of the chain reactions for ros and on the other hand excessive so3 2 played the role as the ros scavenger thus the low tce removal occurred eq 13 what inspired us was that so3 2 in fe iii caso3 system was firstly increased and then decreased softly via the precipitation dissolution equilibrium eq 5 as a result of which the effect of tce removal was more excellent rao et al 2021a meanwhile hso5 generation in the two systems was observed fig s5 a in fe iii na2so3 system the amount of the generated hso5 was around 2 0 μm and then soon exhausted by fe ii to form various ros eq 6 however the generation of hso5 in fe iii caso3 system initially raised to 3 3 μm and then consumed in 15 min while after 30 min the amount of hso5 increased again and finally maintained at around 1 0 μm resulting from 1 the sustained release of so3 2 by caso3 and 2 the exhausted fe ii responsible for hso5 activation as shown in fig s5 b after the reaction s species in na2so3 could be all transformed to so4 2 while s species in caso3 were firstly transformed to so4 2 and then formed caso4 precipitation through eq 7 which would not increase the salinity of soil and groundwater so4 2 calculated so4 2 measured so4 2 fe2 so4 3 3 3 mechanism of fe iii caso3 system for tce removal 3 3 1 ros involved in fe iii caso3 system according to the previous researches ho so4 o2 and even 1o2 were observed in aops for contaminant degradation to determine the contributions of different ros tert butyl alcohol tba was selected for ho scavenging ktba ho 5 2 108 m 1 s 1 ktba so4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 and isopropanol ipa was introduced for ho and so4 quenching owing to its high reactivity for both ho kipa ho 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 kipa so4 8 2 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 gu et al 2018 liu et al 2022 yuan et al 2014 besides chloroform cf can act as the scavenger for o2 ko2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 and furfuryl alcohol ffa has high reaction rate constants k for both ho and 1o2 with the k values of 1 5 1010 and 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 respectively teel and watts 2002 zhang et al 2020 as exhibited in fig 3 a the presence of 50 mm cf had a negligible impact on tce removal from 94 0 to 88 4 demonstrating that o2 was not the dominant ros in fe iii caso3 system the inhibition of 100 mm tba was not likewise obvious and the degradation of tce decreased to 83 6 in 180 min different phenomenon occurred that tce removal was almost completely inhibited from 94 0 to 14 3 with the addition of 100 mm ipa which indicated that so4 generated from radical chain reactions had significant contribution to tce degradation moreover combined the inhibition of tba from 94 0 to 83 6 with ffa from 94 0 to 14 5 it could be deduced that 1o2 played a crucial role in the remediation of tce as well which had never been reported yet in s iv aops meanwhile kobs of tce degradation under different conditions were 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 without scavenger r2 0 9969 0 0149 mm 1 min 1 100 mm ipa r2 0 9570 0 3097 mm 1 min 1 100 mm tba r2 0 9808 0 5417 mm 1 min 1 50 mm cf r2 0 9969 and 0 0213 mm 1 min 1 10 mm ffa r2 0 9956 respectively further epr tests were applied to intuitively identify ros generated in fe iii caso3 system at the reaction time of 1 5 10 and 15 min in fig 3 b the typical three line signal was attributed to 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpox adduct the product that was potentially generated from dmpo direct oxidation by 1o2 harbour et al 1980 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 simultaneously the characteristic dmpo so4 adduct was observed with the six peak height ratio of 1 1 1 1 1 1 and the intensity of the peaks initially enhanced then weaken in the first 15 min temp 1o2 adduct emerged synchronously and the intensity was gradually strengthened in 15 min comparing the dmpo so4 with temp 1o2 it was concluded that the intensity of dmpo so4 decreased with the increased intensity of temp 1o2 which signified that there might be a transformation channel from so4 to 1o2 fig 3 c notably dmpo oh adduct was easy to be captured due to its long half life about 2 6 h whereas no typical four line signal peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 was detected demonstrating that the generation of ho in fe iii caso3 system could be neglectable davies et al 1992 finkelstein et al 1980 in addition based on the recent researches it might be high valence transition metal ions such as fe iv and cu iv rather than cognitive reactive species that were responsible for contaminants removal in transition metal based aops dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was introduced as the probe compound in which the decomposition of pmso was an equal mole with the generation of pmso2 when oxidized by fe iv apparently the yield of pmso2 generation at the entire test period were all less than 1 0 fig s6 the extremely low conversion efficiency of pmso indicated that the contribution of fe iv was of little significance 3 3 2 quantification of dominant ros responsible for tce degradation the steady state concentrations of ho so4 and 1o2 were quantified through the kinetics analysis and calculation when nb ba and dpbf were employed as the probes nb ba and dpbf degradation patterns fitted well with the pseudo first order model and their rate constants kobs were presented in fig s7 and text s3 consequently the steady state concentration of ho was calculated to be 9 1 10 13 m while so4 and 1o2 were determined to be 1 5 10 11 and 5 4 10 11 m which were at least an order of magnitude larger than that of ho corresponding with the results of quenching and epr tests thus the marginal contribution of ho was verified once more and could be ignorable whereafter the concentrations of ros at the desired time 0 2 5 10 15 30 60 120 and 180 min were measured p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba was the specific product derived from ba by ho oxidation and the conversion molar ratio between p hba and ho was around 1 5 87 eq 8 xue et al 2019a tba could be effectively oxidized by so4 and ho to form hcho flyunt et al 2003 yang et al 2015 the conversion factor between ho or so4 and hcho was both around 2 1 eqs 9 10 thus the generation of so4 was determined via eq 11 1o2 concentration was qualified by a dpbf method jiang et al 2020 zhou et al 2021c in brief the consumption of dpbf and 1o2 were of equal mol eq 12 all the probes were excessive and enough to expend ros as shown in fig s8 a the concentrations of ho so4 and 1o2 in 180 min accumulated to 11 7 188 1 and 500 0 μm respectively with the order of 1o2 so4 ho to elucidate the generation mechanism of 1o2 the concentration of 1o2 was further quantified in the presence of ipa and tba respectively fig s8 b in the control group the generation of 1o2 was inappreciable in the absence of fe iii and caso3 when tba was introduced in fe iii caso3 system 1o2 concentration was still 443 9 μm indicating that 1o2 was not originated from ho in contrast with the participation of ipa 1o2 yield dramatically decreased to 66 9 μm which was in line with the quenching tests epr analysis and steady state concentration calculation these results for the first time innovatively demonstrated that 1o2 was principally derived from so4 3 3 3 the controversial role of 1o2 from the results above so4 and 1o2 were responsible for tce removal nevertheless the role of 1o2 on contaminants degradation was debatable duan et al 2021 lee et al 2020 ren et al 2022 these controversies usually lied in the following three aspects 1 the appearance of triplet signal in epr test was not entirely owing to the contribution of 1o2 2 ffa as the scavenger of 1o2 could directly react with pms hso5 so as to lead the low removal performance rather than 1o2 quenching effect 3 the current 1o2 identification techniques were not full fledged to avoid the misunderstanding of 1o2 role ipa tba and ffa were introduced in epr tests in the presence of tba the intensity of temp 1o2 was almost identical with the absence of scavenger fig s9 a on the contrary the addition of ipa or ffa extremely impaired the peak intensity simultaneously verifying the generation of 1o2 and the non negligible role of so4 recently deuterium oxide d2o was widely used to estimate the role of 1o2 in aops the lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 32 μs was greatly longer than that in h2o 2 μs and the reaction kinetics would increase when d2o was applied as the solvent gorman and rodgers 1981 luo et al 2019 obviously the peak of the typical temp 1o2 adduct was highly intensified in d2o solution φ d2o 50 fig s9 b as for the degradation performance although the removal efficiency of tce was basically the same the calculated value of kobs in d2o 1 4888 mm 1 min 1 was much larger than that in h2o 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 fig 9 c furthermore ffa decompositions ffa 0 10 mm in different concentrations of pms hso5 were investigated as well the decomposition of ffa boosted from 1 6 to 78 9 when the concentration of pms increased from 0 01 mm to 10 mm fig s10 the maximum pms hso5 generated in fe iii caso3 system was less than 0 004 mm as a result of which this tiny amount of hso5 would not directly oxidize ffa fig s5 a however in 1o2 scavenging test the consumption of ffa reached up to 43 3 revealing that ffa was indeed decomposed not by pms hso5 but by 1o2 and 1o2 did play an important part for tce removal fig s10 conservatively as the diverse 1o2 scavengers ffa l histidine l his k1o2 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 sodium azide nan3 k1o2 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 temp k1o2 3 1 108 m 1 s 1 and β carotene k1o2 2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 hardly oxidized by pms were separately added to further quench 1o2 and their concentrations were all set as 10 mm as shown in fig s9 d the inhibition on tce removal was so apparent that the contribution of 1o2 to tce degradation was to be reckoned with strongly 3 4 tce removal mechanisms in fe iii caso3 system 3 4 1 tce dechlorination mineralization and degradation pathways the liberation of cl was measured and if the volatile component of tce was taken into account the dechlorination of tce was calculated to be 95 8 which illustrated that tce was completely dechlorinated fig 4 a through toc analysis tce 0 0 15 mm toc 0 3 65 mg l 1 toc removal was modified to 91 7 fig 4 b reflecting the complete tce mineralization although it has been reported that the mineralization extent in 1o2 based aops was always despondent to our great relief the synergistic performance of 1o2 coupled with so4 in this research could fully mineralize tce peng et al 2021 the intermediates during the tce degradation were also explored table s4 dichloroacetic acid dcaa oxalic acid oa and formic acid fa were captured by ion chromatography ic while trace amounts of vinyl chloride vc carbon tetrachloride ct and chloroform cf were detected through gc ms analysis fig s11 based on the results above three main tce degradation pathways were derived fig 4 c scheme i tce was firstly turned into c cl 2ch oh cl through hydroxylation and electrophilic addition by so4 attack li et al 2007 subsequently c cl 2ch oh cl 1 on one hand was transformed to c oh clch cl 2 by isomerization then further hydroxylated and oxidized to dcaa intermediate a and oa intermediate b while 2 on the other hand c cl 2ch oh cl was converted to dichloroacetaldehyde c2h2cl2o and glyoxal c2h2o2 via hydrogenation hydroxylation and tautomerism chu et al 2021 sun et al 2021 then oa was likewise generated from glyoxal by so4 and 1o2 c c bonds in the formed oa were broken by ros and fa intermediate c was produced finally fa was further oxidized to co2 and h2o dong et al 2019b scheme ii the generated c cl 2ch oh cl was converted to ccl3ch oh cl by the addition of free cl through oxidation and bond cleavage ccl3 was generated while ct intermediate d and cf intermediate e were formed by the addition of cl and hydrogenation respectively jiang et al 2018 later on the above two intermediates were transformed to dichlorocarbene ccl2 which was quite unstable and turned into co2 and h2o as a result of hydrolysis meanwhile part of ccl2 was combined to generate perchloroethylene pce by self polymerization and then further completely oxidized and mineralized tang et al 2019 scheme iii firstly vc intermediate f was generated from tce by oxidation substitution and loss of cl then vc turned into c oh clch3 as a result of electrophilic addition and isomerization further acetic acid was produced via oxidation and tautomerism eventually acetic acid was further oxidized to co2 and h2o zhou et al 2021b 3 4 2 toxicity evaluation of intermediates the toxicological properties of intermediates were assessed by qsar prediction through toxicity estimation software tool t e s t the acute toxicities of different intermediates were determined by the ld50 of rats oral table s5 the details were shown in fig s12 and text s4 based on the toxicity assessment some hazardous intermediates were generated with higher toxicity to our satisfaction their concentrations were extremely low and from ic and toc analyses tce and the intermediates could be entirely dechlorinated and mineralized eventually notably more emphasis should be paid to mineralization rather than degradation efficiency alone in the future so as to search for a green and low toxic degradation pathway on contaminants removal 3 4 3 ros transformation mechanism the mechanism of ros transformation was illustrated in fig 5 firstly the feso3 complex was generated by the combination of fe iii and so3 2 then decomposed to fe ii and so3 spontaneously eqs 3 4 zhou et al 2018 later the produced so3 was rapidly oxidized to so5 by o2 eq 13 buxton et al 1988 subsequently the generated so5 1 reacted with so3 2 or fe ii to produce hso5 2 self polymerized to form s2o8 2 and o2 3 self polymerized to generate so4 and released o2 and 4 transformed to so4 in the presence of so3 2 eqs 14 18 rao et al 2021b so4 could be likewise produced by the catalysis of in situ generated fe ii towards hso5 or s2o8 2 eqs 6 and 19 meanwhile hso5 could be decomposed to o2 and 1o2 under the alkaline condition caused by the dissolution of caso3 eqs 20 21 1o2 could also be transformed from hso5 through eqs 22 24 zhou et al 2015 besides it has been reported that ca ii had the potential ability for 1o2 generation which might be another reason for more amount of 1o2 generation in fe iii caso3 system than that in fe iii na2so3 system nardello et al 1998 pan et al 2018 moreover it had been testified in section 3 3 that there was a conversion from so4 to 1o2 thus the pathways were deduced and demonstrated in eqs 25 27 the synergistic oxidation of so4 and 1o2 was responsible for tce degradation and tce could be completely dechlorinated and mineralized eventually 3 5 effects of various solution matrixes 3 5 1 influence of do the influence of do on tce removal was studied it could be concluded from fig s13 a that tce removal under nitrogen n2 environment 84 2 was slightly lower than that under air environment 94 0 while kobs value was almost an order of magnitude lower 0 9252 versus 0 1073 mm 1 min 1 the concentration of do was measured at the desired time fig s13 b in fe iii caso3 air system do sharply dropped to 0 mg l 1 in the first 5 min for so3 oxidation to so5 and in the rest of time do concentration increased gently through eqs 16 17 and 20 in fe iii caso3 n2 system do maintained at an extremely low concentration in the first 30 min and then gradually increased eqs 16 17 and 20 in addition the consumption of so3 2 in the presence of n2 was monitored and as shown in fig s13 c so3 2 concentration was lower than that in the presence of air at the entire period indicating the lack of so3 oxidation in the absence of sufficient do to sum up the participation of sufficient do had the positive effect on ros generation and tce degradation 3 5 2 effects of initial solution ph and coexisting ions it is recognized that fe based aops are sensitive to the initial ph of the solution thus tce degradation at different initial ph 2 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 was evaluated zhang and zhou 2019 tce losses by volatilization adsorption and flocculation at different initial phs could be ignored table s6 the detailed tce removal performance and the ph values in the reaction were shown in fig s14 to our delight tce removal was over 85 0 at the ph range of 3 0 11 0 while 64 9 of tce was degraded at ph 2 0 which might be caused by the decomposition of so3 2 in high h concentration fig 6 a generally the removal efficiency of contaminants would be cut down in alkaline condition however 90 4 and 93 7 of tce could be restored at the initial ph of 9 0 and 11 0 respectively which could be interpreted by the acceleration of 1o2 in alkaline condition through eq 21 based on the results above the drawback of poor degradation in alkaline condition could be overcome by the application of fe iii caso3 system the impact of coexisting ions at various concentration levels namely 1 0 10 and 100 mm on the remediation of tce was conducted and the results were illustrated in text s5 and fig 6 b and c in brief compared to traditional fe based aops fe iii caso3 system had the advantages of higher tolerance to the alkaline ph environment and coexistence of cations and anions 3 5 3 influence of surfactants in the remediation of soil and groundwater in actual contaminated sites surfactant solubilization technology was often applied in combination with aops thus the influence of surfactants on tce removal including tween 80 tw 80 polyoxyethylene lauryl ether brij 35 and triton x 100 tx 100 were investigated lamichhane et al 2017 as shown in fig s15 a tce removal decreased from 94 0 to 91 8 77 3 and 61 5 in the presence of 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 tw 80 from 94 0 to 90 3 74 2 and 49 8 in the presence of brij 35 and from 94 0 to 89 1 68 3 and 40 5 in the presence of tx 100 demonstrating that surfactants had negative effect on tce removal however compared to our previous researches the tce degradation performance in fe iii caso3 system was superior and of higher resistance on surfactants sun et al 2020 zhou et al 2021b 3 5 4 effects of humic acid ha and different sources of water the effect of ha was explored tce removal maintained to 93 5 91 1 90 6 and 90 7 in the participation of 1 0 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 ha respectively revealing the influence of ha could be neglected this result was consistent with the researches that ha had poor reactivity with 1o2 fig 15 b luo et al 2019 further ultrapure water uw was replaced by deionized water dw tap water tw river water rw and actual groundwater aw to assess the remediation ability of fe iii caso3 system on different sources of water fig 15 c tce degradation in tw was almost the same with that in uw while kobs in tw 0 0933 mm 1 min 1 and rw 0 1029 mm 1 min 1 were much lower than that in uw 0 9252 mm 1 min 1 these negative effects were mainly derived from the buffering capacity of tw and rw and when the reaction time expanded to 300 min tce removal could reach 89 3 and 87 2 as for aw only 53 5 of tce removal was obtained due to the anions cl and hco3 and buffering effects fortunately ideal tce removal efficiency could be achieved by properly enlarging the reagent ratio or adjusting the initial solution ph ph0 5 fig s15 d 3 6 removal performance of other organic contaminants in fe iii caso3 system in the remediation of actual contaminated sites the composition of contaminants was complex and diverse therefore typical chcs including tce pce ct 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca 1 2 dichloroethane dca 1 2 3 trichloropropane tcp and dichloromethane dcm benzene series including benzene b toluene t ethylbenzene e and xylene x and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs including naphthalene nap phenanthrene phe and fluoranthene flt were selected as target contaminants to evaluate their removal performance in fe iii caso3 system yu et al 2018 the concentrations of chcs and btex were set as 0 15 mm while nap 0 10 mm phe 1 0 mg l 1 and flt 0 2 mg l 1 concentrations were set as their maximum solubility in water the parameter values on other organic contaminants removal were exhibited in table s7 as shown in fig 7 and fig s16 the system had high reactivity and degradation performance for the organic contaminants with unsaturated bonds especially on tce 94 0 pce 86 0 btex 95 1 98 0 93 5 and 88 0 for b t e and x respectively nap 93 4 phe 97 4 and flt 99 9 while the removal efficiency on ct tca and dcm were relatively low which were not well restored as desired and had to be further investigated 3 7 comparison of tce removal performance in multiple combination systems 3 7 1 synergistic degradation in different sulfur iron containing substances firstly the tce removal performance in different fe iii sulfur containing systems was evaluated by replacing caso3 with na2so3 sodium bisulfite nahso3 sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 sodium dithionite na2s2o4 and sodium sulfide na2s respectively as illustrated in fig 8 a tce removal in various systems were 94 0 in fe iii caso3 42 1 in fe iii na2so3 53 1 in fe iii nahso3 16 7 in fe iii na2s2o3 52 0 in fe iii na2s2o4 and 27 0 in fe iii na2s among which caso3 coupled with fe iii showed the most favorable reactivity on tce through cost calculation and toxicity analysis caso3 had the largest ld50 value and almost the lowest cost which was more suitable for the remediation in actual contaminated sites fig 8 c meanwhile fe iii was substituted with zero valent iron zvi ferrous sulfide fes iron pyrite fes2 fe ii ferroferric oxide fe3o4 and potassium ferrate k2feo4 fe vi respectively 75 5 36 9 23 0 82 1 11 6 94 0 and 42 4 of tce were removed in zvi caso3 fes caso3 fes2 caso3 fe ii caso3 fe3o4 caso3 fe iii caso3 and fe vi caso3 systems respectively thereinto fe iii had the highest catalytic activity for tce degradation fig 8 b further the permutation and combination of sulfur containing coupled with iron containing on tce removal were tested the degradation efficiencies of tce were illustrated in fig 8 d and table s8 as a result of which fe iii caso3 was the most efficient system whereas the combination of fe3o4 coupled with na2s2o4 was of the worst performance 3 7 2 synergistic degradation of tce in the presence of oxidants caso3 could likewise react as the reductant for fe ii generation thus to assess the synergistic degradation performance of tce in the presence of oxidants h2o2 pds and pms were introduced as oxidants in fe iii caso3 system respectively the detailed removal efficiencies were shown in text s6 and table s9 in ternary systems tce removal followed the order pds 96 1 pms 88 3 h2o2 74 8 which could be explained that so3 2 was inclined to directly react with pms or h2o2 and had the great tendency to quench ros generated rather than served for fe ii generation fig s17 zhou et al 2021a subsequently the participation of oxidants in different fe iii sulfur containing systems was studied as well and the results showed the great application prospective of caso3 in aops for the remediation of contaminated sites fig s17 4 conclusion in this work as a slow released so3 2 source caso3 was introduced in s iv based aops as a substitute for na2so3 and the performance kinetics and mechanisms of tce degradation in fe iii caso3 system were investigated tce removal was greatly enhanced to 94 0 by applying caso3 instead of na2so3 while only 42 1 of tce degradation efficiency could be achieved in fe iii na2so3 system tce could be completely dechlorinated and mineralized to co2 h2o and cl eventually in fe iii caso3 system via three main degradation pathways the significance of in situ fe ii generation was clarified and fe ii could initiate a series of radical chain reactions for tce degradation meanwhile the major ros responsible for tce removal were so4 and 1o2 of which part of 1o2 was transformed from so4 among different sulfur iron containing systems fe iii caso3 system had the best reactivity and degradation performance on tce the synergistic tce removal in the presence of oxidants was likewise explored and the order of removal efficiency in different oxidant environments followed an order of pds pms h2o2 the application of fe iii caso3 has higher resistance on complex solution matrixes and possesses broad spectrum reactivity for other organic contaminants demonstrating the application perspective for the remediation of complex contaminants in actual water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

15759,this study proposed that decreasing liquid polarity could weaken the intermolecular polar force at solid liquid interface of waste activated sludge was accordingly a process for enhanced sludge dewatering through liquid polarity regulation was established the liquid polarity was quantified by dielectric constant and the decrease of liquid dielectric constant below 50 was found to significantly improve the solid liquid separation performance of was in terms of filterability by 70 the differential scanning calorimeter dsc coupled with mass spectrum ms identified that 60 c was the appropriate temperature for liquid amendment i e acetonitrile recovery from filtered sludge cake and the corresponding energy consumption was calculated to be at most 799 0 j g which was substantially lower than that of water evaporation by sludge drying the nacl addition with 75 of saturated concentration could non thermally recover 91 7 4 9 of acetonitrile amendment from filtrate by salting out the great potentials in energy saving and recycle of chemicals make the newly proposed approach act as alternatives for the conventional process i e mechanically dewatering drying regarding the mechanism of liquid polarity regulation for enhanced was dewatering the solid liquid interfacial free energy was found to be reduced by 39 4 with the liquid dielectric constant decreasing from 78 50 to 41 00 also tandem mass tags tmt proteomics tracked the phase transfer of amphiphilic proteins with decreasing liquid polarity which found that the solubilization of proteins involved in the gene ontology go classifications of membrane protein complex and membrane protein complex outer membrane could facilitate the enhanced solid liquid separation of was the conformational analysis on those differential proteins was further conducted to reveal the structure attributes of amphiphilic proteins for the phase transfer feature the proteins with more exposed amino acid residues i e average solvent accessibility index over 1 8 tended to dissolve in the liquid phase with lower polarity which was accompanied with the reduced interfacial free energy of was on the contrary the proteins with buried amino acid residues e g the central hydrophobic β sheet is surrounded by the hydrophilic α helix precipitated in the solid phase with the decreasing liquid polarity all these findings are expected to create a novel option for dewatering was with recyclable liquid conditioning agents and provide the improved mechanistic insights into the migration of interfacial compositions controlling the dewaterability of was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge dewatering liquid polarity interfacial free energy protein conformation 1 introduction activated sludge process is the most widely applied technology worldwide for wastewater treatment due to its high adaptability to influent quality flexible operation mode and stable process performance wu et al 2020 however waste activated sludge was an inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment containing various toxic substances such as pathogens heavy metals and some organic contaminants is of concern to the secondary pollution control for biological wastewater treatments feng et al 2015 thus the appropriate handling of was is crucial for the sustainable development of social water cycle an effective dewatering process can minimize the sludge volume facilitate the transportation and enhance the energy efficiency of thermochemical treatment of was wong et al 2016 therefore dewatering is the common key technical unit of various was disposal routines however was is a colloidal mixture consisting of microorganisms mainly bacteria embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps christensen et al 2015 which is difficult to be dewatered due to the fact that highly hydrated bio polymers exert determinate effects on the colloid stability of microbial aggregation and bind a large volume of water i e bound water within the sludge flocs zhang et al 2016 as option to improve the was dewaterability the coagulation flocculation wei et al 2018 sonication feng et al 2009 microwave yu et al 2009 electrolysis zhen et al 2013 and advanced oxidation processes aops xu et al 2016 yu et al 2016 have been suggested to be effective the previous reports recognized that the water holding capacities of was could be eliminated by reducing the micro porosity of bio flocs and removing the hydrophilic surface functional groups of solid compositions li et al 2020 however the research on quantitative relationships among the surface charge properties particle size distribution porosity and chemical compositions of was is still insufficient the non selective aops and thermal treatment processes cannot realize the targeted removal of hydrophilic molecular structure therefore there is still lack of theoretical basis to optimize the existing sludge conditioning process as a result the high dosages of chemicals e g aops reagents and inorganic coagulants 10 30 wt of sludge dry matter large energy consumption e g sonication 600 800 kj kg sludge dry matter and cyclic freezing thawing 10 000 11 000 kj kg target removed water and potential secondary pollution risks e g corrosiveness of chlorine ferrous containing compounds limited the wide application and efficiency improvement of previously reported approaches wu et al 2020 the previous studies found that the extracellular proteins of was are the amphiphilic macromolecules containing hydrophilic α helix and hydrophobic β sheet secondary structure units wu et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 the amphiphilic proteins play more important roles in determining dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 shao et al 2009 yu et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 the hydrophilic molecular units have the affinity with water molecules and the hydrophobic molecular units are compatible with other hydrophobic substances e g cellulose or lipids as a result the amphiphilic components wrap the hydrophobic components to form a colloidal structure stably suspending in water peng et al 2021 wu et al 2021a since the water molecule is polar the hydrophilic molecular units should be polar according to the theory of like dissolves like jiang et al 2004 accordingly the decrease in liquid polarity may eliminate the affinity of polar functional groups with non polar low polar liquid molecules following this principle our recent publication has verified that decreasing liquid polarity through water soluble solvent amendment e g methanol acetone and acetonitrile could enhance the solid liquid separation of was wu et al 2021b however there are still lack of effective approaches for solvent recovery from dewatered sludge cake and filtrate furthermore the phase transfer of key water holding components i e amphiphilic proteins with the varying liquid polarity remains unexplored also the molecular structure attributes of amphiphilic proteins for the phase transfer feature and its potential effects on the solid liquid interfacial energy of was are still unclear the objectives of the present study are i to develop the non thermal method for water soluble organic amendment recovery from filtrate of was and facilitate the set up of sludge dewatering process that can recycle the liquid conditioning chemicals ii to identify the phase transfer feature of extracellular amphiphilic proteins with the varying liquid polarity of was iii to reveal the mechanism of how the molecular structure of extracellular amphiphilic proteins determined its phase partition in liquid with varying polarity iv to unveil the potential implications of phase transfer and molecular evolution of amphiphilic proteins to the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of biological aggregation all these results are expected to create novel insights into the solid water affinity of was and provide an alternative technology for the enhanced solid liquid separation of was 2 materials and methods 2 1 was samples for the further deeply dewatering in this study the mechanically dewatered sludge samples were collected from the belt press filter dewatering unit of a municipal wastewater treatment plant located at shanghai china the treatment capacity of which is 200 000 m3 d three samples for the triplicate experiments were obtained at the sampling interval of 24 h according to american water works association standard methods for the examination of water and sewage apha 2009 the basic properties of sludge samples were measured as ph of 6 81 0 05 water content of 78 31 0 40 wt total solid ts of 21 69 0 40 wt and volatile solid vs of 13 54 0 31 wt the raw sludge samples and all the sludge derived samples e g filtrate and extracellular proteins were stored at 4 c in order to eliminate any possible change in physiochemical properties the basic property analysis and dewatering experiments were conducted within 24 h after sampling the other analytical experiments were finished within the subsequent 5 d 2 2 procedures for dewatering of sludge through liquid polarity regulation based on the liquid amendment screening results from our previous work wu et al 2021b acetonitrile was used to promote the solid liquid separation of was in this study 100 g was sample with the water content of 80 was mixed with acetonitrile at the pre determined mass ratio 0 25 1 0 5 1 0 75 1 1 1 and 2 1 after the agitation with specified reaction time the vacuum filtration was conducted at vacuum degree of 0 07 mpa for 30 min the solid content of filtered sludge cake was used to evaluate the dewaterability of acetonitrile amended sludge 2 3 liquid amendment recovery from dewatered sludge cake and filtrate the thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrum ms was applied to determine the temperature and energy consumption for the liquid amendment recovery from sludge cake obtained by vacuum filtration the salting out was tested for the liquid amendment recovery from filtrate according to the hofmeister series lyklema 2009 the multi charged anion e g po4 3 and the singly charged cation e g nh4 and na have the strong salting out capacity considering its wide source and low price the sodium chloride nacl was used as the salting out agent with the dosage of 5 100 of its aqueous solubility the content of residual acetonitrile in aqueous phase was determined by gas chromatography gc oence and gu 1996 and the water content in recovered acetonitrile was measured by karl fischer coulomb method meyer and boyd 1959 2 4 solid liquid interfacial free energy 200 g was sample with the water content of 80 was mixed with acetonitrile at the pre determined mass ratio 0 25 1 0 5 1 0 75 1 1 1 and 2 1 after the agitation for 3 h the vacuum filtration was conducted at vacuum degree of 0 07 mpa for 30 min the obtained sludge cake was freeze dried for the subsequent solid liquid interfacial energy analysis modified according to the previous literature van oss 2006 the detailed procedures are described in text s1 of supplementary materials 2 5 tandem mass tags tmt proteomics of proteins from was the proteins in the liquid phase of was should originate from the microbial zoogloea therefore the up regulation and down regulation of proteins in liquid phase means their down regulation and up regulation in solid phase respectively besides it is hard to extract all the insoluble proteins in solid phase which may lead to the inaccuracy for analyzing the proteins in solid phase thus in order to track the phase transfer features of amphiphilic proteins with liquid polarity regulation the proteins in liquid phase of raw sludge and acetonitrile amended sludge were subjected to tmt proteomics analysis modified by our previous studies wu et al 2017 the general procedures of tmt proteomics analysis included protein isolation reductive alkylation protease digestion isotope labeling pre separation of peptides and bioinformatics analysis the details can be found in text s1 of supplementary materials 2 6 modeling of differential protein 3d structure the 3d structure of differential proteins was predicted utilizing swiss model an online platform for protein homology modeling https swissmodel expasy org bordoli et al 2009 and i tasser model http zhanglab ccmb med umich edu i tasser yang et al 2015 the amino acid sequences of these differential proteins were collected from uniprot database https www uniprot org and input for the above two online platforms in the web based swiss model homology modeling the amino acid sequence data served as a query to search for evolutionary related protein structures against the swiss model template library smtl when the template search was complete templates were ranked according to expected quality of the resulting models as estimated by global model quality estimate gmqe and quaternary structure quality estimate qsqe bordoli et al 2009 the top ranked templates and alignments were compared to verify whether they represent alternative conformational states or cover different regions of the target protein besides the interactive graphical views facilitated the analysis and comparison of available templates in terms of their three dimensional structures sequence similarity and quaternary structure features for the top ranked template a 3d protein model was automatically generated by first transferring conserved atom coordinates as defined by the target template alignment residue coordinates corresponding to insertions deletions in the alignment were generated by loop modeling and a full atom protein model was set up by constructing the non conserved amino acid side chains eventually 3d structure of authoritative target proteins could be displayed in figures the target proteins were additionally determined by i tasser based on the lowest gibbs free energy principle c score is typically in the range of 5 2 a c score 1 5 indicates a correct global topology model the exposure of amino acid residues was characterized by solvent accessibility index the correspondence between secondary structure units and amino acid residues was also predicted by i tasser model 3 results and discussion 3 1 liquid polarity regulation for enhanced dewatering of was process optimization and amendment recovery 3 1 1 process optimization to facilitate the set up of sludge dewatering process through liquid polarity regulation the effectiveness of acetonitrile for sludge filterability improvement was re evaluated according to the results of our previous study wu et al 2021b as shown in fig 1 the solid content of filtered sludge cake first fell and then rose with the increasing addition of acetonitrile accordingly the dielectric constant of liquid phase with different dosages of acetonitrile decreased from 62 31 to 41 00 the highest solid content 68 34 wt was obtained at the mass ratio of acetonitrile and sludge 2 1 and the corresponding dielectric constant of liquid phase was 41 00 the decrease of dielectric constant below 50 could substantially improve the solid liquid separation of was on the contrary the slight decrease in polarity of liquid phase dielectric constant 49 65 62 31 may strengthen the affinity between liquid molecules and low pole non polar solid functional groups brinck et al 1992 wall et al 2007 as a result only the appropriate polarity of liquid phase could significantly eliminate the dipole dipole force among pole compositions in was and positively contribute to the solid liquid separation in addition based on the dosage of acetonitrile and the liquid content of sludge cake the acetonitrile partitioning in filtrate and sludge cake could be determined as shown in fig 1c for the samples with the improved filterability liquid dielectric constants of 47 07 and 41 00 the recovery of acetonitrile from filtrate accounted for the major part of added acetonitrile more than 80 3 1 2 thermal recovery of liquid amendment from mechanically dewatered sludge cake the sludge filterability was significantly improved with the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 and 2 1 therefore the liquid amendment recovery was conducted on these two samples the thermogravimetry coupled with ms analysis was primarily used to determine the volatilization temperature of residual acetonitrile from sludge cake with the constant heating rate 5 c the ms signal peak of acetonitrile was identified at the temperature of 63 9 c fig 2 the release of water was mainly in the range of 60 to 130 c and the ms peak top of water occurred at 112 c the difference in evaporation temperatures of acetonitrile and water allowed these two liquid compositions able to be separated from sludge cake accordingly the differential scanning calorimeter dsc analysis was further performed with heating up to 60 c and then maintained at 60 for 10 min according to the dsc spectra shown in fig 2b and d the weight loss was in accordance with the heat flow peak which reflected that the evaporation of liquid compositions caused the endothermic process the weight loss in the constant temperature section was 8 11 mg and 6 75 mg for the sample with the mass ratios of acetonitrile and sludge 1 1 and 2 1 respectively fig 2b and d the corresponding endothermic values calculated by integration of heat flow curve was 6 48 j fig 2b and 4 56 j fig 2d respectively therefore for the sludge acetonitrile mass ratios of 1 1 and 2 1 the energy consumptions for unit weight loss at the constant temperature section 60 c were calculated to be 799 0 j g and 675 1 j g respectively the energy consumption for acetonitrile evaporation from sludge cake varied in the percentage of acetonitrile in the total liquid fraction but was much lower than the evaporation enthalpy of water 2675 2 j g lide 2007 in another word compared with the conventional sludge drying process the newly proposed sludge dewatering process based on liquid polarity regulation could have the significant advantage in energy saving 3 1 3 salting out for liquid amendment recovery from filtrate when the salt compounds dissociate in aqueous solutions some of the water molecules are attracted by the salt ions which decreases the number of water molecules available to interact with the soluble organic compounds through hydrogen bond or other non chemical bonds e g orientation force lyklema 2009 in order to non thermally recover the acetonitrile without phase transformation the salting out process was evaluated by its phase balance feature to determine the immiscibility of acetonitrile with aqueous nacl solution as shown in fig 3a the nacl addition induced the two separated phases in the filtrate the upper layer was the organic phase with the lower density than water and the lower layer was aqueous phase according to the data in fig 3b the percentage of upper layer organic phase acetonitrile in the total acetonitrile increased with the nacl dosage increasing from 7 5 to 60 of its solubility when the nacl dosage was over 60 of its solubility there was no significant increase of acetonitrile separated out from aqueous phase also as shown in fig 3c and d the absolute contents of water in organic phase and acetonitrile in aqueous phase both decreased with the increasing addition of nacl the mass fraction of acetonitrile in the lower layer aqueous phase could be as low as 8 28 0 45 wt the maximum recovery efficiency of 91 7 4 9 for acetonitrile could be realized with 75 of the saturated nacl concentration the above results indicated that salting out could recover more than 90 of the acetonitrile in filtrate although the residual acetonitrile in aqueous phase may still need the deeply recovery by distillation yet a lot of energy could be saved through salting out most of aqueous amendment specifically acetonitrile may also react with the complex sludge components e g inorganic acids or hydrogen sulfide which may limit the recovery efficiency of acetonitrile and be worth to be further considered in the future studies 3 2 surface tension and interfacial free energy of solid and liquid phases of acetonitrile amended was the mechanism of enhanced dewatering of was was primarily investigated from the perspective of solid liquid interfacial affinity the surface free energy of solid liquid phases and the solid liquid interfacial free energy were systematically analyzed with the varying liquid polarity 3 2 1 surface tension of solid phase surface tension or surface free energy quantitatively characterizes the disruption of intermolecular bonds that occurs when a surface is created van oss 2006 in the physics of solids surfaces must be intrinsically less energetically favorable than the bulk of a material the molecules on the surface have more energy compared with the molecules in the bulk of the material otherwise there would be a driving force for surfaces to be created removing the bulk of the material van oss 2006 the variation of surface tension reflects the dispersivity of solid compositions and determines the solid aggregation states which further affects the water holding capacity of sludge flocs wu et al 2021a the solid surface tension of acetonitrile treated sludge was presented by fig 4a it was notable that the non polar item van der waals force of surface tension kept increasing from 30 79 mn m to 38 22 mn m when the mass ratio of acetonitrile and sludge ranged from 0 to 2 1 while the polar item lewis acid base force of surface tension was transformed from negative into positive as the mass ratio rose beyond 0 75 1 the solid liquid separation performance of was was just improved when the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio was higher than 0 75 1 therefore it can be inferred that the polar force in surface tension dominated the interfacial affinity and the reduction in the absolute value of polar force could positively contribute to the solid liquid separation in addition it was quite obvious that the absolute value of the non polar item was larger than that of the polar item the total surface tension of solid phase is equal to the sum of the above mentioned two items therefore its trend was in accordance with that of the non polar item which increased from 19 41 mn m to 42 21 mn m in general the increasing surface tension meant that the energy requirement to disperse the solid compositions was increasing li et al 2022 which reflected that the solid aggregation states of acetonitrile amended was was denser than that of raw sludge this result was also consistent with our previous study wu et al 2021b the acetonitrile may decrease the hydrophobic interaction of proteins and strengthened the peptide peptide hydrogen bond causing the denaturation of proteins kunihiko and eiji 1998 as a result the denatured proteins could aggregate and precipitate in solid phase which excluded out the interstitial water and removed the hydration layer 3 2 2 surface tension of liquid phase in order to track how the liquid polarity reduction influenced the wettability of liquid surrounding the solid particles the surface free energy of liquid phase containing different contents of acetonitrile was also investigated fig 4b it was found that the non polar item of surface free energy kept a steady uplift from 21 80 to 24 56 mn m in contrast to solid phase the polar item of surface free energy of liquid phase occupied a major part of the total surface free energy and it decreased substantially with the increasing fraction of acetonitrile from 51 00 to 24 93 mn m which was almost half of that of pure water lide 2007 when acetonitrile is the solute species it exhibits a propensity to reside on the water acetonitrile nanocluster surface otherwise when water is at the low fraction it tends to be solvated in the interior of clusters and form aggregates molinero et al 1998 the hydrogen bond between acetonitrile and water molecules can induce the strong structural correlations in the cluster interior espinosa et al 2000 in this study when increasing the acetonitrile fraction the water acetonitrile miscibility process was actually the dispersion of water molecules in acetonitrile phase the original compact water sub cluster could evolve into a highly irregular chainlike molecular cluster that invaded the continuous phase of acetonitrile espinosa et al 2000 moreau and douhéret 1976 correspondingly the three dimensional network weakened which resulted in the lower surface free energy of acetonitrile water binary system than that of pure water the lower surface free energy of liquid usually tends to be with the higher wettability molinero et al 1998 thus the acetonitrile water mixture more likely penetrated into porous structure when the mass ratio of acetonitrile and water increased which meant that the mixture had the potentials to devastate protein hydration shell through taking place of vicinal water 3 2 3 interfacial free energy of solid liquid phase interfacial free energy of solid liquid phase could be positive or negative the negative interfacial free energy means an interfacial repulsion e g hydrophobic otherwise an attraction tends to occur alluding to as hydration pressure oss 1991 as shown in fig 4c it could be found that the non polar and polar items had the similar trend as the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio increased both of these two subitems of interfacial free energy rose first and then decreased which indicated that the solid liquid affinity was enhanced first and then weakened with the decreasing liquid polarity this trend corresponded to the improvement of filterability measured in 3 1 1 but the polar item was the vast majority of total interfacial free energy as a result the total solid liquid interfacial free energy generally became more negative with the increasing addition of acetonitrile which indicated that the solid and liquid in the mixture were more likely to repel each other and separate in addition there was no obvious discrepancy in the interfacial free energy with acetonitrile sludge mass ratio higher than 0 75 1 for the system with multiple phases the molecules on the solid liquid interface simultaneously interact with the molecules from solid phase and liquid phase the intermolecular force from the different phases may not necessarily offset each other which resulted in the interfacial free energy van oss 2006 the recent literature also reported that the ionized functional groups of surfactants could adsorb on the surface charged sludge particles and accordingly increased the non polar interfacial free energy li et al 2022 thus it could be inferred that the interfacial characteristics may depend more on the migration of solid surface compositions especially the amphiphilic proteins between solid and liquid phases the phase crossing of amphiphilic proteins were investigated in the following sections 3 3 phase transfer of amphiphilic proteins with liquid polarity reduction of was the proteins are the significant amphiphilic macromolecules determining the water holding capacity of was in order to reveal the phase transfer characteristics of amphiphilic proteins the liquid compositions of raw sludge and acetonitrile amended sludge were subjected to the proteomics analysis the specific types origins and functions of proteins contained in the liquid phase was primarily clarified based on go classification a total of 9255 protein groups were identified as shown in fig 5 the identified proteins were involved in various biological processes including cellular process metabolism process location biological regulation response to stimulus and biological adhesion most of the identified proteins were originally derived from intracellular part and cellular anatomical entity including cell surface membrane associated proteins or membrane protein complex some proteins were also determined to be originally located at extracellular regions fig 5b the go analysis of the identified molecular functions indicated that the proteins were primarily associated with the four categories catalytic activity binding transporter activity and structural molecule activity fig 5c as the filterability of was was deteriorated and improved at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratios of 0 25 1 and 1 1 respectively the sludge samples with these two acetonitrile dosages were comparatively analyzed with the raw sludge sample to track the differential proteins the proteins isolated from the liquid phase of acetonitrile amended sludge at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratios of 0 25 1 and 1 1 are labeled as las 0 25 and las 1 respectively for the las 1 sample a total of 1646 proteins were quantified as exhibiting a 0 83 or 1 20 fold change compared with raw sludge of these 793 proteins were found to be significantly down regulated and the other 853 proteins were up regulated figs s2 and s3 of supplementary materials for the las 0 25 sample the numbers of up regulated and down regulated proteins were 548 and 629 respectively and the total number of differential proteins was 1177 figs s2 and s3 the differential proteins were essentially categorized according to the go classification based on biological processes of metabolism process molecular functions of catalytic activity and binding and cellular components of membrane protein complex in particular the proteins involved in go classification of biological adhesion extracellular region and membrane protein complex should be crucial to the aggregation states and water holding capacities of microbial aggregates peng et al 2015 wu et al 2017 therefore the differential proteins classified as these go classifications were typically analyzed tables s5 s8 of supplementary materials compared with raw sludge the cadherin like domain containing protein m4 family metallopeptidase phosphate abc transporter protein cytochrome c oxidase dipeptide binding protein enolase f0f1 atp synthase flagellar motor protein hypothetical protein outer membrane beta barrel protein peptide abc transporter substrate binding protein abc transporter substrate binding protein atp synthase and ompa family protein were up regulated for las 1 but no change for las 0 25 table s5 s8 of supplementary materials therefore those up regulated proteins in the liquid phase could be related to the improved solid liquid separation performance of was at the mass ratio of acetonitrile and sludge 1 1 especially most of the differential proteins involved in the go classifications of membrane protein complex table s7 and membrane protein complex outer membrane table s8 were up regulated in las 1 but no change for las 0 25 for example outer membrane beta barrel protein is the typical beta barrel protein that crosses the cellular membrane of gram negative bacteria and acts as the membrane pore rigel and silhavy 2012 through the membrane pore composed of outer membrane beta barrel protein some small metabolites like sugars ions and amino acids can diffuse rogers 1960 the up regulated outer membrane beta barrel protein in the liquid phase was the typical sign of cell membrane lysis this result implied that the damage of cell membrane structure should facilitate the solid liquid separation of was the flagellin phosphopyruvate hydratase pilin f0f1 atp synthase membrane bound atp synthase and enolase were up regulated or down regulated for las 0 25 but no change for las 1 tables s5 s8 of supplementary materials also these differential proteins were mainly involved in the go classifications of extracellular region extracellular region cell surface which reflected that the phase transfer of extracellular proteins posed negative effects on the solid liquid separation of was table s5 additionally a specific protein might involve multiple biological processes or molecular functions except for the go classifications of extracellular region cell surface some of the down regulated proteins for las 0 25 for example f0f1 atp synthase subunit alpha membrane bound atp synthase and phosphate abc transporter substrate binding protein were classified in anion binding and transmembrane transporter activity the surface of solid compositions of was is always negatively charged wei et al 2018 the transfer of anion binding proteins from liquid phase to solid phase may result in the higher affinity of solid compositions with multiple charge anions and further be adverse to the flocculation of was flocs schwierz et al 2010 as a result the solid liquid separation of was was inhibited with the precipitation of anion binding proteins from liquid phase to solid phase in general all the above differential proteins could be classified into two categories one had the relatively higher content in the liquid phase at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 0 25 1 than 1 1 and another had the relatively higher content in the liquid phase at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 than 0 25 1 the conformational features of the above two differential protein categories were separately investigated to further explore the phase transfer mechanism from the perspective of molecular structure also the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of above differential proteins could be explained by the relative position relationships among hydrophobic hydrophilic secondary protein structure units 3 4 structure attributes of amphiphilic proteins for the phase transfer feature the partitioning of amphiphilic proteins in liquid and solid phases depends on the conformational features and their interactions with liquid molecules schein 1990 figs 6 and 7 shows the structure information of core differential proteins involved in those go classifications that were thought to be closely related to sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 most of the down regulated amphiphilic proteins at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 0 25 1 exhibit the conformational features that the central hydrophobic β sheet is surrounded by the hydrophilic α helix fig 6 the structure consists of β sheets laid in a relatively hydrophobic core regime with hydrophilic α helices distributed to the periphery or margins with the decreasing liquid polarity the molecular affinities between water molecule and hydrophilic α helix was weakened as a result the hydration layer of proteins was removed the condensation of proteins occurred due to the polar force among the hydrophilic edge units of macromolecules schein 1990 the proteins of which the concentration in liquid phase were up regulated at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 commonly have the parallel α helix and β barrel structure units fig 7 in their structural domains the hydrophilic α helices that can interact with water flank the hydrophobic β sheets thus the solubility of those up regulated proteins was not inhibited with the decreasing polarity of liquid phase on the contrary no matter the solvent molecule was polar or non polar the adjacently distributed α helix and β sheet could interact with the polar and non polar solvent molecules respectively which helped the solubilization of amphiphilic proteins and led to the up regulation of those proteins in liquid phase fig 7 schein 1990 in addition those proteins which had the relatively higher content in the liquid phase at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 than that at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 0 25 1 exhibited the higher solvent accessibility index in the range of 1 47 2 72 table s9 of supplementary materials 9 of 13 up regulated proteins at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 had the average solvent accessibility index over 1 8 however 4 of 7 down regulated proteins in fig 6 was below 1 8 table s10 of supplementary materials this phenomenon indicated that the proteins with more exposed amino acid residues tended to dissolve in the liquid phase with the lower polarity conversely the buried amino acid residues should induce the precipitation of proteins in the solid phase with the decreasing liquid polarity the exposure of amino acid residue is the dominant feature of the tertiary structures the significant discrepancy in the relative spatial relationship of secondary structures i e hydrophilic a helix or hydrophobic β sheet tables s9 and s10 of supplementary materials played a pivotal role in the phase distribution of amphiphilic proteins which further dominated the compositions and molecular interactions at solid liquid interface 3 5 environmental implications from a theoretical standpoint the extracellular proteins were previously determined to be the main water holding components of was cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 shao et al 2009 yu et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 accordingly the chemical compositions molecular conformation and micro spatial distribution of extracellular proteins should significantly affect the dewaterability of was the chemical compositions of extracellular proteins have been systematically investigated by previous studies wu et al 2017 in this study the levels of proteins in the liquid phase were analyzed by comparative proteomics i e tmt proteomics to reflect the phase transfer of proteins from solid phase to liquid phase with the decreasing liquid polarity the dewaterability of was was first deteriorated and then improved accordingly the phase transfer features of amphiphilic proteins with the deteriorated and enhanced sludge dewaterability should be different identifying this difference could unveil the mechanism behind the deteriorated enhanced sludge dewaterability from the perspective of phase distribution of amphiphilic proteins also the phase distribution of amphiphilic proteins with the varying liquid polarity should depend on the molecular conformation the common features for those amphiphilic proteins with up regulated liquid levels or down regulated liquid levels were separately identified thus it could be concluded that the molecular structure of amphiphilic proteins influences the sludge dewaterability through determining the phase distribution of amphiphilic proteins that would be the potential linkage between amphiphilic protein conformation and was dewaterability from a practical standpoint the default approaches to improve was dewaterability through modifying the solid compositions e g neutralizing the surface charge of particles by coagulation eliminating the solid surface hydrophilicity by aops or thermal treatment requiring large chemicals or energy inputs furthermore the conventional conditioning chemicals cannot be recycled this study proposed an approach to improve sludge dewaterability by modifying the physical property of liquid phase which made it possible to recycle the conditioning amendments by salting out and distillation also it is anticipated that the enhanced solid liquid separation without altering the chemical compositions of was would not pose negative effects on the subsequent treatment or utilization of was 4 conclusions this study examined the effectiveness of liquid polarity regulation for enhanced solid liquid separation of was the filterability of was could be improved by 70 with the dielectric constant below 50 the dsc coupled with ms identified that the liquid amendment acetonitrile could evaporate from filter sludge cake at around 60 c and the corresponding energy consumptions for unit weight loss at the constant temperature section 60 c was calculated to be at most 799 0 j g which was substantially lower than that of sludge drying process the salting out process was verified to realize the maximum recovery efficiency of 91 7 4 9 for acetonitrile with 75 of nacl solubility all these results open up a novel option for enhanced solid liquid separation of was through decreasing the polarity of liquid phase the great potentials in energy saving and recycle of chemicals make it expected to act as alternatives for the conventional mechanically dewatering drying process regarding the mechanism investigation the tmt proteomics tracked the solubilization of proteins involved in go classifications of membrane protein complex and membrane protein complex outer membrane which should be in favor of the enhanced solid liquid separation of was the conformational analysis of those differential proteins was conducted to reveal the structure attributes of amphiphilic proteins for the phase transfer feature the proteins with more exposed amino acid residues tended to dissolve in the liquid phase with the lower polarity which was accompanied with the reduced interfacial free energy of was on the contrary the buried amino acid residues e g the central hydrophobic β sheet is surrounded by the hydrophilic α helix could induce the precipitation of proteins in the solid phase with the decreasing liquid polarity the conformational analysis of amphiphilic proteins significantly deepened the mechanism understanding of the migration of interfacial compositions and provided the in depth interpretation of reducing the

15759,this study proposed that decreasing liquid polarity could weaken the intermolecular polar force at solid liquid interface of waste activated sludge was accordingly a process for enhanced sludge dewatering through liquid polarity regulation was established the liquid polarity was quantified by dielectric constant and the decrease of liquid dielectric constant below 50 was found to significantly improve the solid liquid separation performance of was in terms of filterability by 70 the differential scanning calorimeter dsc coupled with mass spectrum ms identified that 60 c was the appropriate temperature for liquid amendment i e acetonitrile recovery from filtered sludge cake and the corresponding energy consumption was calculated to be at most 799 0 j g which was substantially lower than that of water evaporation by sludge drying the nacl addition with 75 of saturated concentration could non thermally recover 91 7 4 9 of acetonitrile amendment from filtrate by salting out the great potentials in energy saving and recycle of chemicals make the newly proposed approach act as alternatives for the conventional process i e mechanically dewatering drying regarding the mechanism of liquid polarity regulation for enhanced was dewatering the solid liquid interfacial free energy was found to be reduced by 39 4 with the liquid dielectric constant decreasing from 78 50 to 41 00 also tandem mass tags tmt proteomics tracked the phase transfer of amphiphilic proteins with decreasing liquid polarity which found that the solubilization of proteins involved in the gene ontology go classifications of membrane protein complex and membrane protein complex outer membrane could facilitate the enhanced solid liquid separation of was the conformational analysis on those differential proteins was further conducted to reveal the structure attributes of amphiphilic proteins for the phase transfer feature the proteins with more exposed amino acid residues i e average solvent accessibility index over 1 8 tended to dissolve in the liquid phase with lower polarity which was accompanied with the reduced interfacial free energy of was on the contrary the proteins with buried amino acid residues e g the central hydrophobic β sheet is surrounded by the hydrophilic α helix precipitated in the solid phase with the decreasing liquid polarity all these findings are expected to create a novel option for dewatering was with recyclable liquid conditioning agents and provide the improved mechanistic insights into the migration of interfacial compositions controlling the dewaterability of was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge dewatering liquid polarity interfacial free energy protein conformation 1 introduction activated sludge process is the most widely applied technology worldwide for wastewater treatment due to its high adaptability to influent quality flexible operation mode and stable process performance wu et al 2020 however waste activated sludge was an inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment containing various toxic substances such as pathogens heavy metals and some organic contaminants is of concern to the secondary pollution control for biological wastewater treatments feng et al 2015 thus the appropriate handling of was is crucial for the sustainable development of social water cycle an effective dewatering process can minimize the sludge volume facilitate the transportation and enhance the energy efficiency of thermochemical treatment of was wong et al 2016 therefore dewatering is the common key technical unit of various was disposal routines however was is a colloidal mixture consisting of microorganisms mainly bacteria embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps christensen et al 2015 which is difficult to be dewatered due to the fact that highly hydrated bio polymers exert determinate effects on the colloid stability of microbial aggregation and bind a large volume of water i e bound water within the sludge flocs zhang et al 2016 as option to improve the was dewaterability the coagulation flocculation wei et al 2018 sonication feng et al 2009 microwave yu et al 2009 electrolysis zhen et al 2013 and advanced oxidation processes aops xu et al 2016 yu et al 2016 have been suggested to be effective the previous reports recognized that the water holding capacities of was could be eliminated by reducing the micro porosity of bio flocs and removing the hydrophilic surface functional groups of solid compositions li et al 2020 however the research on quantitative relationships among the surface charge properties particle size distribution porosity and chemical compositions of was is still insufficient the non selective aops and thermal treatment processes cannot realize the targeted removal of hydrophilic molecular structure therefore there is still lack of theoretical basis to optimize the existing sludge conditioning process as a result the high dosages of chemicals e g aops reagents and inorganic coagulants 10 30 wt of sludge dry matter large energy consumption e g sonication 600 800 kj kg sludge dry matter and cyclic freezing thawing 10 000 11 000 kj kg target removed water and potential secondary pollution risks e g corrosiveness of chlorine ferrous containing compounds limited the wide application and efficiency improvement of previously reported approaches wu et al 2020 the previous studies found that the extracellular proteins of was are the amphiphilic macromolecules containing hydrophilic α helix and hydrophobic β sheet secondary structure units wu et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 the amphiphilic proteins play more important roles in determining dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 shao et al 2009 yu et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 the hydrophilic molecular units have the affinity with water molecules and the hydrophobic molecular units are compatible with other hydrophobic substances e g cellulose or lipids as a result the amphiphilic components wrap the hydrophobic components to form a colloidal structure stably suspending in water peng et al 2021 wu et al 2021a since the water molecule is polar the hydrophilic molecular units should be polar according to the theory of like dissolves like jiang et al 2004 accordingly the decrease in liquid polarity may eliminate the affinity of polar functional groups with non polar low polar liquid molecules following this principle our recent publication has verified that decreasing liquid polarity through water soluble solvent amendment e g methanol acetone and acetonitrile could enhance the solid liquid separation of was wu et al 2021b however there are still lack of effective approaches for solvent recovery from dewatered sludge cake and filtrate furthermore the phase transfer of key water holding components i e amphiphilic proteins with the varying liquid polarity remains unexplored also the molecular structure attributes of amphiphilic proteins for the phase transfer feature and its potential effects on the solid liquid interfacial energy of was are still unclear the objectives of the present study are i to develop the non thermal method for water soluble organic amendment recovery from filtrate of was and facilitate the set up of sludge dewatering process that can recycle the liquid conditioning chemicals ii to identify the phase transfer feature of extracellular amphiphilic proteins with the varying liquid polarity of was iii to reveal the mechanism of how the molecular structure of extracellular amphiphilic proteins determined its phase partition in liquid with varying polarity iv to unveil the potential implications of phase transfer and molecular evolution of amphiphilic proteins to the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of biological aggregation all these results are expected to create novel insights into the solid water affinity of was and provide an alternative technology for the enhanced solid liquid separation of was 2 materials and methods 2 1 was samples for the further deeply dewatering in this study the mechanically dewatered sludge samples were collected from the belt press filter dewatering unit of a municipal wastewater treatment plant located at shanghai china the treatment capacity of which is 200 000 m3 d three samples for the triplicate experiments were obtained at the sampling interval of 24 h according to american water works association standard methods for the examination of water and sewage apha 2009 the basic properties of sludge samples were measured as ph of 6 81 0 05 water content of 78 31 0 40 wt total solid ts of 21 69 0 40 wt and volatile solid vs of 13 54 0 31 wt the raw sludge samples and all the sludge derived samples e g filtrate and extracellular proteins were stored at 4 c in order to eliminate any possible change in physiochemical properties the basic property analysis and dewatering experiments were conducted within 24 h after sampling the other analytical experiments were finished within the subsequent 5 d 2 2 procedures for dewatering of sludge through liquid polarity regulation based on the liquid amendment screening results from our previous work wu et al 2021b acetonitrile was used to promote the solid liquid separation of was in this study 100 g was sample with the water content of 80 was mixed with acetonitrile at the pre determined mass ratio 0 25 1 0 5 1 0 75 1 1 1 and 2 1 after the agitation with specified reaction time the vacuum filtration was conducted at vacuum degree of 0 07 mpa for 30 min the solid content of filtered sludge cake was used to evaluate the dewaterability of acetonitrile amended sludge 2 3 liquid amendment recovery from dewatered sludge cake and filtrate the thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrum ms was applied to determine the temperature and energy consumption for the liquid amendment recovery from sludge cake obtained by vacuum filtration the salting out was tested for the liquid amendment recovery from filtrate according to the hofmeister series lyklema 2009 the multi charged anion e g po4 3 and the singly charged cation e g nh4 and na have the strong salting out capacity considering its wide source and low price the sodium chloride nacl was used as the salting out agent with the dosage of 5 100 of its aqueous solubility the content of residual acetonitrile in aqueous phase was determined by gas chromatography gc oence and gu 1996 and the water content in recovered acetonitrile was measured by karl fischer coulomb method meyer and boyd 1959 2 4 solid liquid interfacial free energy 200 g was sample with the water content of 80 was mixed with acetonitrile at the pre determined mass ratio 0 25 1 0 5 1 0 75 1 1 1 and 2 1 after the agitation for 3 h the vacuum filtration was conducted at vacuum degree of 0 07 mpa for 30 min the obtained sludge cake was freeze dried for the subsequent solid liquid interfacial energy analysis modified according to the previous literature van oss 2006 the detailed procedures are described in text s1 of supplementary materials 2 5 tandem mass tags tmt proteomics of proteins from was the proteins in the liquid phase of was should originate from the microbial zoogloea therefore the up regulation and down regulation of proteins in liquid phase means their down regulation and up regulation in solid phase respectively besides it is hard to extract all the insoluble proteins in solid phase which may lead to the inaccuracy for analyzing the proteins in solid phase thus in order to track the phase transfer features of amphiphilic proteins with liquid polarity regulation the proteins in liquid phase of raw sludge and acetonitrile amended sludge were subjected to tmt proteomics analysis modified by our previous studies wu et al 2017 the general procedures of tmt proteomics analysis included protein isolation reductive alkylation protease digestion isotope labeling pre separation of peptides and bioinformatics analysis the details can be found in text s1 of supplementary materials 2 6 modeling of differential protein 3d structure the 3d structure of differential proteins was predicted utilizing swiss model an online platform for protein homology modeling https swissmodel expasy org bordoli et al 2009 and i tasser model http zhanglab ccmb med umich edu i tasser yang et al 2015 the amino acid sequences of these differential proteins were collected from uniprot database https www uniprot org and input for the above two online platforms in the web based swiss model homology modeling the amino acid sequence data served as a query to search for evolutionary related protein structures against the swiss model template library smtl when the template search was complete templates were ranked according to expected quality of the resulting models as estimated by global model quality estimate gmqe and quaternary structure quality estimate qsqe bordoli et al 2009 the top ranked templates and alignments were compared to verify whether they represent alternative conformational states or cover different regions of the target protein besides the interactive graphical views facilitated the analysis and comparison of available templates in terms of their three dimensional structures sequence similarity and quaternary structure features for the top ranked template a 3d protein model was automatically generated by first transferring conserved atom coordinates as defined by the target template alignment residue coordinates corresponding to insertions deletions in the alignment were generated by loop modeling and a full atom protein model was set up by constructing the non conserved amino acid side chains eventually 3d structure of authoritative target proteins could be displayed in figures the target proteins were additionally determined by i tasser based on the lowest gibbs free energy principle c score is typically in the range of 5 2 a c score 1 5 indicates a correct global topology model the exposure of amino acid residues was characterized by solvent accessibility index the correspondence between secondary structure units and amino acid residues was also predicted by i tasser model 3 results and discussion 3 1 liquid polarity regulation for enhanced dewatering of was process optimization and amendment recovery 3 1 1 process optimization to facilitate the set up of sludge dewatering process through liquid polarity regulation the effectiveness of acetonitrile for sludge filterability improvement was re evaluated according to the results of our previous study wu et al 2021b as shown in fig 1 the solid content of filtered sludge cake first fell and then rose with the increasing addition of acetonitrile accordingly the dielectric constant of liquid phase with different dosages of acetonitrile decreased from 62 31 to 41 00 the highest solid content 68 34 wt was obtained at the mass ratio of acetonitrile and sludge 2 1 and the corresponding dielectric constant of liquid phase was 41 00 the decrease of dielectric constant below 50 could substantially improve the solid liquid separation of was on the contrary the slight decrease in polarity of liquid phase dielectric constant 49 65 62 31 may strengthen the affinity between liquid molecules and low pole non polar solid functional groups brinck et al 1992 wall et al 2007 as a result only the appropriate polarity of liquid phase could significantly eliminate the dipole dipole force among pole compositions in was and positively contribute to the solid liquid separation in addition based on the dosage of acetonitrile and the liquid content of sludge cake the acetonitrile partitioning in filtrate and sludge cake could be determined as shown in fig 1c for the samples with the improved filterability liquid dielectric constants of 47 07 and 41 00 the recovery of acetonitrile from filtrate accounted for the major part of added acetonitrile more than 80 3 1 2 thermal recovery of liquid amendment from mechanically dewatered sludge cake the sludge filterability was significantly improved with the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 and 2 1 therefore the liquid amendment recovery was conducted on these two samples the thermogravimetry coupled with ms analysis was primarily used to determine the volatilization temperature of residual acetonitrile from sludge cake with the constant heating rate 5 c the ms signal peak of acetonitrile was identified at the temperature of 63 9 c fig 2 the release of water was mainly in the range of 60 to 130 c and the ms peak top of water occurred at 112 c the difference in evaporation temperatures of acetonitrile and water allowed these two liquid compositions able to be separated from sludge cake accordingly the differential scanning calorimeter dsc analysis was further performed with heating up to 60 c and then maintained at 60 for 10 min according to the dsc spectra shown in fig 2b and d the weight loss was in accordance with the heat flow peak which reflected that the evaporation of liquid compositions caused the endothermic process the weight loss in the constant temperature section was 8 11 mg and 6 75 mg for the sample with the mass ratios of acetonitrile and sludge 1 1 and 2 1 respectively fig 2b and d the corresponding endothermic values calculated by integration of heat flow curve was 6 48 j fig 2b and 4 56 j fig 2d respectively therefore for the sludge acetonitrile mass ratios of 1 1 and 2 1 the energy consumptions for unit weight loss at the constant temperature section 60 c were calculated to be 799 0 j g and 675 1 j g respectively the energy consumption for acetonitrile evaporation from sludge cake varied in the percentage of acetonitrile in the total liquid fraction but was much lower than the evaporation enthalpy of water 2675 2 j g lide 2007 in another word compared with the conventional sludge drying process the newly proposed sludge dewatering process based on liquid polarity regulation could have the significant advantage in energy saving 3 1 3 salting out for liquid amendment recovery from filtrate when the salt compounds dissociate in aqueous solutions some of the water molecules are attracted by the salt ions which decreases the number of water molecules available to interact with the soluble organic compounds through hydrogen bond or other non chemical bonds e g orientation force lyklema 2009 in order to non thermally recover the acetonitrile without phase transformation the salting out process was evaluated by its phase balance feature to determine the immiscibility of acetonitrile with aqueous nacl solution as shown in fig 3a the nacl addition induced the two separated phases in the filtrate the upper layer was the organic phase with the lower density than water and the lower layer was aqueous phase according to the data in fig 3b the percentage of upper layer organic phase acetonitrile in the total acetonitrile increased with the nacl dosage increasing from 7 5 to 60 of its solubility when the nacl dosage was over 60 of its solubility there was no significant increase of acetonitrile separated out from aqueous phase also as shown in fig 3c and d the absolute contents of water in organic phase and acetonitrile in aqueous phase both decreased with the increasing addition of nacl the mass fraction of acetonitrile in the lower layer aqueous phase could be as low as 8 28 0 45 wt the maximum recovery efficiency of 91 7 4 9 for acetonitrile could be realized with 75 of the saturated nacl concentration the above results indicated that salting out could recover more than 90 of the acetonitrile in filtrate although the residual acetonitrile in aqueous phase may still need the deeply recovery by distillation yet a lot of energy could be saved through salting out most of aqueous amendment specifically acetonitrile may also react with the complex sludge components e g inorganic acids or hydrogen sulfide which may limit the recovery efficiency of acetonitrile and be worth to be further considered in the future studies 3 2 surface tension and interfacial free energy of solid and liquid phases of acetonitrile amended was the mechanism of enhanced dewatering of was was primarily investigated from the perspective of solid liquid interfacial affinity the surface free energy of solid liquid phases and the solid liquid interfacial free energy were systematically analyzed with the varying liquid polarity 3 2 1 surface tension of solid phase surface tension or surface free energy quantitatively characterizes the disruption of intermolecular bonds that occurs when a surface is created van oss 2006 in the physics of solids surfaces must be intrinsically less energetically favorable than the bulk of a material the molecules on the surface have more energy compared with the molecules in the bulk of the material otherwise there would be a driving force for surfaces to be created removing the bulk of the material van oss 2006 the variation of surface tension reflects the dispersivity of solid compositions and determines the solid aggregation states which further affects the water holding capacity of sludge flocs wu et al 2021a the solid surface tension of acetonitrile treated sludge was presented by fig 4a it was notable that the non polar item van der waals force of surface tension kept increasing from 30 79 mn m to 38 22 mn m when the mass ratio of acetonitrile and sludge ranged from 0 to 2 1 while the polar item lewis acid base force of surface tension was transformed from negative into positive as the mass ratio rose beyond 0 75 1 the solid liquid separation performance of was was just improved when the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio was higher than 0 75 1 therefore it can be inferred that the polar force in surface tension dominated the interfacial affinity and the reduction in the absolute value of polar force could positively contribute to the solid liquid separation in addition it was quite obvious that the absolute value of the non polar item was larger than that of the polar item the total surface tension of solid phase is equal to the sum of the above mentioned two items therefore its trend was in accordance with that of the non polar item which increased from 19 41 mn m to 42 21 mn m in general the increasing surface tension meant that the energy requirement to disperse the solid compositions was increasing li et al 2022 which reflected that the solid aggregation states of acetonitrile amended was was denser than that of raw sludge this result was also consistent with our previous study wu et al 2021b the acetonitrile may decrease the hydrophobic interaction of proteins and strengthened the peptide peptide hydrogen bond causing the denaturation of proteins kunihiko and eiji 1998 as a result the denatured proteins could aggregate and precipitate in solid phase which excluded out the interstitial water and removed the hydration layer 3 2 2 surface tension of liquid phase in order to track how the liquid polarity reduction influenced the wettability of liquid surrounding the solid particles the surface free energy of liquid phase containing different contents of acetonitrile was also investigated fig 4b it was found that the non polar item of surface free energy kept a steady uplift from 21 80 to 24 56 mn m in contrast to solid phase the polar item of surface free energy of liquid phase occupied a major part of the total surface free energy and it decreased substantially with the increasing fraction of acetonitrile from 51 00 to 24 93 mn m which was almost half of that of pure water lide 2007 when acetonitrile is the solute species it exhibits a propensity to reside on the water acetonitrile nanocluster surface otherwise when water is at the low fraction it tends to be solvated in the interior of clusters and form aggregates molinero et al 1998 the hydrogen bond between acetonitrile and water molecules can induce the strong structural correlations in the cluster interior espinosa et al 2000 in this study when increasing the acetonitrile fraction the water acetonitrile miscibility process was actually the dispersion of water molecules in acetonitrile phase the original compact water sub cluster could evolve into a highly irregular chainlike molecular cluster that invaded the continuous phase of acetonitrile espinosa et al 2000 moreau and douhéret 1976 correspondingly the three dimensional network weakened which resulted in the lower surface free energy of acetonitrile water binary system than that of pure water the lower surface free energy of liquid usually tends to be with the higher wettability molinero et al 1998 thus the acetonitrile water mixture more likely penetrated into porous structure when the mass ratio of acetonitrile and water increased which meant that the mixture had the potentials to devastate protein hydration shell through taking place of vicinal water 3 2 3 interfacial free energy of solid liquid phase interfacial free energy of solid liquid phase could be positive or negative the negative interfacial free energy means an interfacial repulsion e g hydrophobic otherwise an attraction tends to occur alluding to as hydration pressure oss 1991 as shown in fig 4c it could be found that the non polar and polar items had the similar trend as the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio increased both of these two subitems of interfacial free energy rose first and then decreased which indicated that the solid liquid affinity was enhanced first and then weakened with the decreasing liquid polarity this trend corresponded to the improvement of filterability measured in 3 1 1 but the polar item was the vast majority of total interfacial free energy as a result the total solid liquid interfacial free energy generally became more negative with the increasing addition of acetonitrile which indicated that the solid and liquid in the mixture were more likely to repel each other and separate in addition there was no obvious discrepancy in the interfacial free energy with acetonitrile sludge mass ratio higher than 0 75 1 for the system with multiple phases the molecules on the solid liquid interface simultaneously interact with the molecules from solid phase and liquid phase the intermolecular force from the different phases may not necessarily offset each other which resulted in the interfacial free energy van oss 2006 the recent literature also reported that the ionized functional groups of surfactants could adsorb on the surface charged sludge particles and accordingly increased the non polar interfacial free energy li et al 2022 thus it could be inferred that the interfacial characteristics may depend more on the migration of solid surface compositions especially the amphiphilic proteins between solid and liquid phases the phase crossing of amphiphilic proteins were investigated in the following sections 3 3 phase transfer of amphiphilic proteins with liquid polarity reduction of was the proteins are the significant amphiphilic macromolecules determining the water holding capacity of was in order to reveal the phase transfer characteristics of amphiphilic proteins the liquid compositions of raw sludge and acetonitrile amended sludge were subjected to the proteomics analysis the specific types origins and functions of proteins contained in the liquid phase was primarily clarified based on go classification a total of 9255 protein groups were identified as shown in fig 5 the identified proteins were involved in various biological processes including cellular process metabolism process location biological regulation response to stimulus and biological adhesion most of the identified proteins were originally derived from intracellular part and cellular anatomical entity including cell surface membrane associated proteins or membrane protein complex some proteins were also determined to be originally located at extracellular regions fig 5b the go analysis of the identified molecular functions indicated that the proteins were primarily associated with the four categories catalytic activity binding transporter activity and structural molecule activity fig 5c as the filterability of was was deteriorated and improved at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratios of 0 25 1 and 1 1 respectively the sludge samples with these two acetonitrile dosages were comparatively analyzed with the raw sludge sample to track the differential proteins the proteins isolated from the liquid phase of acetonitrile amended sludge at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratios of 0 25 1 and 1 1 are labeled as las 0 25 and las 1 respectively for the las 1 sample a total of 1646 proteins were quantified as exhibiting a 0 83 or 1 20 fold change compared with raw sludge of these 793 proteins were found to be significantly down regulated and the other 853 proteins were up regulated figs s2 and s3 of supplementary materials for the las 0 25 sample the numbers of up regulated and down regulated proteins were 548 and 629 respectively and the total number of differential proteins was 1177 figs s2 and s3 the differential proteins were essentially categorized according to the go classification based on biological processes of metabolism process molecular functions of catalytic activity and binding and cellular components of membrane protein complex in particular the proteins involved in go classification of biological adhesion extracellular region and membrane protein complex should be crucial to the aggregation states and water holding capacities of microbial aggregates peng et al 2015 wu et al 2017 therefore the differential proteins classified as these go classifications were typically analyzed tables s5 s8 of supplementary materials compared with raw sludge the cadherin like domain containing protein m4 family metallopeptidase phosphate abc transporter protein cytochrome c oxidase dipeptide binding protein enolase f0f1 atp synthase flagellar motor protein hypothetical protein outer membrane beta barrel protein peptide abc transporter substrate binding protein abc transporter substrate binding protein atp synthase and ompa family protein were up regulated for las 1 but no change for las 0 25 table s5 s8 of supplementary materials therefore those up regulated proteins in the liquid phase could be related to the improved solid liquid separation performance of was at the mass ratio of acetonitrile and sludge 1 1 especially most of the differential proteins involved in the go classifications of membrane protein complex table s7 and membrane protein complex outer membrane table s8 were up regulated in las 1 but no change for las 0 25 for example outer membrane beta barrel protein is the typical beta barrel protein that crosses the cellular membrane of gram negative bacteria and acts as the membrane pore rigel and silhavy 2012 through the membrane pore composed of outer membrane beta barrel protein some small metabolites like sugars ions and amino acids can diffuse rogers 1960 the up regulated outer membrane beta barrel protein in the liquid phase was the typical sign of cell membrane lysis this result implied that the damage of cell membrane structure should facilitate the solid liquid separation of was the flagellin phosphopyruvate hydratase pilin f0f1 atp synthase membrane bound atp synthase and enolase were up regulated or down regulated for las 0 25 but no change for las 1 tables s5 s8 of supplementary materials also these differential proteins were mainly involved in the go classifications of extracellular region extracellular region cell surface which reflected that the phase transfer of extracellular proteins posed negative effects on the solid liquid separation of was table s5 additionally a specific protein might involve multiple biological processes or molecular functions except for the go classifications of extracellular region cell surface some of the down regulated proteins for las 0 25 for example f0f1 atp synthase subunit alpha membrane bound atp synthase and phosphate abc transporter substrate binding protein were classified in anion binding and transmembrane transporter activity the surface of solid compositions of was is always negatively charged wei et al 2018 the transfer of anion binding proteins from liquid phase to solid phase may result in the higher affinity of solid compositions with multiple charge anions and further be adverse to the flocculation of was flocs schwierz et al 2010 as a result the solid liquid separation of was was inhibited with the precipitation of anion binding proteins from liquid phase to solid phase in general all the above differential proteins could be classified into two categories one had the relatively higher content in the liquid phase at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 0 25 1 than 1 1 and another had the relatively higher content in the liquid phase at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 than 0 25 1 the conformational features of the above two differential protein categories were separately investigated to further explore the phase transfer mechanism from the perspective of molecular structure also the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of above differential proteins could be explained by the relative position relationships among hydrophobic hydrophilic secondary protein structure units 3 4 structure attributes of amphiphilic proteins for the phase transfer feature the partitioning of amphiphilic proteins in liquid and solid phases depends on the conformational features and their interactions with liquid molecules schein 1990 figs 6 and 7 shows the structure information of core differential proteins involved in those go classifications that were thought to be closely related to sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 most of the down regulated amphiphilic proteins at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 0 25 1 exhibit the conformational features that the central hydrophobic β sheet is surrounded by the hydrophilic α helix fig 6 the structure consists of β sheets laid in a relatively hydrophobic core regime with hydrophilic α helices distributed to the periphery or margins with the decreasing liquid polarity the molecular affinities between water molecule and hydrophilic α helix was weakened as a result the hydration layer of proteins was removed the condensation of proteins occurred due to the polar force among the hydrophilic edge units of macromolecules schein 1990 the proteins of which the concentration in liquid phase were up regulated at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 commonly have the parallel α helix and β barrel structure units fig 7 in their structural domains the hydrophilic α helices that can interact with water flank the hydrophobic β sheets thus the solubility of those up regulated proteins was not inhibited with the decreasing polarity of liquid phase on the contrary no matter the solvent molecule was polar or non polar the adjacently distributed α helix and β sheet could interact with the polar and non polar solvent molecules respectively which helped the solubilization of amphiphilic proteins and led to the up regulation of those proteins in liquid phase fig 7 schein 1990 in addition those proteins which had the relatively higher content in the liquid phase at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 than that at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 0 25 1 exhibited the higher solvent accessibility index in the range of 1 47 2 72 table s9 of supplementary materials 9 of 13 up regulated proteins at the acetonitrile sludge mass ratio of 1 1 had the average solvent accessibility index over 1 8 however 4 of 7 down regulated proteins in fig 6 was below 1 8 table s10 of supplementary materials this phenomenon indicated that the proteins with more exposed amino acid residues tended to dissolve in the liquid phase with the lower polarity conversely the buried amino acid residues should induce the precipitation of proteins in the solid phase with the decreasing liquid polarity the exposure of amino acid residue is the dominant feature of the tertiary structures the significant discrepancy in the relative spatial relationship of secondary structures i e hydrophilic a helix or hydrophobic β sheet tables s9 and s10 of supplementary materials played a pivotal role in the phase distribution of amphiphilic proteins which further dominated the compositions and molecular interactions at solid liquid interface 3 5 environmental implications from a theoretical standpoint the extracellular proteins were previously determined to be the main water holding components of was cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 shao et al 2009 yu et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 accordingly the chemical compositions molecular conformation and micro spatial distribution of extracellular proteins should significantly affect the dewaterability of was the chemical compositions of extracellular proteins have been systematically investigated by previous studies wu et al 2017 in this study the levels of proteins in the liquid phase were analyzed by comparative proteomics i e tmt proteomics to reflect the phase transfer of proteins from solid phase to liquid phase with the decreasing liquid polarity the dewaterability of was was first deteriorated and then improved accordingly the phase transfer features of amphiphilic proteins with the deteriorated and enhanced sludge dewaterability should be different identifying this difference could unveil the mechanism behind the deteriorated enhanced sludge dewaterability from the perspective of phase distribution of amphiphilic proteins also the phase distribution of amphiphilic proteins with the varying liquid polarity should depend on the molecular conformation the common features for those amphiphilic proteins with up regulated liquid levels or down regulated liquid levels were separately identified thus it could be concluded that the molecular structure of amphiphilic proteins influences the sludge dewaterability through determining the phase distribution of amphiphilic proteins that would be the potential linkage between amphiphilic protein conformation and was dewaterability from a practical standpoint the default approaches to improve was dewaterability through modifying the solid compositions e g neutralizing the surface charge of particles by coagulation eliminating the solid surface hydrophilicity by aops or thermal treatment requiring large chemicals or energy inputs furthermore the conventional conditioning chemicals cannot be recycled this study proposed an approach to improve sludge dewaterability by modifying the physical property of liquid phase which made it possible to recycle the conditioning amendments by salting out and distillation also it is anticipated that the enhanced solid liquid separation without altering the chemical compositions of was would not pose negative effects on the subsequent treatment or utilization of was 4 conclusions this study examined the effectiveness of liquid polarity regulation for enhanced solid liquid separation of was the filterability of was could be improved by 70 with the dielectric constant below 50 the dsc coupled with ms identified that the liquid amendment acetonitrile could evaporate from filter sludge cake at around 60 c and the corresponding energy consumptions for unit weight loss at the constant temperature section 60 c was calculated to be at most 799 0 j g which was substantially lower than that of sludge drying process the salting out process was verified to realize the maximum recovery efficiency of 91 7 4 9 for acetonitrile with 75 of nacl solubility all these results open up a novel option for enhanced solid liquid separation of was through decreasing the polarity of liquid phase the great potentials in energy saving and recycle of chemicals make it expected to act as alternatives for the conventional mechanically dewatering drying process regarding the mechanism investigation the tmt proteomics tracked the solubilization of proteins involved in go classifications of membrane protein complex and membrane protein complex outer membrane which should be in favor of the enhanced solid liquid separation of was the conformational analysis of those differential proteins was conducted to reveal the structure attributes of amphiphilic proteins for the phase transfer feature the proteins with more exposed amino acid residues tended to dissolve in the liquid phase with the lower polarity which was accompanied with the reduced interfacial free energy of was on the contrary the buried amino acid residues e g the central hydrophobic β sheet is surrounded by the hydrophilic α helix could induce the precipitation of proteins in the solid phase with the decreasing liquid polarity the conformational analysis of amphiphilic proteins significantly deepened the mechanism understanding of the migration of interfacial compositions and provided the in depth interpretation of reducing the
