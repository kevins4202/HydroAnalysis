architecture marine engineering university of michigan usa department of naval architecture marine engineering university of michigan usa corresponding author response conditioning wave techniques are a rational way to link wave excitation environments with return period extreme loading responses by retaining the wave excitation which leads to a design response these techniques can also define extreme combined loading scenarios for complex or novel hull forms combined loading may be relevant for evaluating structural reliability or adequacy but using combined loading scenarios as inputs to high fidelity structural or dynamic modeling tools implies that such load scenarios are realistic for the defined return period this paper investigates three response conditioning wave techniques a modified equivalent design wave method a modified conditioned random response wave method and the design loads generator to evaluate how well they reproduce combined loading statistics for a 1000 hr return period as compared to stochastic brute force simulations the investigation is carried out for extreme combined loading scenarios on a 110 m trimaran hull the design loads generator produces the most realistic extreme combined loading statistics as compared to the brute force approach with a significant reduction in computation time based on combined load conditional probability density functions cumulative density functions and individual stochastic load vectors keywords response conditioned waves combined loading rare responses short term statistics trimaran 1 introduction to ensure adequate lifetime structural performance many classification societies suggest using combined loading scenarios as possible loading conditions to test a vessel s structural compliance see e g lloyd s register 2017 bureau veritas 2018a dnv gl 2018 bureau veritas 2017 2018b american bureau of shipping 2016 2005 iacs 2018 horn et al 2013 classnk 2013 and lloyd s register 2014 the intent of using such combined loading scenarios is to capture the effect of stochastic loads acting in different planes of the vessel however defining such loading scenarios is not simple especially for rare events even defining a return period for multivariate extremes can be ambiguous see e g feld et al 2019 to define simultaneous load effects due to combined loading may require the underlying wave profile which excites these stochastic loads rare combined loading scenarios may be associated with long exposure periods making brute force simulation techniques such as monte carlo simulations mcs potentially intractable multiple response conditioning wave techniques rcwts such as the equivalent design wave edw conditioned random response wave crrw and the design loads generator dlg have been developed to construct wave profiles expected to excite specific loading scenarios these methods are significantly more computationally efficient than mcs because they do not simulate the entire return period to construct waves that excite return period extreme load responses such efficiency and simplicity have made these methods popular because they can easily be implemented by engineers to define lifetime combined loading scenarios it is worth wondering though whether the simplicity of some of these techniques comes at the expense of accuracy in defining realistic combined loading scenarios associated with long return periods this paper examines that potential trade off by comparing rcwt defined short term rare combined loading scenarios with equivalent scenarios from mcs the main questions of interest here are what are the inherent limitations or assumptions associated with these rcwts do these techniques recover the same statistics of lifetime combined loading scenarios that result from a brute force mcs approach and how does increasing a safety factor affect these load scenarios these are timely questions especially as rcwts are gaining popularity in industry practice for defining load scenarios to evaluate structural adequacy of vessels even for novel hull forms like trimarans see lloyd s register 2017 the paper is structured as follows section 2 gives some background to the rcwts examined in this investigation section 3 establishes the trimaran case study and benchmarks to compare the combined loading scenarios from the rcwts with mcs sections 4 7 evaluate the techniques via the established benchmarks finally section 8 discusses the trade offs between the rcwts and section 9 offers some recommendations and conclusions 2 response conditioning wave techniques this section gives a short background on some response conditioning techniques which define a wave excitation profile based on a specific load response with a given return period it is worth acknowledging the many other methods that examine combined loading including but certainly not limited to combination formulas like turkstra s rule turkstra 1970 or the ferry borges castanheta method ferry borges and castanheta 1971 load coincidence models wen 1993 point crossing methods huang and moan 2008 and cross spectral methods alfred mohammed et al 2012 2016 for a recent investigation of such load combination models and their sensitivity when performing a hull girder reliability analysis see piscopo and scamardella 2019 this paper however only examines a few response conditioning wave techniques which are chosen based on either their present usage as defined by classification societies edw potential for expanding on these classification society methods crrw or expected accuracy in capturing lifetime conditional loading statistics dlg in general all of these techniques have a similar aim to construct wave profiles which lead to extreme responses of a defined load scenario consider a stochastic wave profile time series η t 1 η t j 1 n a j c o s ω j t ϕ j where a j 2 s ω j δ ω s ω single sided wave energy spectrum ϕ j phase between π and π if the phases ϕ j are uniformly distributed between π and π as the number of frequency components n approaches infinity the random variable h expressed by the random process η t approaches a gaussian random variable in general rcwts condition a wave profile expected to lead to a pre determined response value at a pre determined time say t 0 in this case the phases ϕ j may not be uniformly distributed between π and π but will likely be tuned based on a transfer function of the desired response consider now some response of interest y t which is excited by the wave elevation η t expressed as 2 y t j 1 n a j h j c o s ω j t ϕ j ψ j where a j 2 s ω j δ ω s ω single sided wave energy spectrum h j value of the transfer function relating the wave excitation and the process y t at ω j ϕ j wave phase between π and π from eq 1 ψ j process y t transfer function phase at ω j the random variable y similarly approaches a gaussian random variable as n approaches infinity and if ϕ j are uniformly distributed between π and π the rcwts focus on defining the wave phases ϕ j such that the resulting y t 0 response is a rare occurrence of course eqs 1 2 are linear relationships but in general response conditioning wave techniques are based upon linear theory and the assumption that a nonlinear response is a correction of the associated linear response it is expected though that the processes employed in this investigation and conclusions would be similar for nonlinear non gaussian models 2 1 equivalent design waves equivalent design waves are regular waves constructed to lead to a specific load value here referred to as a design value in a given heading at a specified instant in time again at t 0 to define a load combination case a single load is chosen as the primary load called m p which is the load the edw is constructed to maximize this edw is constructed using the response amplitude operator transfer function of m p r a o m p ω e in a particular heading the frequency of the edw called ω e is the encounter frequency corresponding to the peak value of r a o m p ω e by construction the edw and resulting load profiles are regular waves with this same frequency ω e the value of the primary load r a o and phase at this frequency ω e are used to define the resulting edw interested readers are referred to seyffert and kana 2019 and seyffert et al 2018 for more discussion on the implementation of the edw technique for this investigation 2 1 1 implications of edw assumption the major assumption of the edw method is that the wave which excites a specified loading scenario is regular and that the resulting loads are regular waves with the same frequency this makes for a very simple construction of the edw and resulting load profiles but means that the resulting load profiles have a limited range consider a vector of time varying load profiles excited by an edw since all of the load profiles are phase shifted cosines with the same frequency ω e the implication is that the combined load vector in n dimensional space each dimension relating to a specific global load will be a 2 d ellipse the shape of an edw driven load vector is pre determined because any phase shifted cosine with a given frequency can be represented as a weighted linear combination of a sine and cosine wave at that same frequency for load vectors excited by an edw this means that the range of an n dimensional load vector excited by an edw has the maximum dimension of 2 graphically an n dimensional load vector excited by an edw plotted in n dimensional space will trace out an ellipse which lies on a 2 d plane the range of that ellipse has dimension 2 and the null space has dimension n 2 regardless of the number of loads n excited by the edw 1 1 consider the set of functions v on r that are a sum of a sine and cosine wave with the same frequency i e a s i n x b c o s x where a and b are real constants v is a vector space because linear sums of elements of v and scalar multiples of elements of v are also members of v since s i n x and c o s x are maximally linearly independent in v meaning that there are no other linearly independent functions in the vector space v they form a basis of v the implication of this is that a vector of n combined loads excited by an edw has at maximum 2 linearly independent dimensions such results can readily be confirmed from linear algebra or signal processing textbooks see e g smith 2002 indeed the fact that s i n x and c o s x form a basis of v is an underpinning of the fourier series the major question for evaluating the edw as a response conditioning wave technique is then do the limitations stemming from the regular wave assumption outweigh the simplicity of application can the edw lead to realistic combined loading scenarios as compared to more complex rcwts and the benchmark mcs 2 2 new waves most likely waves and conditioned random response waves many response conditioning wave techniques have been developed to take the general idea of the edw to construct a wave which leads to an extreme system response of interest and correct for its shortcomings namely that the edw is a regular wave these techniques do not determine such wave profiles via brute force simulation techniques but rather linear and probabilistic theory based on expectations of wave profiles given certain conditional criteria lindgren introduced the new wave profile giving a form for the expected i e most likely profile of a gaussian process conditioned on an extreme peak value at a given time instant lindgren 1970 this result was also demonstrated by tromans et al 1991 friis hansen and nielsen developed the most likely wave mlw by expanding the new wave profile to condition on both the wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency friis hansen and nielsen 1995 if this instantaneous frequency is the mean frequency ω m 1 m 0 where m i is the i th moment of the wave energy spectrum the mlw simplifies to the new wave profile but since this new wave profile is simply the autocorrelation function of the wave spectrum taylor et al added randomness to the expression by embedding this most likely wave profile into a random seaway taylor et al 1997 however a single extreme wave crest may not excite extreme dynamic responses airy wave theory suggests that the wave leading to the worst case system response is the one which excites a response where all frequency components have a peak at the same time torhaug developed the critical wave episode model which identifies wave profiles via a linear model that are expected to lead to extreme system responses this model uses simulations based on design sea state histories to screen for critical wave characteristics torhaug 1996 for example a critical wave characteristic might be extreme wave height meaning that the constructed critical wave episode is based on the new wave model other authors have constructed wave profiles which lead to specific vessel responses by using the linear transfer function that links the wave excitation and response dietz combined the most likely wave mlw profile from friis hansen and nielsen with the most likely extreme response mler method from adegeest et al 1998 to develop the most likely response wave mlrw dietz 2004 the deterministic mlrw is conditioned on a linear vessel response taking a specified extreme value at a given instant in time with a given instantaneous frequency if this instantaneous frequency is the mean frequency the mlrw is the same as the mler wave when this mlrw mler wave includes a random background it is referred to as a conditioned random response wave crrw the mlwr and therefore the crrw is similar to the edw approach in that the linear response transfer function defines the resulting phase of the conditioned wave component at each frequency component the mlrw uses the range of frequencies from the response transfer function instead of the peak frequency like the edw to define the amplitude of each wave component the mlrw incorporates the envelope process of the response along with an instantaneous frequency requirement at the time of the response event the crrw further includes normally distributed coefficients in the wave amplitudes leading to an irregular wave profile the details of the derivation of the crrw can be found in dietz 2004 the formulation of the crrw technique employed here follows drummen et al 2009 it is worth noting though that the crrw does not include randomness in the extreme loading event itself as this value is fixed a priori 2 3 generating a distribution of extreme responses from edw crrw by construction the edw and crrw techniques are designed to lead to a single a priori defined load value while the crrw includes randomness in the constructed wave profile there is no randomness included in the extreme load response of interest at t 0 in reality though a vessel experiences a distribution of extreme loading based on the exposure time in the operational profile this is reflected when running mcs and in waves constructed by the design loads generator as discussed in the next section section 2 4 a distribution of extreme responses is collected to compare with the dlg and mcs the edw and crrw techniques are adjusted to construct an ensemble of waves which lead to a distribution of extreme load values a closed form distribution can be defined for extreme values of a gaussian process given its zero crossing period and the return period then an ensemble of extreme load values can be chosen such that their empirical histogram approaches the theoretical gaussian extreme value distribution evd for the defined exposure as deep water waves can be assumed gaussian and the loading transfer functions are linear this is a reasonable estimation of the extreme loading distribution this logic constructs the dlg wave profiles an ensemble of waves that lead to a distribution of extreme responses whose empirical histogram approaches the gaussian evd based on this ensemble of extreme load values which follow the gaussian evd an ensemble of equivalent design waves and conditioned random response waves can be constructed which excite these load values this approach distinguishes the modified edw m edw and modified crrw m crrw approaches used in this investigation this modification allows a direct comparison between the m edw m crrw dlg and mcs approaches for the different combined loading scenarios considered as all rcwts construct ensembles of waves leading to distributions of extreme load responses 2 4 design loads generator the dlg was developed to construct an ensemble of irregular wave profiles which are expected to lead to extreme return period linear system responses based on a loading transfer function and an exposure time alford 2008 kim 2012 unlike the response conditioning wave techniques discussed in the previous subsections the dlg does not fix the extreme load value a priori and then back calculate a wave profile which leads to this response based on summing phase shifted regular wave components via airy wave theory instead the question that drove the development of the dlg was what is the distribution of wave phases ϕ j in eq 1 that leads to extreme responses of y t at time t 0 which belong to the gaussian evd for a given exposure the main differences between the rcwts discussed earlier and the dlg are the dlg does not require an a priori definition of the extreme load value at t 0 to construct the underlying wave profile unlike edw and crrw the extreme load value excited by a dlg wave is by construction a member of the gaussian evd for the defined exposure period the dlg constructs an ensemble of short irregular wave profiles which excite extreme return period response values which belong to the theoretical gaussian evd based on a characteristics period of the response e g zero crossing period and the return period the phases ϕ j in eq 1 of the dlg waves are not limited based on the phases of the associated linear transfer function which describes the response of interest the edw can be seen as a simplification of eq 1 where only the frequency ω e which corresponds to the peak of the load r a o m p is included and where the height of this wave is scaled to lead to a specific design value by construction then the edw wave phase ϕ j is defined by the transfer function phase at the frequency ω e ψ j the mlrw crrw wave uses more frequency components than the edw and conditions based on an instantaneous frequency but also has the phase of each regular wave component defined completely by the load transfer function i e ϕ j ψ j therefore both edw and crrw construct waves with phases at each frequency component which only take on values contained in the range of phases in the load transfer function in contrast the dlg wave components at each frequency can take phases between π and π 3 case study trimaran for the numerical investigation of how well different response conditioning wave techniques describe lifetime combined loading scenarios a trimaran hull is examined combined loading is relevant for trimaran structural design especially the cross deck structure increasing advances in high fidelity structural modeling allow an in depth study of such complex structural responses but the limited historical and anecdotal knowledge about trimarans makes efficiently applying such models difficult therefore response conditioning wave techniques may be relevant to define a finite number of lifetime combined loading scenarios for use in such tools indeed some classification societies have already suggested this procedure to evaluate the adequacy of trimaran structures e g lloyd s register 2017 to compare load combination scenarios defined by the different rcwts the trimaran hull is the same as used in seyffert and kana 2019 seyffert et al 2018 which examined combined loading scenarios defined by the edw technique the trimaran parameters and operational profile for the load scenarios are given in table 1 for this analysis the rareness of the load combinations is limited by the exposure period which can reasonably be simulated by mcs to give converged statistics therefore the chosen exposure time is 1000 h although a designer may be interested in rarer combined loading events it is relevant to evaluate whether the rcwts accurately describe load scenarios at a shorter return period like 1000 h it is not expected that edw or crrw will become more accurate for describing rarer responses or for flexible hulls where non linearities will be more dominant as compared to brute force stochastic simulations or physical model tests see e g drummen et al 2009 the dlg waves will still be statistically valid for events associated with longer return periods as any return period can be related to a gaussian evd though the gaussian process assumption may break down for such rare responses due to non linearities 3 1 combined loading scenarios on a trimaran typically combined loading scenarios are based on conditional maxima for all of the techniques described in section 2 the load scenarios are defined by the simultaneous responses of all loads when a specific global load attains its 1000 h extreme value these global loads are defined in fig 1 the vertical wave bending moment m w is the wave pressure distribution integrated across the depth of the vessel and the horizontal bending moment m h is the pressure distribution integrated across the vessel breadth m w vertical wave bending moment m s p splitting bending moment m l t longitudinal torsional bending moment m h horizontal bending moment m t t transverse torsional bending moment for this investigation combined load scenarios are defined when each of the global loads in fig 1 attains its extreme value in a given heading the linear version of the high order potential flow code aegir kring et al 2004 was used to generate the trimaran transfer functions of the global loads these transfer functions are adapted from seyffert and kana 2019 and seyffert et al 2018 where the minimum earth coordinate frequency was ω 0 0 4859 rad s here the transfer functions are linearly extrapolated so that the minimum frequency is ω 0 0 rad s the amplitudes are linearly extrapolated so that the amplitude at ω 0 0 rad s is zero the phases are extrapolated so that all phases at ω 0 0 4859 rad s equal the transfer function phase at ω 0 0 4859 rad s this extrapolation is necessary to conduct mcs to examine lifetime loading scenarios the mcs analysis uses the fast fourier transform fft algorithm to simulate the stochastic ocean environment the fft algorithm assumes the frequency range begins from ω 0 0 rad s requiring the extrapolation for this investigation the extrapolated transfer functions are shown in fig 2 3 2 design values of global loads as described in seyffert and kana 2019 and seyffert et al 2018 the heading of each load scenario is based on the heading where the specific global load attains its largest 1000 h extreme value in each heading the most likely extreme value of each load is determined using extreme value theory see e g ochi 1990 with a zero crossing period based on spectral moments these 1000 h most likely extreme values based on heading are given in table 2 the largest most likely extreme value of a load m i over all the headings is defined as the design value r m i and given in bold not all transfer functions were constructed for all headings in those cases the most likely extreme value for that load case is marked as load combination factors or lcfs can be defined as the resulting load combination where each load is normalized by its respective design value 3 3 evaluating rcwt defined lifetime combined loading scenarios defining realistic combined loading scenarios is of vital importance for an adequate structural design of novel vessels like trimarans if these load scenarios are used in high fidelity modeling tools to assess a design s structural adequacy it is important that these load scenarios are statistically relevant and physically realistic the main question is then does it matter which technique is used to define these load scenarios m edw m crrw dlg mcs do all of these methods give comparable statistics of lifetime combined loading scenarios clearly any load combinations derived from statistics of brute force mcs associated with the desired exposure period will be the most realistic because these situations are not based on any load conditioning only the system physics as described in the stochastic simulations while a brute force mcs approach is not a feasible approach for daily use by engineers to define lifetime load combinations it can certainly be used as a benchmark to compare the other techniques for each heading 500 1000 h mcs are run and statistics on the conditional maxima for each global load in fig 1 are collected in the headings suggested by table 2 as well the wave profile and resulting load vector time series around the time of the 1000 h maximum of each global load is saved for later comparison with the m edw m crrw and dlg analyses the points of comparison between these techniques will be 1 how do conditional probability density functions pdf s for each load case defined by the rcwts compare with mcs section 4 this comparison will give good insight on whether the rcwts accurately describe the relative magnitude and variance of the extreme combined loading distributions for this trimaran hull to evaluate the potential variation in short term extreme combined loading scenarios 2 how do conditional cumulative density functions cdf s for each load case defined by the rcwts compare with mcs section 5 this comparison can illustrate the risk factors associated with these load scenarios and whether increasing the risk factor on the primary load in a load case affects all loads equally 3 how do load vectors associated with the most likely 1000 h extreme primary load response from the rcwts compare with mcs section 6 this comparison will give insight on the simultaneous load correlations excited by the rcwts 4 what is the computational effort associated with employing rcwts versus mcs section 7 this comparison will help balance the simplicity and efficiency of applying the rcwts with the quality of the resulting combined load scenarios 4 conditional pdf s from rcwts vs mcs the first way to compare the rcwts in terms of defining realistic combined loading scenarios is by considering the conditional pdf s assembled by each technique for each case in each case a single global load called the primary load m p is maximized at time t 0 in the heading directed by the design values in table 2 the different rcwts m edw m crrw dlg assemble wave profiles which lead to 500 m p t 0 values belonging to the gaussian evd where r m p is the 1000 h most likely extreme value for the operational profile in table 1 these resulting wave profiles can be used to assemble distributions of all m i t 0 responses conditioned on the extreme m p t 0 events to describe these conditional pdf s constructed by the different rcwts and by mcs the nomenclature in eq 3 in box i is used by construction then all rcwts will lead to a 1000 h extreme value m p t 0 distribution with a most likely extreme value at the load design value i e l c f 1 based on the conditioning technique the conditional m i t 0 distributions will differ the load pdf s from the rcwts and mcs are compared when normalized both as a l c f and in physical dimensions to illustrate how well the rcwts capture the potential load variance for the different cases 4 1 head seas in head seas both m w and m t t experience their design value conditional pdf s based on 1000 h extreme m w t 0 and m t t t 0 responses in head seas are shown in figs 3 a 3 b respectively from figs 3 a 3 b it is clear that the conditional pdf s from the dlg prove the best visual match with the conditional pdf s from mcs the f i m crrw m i m w h and f i m crrw m i m t t h distributions overestimate the respective mcs distributions positive f t t m crrw m t t m w h and negative f s p m crrw m s p m w h and positive f w m crrw m w m t t h and negative f s p m crrw m s p m t t h in contrast f i m edw m i m w h and f i m edw m i m t t h do not exhibit any single trend when compared with mcs the m edw method under predicts f t t mcs m t t m w h but f s p m edw m s p m w h is centered around l c f 0 like the respective mcs distribution however f s p e d w m s p m w h is extremely narrow unlike the respective distributions from the dlg m crrw and mcs this result is not surprising though when considering the construction of m edw waves the m edw waves conditioned to maximize m w t 0 have the frequency ω e 1 69 rad s at this frequency the phase difference between m w and m s p is about π 2 radians when m w is maximized at t 0 by the edw m s p is almost π 2 radians out of phase with the m w response resulting in a load distribution at t 0 centered around l c f 0 with low variance 4 2 beam seas in beam seas only m l t experiences its design value conditional pdf s based on 1000 h extreme m l t t 0 responses in beam seas are shown in fig 4 all of the rcwts give reasonable estimates of the mcs pdf s conditioned on extreme m l t t 0 responses in beam seas as compared to mcs all techniques indicate that f w m w m l t b is marginally positive and close to l c f 0 the m edw technique seems to slightly over estimate the peak of the f s p m s p m l t b response distribution 4 3 oblique seas in oblique seas both m s p and m h experience their design value conditional pdf s based on 1000 h extreme m s p t 0 and m h t 0 responses in oblique seas are shown in figs 5 a 5 b respectively there are some striking differences between the f i m i m s p o fig 5 a and f i m i m h o fig 5 b distributions assembled by the rcwts and by mcs the f i m edw m i m s p o and f i m edw m i m h o distributions are significantly narrower than the respective mcs distributions although they do generally track the relative magnitude of the mcs distributions the m crrw technique tracks the relative variance of the mcs distributions but in some instances noticeably over predicts the load magnitude negative f t t m crrw m t t m s p o and negative f l t m crrw m l t m s p o or under predicts that load magnitude f t t m crrw m t t m h o the most surprising difference when comparing the rcwt and mcs conditional pdf s is that the m crrw technique predicts the incorrect sign for both f h m h m s p o and f s p m s p m h o as compared to mcs this sign difference from m crrw for these loads may be explained by the phase restriction of the m crrw based on the range of the load transfer function phases fig 2 indicates that m s p and m h are nearly π radians out of phase for about half of the frequency components 0 ω e 0 7 based on the m crrw construction then where the regular wave components have phases defined by the load transfer function phases i e ϕ j ψ j a significant portion of these regular wave components phased to maximize m s p t 0 in oblique seas will excite simultaneous negative m h t 0 responses and vice versa this can explain why m crrw suggests the conditional extreme m s p t 0 and m h t 0 responses have opposite signs the m edw approach also has this phase limitation but only for a single frequency based on the peak of the primary load r a o it is worth reiterating though that all rcwts as well as mcs use the same transfer functions from fig 2 the dlg and mcs do not limit the wave phases ϕ j in eq 1 based on the range of the transfer function phases like m crrw and m edw 5 conditional cdf s from rcwts vs mcs the conditional load pdf s assembled by the rcwts and by mcs in figs 3 a 5 b do not explicitly link the simultaneous global load values at time t 0 therefore conditional cdf s from the rcwts and mcs are examined with the nomenclature defined in eq 4 in box i for clarity only 50 samples are included in each conditional cdf these 50 samples are at equally spaced probability of non exceedance p n e intervals within the primary load extreme values excited by the 500 m edw m crrw dlg and mcs wave profiles 5 1 head seas fig 6 a shows the cdf s from the rcwts conditioned on 1000 h extreme m w t 0 responses in head seas while fig 6 b shows the cdf s conditioned on 1000 h extreme m t t t 0 responses in head seas the conditional cdf s constructed by m edw shown in figs 6 a 6 b are monotonic towards larger load values either with positive or negative sign convention with increasing probability of non exceedance p n e this is unsurprising considering that the ensemble of waves constructed by m edw only differ by the wave height which is tuned to excite a specific primary load value the wave phase remains the same across all waves constructed by the m edw technique in contrast m crrw dlg and mcs result in non monotonic conditional cdf s with respect to increasing p n e whereas the m crrw regular wave phases remain unchanged for the frequency components across the ensemble of constructed waves random coefficients stochastically alter the wave amplitudes leading to the non monotonic conditional cdf s when the randomness is not included in the crrw i e reverting back to the mlrw the resulting conditional cdf s are monotonic with increasing p n e as a way to quantitatively compare the rcwt and mcs cdf s conditioned on maximized m w t 0 in head seas consider figs 7 a 7 b fig 7 a examines the percentage of conditional cdf values assembled by each rcwt that are within some error bound of the respective mcs conditional cdf with this bound measured as a percentage of each load s design value considering all 500 extreme load responses if a rcwt cdf were exactly the same as the mcs conditional cdf 100 of its cdf values would have a 0 difference from the design value of the mcs cdf this comparison considers how well the rcwt conditional cdf matches the mcs conditional cdf on a global sense the rcwt leading to the best fit with mcs will have the highest percentage of its conditional cdf values within the smallest percentage difference from the respective mcs cdf i e fastest ascent to 100 on the y axis fig 7 b compares the rcwt and mcs conditional cdf s on a more point by point basis by examining the l c f difference between the conditional cdf s at the 50 p n e values included in the conditional cdf s in this case the rcwt leading to the best fit with mcs will have the minimum difference at each sampled p n e value a perfect fit with the mcs cdf would result in zero difference at each p n e value fig 7 a indicates that the rcwt cdf s conditioned on maximized m w t 0 in head seas all have 100 of their samples within 3 of r m w from the mcs cdf since by construction all rcwts lead to a distribution of m w t 0 values which follow the 1000 h gaussian evd for m w in head seas this is not a surprising result it is far more interesting to consider how well f s p m s p m w h and f t t m t t m w h from the rcwts compare with the mcs cdf s the middle inset of fig 7 a indicates that m edw has the best match with f s p mcs m s p m w h the dlg has a slightly worse comparison and m crrw has the worst comparison with mcs from fig 6 a it is not surprising that f s p m crrw m s p m w h is the worst match to f s p mcs m s p m w h but it is not so obvious why the m edw does better than the dlg for this conditional cdf consider though that f s p m edw m s p m w h does capture the relative magnitude of f s p mcs m s p m w h just not the fact that it is non monotonic since f s p m edw m s p m w h is monotonic and has a range similar to f s p mcs m s p m w h it has more values that are within a small distance to the mcs cdf than does the dlg cdf which is non monotonic but if a m edw conditional cdf does not capture the average magnitude of the respective mcs conditional cdf this comparison suffers as seen for f t t m t t m w h in the right inset of fig 7 a in this case both f t t dlg m t t m w h and f t t m crrw m t t m w h are a far better approximation to f t t mcs m t t m w h than f t t m edw m t t m w h fig 7 b confirms that m edw and the dlg best match f s p mcs m s p m w h while the dlg best matches f t t mcs m t t m w h by construction f w m edw m w m w h and f w m crrw m w m w h follow f w dlg m w m w h as they use the same m w t 0 values to construct the ensemble of waves figs 8 a 8 b give the same comparisons for cdf s conditioned on 1000 h extreme m t t t 0 responses in head seas all f t t m t t m t t h distributions match well with f t t mcs m t t m t t h right inset fig 8 a again by construction as indicated from fig 6 b f w m edw m w m t t h centers on the average of f w mcs m w m t t h giving it a slightly better match to mcs than the dlg left insets of figs 8 a 8 b however the dlg provides nearly an equally good match as m edw to mcs for f w m w m t t h while capturing the non monotonic nature of the conditional cdf unlike m edw the dlg also gives the best match to f s p mcs m s p m t t h as the majority of its samples are within the smallest error bound of f s p mcs m s p m t t h and it has the smallest point by point distance from f s p mcs m s p m t t h middle insets of figs 8 a 8 b 5 2 beam seas fig 9 gives the cdf s from the rcwts conditioned on 1000 h extreme m l t t 0 responses in beam seas and confirms the conclusion from fig 4 that all rcwts give a good estimate of the mcs results for this case figs 10 a 10 b indicate that all of the rcwt conditional cdf s have 100 of their values within 20 of the mcs cdf s based on each load s respective design value in this case m crrw proves the best comparison as all f i m crrw m i m l t b have 100 of samples within 12 of the respective design value from the mcs cdf s for this case both m crrw and the dlg give a better estimate to the mcs conditional cdf s than m edw 5 3 oblique seas figs 11 a 11 b give the cdf s conditioned on 1000 h extreme m s p t 0 and m h t 0 responses in oblique seas respectively figs 12 a 12 b and 13 a 13 b give an in depth comparison of these conditional cdf s from the rcwts with mcs the same trends noticed from earlier cases about the performance of m edw m crrw and dlg in matching the mcs conditional cdf hold in figs 12 a 12 b and 13 a 13 b when the m edw conditional cdf captures the average of the mcs conditional cdf it proves the best comparison such as for f w m w m s p o f t t m t t m s p o and f s p m s p m h o but in these instances the dlg comparison with mcs is favorable and still captures the non monotonic nature of the mcs conditional cdf s surprisingly m crrw performs worse than m edw when comparing with mcs for all conditional cdf s in these oblique seas cases except f w m w m h o and f l t m l t m h o 5 4 effect of increasing primary load p n e on secondary loads the non monotonic nature of the mcs conditional cdf s illustrates an important point about combined loading especially relating to safety factors that is a primary load response associated with a higher p n e is not necessarily associated with larger simultaneous secondary loading values in this case a safety factor applied to the primary load may not actually lead to a load scenario which is harsher in a combined loading sense such a result implies that combined loading scenarios may be better defined based on a relevant limit state versus a conditional maximum approach the probability of not exceeding a specific load value like primary loads which define these load scenarios may be misleading when considering the magnitudes of the simultaneous loading conditions it may be more relevant to examine the probability of exceeding specific combined loading scenarios which are relevant for a design limit state as examined in seyffert et al 2019 in that way a safety factor may be applied to the combined loading scenario as a whole rather than on a primary load which defines a conditional maximum based on the results of this investigation increasing the safety factor associated with a primary load for conditional maximum may not have the same effect on the secondary loads 6 load vectors associated with most likely extreme primary load response from rcwts vs mcs another interesting comparison between combined loading statistics from the rcwts and mcs is of individual load vectors around the lifetime combined loading event at time t 0 the following subsections consider these load vectors associated with the most likely 1000 h extreme primary load response or the response with a p n e 0 368 where m p t 0 r m p note that this wave for crrw is the irregular crrw associated with the m p t 0 response with p n e 0 368 not the mlrw all load vector time series from the rcwts and mcs have the same duration about 22 s centered around time t 0 when the m p t 0 r m p response occurs 6 1 head seas fig 14 a shows the load combinationfactor l c f vector excited by the m edw m crrw dlg and mcs wave that excites the m w t 0 response in head seas with p n e 0 368 the first row shows this load vector excited by m edw the second row by m crrw the third row by dlg and the fourth row by mcs the columns give different projections of this load vector the load vector correlation matrices σ are given in eq a 10 in the appendix where the first element is m w the second m s p and the third m t t along with the difference between the rcwt and mcs correlation matrices eq 5 gives the rank and absolute value of the determinant of the difference between the rcwt and mcs correlation matrices which quantifies the spread in the load data from the rcwts as compared to mcs a lower determinant indicates that the rcwt correlation matrix is more similar to the mcs correlation matrix 2 2 the difference σ r c w t σ m c s and the absolute value of det σ r c w t σ m c s can be interpreted similarly as evaluating the spread of data around its mean the difference σ r c w t σ m c s shows how similar the rcwt and mcs correlation values are the value det σ r c w t σ m c s captures the volume of the data cloud associated with the rcwt correlation values centered around the mcs correlation values the determinant of an n by n matrix is equal to the product of the matrix eigenvalues those eigenvalues correspond to the variance along the principal axis components of the matrix data the product of these eigenvalues or the matrix determinant quantifies the hyper volume whose edges are defined by the matrix vectors if σ r c w t σ m c s the volume of the resulting data cloud centered around the mcs mean would be exactly zero load correlations for m w t 0 response with pne 0 368 rank σ m edw 2 det σ m edw σ mcs 0 073 5 rank σ m crrw 3 det σ m crrw σ mcs 0 134 rank σ dlg 3 det σ dlg σ mcs 0 019 rank σ mcs 3 a few things can be observed from comparing the load vectors excited by the different rcwt and mcs waves the m edw load vector is a periodic ellipse and lies on a 2 d plane unlike the m crrw dlg and mcs load vectors this restriction of the m edw technique was noted in section 2 1 1 because the m edw and the resulting loads are regular waves with the same frequency the load vector is a 2 d ellipse visually the dlg load vector seems to be the most representative of the mcs load vector comparing σ m edw σ m crrw σ dlg and σ mcs in eq a 10 explains some of the visual differences between the rcwt and mcs excited load vectors σ dlg tracks the best with σ mcs in terms of the sign and relative magnitude of each correlation value corresponding to the best visual agreement in fig 14 a comparing the determinants of the difference matrices the dlg gives the best match to mcs followed by m edw and then m crrw all correlation matrices are full rank except for σ m edw section 2 1 1 indicated that an m edw excited load vector has a 2 d range or a correlation matrix with at maximum 2 linearly independent columns relating to a maximum σ m edw rank of 2 due to this rank restriction of σ m edw the vector of n m edw excited loads has a null space dimension of n 2 this rank restriction of σ m edw might also have consequences for constructing a joint pdf of these combined loads a reasonable joint pdf choice could be a joint gaussian but since σ m edw is singular it cannot be used to assemble such a pdf similar trends can be noticed for the load vectors excited by the m edw m crrw dlg and mcs wave constructed for the m t t t 0 response in head seas with p n e 0 368 shown in fig 14 b the load vector correlation matrices and difference between the rcwt and mcs correlation matrices are given in eq a 11 in the appendix while the rank and absolute value of the determinants of these difference matrices are given in eq 6 visually the dlg excited load vector seems to give the best agreement with the mcs load vector in the same way σ dlg gives best agreement to σ mcs in terms of relative magnitude and sign of the correlation terms in both of these head seas cases m edw

t t 0 response in beam seas with p n e 0 368 the load vector correlation matrices and the difference between the rcwt and mcs correlation matrices are given in eq a 12 in the appendix where order of the elements is m w m s p and m l t the ranks of the correlation matrices and absolute value of the determinant of the difference matrices are given in eq 7 comparing the determinants of the difference matrices in eq 7 the dlg best captures the mcs load correlations for this case followed by m crrw and then m edw load correlations for m lt t 0 response with pne 0 368 rank σ m edw 2 rank σ

the m edw m crrw dlg and mcs wave that excites the 1000 h extreme m s p t 0 response in oblique seas with p n e 0 368 the oblique seas condition considers all 5 global loads so only the 2 d projections of this vector are plotted the load vector correlation matrices and the σ r c w t σ m c s matrices are given in eq a 13 in the appendix where order of the elements is m w m s p m l t m h and m t t eq 8 gives the ranks and absolute values of the determinants of the difference matrices for this load case based on m s p t 0 r m s p load correlations for m sp t 0 response with pne 0 368

excited load vector is more apparent as the load vector still lies on a 2 d plane in the 5 d space this is reflected by σ m edw which still has rank 2 even though this case includes all 5 global loads despite this limitation m edw still tracks the mcs load correlations quite well but overall the dlg has the best load correlation match with mcs for this case supported by the remarkable visual comparison between the mcs and dlg wave leading to the m s p t 0 response with p n e 0 368 the dlg wave excites very similar load vector shape patterns as mcs especially in the l c f m w l c f m l t l c f m s p l c f m l t l c f m s p l c f m h and l c f m l t l c f m h planes 2nd 5th 6th and 8th columns considering the comparison is of load vectors excited by single irregular waves rather than an ensemble average wave it is impressive that the dlg recovers such a similar simultaneous loading response although the m edw excited load vector corresponding to the m s p t 0 response in oblique seas with p n e 0 368 does not visually track as well with the mcs load vector in terms of the details of the load vector shape it still gives a favorable estimation of the load correlations similar to the comparisons of the conditional cdf s although the m edw wave does not capture the details e g the non monotonic nature of the cdf s or the randomness of the load vector it does globally describe the combined loading scenario when considering the load correlations m crrw does lead to an irregular load vector like mcs but does not estimate these load correlations as well as m edw fig 17 shows the load vectors excited by the rcwts and mcs associated with the m h t 0 response in oblique seas with p n e 0 368 the load correlation matrices difference matrices ranks of the correlation matrices and determinants of the difference matrices are given in eq a 14 and eq 9 respectively again in this case the dlg proves the best visual match to the mcs load vectors especially in the l c f m w l c f m l t l c f m w l c f m h and l c f m l t l c f m h planes 2nd 3rd and 8th columns based on the determinant of the difference matrices in eq 9 the dlg by far best matches the mcs load correlations load

effort associated with rcwts vs mcs the final comparison to distinguish the rcwts is the computational effort associated with constructing the lifetime combined loading scenarios mainly does a rcwt give up accuracy at the expense of efficiency or vice versa table 3 tabulates the computational effort associated with generating the 500 wave profiles via the rcwts and mcs and collecting the conditional maxima statistics for the 5 combined loading scenarios investigated in this paper the m edw m crrw and dlg waves and load statistics were generated via a macbook pro 2 3 ghs intel core i5 the mcs were run on an ubuntu desktop with 12x intel r xeon r cpu e5 2609 v3 1 90 ghz the difference in computational effort between m edw and m crrw is essentially negligible for engineering purposes although the dlg takes longer it is still efficient compared to mcs 8 discussion of rcwt performance section 3 3 introduced four points of comparison to evaluate the rcwts this section summarizes the results from section 4 section 7 to give an overall comparison of the different rcwt performances as compared to mcs 8 1 rcwt leading to best pdf match examining the combined load conditional pdf s from the rcwts with mcs in section 4 the dlg gives the best visual comparison with mcs in terms of load magnitude and variance for all cases except beam seas where dlg and m crrw seem to give equally good comparisons comparing just m crrw and m edw m crrw much better captures the load variance than m edw but both the m edw and m crrw technique can far over or under estimate a load magnitude as compared to mcs which could be problematic if these load cases are used as inputs to high fidelity structural models to test structural compliance with classification society criteria examining the conditional pdf s also indicates that there may be significant variability in short term extreme combined loading responses it may not be possible to accurately describe short term extreme combined loading scenarios by a single l c f combination which would not describe the potential load variability within that load case rather a distribution of extreme combined loading responses may need to be considered 8 2 rcwt leading to best cdf match comparing the conditional load cdf s from the rcwts with mcs in section 5 the dlg gives either the best or a close second best comparison with the mcs for all f i m i m p where m i m p the dlg captures the non monotonic nature of the mcs conditional cdf s with relatively low error in fact the dlg best matches the mcs conditional cdf s in 7 14 cases only considering f i m i m p where m i m p in 5 14 of these conditional cdf s the edw proves the best match but the dlg comes in a close second surprisingly m crrw only gives the best match with mcs for the two beam seas cases where m i m p comparing just the m crrw and m edw conditional cdf s f i m i m p where m i m p m crrw only out performs m edw in 5 cases f t t m t t m w h f w m w m l t b f s p m s p m l t b f w m w m h o and f l t m l t m h o but a visual inspection of these cdf s in figs 5 fig 6 a 9 and 11 b indicates that for the cases when m crrw outperforms m edw only in three cases f w m w m l t b f s p m s p m l t b and f l t m l t m h o does m crrw give a good approximation to mcs for the other two cases f t t m t t m w h and f w m w m h o the comparison of m crrw to mcs is better than m edw to mcs but m crrw still does not give an accurate representation of the respective mcs cdf s in terms of load magnitude the m crrw technique does capture the non monotonic nature of the mcs conditional cdf s but does not reliably capture the mcs load magnitude for every load scenario 8 3 rcwt leading to best load correlation match examining the load vectors associated with the most likely 1000 h extreme m p t 0 responses in section 6 again suggests dlg gives the best comparison with mcs the dlg waves exciting the 1000 h most likely extreme m p t 0 responses led to the closest load correlation comparison to mcs for all of the examined cases the dlg waves also led to very similar load vector shapes as the associated mcs waves even though this comparison was of single stochastic simulations and not ensemble averages comparing just m crrw and m edw m crrw only out performs m edw for the load vectors based on extreme m l t t 0 response in beam seas and extreme m h t 0 response in oblique seas on the other hand m edw out performs m crrw for matching the equivalent mcs load correlations extreme m w t 0 and m t t t 0 in head seas and extreme m s p t 0 in oblique seas even though the m edw correlation matrices are rank deficient 8 4 efficient vs realistic clearly the m edw and m crrw are the most efficient rcwts although the computation time for the dlg is still minimal when compared to brute force mcs and for engineering purposes considering that the m edw and m crrw methods are based on a similar idea i e airy wave theory or phase shifting frequency components to lead to maximum load responses the added computation time to include all wave frequencies m crrw versus using a single wave frequency m edw is negligible but based on the combined loading statistics evaluated for this trimaran hull it is not clear that using the m crrw technique results in more realistic extreme combined loading scenarios than does the m edw technique as compared to mcs waves from the m crrw technique are certainly more physically realistic because they are irregular but the waves from the m crrw technique did not reliably excite more realistic combined loading scenarios for the examined trimaran hull than the waves from the m edw technique surprisingly the combined loading scenarios from the m edw technique seem to better represent the mcs load scenarios than m crrw despite the fact that the m edw is truly a simplification of the m crrw technique at the very least m crrw did not present a significant improvement over m edw when defining extreme combined loading scenarios for this trimaran hull 9 conclusions this paper investigated 1000 h extreme combined loading statistics on a trimaran generated by three response conditioning wave techniques a modified equivalent design wave m edw approach modified conditioned random response wave m crrw approach and the design loads generator dlg and compared the results with load statistics from brute force monte carlo simulations mcs this investigation illustrated m edw and m crrw approaches which construct ensembles of waves that lead to a distribution of extreme loading responses it is at least recommended to use these m edw and m crrw techniques instead of the traditional edw and crrw techniques to account for the possible extreme load variability of short term combined loading scenarios as the variance in the simultaneous loading distributions can be substantial compared to the analyses in seyffert and kana 2019 and seyffert et al 2018 the m edw technique represents a major improvement over using a single edw to describe combined loading scenarios on this trimaran hull comparing just m edw and m crrw it is not clear if m crrw offers any significant advantage over m edw in realistically describing extreme combined loading scenarios for the examined trimaran hull overall the dlg provides the best comparison with mcs when describing extreme combined loading scenarios for this trimaran with a significant reduction in computation time the dlg captured the load magnitude and variance of the conditional extreme loading pdf s the non monotonic nature of the conditional cdf s and the irregular loading profiles and resulting load correlations for a specific risk parameter i e extreme primary load response with p n e 0 368 this investigation confirms the suitability of the dlg based on efficiency and comparisons with brute force stochastic simulations to construct wave environments leading to rare return period responses even for rare combined loading scenarios on a complex hull like a trimaran acknowledgments the authors would like to thank ms kelly cooper and the office of naval research for their support for this research which is funded under the naval

architecture marine engineering university of michigan usa department of naval architecture marine engineering university of michigan usa corresponding author response conditioning wave techniques are a rational way to link wave excitation environments with return period extreme loading responses by retaining the wave excitation which leads to a design response these techniques can also define extreme combined loading scenarios for complex or novel hull forms combined loading may be relevant for evaluating structural reliability or adequacy but using combined loading scenarios as inputs to high fidelity structural or dynamic modeling tools implies that such load scenarios are realistic for the defined return period this paper investigates three response conditioning wave techniques a modified equivalent design wave method a modified conditioned random response wave method and the design loads generator to evaluate how well they reproduce combined loading statistics for a 1000 hr return period as compared to stochastic brute force simulations the investigation is carried out for extreme combined loading scenarios on a 110 m trimaran hull the design loads generator produces the most realistic extreme combined loading statistics as compared to the brute force approach with a significant reduction in computation time based on combined load conditional probability density functions cumulative density functions and individual stochastic load vectors keywords response conditioned waves combined loading rare responses short term statistics trimaran 1 introduction to ensure adequate lifetime structural performance many classification societies suggest using combined loading scenarios as possible loading conditions to test a vessel s structural compliance see e g lloyd s register 2017 bureau veritas 2018a dnv gl 2018 bureau veritas 2017 2018b american bureau of shipping 2016 2005 iacs 2018 horn et al 2013 classnk 2013 and lloyd s register 2014 the intent of using such combined loading scenarios is to capture the effect of stochastic loads acting in different planes of the vessel however defining such loading scenarios is not simple especially for rare events even defining a return period for multivariate extremes can be ambiguous see e g feld et al 2019 to define simultaneous load effects due to combined loading may require the underlying wave profile which excites these stochastic loads rare combined loading scenarios may be associated with long exposure periods making brute force simulation techniques such as monte carlo simulations mcs potentially intractable multiple response conditioning wave techniques rcwts such as the equivalent design wave edw conditioned random response wave crrw and the design loads generator dlg have been developed to construct wave profiles expected to excite specific loading scenarios these methods are significantly more computationally efficient than mcs because they do not simulate the entire return period to construct waves that excite return period extreme load responses such efficiency and simplicity have made these methods popular because they can easily be implemented by engineers to define lifetime combined loading scenarios it is worth wondering though whether the simplicity of some of these techniques comes at the expense of accuracy in defining realistic combined loading scenarios associated with long return periods this paper examines that potential trade off by comparing rcwt defined short term rare combined loading scenarios with equivalent scenarios from mcs the main questions of interest here are what are the inherent limitations or assumptions associated with these rcwts do these techniques recover the same statistics of lifetime combined loading scenarios that result from a brute force mcs approach and how does increasing a safety factor affect these load scenarios these are timely questions especially as rcwts are gaining popularity in industry practice for defining load scenarios to evaluate structural adequacy of vessels even for novel hull forms like trimarans see lloyd s register 2017 the paper is structured as follows section 2 gives some background to the rcwts examined in this investigation section 3 establishes the trimaran case study and benchmarks to compare the combined loading scenarios from the rcwts with mcs sections 4 7 evaluate the techniques via the established benchmarks finally section 8 discusses the trade offs between the rcwts and section 9 offers some recommendations and conclusions 2 response conditioning wave techniques this section gives a short background on some response conditioning techniques which define a wave excitation profile based on a specific load response with a given return period it is worth acknowledging the many other methods that examine combined loading including but certainly not limited to combination formulas like turkstra s rule turkstra 1970 or the ferry borges castanheta method ferry borges and castanheta 1971 load coincidence models wen 1993 point crossing methods huang and moan 2008 and cross spectral methods alfred mohammed et al 2012 2016 for a recent investigation of such load combination models and their sensitivity when performing a hull girder reliability analysis see piscopo and scamardella 2019 this paper however only examines a few response conditioning wave techniques which are chosen based on either their present usage as defined by classification societies edw potential for expanding on these classification society methods crrw or expected accuracy in capturing lifetime conditional loading statistics dlg in general all of these techniques have a similar aim to construct wave profiles which lead to extreme responses of a defined load scenario consider a stochastic wave profile time series η t 1 η t j 1 n a j c o s ω j t ϕ j where a j 2 s ω j δ ω s ω single sided wave energy spectrum ϕ j phase between π and π if the phases ϕ j are uniformly distributed between π and π as the number of frequency components n approaches infinity the random variable h expressed by the random process η t approaches a gaussian random variable in general rcwts condition a wave profile expected to lead to a pre determined response value at a pre determined time say t 0 in this case the phases ϕ j may not be uniformly distributed between π and π but will likely be tuned based on a transfer function of the desired response consider now some response of interest y t which is excited by the wave elevation η t expressed as 2 y t j 1 n a j h j c o s ω j t ϕ j ψ j where a j 2 s ω j δ ω s ω single sided wave energy spectrum h j value of the transfer function relating the wave excitation and the process y t at ω j ϕ j wave phase between π and π from eq 1 ψ j process y t transfer function phase at ω j the random variable y similarly approaches a gaussian random variable as n approaches infinity and if ϕ j are uniformly distributed between π and π the rcwts focus on defining the wave phases ϕ j such that the resulting y t 0 response is a rare occurrence of course eqs 1 2 are linear relationships but in general response conditioning wave techniques are based upon linear theory and the assumption that a nonlinear response is a correction of the associated linear response it is expected though that the processes employed in this investigation and conclusions would be similar for nonlinear non gaussian models 2 1 equivalent design waves equivalent design waves are regular waves constructed to lead to a specific load value here referred to as a design value in a given heading at a specified instant in time again at t 0 to define a load combination case a single load is chosen as the primary load called m p which is the load the edw is constructed to maximize this edw is constructed using the response amplitude operator transfer function of m p r a o m p ω e in a particular heading the frequency of the edw called ω e is the encounter frequency corresponding to the peak value of r a o m p ω e by construction the edw and resulting load profiles are regular waves with this same frequency ω e the value of the primary load r a o and phase at this frequency ω e are used to define the resulting edw interested readers are referred to seyffert and kana 2019 and seyffert et al 2018 for more discussion on the implementation of the edw technique for this investigation 2 1 1 implications of edw assumption the major assumption of the edw method is that the wave which excites a specified loading scenario is regular and that the resulting loads are regular waves with the same frequency this makes for a very simple construction of the edw and resulting load profiles but means that the resulting load profiles have a limited range consider a vector of time varying load profiles excited by an edw since all of the load profiles are phase shifted cosines with the same frequency ω e the implication is that the combined load vector in n dimensional space each dimension relating to a specific global load will be a 2 d ellipse the shape of an edw driven load vector is pre determined because any phase shifted cosine with a given frequency can be represented as a weighted linear combination of a sine and cosine wave at that same frequency for load vectors excited by an edw this means that the range of an n dimensional load vector excited by an edw has the maximum dimension of 2 graphically an n dimensional load vector excited by an edw plotted in n dimensional space will trace out an ellipse which lies on a 2 d plane the range of that ellipse has dimension 2 and the null space has dimension n 2 regardless of the number of loads n excited by the edw 1 1 consider the set of functions v on r that are a sum of a sine and cosine wave with the same frequency i e a s i n x b c o s x where a and b are real constants v is a vector space because linear sums of elements of v and scalar multiples of elements of v are also members of v since s i n x and c o s x are maximally linearly independent in v meaning that there are no other linearly independent functions in the vector space v they form a basis of v the implication of this is that a vector of n combined loads excited by an edw has at maximum 2 linearly independent dimensions such results can readily be confirmed from linear algebra or signal processing textbooks see e g smith 2002 indeed the fact that s i n x and c o s x form a basis of v is an underpinning of the fourier series the major question for evaluating the edw as a response conditioning wave technique is then do the limitations stemming from the regular wave assumption outweigh the simplicity of application can the edw lead to realistic combined loading scenarios as compared to more complex rcwts and the benchmark mcs 2 2 new waves most likely waves and conditioned random response waves many response conditioning wave techniques have been developed to take the general idea of the edw to construct a wave which leads to an extreme system response of interest and correct for its shortcomings namely that the edw is a regular wave these techniques do not determine such wave profiles via brute force simulation techniques but rather linear and probabilistic theory based on expectations of wave profiles given certain conditional criteria lindgren introduced the new wave profile giving a form for the expected i e most likely profile of a gaussian process conditioned on an extreme peak value at a given time instant lindgren 1970 this result was also demonstrated by tromans et al 1991 friis hansen and nielsen developed the most likely wave mlw by expanding the new wave profile to condition on both the wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency friis hansen and nielsen 1995 if this instantaneous frequency is the mean frequency ω m 1 m 0 where m i is the i th moment of the wave energy spectrum the mlw simplifies to the new wave profile but since this new wave profile is simply the autocorrelation function of the wave spectrum taylor et al added randomness to the expression by embedding this most likely wave profile into a random seaway taylor et al 1997 however a single extreme wave crest may not excite extreme dynamic responses airy wave theory suggests that the wave leading to the worst case system response is the one which excites a response where all frequency components have a peak at the same time torhaug developed the critical wave episode model which identifies wave profiles via a linear model that are expected to lead to extreme system responses this model uses simulations based on design sea state histories to screen for critical wave characteristics torhaug 1996 for example a critical wave characteristic might be extreme wave height meaning that the constructed critical wave episode is based on the new wave model other authors have constructed wave profiles which lead to specific vessel responses by using the linear transfer function that links the wave excitation and response dietz combined the most likely wave mlw profile from friis hansen and nielsen with the most likely extreme response mler method from adegeest et al 1998 to develop the most likely response wave mlrw dietz 2004 the deterministic mlrw is conditioned on a linear vessel response taking a specified extreme value at a given instant in time with a given instantaneous frequency if this instantaneous frequency is the mean frequency the mlrw is the same as the mler wave when this mlrw mler wave includes a random background it is referred to as a conditioned random response wave crrw the mlwr and therefore the crrw is similar to the edw approach in that the linear response transfer function defines the resulting phase of the conditioned wave component at each frequency component the mlrw uses the range of frequencies from the response transfer function instead of the peak frequency like the edw to define the amplitude of each wave component the mlrw incorporates the envelope process of the response along with an instantaneous frequency requirement at the time of the response event the crrw further includes normally distributed coefficients in the wave amplitudes leading to an irregular wave profile the details of the derivation of the crrw can be found in dietz 2004 the formulation of the crrw technique employed here follows drummen et al 2009 it is worth noting though that the crrw does not include randomness in the extreme loading event itself as this value is fixed a priori 2 3 generating a distribution of extreme responses from edw crrw by construction the edw and crrw techniques are designed to lead to a single a priori defined load value while the crrw includes randomness in the constructed wave profile there is no randomness included in the extreme load response of interest at t 0 in reality though a vessel experiences a distribution of extreme loading based on the exposure time in the operational profile this is reflected when running mcs and in waves constructed by the design loads generator as discussed in the next section section 2 4 a distribution of extreme responses is collected to compare with the dlg and mcs the edw and crrw techniques are adjusted to construct an ensemble of waves which lead to a distribution of extreme load values a closed form distribution can be defined for extreme values of a gaussian process given its zero crossing period and the return period then an ensemble of extreme load values can be chosen such that their empirical histogram approaches the theoretical gaussian extreme value distribution evd for the defined exposure as deep water waves can be assumed gaussian and the loading transfer functions are linear this is a reasonable estimation of the extreme loading distribution this logic constructs the dlg wave profiles an ensemble of waves that lead to a distribution of extreme responses whose empirical histogram approaches the gaussian evd based on this ensemble of extreme load values which follow the gaussian evd an ensemble of equivalent design waves and conditioned random response waves can be constructed which excite these load values this approach distinguishes the modified edw m edw and modified crrw m crrw approaches used in this investigation this modification allows a direct comparison between the m edw m crrw dlg and mcs approaches for the different combined loading scenarios considered as all rcwts construct ensembles of waves leading to distributions of extreme load responses 2 4 design loads generator the dlg was developed to construct an ensemble of irregular wave profiles which are expected to lead to extreme return period linear system responses based on a loading transfer function and an exposure time alford 2008 kim 2012 unlike the response conditioning wave techniques discussed in the previous subsections the dlg does not fix the extreme load value a priori and then back calculate a wave profile which leads to this response based on summing phase shifted regular wave components via airy wave theory instead the question that drove the development of the dlg was what is the distribution of wave phases ϕ j in eq 1 that leads to extreme responses of y t at time t 0 which belong to the gaussian evd for a given exposure the main differences between the rcwts discussed earlier and the dlg are the dlg does not require an a priori definition of the extreme load value at t 0 to construct the underlying wave profile unlike edw and crrw the extreme load value excited by a dlg wave is by construction a member of the gaussian evd for the defined exposure period the dlg constructs an ensemble of short irregular wave profiles which excite extreme return period response values which belong to the theoretical gaussian evd based on a characteristics period of the response e g zero crossing period and the return period the phases ϕ j in eq 1 of the dlg waves are not limited based on the phases of the associated linear transfer function which describes the response of interest the edw can be seen as a simplification of eq 1 where only the frequency ω e which corresponds to the peak of the load r a o m p is included and where the height of this wave is scaled to lead to a specific design value by construction then the edw wave phase ϕ j is defined by the transfer function phase at the frequency ω e ψ j the mlrw crrw wave uses more frequency components than the edw and conditions based on an instantaneous frequency but also has the phase of each regular wave component defined completely by the load transfer function i e ϕ j ψ j therefore both edw and crrw construct waves with phases at each frequency component which only take on values contained in the range of phases in the load transfer function in contrast the dlg wave components at each frequency can take phases between π and π 3 case study trimaran for the numerical investigation of how well different response conditioning wave techniques describe lifetime combined loading scenarios a trimaran hull is examined combined loading is relevant for trimaran structural design especially the cross deck structure increasing advances in high fidelity structural modeling allow an in depth study of such complex structural responses but the limited historical and anecdotal knowledge about trimarans makes efficiently applying such models difficult therefore response conditioning wave techniques may be relevant to define a finite number of lifetime combined loading scenarios for use in such tools indeed some classification societies have already suggested this procedure to evaluate the adequacy of trimaran structures e g lloyd s register 2017 to compare load combination scenarios defined by the different rcwts the trimaran hull is the same as used in seyffert and kana 2019 seyffert et al 2018 which examined combined loading scenarios defined by the edw technique the trimaran parameters and operational profile for the load scenarios are given in table 1 for this analysis the rareness of the load combinations is limited by the exposure period which can reasonably be simulated by mcs to give converged statistics therefore the chosen exposure time is 1000 h although a designer may be interested in rarer combined loading events it is relevant to evaluate whether the rcwts accurately describe load scenarios at a shorter return period like 1000 h it is not expected that edw or crrw will become more accurate for describing rarer responses or for flexible hulls where non linearities will be more dominant as compared to brute force stochastic simulations or physical model tests see e g drummen et al 2009 the dlg waves will still be statistically valid for events associated with longer return periods as any return period can be related to a gaussian evd though the gaussian process assumption may break down for such rare responses due to non linearities 3 1 combined loading scenarios on a trimaran typically combined loading scenarios are based on conditional maxima for all of the techniques described in section 2 the load scenarios are defined by the simultaneous responses of all loads when a specific global load attains its 1000 h extreme value these global loads are defined in fig 1 the vertical wave bending moment m w is the wave pressure distribution integrated across the depth of the vessel and the horizontal bending moment m h is the pressure distribution integrated across the vessel breadth m w vertical wave bending moment m s p splitting bending moment m l t longitudinal torsional bending moment m h horizontal bending moment m t t transverse torsional bending moment for this investigation combined load scenarios are defined when each of the global loads in fig 1 attains its extreme value in a given heading the linear version of the high order potential flow code aegir kring et al 2004 was used to generate the trimaran transfer functions of the global loads these transfer functions are adapted from seyffert and kana 2019 and seyffert et al 2018 where the minimum earth coordinate frequency was ω 0 0 4859 rad s here the transfer functions are linearly extrapolated so that the minimum frequency is ω 0 0 rad s the amplitudes are linearly extrapolated so that the amplitude at ω 0 0 rad s is zero the phases are extrapolated so that all phases at ω 0 0 4859 rad s equal the transfer function phase at ω 0 0 4859 rad s this extrapolation is necessary to conduct mcs to examine lifetime loading scenarios the mcs analysis uses the fast fourier transform fft algorithm to simulate the stochastic ocean environment the fft algorithm assumes the frequency range begins from ω 0 0 rad s requiring the extrapolation for this investigation the extrapolated transfer functions are shown in fig 2 3 2 design values of global loads as described in seyffert and kana 2019 and seyffert et al 2018 the heading of each load scenario is based on the heading where the specific global load attains its largest 1000 h extreme value in each heading the most likely extreme value of each load is determined using extreme value theory see e g ochi 1990 with a zero crossing period based on spectral moments these 1000 h most likely extreme values based on heading are given in table 2 the largest most likely extreme value of a load m i over all the headings is defined as the design value r m i and given in bold not all transfer functions were constructed for all headings in those cases the most likely extreme value for that load case is marked as load combination factors or lcfs can be defined as the resulting load combination where each load is normalized by its respective design value 3 3 evaluating rcwt defined lifetime combined loading scenarios defining realistic combined loading scenarios is of vital importance for an adequate structural design of novel vessels like trimarans if these load scenarios are used in high fidelity modeling tools to assess a design s structural adequacy it is important that these load scenarios are statistically relevant and physically realistic the main question is then does it matter which technique is used to define these load scenarios m edw m crrw dlg mcs do all of these methods give comparable statistics of lifetime combined loading scenarios clearly any load combinations derived from statistics of brute force mcs associated with the desired exposure period will be the most realistic because these situations are not based on any load conditioning only the system physics as described in the stochastic simulations while a brute force mcs approach is not a feasible approach for daily use by engineers to define lifetime load combinations it can certainly be used as a benchmark to compare the other techniques for each heading 500 1000 h mcs are run and statistics on the conditional maxima for each global load in fig 1 are collected in the headings suggested by table 2 as well the wave profile and resulting load vector time series around the time of the 1000 h maximum of each global load is saved for later comparison with the m edw m crrw and dlg analyses the points of comparison between these techniques will be 1 how do conditional probability density functions pdf s for each load case defined by the rcwts compare with mcs section 4 this comparison will give good insight on whether the rcwts accurately describe the relative magnitude and variance of the extreme combined loading distributions for this trimaran hull to evaluate the potential variation in short term extreme combined loading scenarios 2 how do conditional cumulative density functions cdf s for each load case defined by the rcwts compare with mcs section 5 this comparison can illustrate the risk factors associated with these load scenarios and whether increasing the risk factor on the primary load in a load case affects all loads equally 3 how do load vectors associated with the most likely 1000 h extreme primary load response from the rcwts compare with mcs section 6 this comparison will give insight on the simultaneous load correlations excited by the rcwts 4 what is the computational effort associated with employing rcwts versus mcs section 7 this comparison will help balance the simplicity and efficiency of applying the rcwts with the quality of the resulting combined load scenarios 4 conditional pdf s from rcwts vs mcs the first way to compare the rcwts in terms of defining realistic combined loading scenarios is by considering the conditional pdf s assembled by each technique for each case in each case a single global load called the primary load m p is maximized at time t 0 in the heading directed by the design values in table 2 the different rcwts m edw m crrw dlg assemble wave profiles which lead to 500 m p t 0 values belonging to the gaussian evd where r m p is the 1000 h most likely extreme value for the operational profile in table 1 these resulting wave profiles can be used to assemble distributions of all m i t 0 responses conditioned on the extreme m p t 0 events to describe these conditional pdf s constructed by the different rcwts and by mcs the nomenclature in eq 3 in box i is used by construction then all rcwts will lead to a 1000 h extreme value m p t 0 distribution with a most likely extreme value at the load design value i e l c f 1 based on the conditioning technique the conditional m i t 0 distributions will differ the load pdf s from the rcwts and mcs are compared when normalized both as a l c f and in physical dimensions to illustrate how well the rcwts capture the potential load variance for the different cases 4 1 head seas in head seas both m w and m t t experience their design value conditional pdf s based on 1000 h extreme m w t 0 and m t t t 0 responses in head seas are shown in figs 3 a 3 b respectively from figs 3 a 3 b it is clear that the conditional pdf s from the dlg prove the best visual match with the conditional pdf s from mcs the f i m crrw m i m w h and f i m crrw m i m t t h distributions overestimate the respective mcs distributions positive f t t m crrw m t t m w h and negative f s p m crrw m s p m w h and positive f w m crrw m w m t t h and negative f s p m crrw m s p m t t h in contrast f i m edw m i m w h and f i m edw m i m t t h do not exhibit any single trend when compared with mcs the m edw method under predicts f t t mcs m t t m w h but f s p m edw m s p m w h is centered around l c f 0 like the respective mcs distribution however f s p e d w m s p m w h is extremely narrow unlike the respective distributions from the dlg m crrw and mcs this result is not surprising though when considering the construction of m edw waves the m edw waves conditioned to maximize m w t 0 have the frequency ω e 1 69 rad s at this frequency the phase difference between m w and m s p is about π 2 radians when m w is maximized at t 0 by the edw m s p is almost π 2 radians out of phase with the m w response resulting in a load distribution at t 0 centered around l c f 0 with low variance 4 2 beam seas in beam seas only m l t experiences its design value conditional pdf s based on 1000 h extreme m l t t 0 responses in beam seas are shown in fig 4 all of the rcwts give reasonable estimates of the mcs pdf s conditioned on extreme m l t t 0 responses in beam seas as compared to mcs all techniques indicate that f w m w m l t b is marginally positive and close to l c f 0 the m edw technique seems to slightly over estimate the peak of the f s p m s p m l t b response distribution 4 3 oblique seas in oblique seas both m s p and m h experience their design value conditional pdf s based on 1000 h extreme m s p t 0 and m h t 0 responses in oblique seas are shown in figs 5 a 5 b respectively there are some striking differences between the f i m i m s p o fig 5 a and f i m i m h o fig 5 b distributions assembled by the rcwts and by mcs the f i m edw m i m s p o and f i m edw m i m h o distributions are significantly narrower than the respective mcs distributions although they do generally track the relative magnitude of the mcs distributions the m crrw technique tracks the relative variance of the mcs distributions but in some instances noticeably over predicts the load magnitude negative f t t m crrw m t t m s p o and negative f l t m crrw m l t m s p o or under predicts that load magnitude f t t m crrw m t t m h o the most surprising difference when comparing the rcwt and mcs conditional pdf s is that the m crrw technique predicts the incorrect sign for both f h m h m s p o and f s p m s p m h o as compared to mcs this sign difference from m crrw for these loads may be explained by the phase restriction of the m crrw based on the range of the load transfer function phases fig 2 indicates that m s p and m h are nearly π radians out of phase for about half of the frequency components 0 ω e 0 7 based on the m crrw construction then where the regular wave components have phases defined by the load transfer function phases i e ϕ j ψ j a significant portion of these regular wave components phased to maximize m s p t 0 in oblique seas will excite simultaneous negative m h t 0 responses and vice versa this can explain why m crrw suggests the conditional extreme m s p t 0 and m h t 0 responses have opposite signs the m edw approach also has this phase limitation but only for a single frequency based on the peak of the primary load r a o it is worth reiterating though that all rcwts as well as mcs use the same transfer functions from fig 2 the dlg and mcs do not limit the wave phases ϕ j in eq 1 based on the range of the transfer function phases like m crrw and m edw 5 conditional cdf s from rcwts vs mcs the conditional load pdf s assembled by the rcwts and by mcs in figs 3 a 5 b do not explicitly link the simultaneous global load values at time t 0 therefore conditional cdf s from the rcwts and mcs are examined with the nomenclature defined in eq 4 in box i for clarity only 50 samples are included in each conditional cdf these 50 samples are at equally spaced probability of non exceedance p n e intervals within the primary load extreme values excited by the 500 m edw m crrw dlg and mcs wave profiles 5 1 head seas fig 6 a shows the cdf s from the rcwts conditioned on 1000 h extreme m w t 0 responses in head seas while fig 6 b shows the cdf s conditioned on 1000 h extreme m t t t 0 responses in head seas the conditional cdf s constructed by m edw shown in figs 6 a 6 b are monotonic towards larger load values either with positive or negative sign convention with increasing probability of non exceedance p n e this is unsurprising considering that the ensemble of waves constructed by m edw only differ by the wave height which is tuned to excite a specific primary load value the wave phase remains the same across all waves constructed by the m edw technique in contrast m crrw dlg and mcs result in non monotonic conditional cdf s with respect to increasing p n e whereas the m crrw regular wave phases remain unchanged for the frequency components across the ensemble of constructed waves random coefficients stochastically alter the wave amplitudes leading to the non monotonic conditional cdf s when the randomness is not included in the crrw i e reverting back to the mlrw the resulting conditional cdf s are monotonic with increasing p n e as a way to quantitatively compare the rcwt and mcs cdf s conditioned on maximized m w t 0 in head seas consider figs 7 a 7 b fig 7 a examines the percentage of conditional cdf values assembled by each rcwt that are within some error bound of the respective mcs conditional cdf with this bound measured as a percentage of each load s design value considering all 500 extreme load responses if a rcwt cdf were exactly the same as the mcs conditional cdf 100 of its cdf values would have a 0 difference from the design value of the mcs cdf this comparison considers how well the rcwt conditional cdf matches the mcs conditional cdf on a global sense the rcwt leading to the best fit with mcs will have the highest percentage of its conditional cdf values within the smallest percentage difference from the respective mcs cdf i e fastest ascent to 100 on the y axis fig 7 b compares the rcwt and mcs conditional cdf s on a more point by point basis by examining the l c f difference between the conditional cdf s at the 50 p n e values included in the conditional cdf s in this case the rcwt leading to the best fit with mcs will have the minimum difference at each sampled p n e value a perfect fit with the mcs cdf would result in zero difference at each p n e value fig 7 a indicates that the rcwt cdf s conditioned on maximized m w t 0 in head seas all have 100 of their samples within 3 of r m w from the mcs cdf since by construction all rcwts lead to a distribution of m w t 0 values which follow the 1000 h gaussian evd for m w in head seas this is not a surprising result it is far more interesting to consider how well f s p m s p m w h and f t t m t t m w h from the rcwts compare with the mcs cdf s the middle inset of fig 7 a indicates that m edw has the best match with f s p mcs m s p m w h the dlg has a slightly worse comparison and m crrw has the worst comparison with mcs from fig 6 a it is not surprising that f s p m crrw m s p m w h is the worst match to f s p mcs m s p m w h but it is not so obvious why the m edw does better than the dlg for this conditional cdf consider though that f s p m edw m s p m w h does capture the relative magnitude of f s p mcs m s p m w h just not the fact that it is non monotonic since f s p m edw m s p m w h is monotonic and has a range similar to f s p mcs m s p m w h it has more values that are within a small distance to the mcs cdf than does the dlg cdf which is non monotonic but if a m edw conditional cdf does not capture the average magnitude of the respective mcs conditional cdf this comparison suffers as seen for f t t m t t m w h in the right inset of fig 7 a in this case both f t t dlg m t t m w h and f t t m crrw m t t m w h are a far better approximation to f t t mcs m t t m w h than f t t m edw m t t m w h fig 7 b confirms that m edw and the dlg best match f s p mcs m s p m w h while the dlg best matches f t t mcs m t t m w h by construction f w m edw m w m w h and f w m crrw m w m w h follow f w dlg m w m w h as they use the same m w t 0 values to construct the ensemble of waves figs 8 a 8 b give the same comparisons for cdf s conditioned on 1000 h extreme m t t t 0 responses in head seas all f t t m t t m t t h distributions match well with f t t mcs m t t m t t h right inset fig 8 a again by construction as indicated from fig 6 b f w m edw m w m t t h centers on the average of f w mcs m w m t t h giving it a slightly better match to mcs than the dlg left insets of figs 8 a 8 b however the dlg provides nearly an equally good match as m edw to mcs for f w m w m t t h while capturing the non monotonic nature of the conditional cdf unlike m edw the dlg also gives the best match to f s p mcs m s p m t t h as the majority of its samples are within the smallest error bound of f s p mcs m s p m t t h and it has the smallest point by point distance from f s p mcs m s p m t t h middle insets of figs 8 a 8 b 5 2 beam seas fig 9 gives the cdf s from the rcwts conditioned on 1000 h extreme m l t t 0 responses in beam seas and confirms the conclusion from fig 4 that all rcwts give a good estimate of the mcs results for this case figs 10 a 10 b indicate that all of the rcwt conditional cdf s have 100 of their values within 20 of the mcs cdf s based on each load s respective design value in this case m crrw proves the best comparison as all f i m crrw m i m l t b have 100 of samples within 12 of the respective design value from the mcs cdf s for this case both m crrw and the dlg give a better estimate to the mcs conditional cdf s than m edw 5 3 oblique seas figs 11 a 11 b give the cdf s conditioned on 1000 h extreme m s p t 0 and m h t 0 responses in oblique seas respectively figs 12 a 12 b and 13 a 13 b give an in depth comparison of these conditional cdf s from the rcwts with mcs the same trends noticed from earlier cases about the performance of m edw m crrw and dlg in matching the mcs conditional cdf hold in figs 12 a 12 b and 13 a 13 b when the m edw conditional cdf captures the average of the mcs conditional cdf it proves the best comparison such as for f w m w m s p o f t t m t t m s p o and f s p m s p m h o but in these instances the dlg comparison with mcs is favorable and still captures the non monotonic nature of the mcs conditional cdf s surprisingly m crrw performs worse than m edw when comparing with mcs for all conditional cdf s in these oblique seas cases except f w m w m h o and f l t m l t m h o 5 4 effect of increasing primary load p n e on secondary loads the non monotonic nature of the mcs conditional cdf s illustrates an important point about combined loading especially relating to safety factors that is a primary load response associated with a higher p n e is not necessarily associated with larger simultaneous secondary loading values in this case a safety factor applied to the primary load may not actually lead to a load scenario which is harsher in a combined loading sense such a result implies that combined loading scenarios may be better defined based on a relevant limit state versus a conditional maximum approach the probability of not exceeding a specific load value like primary loads which define these load scenarios may be misleading when considering the magnitudes of the simultaneous loading conditions it may be more relevant to examine the probability of exceeding specific combined loading scenarios which are relevant for a design limit state as examined in seyffert et al 2019 in that way a safety factor may be applied to the combined loading scenario as a whole rather than on a primary load which defines a conditional maximum based on the results of this investigation increasing the safety factor associated with a primary load for conditional maximum may not have the same effect on the secondary loads 6 load vectors associated with most likely extreme primary load response from rcwts vs mcs another interesting comparison between combined loading statistics from the rcwts and mcs is of individual load vectors around the lifetime combined loading event at time t 0 the following subsections consider these load vectors associated with the most likely 1000 h extreme primary load response or the response with a p n e 0 368 where m p t 0 r m p note that this wave for crrw is the irregular crrw associated with the m p t 0 response with p n e 0 368 not the mlrw all load vector time series from the rcwts and mcs have the same duration about 22 s centered around time t 0 when the m p t 0 r m p response occurs 6 1 head seas fig 14 a shows the load combinationfactor l c f vector excited by the m edw m crrw dlg and mcs wave that excites the m w t 0 response in head seas with p n e 0 368 the first row shows this load vector excited by m edw the second row by m crrw the third row by dlg and the fourth row by mcs the columns give different projections of this load vector the load vector correlation matrices σ are given in eq a 10 in the appendix where the first element is m w the second m s p and the third m t t along with the difference between the rcwt and mcs correlation matrices eq 5 gives the rank and absolute value of the determinant of the difference between the rcwt and mcs correlation matrices which quantifies the spread in the load data from the rcwts as compared to mcs a lower determinant indicates that the rcwt correlation matrix is more similar to the mcs correlation matrix 2 2 the difference σ r c w t σ m c s and the absolute value of det σ r c w t σ m c s can be interpreted similarly as evaluating the spread of data around its mean the difference σ r c w t σ m c s shows how similar the rcwt and mcs correlation values are the value det σ r c w t σ m c s captures the volume of the data cloud associated with the rcwt correlation values centered around the mcs correlation values the determinant of an n by n matrix is equal to the product of the matrix eigenvalues those eigenvalues correspond to the variance along the principal axis components of the matrix data the product of these eigenvalues or the matrix determinant quantifies the hyper volume whose edges are defined by the matrix vectors if σ r c w t σ m c s the volume of the resulting data cloud centered around the mcs mean would be exactly zero load correlations for m w t 0 response with pne 0 368 rank σ m edw 2 det σ m edw σ mcs 0 073 5 rank σ m crrw 3 det σ m crrw σ mcs 0 134 rank σ dlg 3 det σ dlg σ mcs 0 019 rank σ mcs 3 a few things can be observed from comparing the load vectors excited by the different rcwt and mcs waves the m edw load vector is a periodic ellipse and lies on a 2 d plane unlike the m crrw dlg and mcs load vectors this restriction of the m edw technique was noted in section 2 1 1 because the m edw and the resulting loads are regular waves with the same frequency the load vector is a 2 d ellipse visually the dlg load vector seems to be the most representative of the mcs load vector comparing σ m edw σ m crrw σ dlg and σ mcs in eq a 10 explains some of the visual differences between the rcwt and mcs excited load vectors σ dlg tracks the best with σ mcs in terms of the sign and relative magnitude of each correlation value corresponding to the best visual agreement in fig 14 a comparing the determinants of the difference matrices the dlg gives the best match to mcs followed by m edw and then m crrw all correlation matrices are full rank except for σ m edw section 2 1 1 indicated that an m edw excited load vector has a 2 d range or a correlation matrix with at maximum 2 linearly independent columns relating to a maximum σ m edw rank of 2 due to this rank restriction of σ m edw the vector of n m edw excited loads has a null space dimension of n 2 this rank restriction of σ m edw might also have consequences for constructing a joint pdf of these combined loads a reasonable joint pdf choice could be a joint gaussian but since σ m edw is singular it cannot be used to assemble such a pdf similar trends can be noticed for the load vectors excited by the m edw m crrw dlg and mcs wave constructed for the m t t t 0 response in head seas with p n e 0 368 shown in fig 14 b the load vector correlation matrices and difference between the rcwt and mcs correlation matrices are given in eq a 11 in the appendix while the rank and absolute value of the determinants of these difference matrices are given in eq 6 visually the dlg excited load vector seems to give the best agreement with the mcs load vector in the same way σ dlg gives best agreement to σ mcs in terms of relative magnitude and sign of the correlation terms in both of these head seas cases m edw

t t 0 response in beam seas with p n e 0 368 the load vector correlation matrices and the difference between the rcwt and mcs correlation matrices are given in eq a 12 in the appendix where order of the elements is m w m s p and m l t the ranks of the correlation matrices and absolute value of the determinant of the difference matrices are given in eq 7 comparing the determinants of the difference matrices in eq 7 the dlg best captures the mcs load correlations for this case followed by m crrw and then m edw load correlations for m lt t 0 response with pne 0 368 rank σ m edw 2 rank σ

the m edw m crrw dlg and mcs wave that excites the 1000 h extreme m s p t 0 response in oblique seas with p n e 0 368 the oblique seas condition considers all 5 global loads so only the 2 d projections of this vector are plotted the load vector correlation matrices and the σ r c w t σ m c s matrices are given in eq a 13 in the appendix where order of the elements is m w m s p m l t m h and m t t eq 8 gives the ranks and absolute values of the determinants of the difference matrices for this load case based on m s p t 0 r m s p load correlations for m sp t 0 response with pne 0 368

excited load vector is more apparent as the load vector still lies on a 2 d plane in the 5 d space this is reflected by σ m edw which still has rank 2 even though this case includes all 5 global loads despite this limitation m edw still tracks the mcs load correlations quite well but overall the dlg has the best load correlation match with mcs for this case supported by the remarkable visual comparison between the mcs and dlg wave leading to the m s p t 0 response with p n e 0 368 the dlg wave excites very similar load vector shape patterns as mcs especially in the l c f m w l c f m l t l c f m s p l c f m l t l c f m s p l c f m h and l c f m l t l c f m h planes 2nd 5th 6th and 8th columns considering the comparison is of load vectors excited by single irregular waves rather than an ensemble average wave it is impressive that the dlg recovers such a similar simultaneous loading response although the m edw excited load vector corresponding to the m s p t 0 response in oblique seas with p n e 0 368 does not visually track as well with the mcs load vector in terms of the details of the load vector shape it still gives a favorable estimation of the load correlations similar to the comparisons of the conditional cdf s although the m edw wave does not capture the details e g the non monotonic nature of the cdf s or the randomness of the load vector it does globally describe the combined loading scenario when considering the load correlations m crrw does lead to an irregular load vector like mcs but does not estimate these load correlations as well as m edw fig 17 shows the load vectors excited by the rcwts and mcs associated with the m h t 0 response in oblique seas with p n e 0 368 the load correlation matrices difference matrices ranks of the correlation matrices and determinants of the difference matrices are given in eq a 14 and eq 9 respectively again in this case the dlg proves the best visual match to the mcs load vectors especially in the l c f m w l c f m l t l c f m w l c f m h and l c f m l t l c f m h planes 2nd 3rd and 8th columns based on the determinant of the difference matrices in eq 9 the dlg by far best matches the mcs load correlations load

effort associated with rcwts vs mcs the final comparison to distinguish the rcwts is the computational effort associated with constructing the lifetime combined loading scenarios mainly does a rcwt give up accuracy at the expense of efficiency or vice versa table 3 tabulates the computational effort associated with generating the 500 wave profiles via the rcwts and mcs and collecting the conditional maxima statistics for the 5 combined loading scenarios investigated in this paper the m edw m crrw and dlg waves and load statistics were generated via a macbook pro 2 3 ghs intel core i5 the mcs were run on an ubuntu desktop with 12x intel r xeon r cpu e5 2609 v3 1 90 ghz the difference in computational effort between m edw and m crrw is essentially negligible for engineering purposes although the dlg takes longer it is still efficient compared to mcs 8 discussion of rcwt performance section 3 3 introduced four points of comparison to evaluate the rcwts this section summarizes the results from section 4 section 7 to give an overall comparison of the different rcwt performances as compared to mcs 8 1 rcwt leading to best pdf match examining the combined load conditional pdf s from the rcwts with mcs in section 4 the dlg gives the best visual comparison with mcs in terms of load magnitude and variance for all cases except beam seas where dlg and m crrw seem to give equally good comparisons comparing just m crrw and m edw m crrw much better captures the load variance than m edw but both the m edw and m crrw technique can far over or under estimate a load magnitude as compared to mcs which could be problematic if these load cases are used as inputs to high fidelity structural models to test structural compliance with classification society criteria examining the conditional pdf s also indicates that there may be significant variability in short term extreme combined loading responses it may not be possible to accurately describe short term extreme combined loading scenarios by a single l c f combination which would not describe the potential load variability within that load case rather a distribution of extreme combined loading responses may need to be considered 8 2 rcwt leading to best cdf match comparing the conditional load cdf s from the rcwts with mcs in section 5 the dlg gives either the best or a close second best comparison with the mcs for all f i m i m p where m i m p the dlg captures the non monotonic nature of the mcs conditional cdf s with relatively low error in fact the dlg best matches the mcs conditional cdf s in 7 14 cases only considering f i m i m p where m i m p in 5 14 of these conditional cdf s the edw proves the best match but the dlg comes in a close second surprisingly m crrw only gives the best match with mcs for the two beam seas cases where m i m p comparing just the m crrw and m edw conditional cdf s f i m i m p where m i m p m crrw only out performs m edw in 5 cases f t t m t t m w h f w m w m l t b f s p m s p m l t b f w m w m h o and f l t m l t m h o but a visual inspection of these cdf s in figs 5 fig 6 a 9 and 11 b indicates that for the cases when m crrw outperforms m edw only in three cases f w m w m l t b f s p m s p m l t b and f l t m l t m h o does m crrw give a good approximation to mcs for the other two cases f t t m t t m w h and f w m w m h o the comparison of m crrw to mcs is better than m edw to mcs but m crrw still does not give an accurate representation of the respective mcs cdf s in terms of load magnitude the m crrw technique does capture the non monotonic nature of the mcs conditional cdf s but does not reliably capture the mcs load magnitude for every load scenario 8 3 rcwt leading to best load correlation match examining the load vectors associated with the most likely 1000 h extreme m p t 0 responses in section 6 again suggests dlg gives the best comparison with mcs the dlg waves exciting the 1000 h most likely extreme m p t 0 responses led to the closest load correlation comparison to mcs for all of the examined cases the dlg waves also led to very similar load vector shapes as the associated mcs waves even though this comparison was of single stochastic simulations and not ensemble averages comparing just m crrw and m edw m crrw only out performs m edw for the load vectors based on extreme m l t t 0 response in beam seas and extreme m h t 0 response in oblique seas on the other hand m edw out performs m crrw for matching the equivalent mcs load correlations extreme m w t 0 and m t t t 0 in head seas and extreme m s p t 0 in oblique seas even though the m edw correlation matrices are rank deficient 8 4 efficient vs realistic clearly the m edw and m crrw are the most efficient rcwts although the computation time for the dlg is still minimal when compared to brute force mcs and for engineering purposes considering that the m edw and m crrw methods are based on a similar idea i e airy wave theory or phase shifting frequency components to lead to maximum load responses the added computation time to include all wave frequencies m crrw versus using a single wave frequency m edw is negligible but based on the combined loading statistics evaluated for this trimaran hull it is not clear that using the m crrw technique results in more realistic extreme combined loading scenarios than does the m edw technique as compared to mcs waves from the m crrw technique are certainly more physically realistic because they are irregular but the waves from the m crrw technique did not reliably excite more realistic combined loading scenarios for the examined trimaran hull than the waves from the m edw technique surprisingly the combined loading scenarios from the m edw technique seem to better represent the mcs load scenarios than m crrw despite the fact that the m edw is truly a simplification of the m crrw technique at the very least m crrw did not present a significant improvement over m edw when defining extreme combined loading scenarios for this trimaran hull 9 conclusions this paper investigated 1000 h extreme combined loading statistics on a trimaran generated by three response conditioning wave techniques a modified equivalent design wave m edw approach modified conditioned random response wave m crrw approach and the design loads generator dlg and compared the results with load statistics from brute force monte carlo simulations mcs this investigation illustrated m edw and m crrw approaches which construct ensembles of waves that lead to a distribution of extreme loading responses it is at least recommended to use these m edw and m crrw techniques instead of the traditional edw and crrw techniques to account for the possible extreme load variability of short term combined loading scenarios as the variance in the simultaneous loading distributions can be substantial compared to the analyses in seyffert and kana 2019 and seyffert et al 2018 the m edw technique represents a major improvement over using a single edw to describe combined loading scenarios on this trimaran hull comparing just m edw and m crrw it is not clear if m crrw offers any significant advantage over m edw in realistically describing extreme combined loading scenarios for the examined trimaran hull overall the dlg provides the best comparison with mcs when describing extreme combined loading scenarios for this trimaran with a significant reduction in computation time the dlg captured the load magnitude and variance of the conditional extreme loading pdf s the non monotonic nature of the conditional cdf s and the irregular loading profiles and resulting load correlations for a specific risk parameter i e extreme primary load response with p n e 0 368 this investigation confirms the suitability of the dlg based on efficiency and comparisons with brute force stochastic simulations to construct wave environments leading to rare return period responses even for rare combined loading scenarios on a complex hull like a trimaran acknowledgments the authors would like to thank ms kelly cooper and the office of naval research for their support for this research which is funded under the naval

21651,a coupling algorithm is developed to accelerate the boundary element method for both open water and unsteady calculations it is realized in the way that the full wake alignment is conducted using the vortex lattice lifting line method with discrete wake sheet techniques to convert wake sheets of lifting line to those for boundary element method are described numerical simulations for open water and unsteady case are then carried out it shows that the coupling method predicts similar results as the boundary element method especially for the open water case evident reduction of the computational time is also observed which is 70 and 65 for open water and unsteady calculation respectively keywords computational speed boundary element method wake alignment marine propeller 1 introduction in the 1980s the boundary element method bem was firstly adopted for performance analysis of marine propeller hess and valarezo 1985 kerwin et al 1987 hoshino 1990 after 30 years of development bem is nowadays still the workhorse in the industry for marine propeller design this is mostly due to its computational efficiency and ability to predict various performance aspects of marine propellers which allows a quick assessment of new designs with regard to different requirements bem was primarily designed to predict propeller s open water performance the researcher have gradually extended its usage into the field of unsteady forces hoshino 1993 kinnas and hsin 1992 sheet and super cavitation dynamics fine 1992 vaz 2005 and even tip vortex cavitation lee 2002 wang et al 2016b more recently the research is focused on the propellers radiated noise göttsche et al 2017 cavitation erosion berger et al 2019 flow around blunt trailing edge of propeller or duct du and kinnas 2019 baltazar and de campos 2019 and effect of leading edge vortex tian 2014 bem accuracy depends heavily on the wake sheet geometry the wake sheet is a virtual domain boundary which represents the thin vorticity layer shedding from the marine propeller s trailing edge the wake sheet is discretized into small boundary elements or panels just as the body surface as shown in fig 1 the positions of these wake panels or rather their corners are firstly obtained with empirical model which defines the contraction acceleration and roll up based on measured data kerwin and lee 1978 in 1990s the wake alignment method was introduced pyo 1995 by which the wake sheet geometry is obtained by iterative calculation according to the force free condition the wake alignment makes bem free of some empirical parameters and helps obtain more accurate results especially for off design points and unsteady operations in ship wake field after that different ways to realize the wake alignment have been reported baltazar et al 2012 tian and kinnas 2012 wang et al 2016a which are aimed to improve the accuracy and speed nowadays the wake alignment becomes already a standard component of the modern bem code however wake alignment is a time consuming procedure the panels mutual induced velocities must be calculated in every iteration the time complexity is o n 2 with n being the number of panels the situation is especially serious for unsteady calculations e g operation in ship hull wake field because the flow on every blade cannot be assumed the same and all blades must be modeled instead of only one blade for the open water case in such cases much more panels will be involved this may not pose a big problem for single propeller analysis but when massive calculations are carried out a faster alternative method would help save considerable an amount of time for example for the optimization of propeller blade geometry a combination of the genetic algorithm and bem has been applied by different researchers gaggero et al 2016 foeth 2015 ebrahimi et al 2019 firstly a parametric description of the blade geometry must be designed bem is used to compute the propeller performance and genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal geometric parameter according to the performance different works differ in the parameterization method objective function and restrictions this diversity indicates also the flexibility of such an method compared with the conventional design method in such an optimization process normally several hundreds of different propellers would be analyzed in the current work an approach is developed to reduce the calculation time for wake alignment it is a coupling scheme between lifting line method llm and bem llm is a more simple method in which the blade is represented with only one single line llm especially the lerbs llm lerbs 1952 is mostly used for optimal propeller design based on the betz condition discrete llm was introduced by coney 1989 which makes llm more flexible regarding the design target the discrete llm has afterwards also been applied for the analysis of propellers and wind turbines epps 2010 for a long time the trailing vortices in llm are assumed to be helical lines with constant pitch which is justified by the moderately loading condition near the design point recently the wake alignment idea like in bem is also introduced into llm melo et al 2018 menéndez arán and kinnas 2014 and makes it physically more correct and more accurate in the coupling method the wake alignment is conducted in llm and the obtained wake sheet geometry is used in bem no more wake alignment is conducted in bem the similar idea was presented in krüger et al 2019 but in that work the wake sheet was not fully aligned constant wake sheet pitch along streamwise direction was assumed axisymmetric condition was used and the radial contraction of the slipstream was empirically evaluated its application was thus restricted to open water simulations here this coupling idea is developed further full wake alignment is conducted in llm this means the location of every wake sheet point is iteratively calculated just as in a normal bem code for this purpose a new llm code has been implemented inspired by the algorithm in marten et al 2016 because in llm there is no body panels and besides larger time step and rougher radial discretization can be used the wake alignment is still much faster than in a bem code besides the adoption of a new lifting line algorithm other new techniques are developed to convert the wake sheet from llm to bem for unsteady simulations these include firstly the construction of wake sheet for an arbitrary blade angular position based on those on other positions this is used when different time step sizes are applied in llm and bem another technique is the rediscretization of the wake sheet in both streamwise and radial direction this is necessary when different discretizations are adopted in llm and bem compared with a bem code the presented coupling technique will obtain similar results with much less computational time for both open water and unsteady simulations the manuscript is organized as follows in the next section the algorithms are described including bem llm and the newly developed coupling techniques then in section 3 numerical results are presented including integral forces like thrust and torque as well as pressure distribution and variation and computational time finally the conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methods 2 1 boundary element method here only a brief introduction is presented to allow a better understanding of the whole algorithm more accurate mathematical descriptions can be found in katz and plotkin 2001 wang et al 2016a 2017 in bem the flow is assumed to inviscid and irrotational the inviscid potential theory is used and the main unknown is the disturbed velocity potential ϕ to obtain a deterministic solution of ϕ in the fluid domain its value and normal derivatives on the boundaries are enough these are represented by dipole and source strength on the boundaries and they are the variables to be solved for the domain boundaries consist of the solid body boundary and the wake sheet normally the wake sheet geometry is determined through an iterative process called wake alignment but in current work is pre described using llm the boundaries are discretized into panels i e boundary elements for a numerical solving process as shown in fig 1 there are source and dipole on each panel and they induce potentials and velocities everywhere in the fluid domain in current work the low order bem is used which means the source and dipole strength are constant on the panel on wake panels the source strengths are kept zero for steady cases the dipole strengths are constant on each streamwise wake panel strip and are determined according to kutta condition wang et al 2017 for unsteady cases the wake panel moves with local flow velocity calculated at the panel corner points and its dipole strength does not change with time in such a way the vorticity is convected in a lagrangian manner on the blade wakes in every time step new wake panels are generated at the propeller trailing edge and their dipole strengths are calculated using kutta condition on body panels the source and dipole strengths are obtained by solving a system of linear equations but before that half of the unknowns must be pre determined to make the system determined here the source strengths are pre evaluated according to the inflow velocity i e σ n v i n where n is the outwards normal direction vector and v i n is the relative inflow velocity in the current work the equation system is built using dirichlet boundary condition which requires the disturbed potential ϕ on inner side of the body boundary to be zero with this condition an equation is built for every body panel in a way that sum of all the induced potential on the outer side of each body panel is equal to the dipole strength of itself combine the equations together a system is obtained as 1 a b μ b a w μ w b σ i μ b where μ b and σ are the dipole and source strength on the body panels μ w represent the dipole strength on the wake panels a b a w and b are matrices of the induced potential coefficients of the corresponding singularities on the body panels and i is the identity matrix for steady case the nonlinear kutta condition is adopted and μ w is regarded as known when solving eq 1 an outer iteration is conducted to find the correct μ w value to minimize the pressure jump at trailing edge wang et al 2017 for unsteady case most of μ w values are known from previous time step due to the lagrangian convection but except for those on wake panels adjacent to the trailing edge these panels are newly created in current time step the linear kutta condition is used to build additional equations for these unknowns which are μ w μ b μ b with μ w μ b and μ b being the dipole strengths on the wake panel upper body panel and lower body panel adjacent to the same trailing edge segment in current work the system of linear equations is solved with the gaussian elimination method with pivoting using the lapack package lapack 2020 with strengths of all sources and dipoles the fluid velocity can be calculated the pressure is obtained then with the bernoulli equation the local viscous frictional force is evaluated by applying empirical formulas torque and thrust are computed by integrating the local forces over corresponding body panels the bem code panmare developed in the institute for fluid dynamics and ship theory fds at tuhh is used for current study 2 2 wake alignment lifting line method for the current coupling a lifting line code is developed as a part of the software panmare the basic algorithm is inspired by the work of marten et al 2016 the computational elements in llm are shown in fig 2 discrete lifting lines are bounded on the blade middle surface and chordwise at the middle position between leading and trailing edges the trailing edge and lifting lines are connected by fixed trailing vortices free trailing vortices are generated after the trailing edge and also discretized into segments radial segments connecting the junction points are also used to facilitate unsteady simulations the numerical procedure of unsteady calculation is described in this section the steady case is calculated as an unsteady case until convergence before describing the calculation procedure we firstly introduce a perspective to use panels to represent the system of lifting lines and vortices it can be observed that vortex segments build up many quadrilateral wireframes as shown in fig 2 each quadrilateral wireframe can be regarded as a panel with constant dipole strength fixed ones on the blade are called lifting line panels and free ones on the wake sheet as wake panels according to the equivalence of constant dipole panel and vortex ring katz and plotkin 2001 page 250 the dipole strength of lifting line panel equals to the circulation of the lifting line segment circulations of other segments are the difference of the dipole strengths on the two adjoining panels to avoid circulations on the trailing edge which is represented by the blue segments in fig 2 the dipole strength on first wake panel is set to be equal to that on the adjoining lifting line panel the calculation procedure includes the unsteady wake alignment as outer iterations and solving the lifting line circulations in every outer iteration as inner iterations one outer iteration corresponds physically to one time step as the unsteady wake alignment the wake panels move downstream with local flow their dipole strengths do not change with time which results in a lagrangian manner convection of the vorticity the motion velocity is the sum of the undisturbed free velocity and the induced velocity which is evaluated directly on the panel corner points the mathematical description of the wake alignment is 2 d x x 0 t 0 t d t u x t where x is the position of wake panel corner point x 0 is the its starting position always on the trailing edge t 0 is the time when it leaves the trailing edge and u is the flow velocity different time advancing schemes can be used to solve this formulas and in current work the explicit euler scheme is adopted for the open water cases when the wake alignment converges u x t does not change with t any more therefore x does not depend on the absolute values of t and t 0 but the relative value t t 0 i e 3 x x 0 t 0 t x 0 t 0 t u x x 0 t 0 τ d τ x x 0 t t 0 x 0 0 t t 0 u x x 0 τ d τ so the wake geometry are also temporally constant for unsteady cases with ship wake field when the convergence is achieved x x 0 t 0 t z t t z x x 0 t 0 t satisfies with t being the propeller rotation period and z the blade number with the wake alignment the effect of the tip vortex is included and geometric roll up is achieved another important aspect during the wake alignment is the calculation of induced velocity the induced velocity of an concentrated vortex segment is normally calculated with 4 u i n d γ 4 π r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 2 r 0 r 1 r 1 r 2 r 2 where γ is the circulation of the vortex segment r 0 is the vector from starting point to end point of the vortex segment r 1 is the vector from starting point to the field point and r 2 from end point to field point with field point meaning the point where the velocity is calculated with eq 4 the induced velocity around the vortex segment would be very large and even approaches infinitive as the field point goes to the vortex segment this could lead to instability during the wake alignment especially near the tip vortices to avoid such non physical large induced velocities and to stabilize the wake alignment procedure a desingularization term is used in the current work for the induced velocity u i n d i e 5 u i n d u i n d 1 e r 2 δ 2 where e is euler s number r is the perpendicular distance between the vortex segment and the field point and δ is the desingularization parameter it has been observed that the parameter δ do not have obvious influence on the final results as long as it is still relative small compared to the propeller s radius wang et al 2016b in the current work δ 0 04 d is adopted for the conditions with j 0 6 and δ 0 08 d for j 0 6 where d is the propeller diameter and j is the advance ratio in every time step the circulations γ of lifting lines are calculated with the inner iteration process as depicted in fig 3 for this calculation the c l α and c d α relations are pre described for every blade section where α is the angle of attack and c l and c d are lift and drag coefficient respectively initially the circulations are taken the same as in the last time step or zero for the first time step the velocities are calculated on the control point i e the center of every lifting line with local geometry information blade pitch angles of attack for the blade sections are obtained then with the given c l α relation the c l is obtained which in turn is used to calculate a new circulation according to the equivalence of lift 6 ρ u γ 0 5 ρ c l c u 2 where u is the local velocity and c is the chord length this process is repeated until convergence a relaxation is also conducted to make the convergence stable the circulation obtained by eq 6 is denoted as γ n e w the really new circulation is calculated as 7 γ n e w γ o l d k r γ n e w γ o l d where k r is the relaxation factor experiences show that k r 0 01 works well for most cases the needed c l α and c d α relations are calculated based on the propeller geometry information mainly the sectional thickness ratio t c and camber ratio f c the formula for naca 66 mod thickness distribution together with naca a 0 8 modified mean line is used for the c l calculation sheng and liu 2004 page 240 8 c l 5 8 1 0 25 t c α α 0 c l 0 where 9 c l 0 14 75 f c 1 0 82 t c 10 α 0 1 54 π 180 c l 0 for c d an empirical formula is used jarzyna et al 1996 page 34 11 c d 0 0085 0 001 180 π α 1 0 2 a reverse lifting surface correction is also applied on the c l α relation the correction is based on the data given by morgan et al 1968 to facilitate the programming the data are fitted to polynomials according to the ideas in van oossanen 1974 as the above mentioned thickness distribution and mean line are popular for marine propeller design reasonable estimation of the c l α relation can be obtained even other profiles are used this should be enough in current work to predict the wake sheet geometry 2 3 coupling techniques in an unsteady simulation with the coupling scheme the unsteady llm simulation is firstly carried out after the convergence is achieved the simulation is continued for another revolution in this last revolution the wake sheets of each blade in every time step are saved these saved wake sheets will be used to determine wake sheet geometries in bem simulation then the bem simulation is carried out for two revolutions in every time step new wake panels are produced at the blade trailing edge and other wake panels move downstream as described in section 2 1 but here the positions of the wake panels are determined using the prescribed wake sheet geometry and the velocity calculation is avoided for open water simulation only one wake sheet is saved and used and only one step of bem computation is conducted due to the influence of ship wake field even after convergence the wake sheet geometries will be different when the corresponding blades are at different angular positions therefore the angular position of a wake sheet θ w a k e and a blade is firstly defined here for clear description the angular position of a wake sheet θ w a k e is defined as the radius averaged value on its leading line which coincides with the blade trailing edge i e 12 θ w a k e 1 r r h r h r θ r d r where θ r is the angular position of the point on wake sheet leading line or blade trailing edge and r and r h are radii of the blade and hub respectively the angular position of a blade is defined as the radius averaged value of its trailing edge thus a pair of connected propeller blade and wake sheet have the same angular position the above defined angular position will be used to identity the saved wake sheet and for the following described wake conversions especially for the angular interpolation step in current study larger time step and coarser radial grid would be used in llm than in bem it results in different streamwise and radial grid distributions on the wake sheet besides the angular positions of blades in llm and bem will not coincide due to the different time step sizes thus the llm wake sheets cannot be directly used in bem necessary conversions must be carried out the conversions consist of streamwise refinement angular interpolation and radial refinement as depicted in fig 4 streamwise refinement and radial refinement are to modify the discretization of the wake sheet according to the setups in bem angular interpolation is to get the wake sheet for one blade with arbitrary angular position for open water cases the wake sheet geometry is independent of angular position thus only streamwise refinement and radial refinement are conducted these three conversion steps are described in detail in following for simplification in the description the term wake point is used for the wake panel corner points which defines the discrete wake sheet geometry by age of the wake point we mean the time it has left the trailing edge this is like the term t t 0 in eq 3 2 3 1 streamwise refinement the aim of the streamwise refinement is to make streamwise panel length in accord with the time step size used in bem one wake panel corresponds to the wake sheet being shed in one time step from the trailing edge the age of the wake points in llm is 13 t i 0 for i 0 i 0 5 δ t l l m for i 1 n s l l m and in bem is 14 t j 0 for j 0 j 0 5 δ t b e m for j 1 n s b e m where δ t l l m and δ t b e m are the time step sizes n s l l m and n s b e m mean the numbers of wake panels in the streamwise direction i and j are the indices of wake points in the streamwise direction and the 0 5 in the formula is due to that the first wake panel corresponds to half time step katz and plotkin 2001 to have almost the same wake sheet length n s b e m is determined as follows 15 n s b e m 0 5 n s l l m 0 5 δ t l l m δ t b e m where is the round down function the streamwise refinement can now be done with interpolation on the streamwise vortices with using t i and t j as independent variables but in this way the detailed ship wake field variation especially in the top narrow low velocity region which cannot be totally captured in llm due to the large time step would also be lost in the refined wake sheet geometry in current work a special procedure is developed to restore the lost information in the refined wake sheet here v i n is used to denote the undisturbed inflow velocity including the ship wake field v i n is not constant but has a distribution in the flow field during the streamwise refinement the displacement due to v i n is firstly deducted from the llm wake points position i e 16 x i 0 x i 0 t i v i n x i t d t x i t i 0 v i n x i t d t where x i denotes the wake points position and x i 0 are the positions without displacement caused by v i n in x i 0 there are only the displacements caused by induced velocity then interpolation is conducted on x i 0 with using t i and t j as independent variables the positions x j 0 are obtained finally the displacements due to v i n are added on x j 0 to get the refined wake points locations i e 17 x j x j 0 0 t j v i n x j t d t the integral in eqs 16 and 17 are evaluated numerically using midpoint method as shown in fig 4 a and b such a process rebuilds the small peak of the wake sheet caused by the ship wake field the effect of the developed streamwise refinement method will be further discussed in section 3 2 2 3 2 angular interpolation after the llm calculation wake sheets at some specific angular positions are available wake sheet geometry at an angular position which is not included in the available ones might be needed for the bem simulation in this situation a process named here as angular interpolation is conducted to produce wake sheet at the targeted angular position the angular position of the targeted wake sheet is denoted as θ t firstly the existing wake sheets are sorted by their angular positions then an interval in the sorted angular positions which embraces θ t is searched out that means when the end angles for this interval are denoted as θ 0 and θ 1 then the relation θ 0 θ t θ 1 holds the streamwise refined wake sheet at θ 0 and θ 1 would be used to generate the new wake sheet at θ t in this section the superscripts 0 t and 1 are used to indicate the variables associated to these three different wake sheets respectively the time when the blade is at the angular positions θ 0 θ t and θ 1 are defined as t 0 t t and t 1 then we have 18 δ t t 0 t t t 0 θ t θ 0 ω 19 δ t 1 t t 1 t t θ 1 θ t ω where ω is the propeller rotation speed we use t j to denote the age of wake points on the new wake sheet as defined in eq 14 the corresponding points which represent the same fluid particle at other time points on the already known wake sheets then have ages t j 0 t j δ t t 0 and t j 1 t j δ t 1 t interpolation function is used to find positions of the corresponding points on existing wake sheets i e x 0 t j 0 and x 1 t j 1 then linear interpolation is applied to obtain the point location on the new wake sheet 20 x j t x t t j δ t 1 t x 0 t j 0 δ t t 0 x 1 t j 1 δ t 1 t δ t t 0 the new wake sheet is generated by conducting such a computation for all j 0 n s b e m three situations would be encountered during the calculation additional steps for different situations are described in the following they are also depicted as different regions in fig 5 1 t j δ t t 0 0 and t j δ t 1 t t n s b e m in this situation the above described method can be directly applied 2 t j δ t t 0 0 in this situation there is no corresponding point on the wake sheet at θ 0 as shown in region 2 of fig 5 so firstly a temporary point is produced which has an angular position of θ t m p θ t ω t j and an age of zero its position x 0 t m p is obtained by linear interpolation of the leading points of the existing wake sheets in cylindrical coordinate here the obtained position is exact as long as the propeller rotation speed is constant then the point location on the new wake sheet is calculated as 21 x t t j δ t 1 t x 0 t m p t j x 1 t j 1 δ t 1 t t j 3 t j δ t 1 t t n s b e m in this situation there is no corresponding point on the wake sheet at θ 1 as shown in region 3 of fig 5 therefore only the corresponding point on wake sheet at θ 0 is used and a constant distance between the new wake sheet and wake sheet at θ 0 is assumed this leads the calculation formula as 22 x t t j x 0 t j 0 δx the distance vector δx is calculated at the position of t j which is the maximum t j that satisfies t j δ t 1 t t n s b e m the formula for the δx is 23 δx x t t j x 0 t j δ t t 0 an example of angular interpolation is shown in fig 4 c where the yellow wake sheet is obtained using the angular interpolation 2 3 3 radial refinement until now the radial grid distribution on the wake sheet is still determined by the discretization in llm this might be different from the radial grid distribution on the blade in bem as shown in fig 4 c such wake sheets cannot be directly used in the bem calculation the radial refinement is to make the radial discretization of wake sheets in accord with the blade discretization the wake points on the same streamwise vortex line are shed from the same point on the trailing edge and this point is named here as the origin of wake point thus every wake point also its position can be identified with a pair of indices the first for age and the second for origin on the wake sheet obtained by angular interpolation the point positions are x j m m 0 n r l l m and on the wake sheet for bem calculation they are x j n n 0 n r b e m where n r l l m and n r b e m are numbers of panels in the radial direction the position x 0 m coincides with the origin position for points indexed by m and the same holds for x 0 n thus the radii of origins can be evaluated as 24 r m f r x 0 m r n f r x 0 n where f r is the function to calculate radius of a position and the axis and center of the propeller are used for the calculation the radial refinement is then conducted as interpolation on radial vortices with using the origin radii r m and r n as independent variables in this way a new wake sheet in accord with the blade discretization is obtained the effect is shown in fig 4 c and d in the wake conversion procedure interpolations are applied several times they are all simple one dimensional interpolations and the choice of the interpolation algorithm is flexible and should not make large differences the exception is the interpolation described by eqs 20 and 21 during the angular interpolation they are expressed explicitly as linear interpolation otherwise more situations now 3 must be added in the angular interpolation and the algorithm will be complicated generally the linear interpolation would be enough for the accuracy everywhere during the wake conversion however in the current work the cubic interpolations are adopted except for the explicitly indicated linear interpolations the reason for such an over accurate choice is that our wake conversion code was written in python and using cubic interpolation did not add any coding or observable computation burden 3 results in this section the numerical results obtained with the developed coupling method are presented and compared with those obtained with bem the typical computation time is also presented to show its advantages this section is divided into two parts first part for open water simulations and the second part for unsteady simulations in ship wake field 3 1 open water the open water performances of the public available propellers pptc and kp505 are analyzed pptc is 5 blade controllable pitch propeller designed in potsdam model basin its geometry and measured open water performances are available in barkmann 2011 kp505 is a 5 blade fixed pitch propeller which is designed for the moeri container ship kcs its geometry and various experimental data can be found in moeri 2008 the main parameters of these two propellers are listed in table 1 in bem simulation 28 radial 24 chordwise panels are used on the blade one face two revolutions of wake length are simulated a virtual time step corresponding to 6 degrees per step is used in the coupling simulation the same discretization is used for the bem part in llm simulation 10 lifting line segments are used in the radial direction and a virtual time step corresponding to 30 degrees per step is used in both simulations the axisymmetric condition is exploited i e only one blade is simulated and the wake sheet and singularity strengths on other blades are assumed to be the same on the calculated blade in bem the simulation is conducted in an unsteady manner an acceleration technique is applied for the steady calculation in each iteration the wake points move for 10 time steps during which the induced velocities are assumed to be constant then it needs 72 0 6 10 12 iterations to pass the information from blade trailing edge to the most downstream wake panels to make sure that the wake sheet is well deformed a minimum iteration number of 12 1 5 18 is set for the simulation where 1 5 works as a margin factor other than this the square roots of the second central moments of thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and efficiency η in the last ten iterations are used for convergence judgment when all of them are less than a specific value in current work 0 004 the convergence is asserted to be achieved actually for all the simulations the convergence was achieved in 18 iterations this indicates a conservative setting of the minimum iteration number in the coupling simulation no similar acceleration technique is used in the llm part a minimum iteration number of 36 is set which is calculated as 72 0 3 0 1 5 and here 1 5 is a margin factor the same convergence criteria as described above in bem are also used in the llm simulation such a setting is aimed to make sure that the wake sheet geometry is converged after the llm simulation one step of bem simulation is conducted to obtain the final results several advance ratios are simulated for every propeller the results are shown in fig 6 and the relative errors compared with the experimental measurement are shown in fig 7 the results obtained by the bem and the coupling method are almost the same the maximum deviation between the coupling method and bem is within 3 and occurs at j 0 4 of kp505 propeller some difference between the calculated results and the measured data can be observed they are deemed reasonable within the frame of bem calculations the large relative errors for high advance ratios are due to the small absolute values of k t and k q the comparison of wake sheet geometries for kp505 at j 0 6 is shown in fig 8 the wake deformation for coupling method is relatively smaller the details of the tip vortex geometry which has large influence on the open water results are given in fig 9 the tip vortex local pitch obtained with lifting line method shows an oscillation while in bem it is smooth the oscillation is transmitted or a little enhanced during interpolation however the real important thing is the accumulation of the local pitch i e the axial location of tip vortex versus azimuthal angle which determines the distance and mutual influence between tip vortex and the blade the local pitch in llm is generally a little larger than in bem especially near beginning position this leads to more downstream position of the tip vortex in the coupling method compared with bem the quantitative differences are 0 007d 0 009d and 0 013d for the first three blade positions i e for the azimuthal angle 72 144 and 216 degrees considering the similar obtained open water performances such differences can be deemed to be small wake geometry differences for smaller radii are more obvious which however to our experience has little influence on the hydrodynamics result the calculation times are listed in table 2 all the simulations are conducted on a computer with 48 intel r xeon r gold 5118 cpus the code is well parallelized the coupling method costs obviously much less time as stated above the minimum iteration number in bem might be too conservative we also admit that there are various techniques to accelerate the convergence for open water simulation e g in wang et al 2016a it is then to some extent unfair for bem for the comparison in table 2 the comparison can be conducted in another more general way the time for coupling method is kept constant 36 s in the bem simulation it is observed that the preparation operations need 18 s and every iteration costs about 6 5 s an estimation for the bem simulation time is 18 6 5 n seconds with n being the iteration number thus as far as the bem simulation needs more than 3 iterations it lost the speed competition to the coupling method it might be argued that the radial discretization in llm and bem are different 10 vs 28 however llm works only as a tool to obtain wake sheet geometry calculation is like something between empirical model and fully bem wake alignment it is a time saving solution to use less radial strips in llm than in bem additional simulations with 28 radial segments in llm are carried out to verify the configuration the results obtained with 10 and 28 radial lifting line segments are listed in table 3 the difference between the results are small most are less than 0 5 except for pptc j 0 6 this verifies the relative coarse radial discretization adopted in llm 10 radial segments have also been reported in other works menéndez arán and kinnas 2014 to be enough for the llm convergence furthermore a real same discretization in llm and bem could not be achieved with consideration of the chordwise resolution 3 2 unsteady case in this section the unsteady performance of the kp505 propeller is calculated with different methods the propeller operates in a typical single screw ship wake field as shown in fig 10 the blade discretization is the same as in the open water simulation the panel distribution for bem on the blade is shown in fig 11 the time step in bem still corresponds to 6 degrees per step and in llm corresponds to 30 degrees per step there is only one wake panel in the streamwise direction at the beginning and the number increases as the simulation goes on the maximum wake length is set to be 2 revolutions which means the wake panels that go outside of two revolutions will be removed from the simulation it is observed that 4 revolutions are necessary and enough to achieve convergence the 5th revolution can provide a converged variation of the desired variables therefore the bem calculation is carried out for 5 revolutions in the coupling method llm part runs also for 5 revolutions and in the 5th revolution the wake sheets are saved with the obtained wake sheets the bem part runs for another 2 revolutions and the final converged results are extracted in the second revolution for clarification purpose the set up regarding the physical time is also depicted in fig 12 two advance ratios are simulated i e j s 0 9 and j s 0 7 where j s is the advance ratio based on the ship velocity considering the flow deceleration in the ship wake field the propeller works around its design point at j s 0 9 j s 0 7 presents a high loading situation the k t and k q variations in the last revolution are given in fig 13 for j s 0 9 the results of bem and coupling method correlate well except for a range on the top even there the maximum difference is within 1 for k t and 2 for k q for j s 0 7 the differences become larger compared with bem the coupling method underestimates both k t and k q and the maximum error is about 3 for k t and 5 for k q this results in an overestimation of the efficiency by 2 as shown in fig 14 the large differences indicate a large sensibility of the unsteady results to the wake sheet geometry open water simulation fig 15 shows the wake sheets in bem and coupling method the shapes look very similar fig 16 shows the tip vortex axial positions in different methods the differences are small except for a range near 0 where the axial inflow velocity is minimum and suffers a strong variation the maximum tip vortex axial position differences in this region are 0 03 d 0 05 d and 0 08 d for the first three encountered wakes after the blade at 0 as indicated by the green segments in fig 16 at other places as indicated by the green circles in the same figure the typical differences are 0 009 d 0 012 d and 0 018 d which are not dramatically larger than the values in the steady simulation besides the wake geometry the distribution of dipole strength on the wake sheet would also influence the result especially important is its streamwise variation which is decided by the solutions in previous time steps and results in vorticity along the radial direction this is not present in the steady simulation and can lead to accumulation of errors fig 17 shows the single blade s k t and k q variation in one revolution the largest differences do not happen at the places where the blade is near to the largest wake geometry differences i e between 0 and 50 this indicates a complex relationship between wake sheet geometry dipole strength distribution and the solution besides the integral forces the pressure distribution and variation are analyzed the comparison of the calculated pressure distributions for different angular positions and radial sections are shown in fig 18 little differences near the leading edge on the suction side can be observed a typical value is 0 02 larger differences are observed near the leading edge which is typically 0 03 also near the trailing edge the difference of the pressure on pressure side and suction side is smaller in the coupling method this contributes to the smaller k t and k q of the coupling method compared with the bem the pressure history of one fixed point on the blade suction side is shown in fig 19 the point is the center of the panel with pink frame shown in fig 11 it locates around one fifth chord position on the 0 8r section the variation forms of the results for the two methods are the same the value differences are small within 4 although visible here it should be pointed out the relative larger pressure at this point in the coupling method does not imply a larger integral force which would contradict the results shown in figs 13 and 17 regarding the integral force only the pressure difference between the pressure and suction side matters regarding the calculation time the bem simulation costed 1513 s i e around 25 min the coupling method costed 537 s 9 min in which around 35 s are for the llm part thus compared with bem the coupling method decreases the calculation time by 65 i e increases the computational speed by 180 during the streamwise refinement the ship hull wake field induced displacement is firstly deduced from the wake point position and added back after interpolation the effect and influence of such an operation need to be studied therefore an comparison simulation has been conducted with the coupling method in which the time step in llm is set to correspond to 6 degrees that means the time steps in llm and bem are the same and no streamwise refinement is carried out comparing the wake sheet geometry and propeller forces obtained in such a simulation and the simulation mentioned above where the time steps in llm and bem correspond to 30 and 6 degrees respectively help identify the effect of the developed streamwise refinement algorithm the obtained llm wake sheet geometries are shown in 20 large time step cannot capture small features in the ship hull wake field and the streamwise refinement restores most of these features the llm wake sheet obtained by refinement of the result with a coarse time step looks very similar to the one obtained directly with the fine time step the obtained k t variation with both setups are given in fig 21 small deviations exist near the pick but no large difference is observed as a conclusion in the frame of the current coupling method using large time step in llm together with the developed streamwise refinement algorithm generates quite similar results compared with using fine time step in llm it should be mentioned here that large time step size does not only mean less steps for the llm calculation but also less wake panels and then less calculation time for every time step 4 conclusion in the current work a hybrid method coupling wake alignment lifting line method llm and boundary element method bem is developed for the hydrodynamic analysis of marine propellers the coupling method retains all abilities of a bem code and is much faster by using llm for the wake alignment open water calculation and unsteady simulations have been carried out similar integral forces pressure distributions and pressure variation histories are obtained with the coupling method when compared with bem code differences within 3 are observed for open water performances at high loading conditions and are much smaller for around normal loading conditions the deviation for high loading unsteady case is within 3 for k t and 5 for k q for moderate loading case the differences are much smaller for the unsteady simulation the computational time is reduced by 65 for the open water calculation the improvement depends on how many iterations the boundary element code needs for the convergence as long as the iteration number exceeds 3 the coupling method is faster than the bem in the current work the time reduction is around 70 as an alternative way to apply the coupling method one can use the lifting line wake sheet geometry as initial guess and conduct further wake alignment iterations in bem code this would leads to more similar results with bem but also more calculation time it would be still faster than the pure bem method due to the length of manuscript the relative study is not reported here the coupling algorithm and lifting line part described in current work is relatively easy to implement especially when a boundary element code is already available in the way that the wake and wake alignment algorithm are reused for the lifting line method such a coupling algorithm can further improve the work efficiency for propeller design and analysis it also

21651,a coupling algorithm is developed to accelerate the boundary element method for both open water and unsteady calculations it is realized in the way that the full wake alignment is conducted using the vortex lattice lifting line method with discrete wake sheet techniques to convert wake sheets of lifting line to those for boundary element method are described numerical simulations for open water and unsteady case are then carried out it shows that the coupling method predicts similar results as the boundary element method especially for the open water case evident reduction of the computational time is also observed which is 70 and 65 for open water and unsteady calculation respectively keywords computational speed boundary element method wake alignment marine propeller 1 introduction in the 1980s the boundary element method bem was firstly adopted for performance analysis of marine propeller hess and valarezo 1985 kerwin et al 1987 hoshino 1990 after 30 years of development bem is nowadays still the workhorse in the industry for marine propeller design this is mostly due to its computational efficiency and ability to predict various performance aspects of marine propellers which allows a quick assessment of new designs with regard to different requirements bem was primarily designed to predict propeller s open water performance the researcher have gradually extended its usage into the field of unsteady forces hoshino 1993 kinnas and hsin 1992 sheet and super cavitation dynamics fine 1992 vaz 2005 and even tip vortex cavitation lee 2002 wang et al 2016b more recently the research is focused on the propellers radiated noise göttsche et al 2017 cavitation erosion berger et al 2019 flow around blunt trailing edge of propeller or duct du and kinnas 2019 baltazar and de campos 2019 and effect of leading edge vortex tian 2014 bem accuracy depends heavily on the wake sheet geometry the wake sheet is a virtual domain boundary which represents the thin vorticity layer shedding from the marine propeller s trailing edge the wake sheet is discretized into small boundary elements or panels just as the body surface as shown in fig 1 the positions of these wake panels or rather their corners are firstly obtained with empirical model which defines the contraction acceleration and roll up based on measured data kerwin and lee 1978 in 1990s the wake alignment method was introduced pyo 1995 by which the wake sheet geometry is obtained by iterative calculation according to the force free condition the wake alignment makes bem free of some empirical parameters and helps obtain more accurate results especially for off design points and unsteady operations in ship wake field after that different ways to realize the wake alignment have been reported baltazar et al 2012 tian and kinnas 2012 wang et al 2016a which are aimed to improve the accuracy and speed nowadays the wake alignment becomes already a standard component of the modern bem code however wake alignment is a time consuming procedure the panels mutual induced velocities must be calculated in every iteration the time complexity is o n 2 with n being the number of panels the situation is especially serious for unsteady calculations e g operation in ship hull wake field because the flow on every blade cannot be assumed the same and all blades must be modeled instead of only one blade for the open water case in such cases much more panels will be involved this may not pose a big problem for single propeller analysis but when massive calculations are carried out a faster alternative method would help save considerable an amount of time for example for the optimization of propeller blade geometry a combination of the genetic algorithm and bem has been applied by different researchers gaggero et al 2016 foeth 2015 ebrahimi et al 2019 firstly a parametric description of the blade geometry must be designed bem is used to compute the propeller performance and genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal geometric parameter according to the performance different works differ in the parameterization method objective function and restrictions this diversity indicates also the flexibility of such an method compared with the conventional design method in such an optimization process normally several hundreds of different propellers would be analyzed in the current work an approach is developed to reduce the calculation time for wake alignment it is a coupling scheme between lifting line method llm and bem llm is a more simple method in which the blade is represented with only one single line llm especially the lerbs llm lerbs 1952 is mostly used for optimal propeller design based on the betz condition discrete llm was introduced by coney 1989 which makes llm more flexible regarding the design target the discrete llm has afterwards also been applied for the analysis of propellers and wind turbines epps 2010 for a long time the trailing vortices in llm are assumed to be helical lines with constant pitch which is justified by the moderately loading condition near the design point recently the wake alignment idea like in bem is also introduced into llm melo et al 2018 menéndez arán and kinnas 2014 and makes it physically more correct and more accurate in the coupling method the wake alignment is conducted in llm and the obtained wake sheet geometry is used in bem no more wake alignment is conducted in bem the similar idea was presented in krüger et al 2019 but in that work the wake sheet was not fully aligned constant wake sheet pitch along streamwise direction was assumed axisymmetric condition was used and the radial contraction of the slipstream was empirically evaluated its application was thus restricted to open water simulations here this coupling idea is developed further full wake alignment is conducted in llm this means the location of every wake sheet point is iteratively calculated just as in a normal bem code for this purpose a new llm code has been implemented inspired by the algorithm in marten et al 2016 because in llm there is no body panels and besides larger time step and rougher radial discretization can be used the wake alignment is still much faster than in a bem code besides the adoption of a new lifting line algorithm other new techniques are developed to convert the wake sheet from llm to bem for unsteady simulations these include firstly the construction of wake sheet for an arbitrary blade angular position based on those on other positions this is used when different time step sizes are applied in llm and bem another technique is the rediscretization of the wake sheet in both streamwise and radial direction this is necessary when different discretizations are adopted in llm and bem compared with a bem code the presented coupling technique will obtain similar results with much less computational time for both open water and unsteady simulations the manuscript is organized as follows in the next section the algorithms are described including bem llm and the newly developed coupling techniques then in section 3 numerical results are presented including integral forces like thrust and torque as well as pressure distribution and variation and computational time finally the conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methods 2 1 boundary element method here only a brief introduction is presented to allow a better understanding of the whole algorithm more accurate mathematical descriptions can be found in katz and plotkin 2001 wang et al 2016a 2017 in bem the flow is assumed to inviscid and irrotational the inviscid potential theory is used and the main unknown is the disturbed velocity potential ϕ to obtain a deterministic solution of ϕ in the fluid domain its value and normal derivatives on the boundaries are enough these are represented by dipole and source strength on the boundaries and they are the variables to be solved for the domain boundaries consist of the solid body boundary and the wake sheet normally the wake sheet geometry is determined through an iterative process called wake alignment but in current work is pre described using llm the boundaries are discretized into panels i e boundary elements for a numerical solving process as shown in fig 1 there are source and dipole on each panel and they induce potentials and velocities everywhere in the fluid domain in current work the low order bem is used which means the source and dipole strength are constant on the panel on wake panels the source strengths are kept zero for steady cases the dipole strengths are constant on each streamwise wake panel strip and are determined according to kutta condition wang et al 2017 for unsteady cases the wake panel moves with local flow velocity calculated at the panel corner points and its dipole strength does not change with time in such a way the vorticity is convected in a lagrangian manner on the blade wakes in every time step new wake panels are generated at the propeller trailing edge and their dipole strengths are calculated using kutta condition on body panels the source and dipole strengths are obtained by solving a system of linear equations but before that half of the unknowns must be pre determined to make the system determined here the source strengths are pre evaluated according to the inflow velocity i e σ n v i n where n is the outwards normal direction vector and v i n is the relative inflow velocity in the current work the equation system is built using dirichlet boundary condition which requires the disturbed potential ϕ on inner side of the body boundary to be zero with this condition an equation is built for every body panel in a way that sum of all the induced potential on the outer side of each body panel is equal to the dipole strength of itself combine the equations together a system is obtained as 1 a b μ b a w μ w b σ i μ b where μ b and σ are the dipole and source strength on the body panels μ w represent the dipole strength on the wake panels a b a w and b are matrices of the induced potential coefficients of the corresponding singularities on the body panels and i is the identity matrix for steady case the nonlinear kutta condition is adopted and μ w is regarded as known when solving eq 1 an outer iteration is conducted to find the correct μ w value to minimize the pressure jump at trailing edge wang et al 2017 for unsteady case most of μ w values are known from previous time step due to the lagrangian convection but except for those on wake panels adjacent to the trailing edge these panels are newly created in current time step the linear kutta condition is used to build additional equations for these unknowns which are μ w μ b μ b with μ w μ b and μ b being the dipole strengths on the wake panel upper body panel and lower body panel adjacent to the same trailing edge segment in current work the system of linear equations is solved with the gaussian elimination method with pivoting using the lapack package lapack 2020 with strengths of all sources and dipoles the fluid velocity can be calculated the pressure is obtained then with the bernoulli equation the local viscous frictional force is evaluated by applying empirical formulas torque and thrust are computed by integrating the local forces over corresponding body panels the bem code panmare developed in the institute for fluid dynamics and ship theory fds at tuhh is used for current study 2 2 wake alignment lifting line method for the current coupling a lifting line code is developed as a part of the software panmare the basic algorithm is inspired by the work of marten et al 2016 the computational elements in llm are shown in fig 2 discrete lifting lines are bounded on the blade middle surface and chordwise at the middle position between leading and trailing edges the trailing edge and lifting lines are connected by fixed trailing vortices free trailing vortices are generated after the trailing edge and also discretized into segments radial segments connecting the junction points are also used to facilitate unsteady simulations the numerical procedure of unsteady calculation is described in this section the steady case is calculated as an unsteady case until convergence before describing the calculation procedure we firstly introduce a perspective to use panels to represent the system of lifting lines and vortices it can be observed that vortex segments build up many quadrilateral wireframes as shown in fig 2 each quadrilateral wireframe can be regarded as a panel with constant dipole strength fixed ones on the blade are called lifting line panels and free ones on the wake sheet as wake panels according to the equivalence of constant dipole panel and vortex ring katz and plotkin 2001 page 250 the dipole strength of lifting line panel equals to the circulation of the lifting line segment circulations of other segments are the difference of the dipole strengths on the two adjoining panels to avoid circulations on the trailing edge which is represented by the blue segments in fig 2 the dipole strength on first wake panel is set to be equal to that on the adjoining lifting line panel the calculation procedure includes the unsteady wake alignment as outer iterations and solving the lifting line circulations in every outer iteration as inner iterations one outer iteration corresponds physically to one time step as the unsteady wake alignment the wake panels move downstream with local flow their dipole strengths do not change with time which results in a lagrangian manner convection of the vorticity the motion velocity is the sum of the undisturbed free velocity and the induced velocity which is evaluated directly on the panel corner points the mathematical description of the wake alignment is 2 d x x 0 t 0 t d t u x t where x is the position of wake panel corner point x 0 is the its starting position always on the trailing edge t 0 is the time when it leaves the trailing edge and u is the flow velocity different time advancing schemes can be used to solve this formulas and in current work the explicit euler scheme is adopted for the open water cases when the wake alignment converges u x t does not change with t any more therefore x does not depend on the absolute values of t and t 0 but the relative value t t 0 i e 3 x x 0 t 0 t x 0 t 0 t u x x 0 t 0 τ d τ x x 0 t t 0 x 0 0 t t 0 u x x 0 τ d τ so the wake geometry are also temporally constant for unsteady cases with ship wake field when the convergence is achieved x x 0 t 0 t z t t z x x 0 t 0 t satisfies with t being the propeller rotation period and z the blade number with the wake alignment the effect of the tip vortex is included and geometric roll up is achieved another important aspect during the wake alignment is the calculation of induced velocity the induced velocity of an concentrated vortex segment is normally calculated with 4 u i n d γ 4 π r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 2 r 0 r 1 r 1 r 2 r 2 where γ is the circulation of the vortex segment r 0 is the vector from starting point to end point of the vortex segment r 1 is the vector from starting point to the field point and r 2 from end point to field point with field point meaning the point where the velocity is calculated with eq 4 the induced velocity around the vortex segment would be very large and even approaches infinitive as the field point goes to the vortex segment this could lead to instability during the wake alignment especially near the tip vortices to avoid such non physical large induced velocities and to stabilize the wake alignment procedure a desingularization term is used in the current work for the induced velocity u i n d i e 5 u i n d u i n d 1 e r 2 δ 2 where e is euler s number r is the perpendicular distance between the vortex segment and the field point and δ is the desingularization parameter it has been observed that the parameter δ do not have obvious influence on the final results as long as it is still relative small compared to the propeller s radius wang et al 2016b in the current work δ 0 04 d is adopted for the conditions with j 0 6 and δ 0 08 d for j 0 6 where d is the propeller diameter and j is the advance ratio in every time step the circulations γ of lifting lines are calculated with the inner iteration process as depicted in fig 3 for this calculation the c l α and c d α relations are pre described for every blade section where α is the angle of attack and c l and c d are lift and drag coefficient respectively initially the circulations are taken the same as in the last time step or zero for the first time step the velocities are calculated on the control point i e the center of every lifting line with local geometry information blade pitch angles of attack for the blade sections are obtained then with the given c l α relation the c l is obtained which in turn is used to calculate a new circulation according to the equivalence of lift 6 ρ u γ 0 5 ρ c l c u 2 where u is the local velocity and c is the chord length this process is repeated until convergence a relaxation is also conducted to make the convergence stable the circulation obtained by eq 6 is denoted as γ n e w the really new circulation is calculated as 7 γ n e w γ o l d k r γ n e w γ o l d where k r is the relaxation factor experiences show that k r 0 01 works well for most cases the needed c l α and c d α relations are calculated based on the propeller geometry information mainly the sectional thickness ratio t c and camber ratio f c the formula for naca 66 mod thickness distribution together with naca a 0 8 modified mean line is used for the c l calculation sheng and liu 2004 page 240 8 c l 5 8 1 0 25 t c α α 0 c l 0 where 9 c l 0 14 75 f c 1 0 82 t c 10 α 0 1 54 π 180 c l 0 for c d an empirical formula is used jarzyna et al 1996 page 34 11 c d 0 0085 0 001 180 π α 1 0 2 a reverse lifting surface correction is also applied on the c l α relation the correction is based on the data given by morgan et al 1968 to facilitate the programming the data are fitted to polynomials according to the ideas in van oossanen 1974 as the above mentioned thickness distribution and mean line are popular for marine propeller design reasonable estimation of the c l α relation can be obtained even other profiles are used this should be enough in current work to predict the wake sheet geometry 2 3 coupling techniques in an unsteady simulation with the coupling scheme the unsteady llm simulation is firstly carried out after the convergence is achieved the simulation is continued for another revolution in this last revolution the wake sheets of each blade in every time step are saved these saved wake sheets will be used to determine wake sheet geometries in bem simulation then the bem simulation is carried out for two revolutions in every time step new wake panels are produced at the blade trailing edge and other wake panels move downstream as described in section 2 1 but here the positions of the wake panels are determined using the prescribed wake sheet geometry and the velocity calculation is avoided for open water simulation only one wake sheet is saved and used and only one step of bem computation is conducted due to the influence of ship wake field even after convergence the wake sheet geometries will be different when the corresponding blades are at different angular positions therefore the angular position of a wake sheet θ w a k e and a blade is firstly defined here for clear description the angular position of a wake sheet θ w a k e is defined as the radius averaged value on its leading line which coincides with the blade trailing edge i e 12 θ w a k e 1 r r h r h r θ r d r where θ r is the angular position of the point on wake sheet leading line or blade trailing edge and r and r h are radii of the blade and hub respectively the angular position of a blade is defined as the radius averaged value of its trailing edge thus a pair of connected propeller blade and wake sheet have the same angular position the above defined angular position will be used to identity the saved wake sheet and for the following described wake conversions especially for the angular interpolation step in current study larger time step and coarser radial grid would be used in llm than in bem it results in different streamwise and radial grid distributions on the wake sheet besides the angular positions of blades in llm and bem will not coincide due to the different time step sizes thus the llm wake sheets cannot be directly used in bem necessary conversions must be carried out the conversions consist of streamwise refinement angular interpolation and radial refinement as depicted in fig 4 streamwise refinement and radial refinement are to modify the discretization of the wake sheet according to the setups in bem angular interpolation is to get the wake sheet for one blade with arbitrary angular position for open water cases the wake sheet geometry is independent of angular position thus only streamwise refinement and radial refinement are conducted these three conversion steps are described in detail in following for simplification in the description the term wake point is used for the wake panel corner points which defines the discrete wake sheet geometry by age of the wake point we mean the time it has left the trailing edge this is like the term t t 0 in eq 3 2 3 1 streamwise refinement the aim of the streamwise refinement is to make streamwise panel length in accord with the time step size used in bem one wake panel corresponds to the wake sheet being shed in one time step from the trailing edge the age of the wake points in llm is 13 t i 0 for i 0 i 0 5 δ t l l m for i 1 n s l l m and in bem is 14 t j 0 for j 0 j 0 5 δ t b e m for j 1 n s b e m where δ t l l m and δ t b e m are the time step sizes n s l l m and n s b e m mean the numbers of wake panels in the streamwise direction i and j are the indices of wake points in the streamwise direction and the 0 5 in the formula is due to that the first wake panel corresponds to half time step katz and plotkin 2001 to have almost the same wake sheet length n s b e m is determined as follows 15 n s b e m 0 5 n s l l m 0 5 δ t l l m δ t b e m where is the round down function the streamwise refinement can now be done with interpolation on the streamwise vortices with using t i and t j as independent variables but in this way the detailed ship wake field variation especially in the top narrow low velocity region which cannot be totally captured in llm due to the large time step would also be lost in the refined wake sheet geometry in current work a special procedure is developed to restore the lost information in the refined wake sheet here v i n is used to denote the undisturbed inflow velocity including the ship wake field v i n is not constant but has a distribution in the flow field during the streamwise refinement the displacement due to v i n is firstly deducted from the llm wake points position i e 16 x i 0 x i 0 t i v i n x i t d t x i t i 0 v i n x i t d t where x i denotes the wake points position and x i 0 are the positions without displacement caused by v i n in x i 0 there are only the displacements caused by induced velocity then interpolation is conducted on x i 0 with using t i and t j as independent variables the positions x j 0 are obtained finally the displacements due to v i n are added on x j 0 to get the refined wake points locations i e 17 x j x j 0 0 t j v i n x j t d t the integral in eqs 16 and 17 are evaluated numerically using midpoint method as shown in fig 4 a and b such a process rebuilds the small peak of the wake sheet caused by the ship wake field the effect of the developed streamwise refinement method will be further discussed in section 3 2 2 3 2 angular interpolation after the llm calculation wake sheets at some specific angular positions are available wake sheet geometry at an angular position which is not included in the available ones might be needed for the bem simulation in this situation a process named here as angular interpolation is conducted to produce wake sheet at the targeted angular position the angular position of the targeted wake sheet is denoted as θ t firstly the existing wake sheets are sorted by their angular positions then an interval in the sorted angular positions which embraces θ t is searched out that means when the end angles for this interval are denoted as θ 0 and θ 1 then the relation θ 0 θ t θ 1 holds the streamwise refined wake sheet at θ 0 and θ 1 would be used to generate the new wake sheet at θ t in this section the superscripts 0 t and 1 are used to indicate the variables associated to these three different wake sheets respectively the time when the blade is at the angular positions θ 0 θ t and θ 1 are defined as t 0 t t and t 1 then we have 18 δ t t 0 t t t 0 θ t θ 0 ω 19 δ t 1 t t 1 t t θ 1 θ t ω where ω is the propeller rotation speed we use t j to denote the age of wake points on the new wake sheet as defined in eq 14 the corresponding points which represent the same fluid particle at other time points on the already known wake sheets then have ages t j 0 t j δ t t 0 and t j 1 t j δ t 1 t interpolation function is used to find positions of the corresponding points on existing wake sheets i e x 0 t j 0 and x 1 t j 1 then linear interpolation is applied to obtain the point location on the new wake sheet 20 x j t x t t j δ t 1 t x 0 t j 0 δ t t 0 x 1 t j 1 δ t 1 t δ t t 0 the new wake sheet is generated by conducting such a computation for all j 0 n s b e m three situations would be encountered during the calculation additional steps for different situations are described in the following they are also depicted as different regions in fig 5 1 t j δ t t 0 0 and t j δ t 1 t t n s b e m in this situation the above described method can be directly applied 2 t j δ t t 0 0 in this situation there is no corresponding point on the wake sheet at θ 0 as shown in region 2 of fig 5 so firstly a temporary point is produced which has an angular position of θ t m p θ t ω t j and an age of zero its position x 0 t m p is obtained by linear interpolation of the leading points of the existing wake sheets in cylindrical coordinate here the obtained position is exact as long as the propeller rotation speed is constant then the point location on the new wake sheet is calculated as 21 x t t j δ t 1 t x 0 t m p t j x 1 t j 1 δ t 1 t t j 3 t j δ t 1 t t n s b e m in this situation there is no corresponding point on the wake sheet at θ 1 as shown in region 3 of fig 5 therefore only the corresponding point on wake sheet at θ 0 is used and a constant distance between the new wake sheet and wake sheet at θ 0 is assumed this leads the calculation formula as 22 x t t j x 0 t j 0 δx the distance vector δx is calculated at the position of t j which is the maximum t j that satisfies t j δ t 1 t t n s b e m the formula for the δx is 23 δx x t t j x 0 t j δ t t 0 an example of angular interpolation is shown in fig 4 c where the yellow wake sheet is obtained using the angular interpolation 2 3 3 radial refinement until now the radial grid distribution on the wake sheet is still determined by the discretization in llm this might be different from the radial grid distribution on the blade in bem as shown in fig 4 c such wake sheets cannot be directly used in the bem calculation the radial refinement is to make the radial discretization of wake sheets in accord with the blade discretization the wake points on the same streamwise vortex line are shed from the same point on the trailing edge and this point is named here as the origin of wake point thus every wake point also its position can be identified with a pair of indices the first for age and the second for origin on the wake sheet obtained by angular interpolation the point positions are x j m m 0 n r l l m and on the wake sheet for bem calculation they are x j n n 0 n r b e m where n r l l m and n r b e m are numbers of panels in the radial direction the position x 0 m coincides with the origin position for points indexed by m and the same holds for x 0 n thus the radii of origins can be evaluated as 24 r m f r x 0 m r n f r x 0 n where f r is the function to calculate radius of a position and the axis and center of the propeller are used for the calculation the radial refinement is then conducted as interpolation on radial vortices with using the origin radii r m and r n as independent variables in this way a new wake sheet in accord with the blade discretization is obtained the effect is shown in fig 4 c and d in the wake conversion procedure interpolations are applied several times they are all simple one dimensional interpolations and the choice of the interpolation algorithm is flexible and should not make large differences the exception is the interpolation described by eqs 20 and 21 during the angular interpolation they are expressed explicitly as linear interpolation otherwise more situations now 3 must be added in the angular interpolation and the algorithm will be complicated generally the linear interpolation would be enough for the accuracy everywhere during the wake conversion however in the current work the cubic interpolations are adopted except for the explicitly indicated linear interpolations the reason for such an over accurate choice is that our wake conversion code was written in python and using cubic interpolation did not add any coding or observable computation burden 3 results in this section the numerical results obtained with the developed coupling method are presented and compared with those obtained with bem the typical computation time is also presented to show its advantages this section is divided into two parts first part for open water simulations and the second part for unsteady simulations in ship wake field 3 1 open water the open water performances of the public available propellers pptc and kp505 are analyzed pptc is 5 blade controllable pitch propeller designed in potsdam model basin its geometry and measured open water performances are available in barkmann 2011 kp505 is a 5 blade fixed pitch propeller which is designed for the moeri container ship kcs its geometry and various experimental data can be found in moeri 2008 the main parameters of these two propellers are listed in table 1 in bem simulation 28 radial 24 chordwise panels are used on the blade one face two revolutions of wake length are simulated a virtual time step corresponding to 6 degrees per step is used in the coupling simulation the same discretization is used for the bem part in llm simulation 10 lifting line segments are used in the radial direction and a virtual time step corresponding to 30 degrees per step is used in both simulations the axisymmetric condition is exploited i e only one blade is simulated and the wake sheet and singularity strengths on other blades are assumed to be the same on the calculated blade in bem the simulation is conducted in an unsteady manner an acceleration technique is applied for the steady calculation in each iteration the wake points move for 10 time steps during which the induced velocities are assumed to be constant then it needs 72 0 6 10 12 iterations to pass the information from blade trailing edge to the most downstream wake panels to make sure that the wake sheet is well deformed a minimum iteration number of 12 1 5 18 is set for the simulation where 1 5 works as a margin factor other than this the square roots of the second central moments of thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and efficiency η in the last ten iterations are used for convergence judgment when all of them are less than a specific value in current work 0 004 the convergence is asserted to be achieved actually for all the simulations the convergence was achieved in 18 iterations this indicates a conservative setting of the minimum iteration number in the coupling simulation no similar acceleration technique is used in the llm part a minimum iteration number of 36 is set which is calculated as 72 0 3 0 1 5 and here 1 5 is a margin factor the same convergence criteria as described above in bem are also used in the llm simulation such a setting is aimed to make sure that the wake sheet geometry is converged after the llm simulation one step of bem simulation is conducted to obtain the final results several advance ratios are simulated for every propeller the results are shown in fig 6 and the relative errors compared with the experimental measurement are shown in fig 7 the results obtained by the bem and the coupling method are almost the same the maximum deviation between the coupling method and bem is within 3 and occurs at j 0 4 of kp505 propeller some difference between the calculated results and the measured data can be observed they are deemed reasonable within the frame of bem calculations the large relative errors for high advance ratios are due to the small absolute values of k t and k q the comparison of wake sheet geometries for kp505 at j 0 6 is shown in fig 8 the wake deformation for coupling method is relatively smaller the details of the tip vortex geometry which has large influence on the open water results are given in fig 9 the tip vortex local pitch obtained with lifting line method shows an oscillation while in bem it is smooth the oscillation is transmitted or a little enhanced during interpolation however the real important thing is the accumulation of the local pitch i e the axial location of tip vortex versus azimuthal angle which determines the distance and mutual influence between tip vortex and the blade the local pitch in llm is generally a little larger than in bem especially near beginning position this leads to more downstream position of the tip vortex in the coupling method compared with bem the quantitative differences are 0 007d 0 009d and 0 013d for the first three blade positions i e for the azimuthal angle 72 144 and 216 degrees considering the similar obtained open water performances such differences can be deemed to be small wake geometry differences for smaller radii are more obvious which however to our experience has little influence on the hydrodynamics result the calculation times are listed in table 2 all the simulations are conducted on a computer with 48 intel r xeon r gold 5118 cpus the code is well parallelized the coupling method costs obviously much less time as stated above the minimum iteration number in bem might be too conservative we also admit that there are various techniques to accelerate the convergence for open water simulation e g in wang et al 2016a it is then to some extent unfair for bem for the comparison in table 2 the comparison can be conducted in another more general way the time for coupling method is kept constant 36 s in the bem simulation it is observed that the preparation operations need 18 s and every iteration costs about 6 5 s an estimation for the bem simulation time is 18 6 5 n seconds with n being the iteration number thus as far as the bem simulation needs more than 3 iterations it lost the speed competition to the coupling method it might be argued that the radial discretization in llm and bem are different 10 vs 28 however llm works only as a tool to obtain wake sheet geometry calculation is like something between empirical model and fully bem wake alignment it is a time saving solution to use less radial strips in llm than in bem additional simulations with 28 radial segments in llm are carried out to verify the configuration the results obtained with 10 and 28 radial lifting line segments are listed in table 3 the difference between the results are small most are less than 0 5 except for pptc j 0 6 this verifies the relative coarse radial discretization adopted in llm 10 radial segments have also been reported in other works menéndez arán and kinnas 2014 to be enough for the llm convergence furthermore a real same discretization in llm and bem could not be achieved with consideration of the chordwise resolution 3 2 unsteady case in this section the unsteady performance of the kp505 propeller is calculated with different methods the propeller operates in a typical single screw ship wake field as shown in fig 10 the blade discretization is the same as in the open water simulation the panel distribution for bem on the blade is shown in fig 11 the time step in bem still corresponds to 6 degrees per step and in llm corresponds to 30 degrees per step there is only one wake panel in the streamwise direction at the beginning and the number increases as the simulation goes on the maximum wake length is set to be 2 revolutions which means the wake panels that go outside of two revolutions will be removed from the simulation it is observed that 4 revolutions are necessary and enough to achieve convergence the 5th revolution can provide a converged variation of the desired variables therefore the bem calculation is carried out for 5 revolutions in the coupling method llm part runs also for 5 revolutions and in the 5th revolution the wake sheets are saved with the obtained wake sheets the bem part runs for another 2 revolutions and the final converged results are extracted in the second revolution for clarification purpose the set up regarding the physical time is also depicted in fig 12 two advance ratios are simulated i e j s 0 9 and j s 0 7 where j s is the advance ratio based on the ship velocity considering the flow deceleration in the ship wake field the propeller works around its design point at j s 0 9 j s 0 7 presents a high loading situation the k t and k q variations in the last revolution are given in fig 13 for j s 0 9 the results of bem and coupling method correlate well except for a range on the top even there the maximum difference is within 1 for k t and 2 for k q for j s 0 7 the differences become larger compared with bem the coupling method underestimates both k t and k q and the maximum error is about 3 for k t and 5 for k q this results in an overestimation of the efficiency by 2 as shown in fig 14 the large differences indicate a large sensibility of the unsteady results to the wake sheet geometry open water simulation fig 15 shows the wake sheets in bem and coupling method the shapes look very similar fig 16 shows the tip vortex axial positions in different methods the differences are small except for a range near 0 where the axial inflow velocity is minimum and suffers a strong variation the maximum tip vortex axial position differences in this region are 0 03 d 0 05 d and 0 08 d for the first three encountered wakes after the blade at 0 as indicated by the green segments in fig 16 at other places as indicated by the green circles in the same figure the typical differences are 0 009 d 0 012 d and 0 018 d which are not dramatically larger than the values in the steady simulation besides the wake geometry the distribution of dipole strength on the wake sheet would also influence the result especially important is its streamwise variation which is decided by the solutions in previous time steps and results in vorticity along the radial direction this is not present in the steady simulation and can lead to accumulation of errors fig 17 shows the single blade s k t and k q variation in one revolution the largest differences do not happen at the places where the blade is near to the largest wake geometry differences i e between 0 and 50 this indicates a complex relationship between wake sheet geometry dipole strength distribution and the solution besides the integral forces the pressure distribution and variation are analyzed the comparison of the calculated pressure distributions for different angular positions and radial sections are shown in fig 18 little differences near the leading edge on the suction side can be observed a typical value is 0 02 larger differences are observed near the leading edge which is typically 0 03 also near the trailing edge the difference of the pressure on pressure side and suction side is smaller in the coupling method this contributes to the smaller k t and k q of the coupling method compared with the bem the pressure history of one fixed point on the blade suction side is shown in fig 19 the point is the center of the panel with pink frame shown in fig 11 it locates around one fifth chord position on the 0 8r section the variation forms of the results for the two methods are the same the value differences are small within 4 although visible here it should be pointed out the relative larger pressure at this point in the coupling method does not imply a larger integral force which would contradict the results shown in figs 13 and 17 regarding the integral force only the pressure difference between the pressure and suction side matters regarding the calculation time the bem simulation costed 1513 s i e around 25 min the coupling method costed 537 s 9 min in which around 35 s are for the llm part thus compared with bem the coupling method decreases the calculation time by 65 i e increases the computational speed by 180 during the streamwise refinement the ship hull wake field induced displacement is firstly deduced from the wake point position and added back after interpolation the effect and influence of such an operation need to be studied therefore an comparison simulation has been conducted with the coupling method in which the time step in llm is set to correspond to 6 degrees that means the time steps in llm and bem are the same and no streamwise refinement is carried out comparing the wake sheet geometry and propeller forces obtained in such a simulation and the simulation mentioned above where the time steps in llm and bem correspond to 30 and 6 degrees respectively help identify the effect of the developed streamwise refinement algorithm the obtained llm wake sheet geometries are shown in 20 large time step cannot capture small features in the ship hull wake field and the streamwise refinement restores most of these features the llm wake sheet obtained by refinement of the result with a coarse time step looks very similar to the one obtained directly with the fine time step the obtained k t variation with both setups are given in fig 21 small deviations exist near the pick but no large difference is observed as a conclusion in the frame of the current coupling method using large time step in llm together with the developed streamwise refinement algorithm generates quite similar results compared with using fine time step in llm it should be mentioned here that large time step size does not only mean less steps for the llm calculation but also less wake panels and then less calculation time for every time step 4 conclusion in the current work a hybrid method coupling wake alignment lifting line method llm and boundary element method bem is developed for the hydrodynamic analysis of marine propellers the coupling method retains all abilities of a bem code and is much faster by using llm for the wake alignment open water calculation and unsteady simulations have been carried out similar integral forces pressure distributions and pressure variation histories are obtained with the coupling method when compared with bem code differences within 3 are observed for open water performances at high loading conditions and are much smaller for around normal loading conditions the deviation for high loading unsteady case is within 3 for k t and 5 for k q for moderate loading case the differences are much smaller for the unsteady simulation the computational time is reduced by 65 for the open water calculation the improvement depends on how many iterations the boundary element code needs for the convergence as long as the iteration number exceeds 3 the coupling method is faster than the bem in the current work the time reduction is around 70 as an alternative way to apply the coupling method one can use the lifting line wake sheet geometry as initial guess and conduct further wake alignment iterations in bem code this would leads to more similar results with bem but also more calculation time it would be still faster than the pure bem method due to the length of manuscript the relative study is not reported here the coupling algorithm and lifting line part described in current work is relatively easy to implement especially when a boundary element code is already available in the way that the wake and wake alignment algorithm are reused for the lifting line method such a coupling algorithm can further improve the work efficiency for propeller design and analysis it also helps accelerate the research about boundary element method improvement which needs a lot of calculations as trial and error credit authorship contribution statement youjiang wang data curation formal

21652,this article investigates two effects of seal friction of hydropneumatic passive heave compensator phc during offshore drilling for contact and non contact operations the first is the attenuation rate variation of the transmitted heave movement in function of the amplitude of the platform motion the second is the compensator induced vibration civ which induces longitudinal oscillations of frequencies higher than the heave motion these phenomena are explained by an analysis of phc forces linearization and frequency spectra and a modal analysis of the drill string dynamic with phc mode shapes and boundary conditions an active controller is proposed to mitigate the seal friction of phc in part ii of this two part paper series keywords ultra long drill string compensator induced vibration civ heave compensator longitudinal natural vibration seal friction 1 introduction typical offshore operations include lowering lifting and holding a load at sea these operations may be hampered by the occurrences of ocean waves which raise and lower the vessel heave motion heave compensator is used to mitigate this heave motion transmission from the platform to the load in offshore drilling operation with vessels heave compensator is fundamental to decouple the drill string from the vessel heave motion it prevents damage of the drill bit and string collapse of the borehole wall well kick and cease of the drilling operation which may cause loss of money and time as well as increase the risk of major accidents woodall mason et al 1976 there are four types of heave compensators such as passive heave compensator phc semi active heave compensator sahc active heave compensator ahc and hybrid heave compensator hhc the compensator addressed in this article is a hydropneumatic phc linear phc has been extensively studied as commented bywoodacre et al 2015 its design and behavior has been described for a non contact operation in sanchez et al 2017 however phc develops nonlinear forces hatleskog and dunningan 2006 present the linearization of phc forces with nonlinear seal friction and without weight on bit wob however only the stiffness linearization is detailed seal friction has a severely detrimental impact on the phc performance ottestad et al 2010 2012 hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b even so in the review of heave compensation woodacre et al 2015 reported the lack or absence of work or studies on the effects of nonlinear friction of hydraulic cylinders with respect to phc three phenomena associated with the phc with seal friction have been reported first is the cylinder stick slip in which the seal friction is too large to be easily overcome by the load kidera 1983 the second corresponds to the variation of attenuation ratio crown block movement ship movement as function of the amplitude of the ship displacement which is briefly commented in odp 2012 the third is the civ phenomenon which is manifested as oscillations of higher frequencies than those of the ship disturbance these oscillations are displayed in the crown block and in the wob hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b ascribed these oscillations to the contact instability between the drill bit and the formation wada et al 2018 analyzed the obtained data during ultradeep water drilling programs conducted by the scientific drilling vessel chikyu as a result it is indicated that the high frequencies are a possible influence of the seal friction in phc for ultra long drill pipe this phenomenon has been named compensator induced vibration civ civ excites the first three vibration modes of the system drill string with nonlinear phc and their vibration shape distribution has been analyzed for a particular ocean wave wada et al 2018 for this study the two last phenomena of the nonlinear friction in hydraulic cylinders with respect to phcs namely attenuation variation in function of the ship amplitude and civ are explained furthermore the phc dynamic force and its frequency spectrum is analyzed this force is also linearized and its linearization is detailed including its interval of validity thus both linear phc and drill string models are used in a modal analysis and determination of the shapes and boundary conditions of the typical modes excited by the seal friction this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the nonlinear model of phc and the lumped model of the drill string are presented section 3 describes the main points and conditions for numerical simulation in section 4 the nonlinear phc forces are analyzed and a detail linearization is conducted in section 5 the linear model of phc and drill string is deduced a modal analysis is carried out on this model to study the shape and boundary condition of each vibration mode section 6 shows the seal friction effects attenuation variation as function of the ship amplitude and the civ phenomena are explained section 7 draws conclusion and future works in part ii of this paper series an active subsystem is added and a robust controller is proposed to mitigate heave motion and civ phenomenon 2 phc and drill string in this section an overview of offshore drilling systems with phc and its model are presented the model of the phc and the drill string is divided into three parts firstly forces develop by the phc are shown secondly parameter equations of drill string are presented and explained finally equations of the dynamic model based on the previous phc force and drill string parameters are introduced 2 1 overview of drilling system and heave compensator fig 1 illustrates a schematic of the offshore drilling system with the hhc without the fast and dead line compensation arrangement for clarity the phc and ahc are placed on the derrick the phc supports the crown block an ensemble of sheaves supporting the traveling block through a wire hope this rope is connected to the draw work which have as a main function to provide a means of raising and lowering the traveling block the top drive is suspended from the traveling block its functions are to maintain and to rotate the drill string the drill string transmits the rotary motion and provides a flow path inside the drill string for drilling fluids to circulate from top drive to the drill bit fluids travel back to the sea floor through the space between the drill string and the walls of the hole and circulates from seabed to surface between the drill string and the riser which provides this temporary extension between the subsea well and surface on the subsea well a blowout preventer bop is placed it is a specialized valve to seal the well in the seabed the drill string is composed of drill pipes and a bottom hole assembly bha the latter is composed of a stabilizer a drill bit and drill collars the weight of the drill string traveling block crown block and top drive is supported by phc except for the wob that is the amount of downward force exerted on the drill bit wob variations are caused by the heave motion in simple words a phc is a significant traditional hydropneumatic suspension its main components are a cylinder accumulators and flow restrictions phc operation can be described as follows when the ship heaves up the gas of the cylinder is forced into the accumulator and is compressed to compensate the increased displacement and it stores energy this energy is dissipated by the seal friction of the cylinder and by the viscous friction of the airflow through the pipes when the ship goes down the cylinder housings descend and the gas of the accumulator is expanded flowing from the accumulator to the cylinder for more detailed explanation see hatleskog and dunningan 2006 phc mitigates the wob variation however the problem is that its seal friction may cause the drill bit to be lifted from the formation ottestad et al 2012 in order to avoid it and to improve the attenuation rate an ahc subsystem is added the most common actuator is a double acting hydraulic cylinder that is regulated by a servo valve or a pump swash angle hatleskog and dunnigan 2007a other kind of actuators are found in woodacre et al 2015 2 2 phc model three main forces developed by the phc are air spring f a s fluid friction f f f and seal friction f s f a detailed explanation is given in hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b and barr 2015 a more realistic and therefore complex phc model is deduced by hatletvedt et al 2018 this model accounts for temperature variation dry friction and non ideal gas behavior the air accumulator of phc acts as low rate spring and develops f a s which is given by eq 1 this equation represents the accumulator pressure change around the mean pressure p 0 due to the relative displacement between the ship x h and the crown block x c the parameter a is the cylinder area of phc v 0 is the gas accumulator volume of phc and r is the polytropic coefficient of gas 1 f a s t a p 0 1 a v 0 x c t x h t r the cylinder friction force f s f is modeled in a simplified manner with eq 2 the hyperbolic tangent function approximation is utilized to treat discontinuity issues associated with modeling friction as a constant with sign changes barr 2015 its scaling parameter h determines the rate of friction from one direction to another the kinetic friction coefficient of cylinder seal μ s f is considered constant under variations of pressure and velocity 2 f s f t μ s f t a n h h x c t x h t the air travels from the phc cylinder to the accumulator through pipes in a highly turbulent flow hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b such flow induces a fluid friction force also called viscous friction or hydrodynamic friction force this force has a viscous friction coefficient μ f f 3 f f f t μ f f s i g n x c t x h t x c t x h t 2 the sum of these forces is the dynamic force of the phc which is nonlinear 4 f d p h c t f a s t f f f t f s f t the phc dynamic force f d p h c does not include the static force of air spring that supports the weight of the drill string 5 f p h c t f d p h c t a p 0 2 3 drill string parameters a variety of models has been developed to investigate the axial vibration of the drill string without heave compensator ghasemloonia et al 2015 the most common model of drill string with phc is a lumped mass model and the drill string is decomposed into two sections upper and lower ottestad et al 2012 2010 haao and vangen 2012 hatleskog and dunnigan 2012 2007b gonzalez et al 2019 similarly barr 2015 and wada et al 2018 used more discretized lumped models the drill string configuration is represented as a lumped mass model the crown block and traveling block are the first elements see fig 2 the stiffness of each element k i of the drill string is expressed in eq 6 as function of its diameter d i its thickness t i and its length l i the damping coefficient of drill string b i is estimated with eq 7 in terms of the damping ratio ζ the element mass m i and the mass of drilling fluid inside of drill pipe m a i which is calculated with eq 8 and acts in consort with the drill string they move together but it does not influence the traction of the drill string due to the buoyant force hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b the weight of the drill string is modified because it is submerged in drilling fluid this weight is also called the wet weight and it is calculated multiplying the weight by the buoyancy factor b u o which is indicated by eq 9 it is related to the difference of drilling fluid and drill pipe densities ρ 3 and ρ 2 respectively the well bottom force f w e l l is applied on the lowest drill string element when there is a contact between drill bit and the formation but this force does not exist when the drill bit is lifted clear of the bottom hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b this phenomenon is neglected and it is considered a simple bottom stiffness as is described by eq 10 x w e l l is the bottom of the well position and k w e l l is the formation

hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b except eq 7 which was found in wada et al 2018 2 4 model of drill string with phc the set of eqs 11 14 summarizes the model and fig 2 shows its schematic which is composed of crown block traveling block and drill string the forces acting on the crown block eq 11 are its own weight m c g phc force f p h c ahc force f a h c and wire rope force which is derived from the hooke s law and has a stiffness k w and a viscous damping coefficient b w the forces applied on the traveling block are the wire rope force the force of the upper drill string and its own weight eq 12 one degree of freedom lumped mass model is developed for the drill string and eq 13 is written for each element this equation considers the buoyancy factor b u o added mass of internal drilling fluid m a i stiffness k i and damping b i of the drill string the expressions of these parameters have already been defined in the previous subsection the lower drill string mass m i m has a different dynamic eq 14 because its weight is partially supported by the well bottom f w e l l 11 x c t f p h c t k w x t t x c t b w x t t x c t m c g f a h c t m c 12 x t t b w x c t x t t b i x i t x t t k w

configuration is detailed finally time simulation parameters are presented 3 1 sinusoidal heave disturbance for heave disturbance three sinusoidal signals are used where two signals are the limits and the third is the operation signal all three signals have the same period of 7 s frequency ω and the amplitudes are x h m i n 0 5 m x h o p e 1 m and x h m a x 1 5 m these amplitudes represent sea state number 1 2 and 3 respectively 3 2 drill string configuration the drill string configurations of 4 km and 8 km are presented in table 1 which is taken from wada et al 2018 and the length of each drill string section is approximated by a multiple of 100 m to simplify the model specifications there are three components for 4 km and five components for 8 km the parameters for each component are length outer diameter and thickness the components of 8 km and 4 km are rescaled by factors of 1 5 and 0 5 respectively to obtain the components of 12 km and 2 km as wada et al 2018 simulate the case of 12 km the bottom hole assembly bha comprises drill collar stabilizer and drill bit its length 0 3 km remains constant the others parameters of the drill string are calculated with eqs 6 9 3 3 time simulation the configuration of drill string described in previous section 3 2 is used the linear model is simulated with eqs 23 27 and the nonlinear with the set of eqs 11 14 the equations are solved using a fourth order runge kutta for the temporal simulations and their simulation parameters are a sample time of 0 01 s and a drill element length of 100 m for 2 km sample time of 0 001 s and the same drill element length value for 12 km table 2 contains the parameters values of drill string and phc 4 phc this section shows the dynamic force of phc with seal friction its shape and its frequency spectra are obtained for different sprung masses and ship heave disturbances with different amplitudes furthermore the linearization of the phc forces is shown and its interval of validation is established the results shown in this section have the follow approximation x c x c 0 b e c a u s e x h x c this is supported by phc and ahc attenuations of the transmitted heave amplitude larger than 85 and 95 respectively odp 2012 this approximation is more valid in the case of ahc because the attenuation is larger than with the phc then the phc dynamic force depends mainly on the ship heave movement 4 1 analysis of phc dynamic force the main disturbance force on the crown block is provided by the heave ship motion through the phc which operates as a transducer converting this heave motion into a force a good knowledge of this force is very important to properly understand the offshore drilling dynamic with phc and to design ahc controllers more efficiently phc component forces and dynamic force are shown in fig 3 for the three ship amplitudes of section 3 1 and for two drill string lengths 2 km and 12 km with the configurations of section 3 2 the air friction and the seal friction forces do not depend on the drill string mass as is shown in fig 3 only the air spring force depends on the sprung mass because it is associated with the drill string length which is evident in eqs 1 3 and in fig 3 the air friction force has the smallest response in the six cases and increases with the ship amplitude its maximum value is at 4 kn and occurs the maximum heave amplitude but its largest influence on the dynamic force is only 10 when the minimum drill string length is supported in fig 3 e the air spring force is proportional to the heave amplitude and the sprung mass so the most important case occurs at the maximum length of the drill string and at the maximum heave amplitude fig 3 f the seal friction force is a square wave of constant amplitude because its magnitude does not depend on the heave of the ship nor sprung mass as it was assumed here the dynamic force shape is mainly determined by the seal friction force and the air spring force in the case of the shortest length of drill string and the smallest heave amplitude the seal friction is the most important force has the biggest magnitude and determines the dynamic force shape which is almost a square wave fig 3 a the influence of seal friction on the dynamic force decreases as either the drill string length or heave ship amplitude increases because the air spring force also raises and becomes important even so an abrupt change is always presented in the maximum point of dynamic force which is produced by the seal friction force the value of this friction is always added to the maximum value of the dynamic force this means that the maximum of dynamic force is f s f greater with seal friction than without it the dynamic force has a similar shape to the load variation in the wire rope shown by hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b showing that the variation wob is highly affected by the phc force the fourier transformation spectra of phc forces are shown in fig 4 for the drill string length of 2 km and 12 km with the operation ship amplitude x h o p e the maximum value of dynamic force occurs in the same frequency of the ship heave disturbance 0 9 rad s this is the result of the sum of the seal friction and the air spring forces since the fluid friction force has insignificant magnitude the spectra of the phc dynamic force of fig 4 has peaks of frequencies 0 9 2 7 4 5 6 3 rad s and they are higher than the input frequency of the ship movement 0 9 rad s these higher frequencies are caused by the seal friction and present peaks in frequencies n ω with n odd 1 3 5 7 its amplitude is inversely proportional to n this is explained in the next subsection with the fourier transformation of a square wave eq 19 fig 4 shows that the gain of the second peak 2 7 rad s is approximately 20 of the first for the drill string of 2 km whereas for 12 km it is only 10 such result matches well with the observation of phc dynamic force which is less linear for small drill string lengths and a similar effect is obtained with smaller ship vertical velocities 4 2 linearization of phc forces phc forces are nonlinear making the analysis and control more complex than in the linear case for this reason a linearization of pneumatic phc with drill bit free wob was presented in hatleskog and dunningan 2006 matches well with the nonlinear phc behavior and is briefly described niedzwecki and thampii 1988 linearized the phc forces drag and air spring based on equal energy dissipation rate or least square minimization principle in this paper the linearization of each phc component is presented in detail as well as a robustness analysis with respect to variations of drill string length and heave amplitude of the ship the air spring force of eq 1 is linearized by application of taylor expansion at the point x c x h 0 this linearization has a physical meaning the variation of gas volume caused by the heave movement is small when compared to the total accumulator volume a similar assumption is considered in moreau et al 2004 and hatleskog and dunningan 2006 obtaining the same linearization 15 p 0 a 1 a v 0 x c t x h t r k p h c x h t x c t where the parameter k p h c is the linear stiffness of the air bank defined as 16 k p h c r a 2 p 0 v 0 the percentage error is described by the next equation without the point x c x h 0 17 e r f a s t 100 r a v 0 x h t x c t 1 a v 0 x c t x h t r 1 1 a v 0 x c t x h t r 1 fig 5 a presents the linear and nonlinear responses for a sinusoidal heave input without the static force these forces are different especially in the upper and lower parts compression and expansion because these points are further away from the linearization point the percentage error is only proportional to the heave ship amplitude see fig 5 b and it does not depend on the value of sprung mass however the absolute error is related to this parameter i e 1 3 kn for the drill string length of 12 km and the maximum amplitude and 0 5 kn for the drill string of 2 km and the maximum amplitude the air friction force has the quadratic expression of eq 3 it is linearized around an intermediate point m a x x c x h o p e 2 using the taylor expansion μ f f s i g n x c t x h t x c t x h t 2 b f f x c t x h t 18 b f f μ f f m a x x c x h o p e this linearization does not ensure robustness to ship amplitude variations because its gain is a function of the maximum heave ship amplitude and this parameter is not constant fig 6 shows the error does not reach significant values the maximum is 0 65 kn as mentioned in the previous subsection this force has small magnitude compared with the other forces developed by the phc the seal friction force of eq 2 has a behavior of a square wave for a sinusoidal input heave movement which can be represented as an infinite sum of sinusoidal waves using a fourier expansion 19 f s f t 4 π n 1 3 5 1 n s i n n ω t the first harmonic has the same frequency of the square wave and has the largest magnitude the other harmonics have frequencies n ω n odd and their amplitudes decrease in function of the parameter n as seen in fig 4 only the first harmonic is considered in the linearization but the other harmonics are essential to understand the civ phenomenon the ocean wave x h has a sinusoidal behavior that may be normalized with m a x x c x h o p e to obtain a maximum amplitude force of 4 μ s f π 20 μ s f t a n h h x c t x h t b s f x c t x h t 21 b s f 4 μ s f π m a x x c x h o p e the linear and nonlinear seal friction forces are shown in fig 7 for three amplitudes of ship the nonlinear force is the same whereas the linear forces are different this is explained by the linear force dependence on the maximum value of the relative velocity x c x h o p e which is variable if this value was updated for each wave in each period the better linear force could be obtained however its feasibility is questionable since the prediction of the input signal becomes mandatory the error between the linear and nonlinear force reaches the value of μ s f when the sign of the nonlinear seal friction changes the error is even larger when the ship amplitude is different from the operating amplitude finally the total friction coefficient of the phc b p h c is the sum of the coefficients b s f and b f f 22 b p h c b s f b f f the frequency variation of heave movement is not analyzed because it has similar consequence to the heave amplitude variation as is shown in eqs 18 and 21 5 analysis of linear system in this section the linear system of the drill string with the phc is determined a modal analysis is done with this linear system 5 1 linear model the dynamic model is described by eqs 11 14 there are no nonlinearities in the drill string and or in the traveling block equations only in the phc behavior which affects the crown block dynamic in eq 11 therefore the linear model uses the phc linear forces obtained in the previous section two linear models are defined in function of the input in the first model of eq 23 the input is the force of eq 24 which is caused by the ship heave motion and its velocity 23 x t a x t b f f x h t m y t c x t 24 f x h t k p h c x h t b p h c x h t where x is the state vector defined in eq 26 the matrix b f indicates that the force f x h is applied on the second estate equation which represents the crown block acceleration as ascribed by eq 27 the output system is the crown block position and it is established by the matrix c of eq 28 the matrix m has the masses and static parameters as the static pressure and the weight supported by the well bottom the matrix a is given by eq 25 in box i and the matrix m is presented in eq 29 to provide an example of a discretized drill string into two elements the matrix notation of a and m is simplified with m d i m i m a i m d i m m i m m a i m 26 x t x c t x c t x t t x t t x i t x i t x i m t x i m t 27 b f 0 1 m c 0 0 0 0 0 0 28 c 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 29 m 0 p

forces are neglected without the matrix m in order to ensure a single input single output siso implementation a new state x c m is defined per eq 31 hatleskog and dunningan 2006 and a new state vector x x h is defined in eq 32 finally the matrix b x h of eq 34 represents the input disturbance only in function of the heave motion 30 x x h t a x x h t b x h x h t y x h t c x x h t 31 x c m t x c t k p h c m c x h t 32 x x h t x c t x c m t x t t x t t x i t x i t x i m t x i m t 33 σ k p h c m c b p h c 2 b w b p h c m c 2 34 b x h b p h c m c σ 0 b w b p h c m t m c 0 0 0 0 5 2 modal decomposition the system eigenvalues of eq 23 are computed with a ship heave amplitude of x h o p e and frequency ω 0 9 rad s these eigenvalues are distinct between each other then the i th eigenvector corresponds to the i th column of the modal matrix t 35 t v 1 v 2 v 2 n the original system is transformed with the modal matrix in 36 x m t a m x m t b m f x h t y m t c m x m t the matrices of this transformation are a m t 1 a t x m t t 1 x t b m t 1 b f and c m c t the modal system is denoted by the subscript m the matrix a m is diagonal and turns explicit its eigenvalues decoupling the original system in n subsystems of second order that have pairs of eigenvalues reals or complexes in order to facilitate the visualization fig 8 is plotted with re normalized eigenvectors considering for each eigenvector its element with the highest absolute value which always occurs in the top of the drill string and in the first vibration mode these values are 132 118 102 mm for the depths 4 8 12 km so the amplitude of the top drill string decreases 23 when the depth increases from 4 km to 12 km and increases approximately 50 for the second and third vibration mode so these two modes are more free in the top for deeper drilling on the other hand the bottom deflection of drill string decreases approximately 70 from 4 km to 12 km it means that the bottom is better recessed with increasing depth the mode shapes change with the drill string length the nodes and the maximum does not occur in the same places the maximum deflections of each mode are different the top deflection of the second and third modes are amplified around z 0 7 for 8 km and 12 km in these lengths are even larger than the deflection of the first mode at the same length this is important because these modes are excited by the civ and the maximum deflection produces the maximum acceleration that may cause drill string fatigue fig 9 presents the 3 d plot of the axial deflection and the real and imaginary eigenvector part the eigenvectors were rotated to have a zero phase at the top in this way it is simpler to compare the vibration modes of drill string length the mode shapes are extremely close to the mode of vibration for free and fixed bottom as the analytical solution of a beam with a free top end and a fixed bottom end this boundary condition of the first vibration mode has already been noted in wada et al 2018 and it was expected since the drill bit is in contact with the ground which has a much greater stiffness than the drill string and its top is connected to the phc which has a stiffness significantly smaller than the drill string fig 10 depicts the same deflections of fig 9 looking downward from the top end of the drill string the imaginary parts of the eigenvectors imply that all points of the drill string vibrate out of phase in each modal contribution it avoids that the displacements at all points reaches their maximums peaks simultaneously oliveto et al 1997 however maximum deflection at the top and bottom occur almost at the same time for first and third modes but in opposite directions for the second mode the phase of higher modes is more affected by the damping as is seen in the third mode whereas the first mode has the smallest phase variation the modal analysis was based on the matrix a that is a function of operation ship amplitude x h o p e and its frequency ω 0 9 rad s see above subsection if these parameters change the matrix a is also modified then the modes results vary too however the response between the interval x h m i n and x h m a x and frequency between 0 35 rad s and 1 rad s showed slight variations therefore the results presented are typical of these intervals 6 seal friction effect on phc performance the seal friction effects on the system are analyzed for long and short drill pipe of 2 km and 12 km with drill bit free and in contact these effects are attenuation variation in function of ship amplitude odp 2012 and the civ phenomena wada et al 2018 6 1 phc attenuation variation in function of ship amplitude 6 1 1 2 km with drill bit free and in contact fig 11 presents the crown block movement x c for four cases with drill bit free and in contact and with the operation and minimum heave waves i e x h o p e and x h m i n the responses with nonlinear linear b s f x h ope and linear b s f x h min phc are depicted in linear cases the stiffness k p h c is linearized around 0 and the viscous friction coefficient of the fluid b f f is obtained with the amplitude of the operation vessel x o p e the difference between the linear cases is the value of the coefficient of the seal friction b s f which is updated with the input amplitude the linear b s f x h o p e and the nonlinear have almost the same response for the operation ship amplitude in fig 11 a and b with drill bit free and in contact even if the linearization of seal friction force does not totally represent its nonlinear behavior as shown in fig 7 with this approach the linear phc may fit the nonlinear phc performance for a sinusoidal wave with drill bit free and in contact an acceptable linearization has been described in hatleskog and dunningan 2006 for phc with drill bit free however there is a warning with drill bit in contact the linearization is valid if the drill bit is maintained in contact with the formation because if the drill bit is lifted from the bottom of the well the dynamic is highly modified as commented by hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b the linear b s f x h o p e has an attenuation of the transmitted ship movement of 77 with drill bit free fig 11 a and c and 84 with drill bit in contact fig 11 b and d these attenuation values are maintained constant when there is a change of the maximum ship heave amplitude which does not match with the nonlinear behavior that has a variable attenuation in function of the ship amplitude similar behavior has already been reported in odp 2012 the attenuation decreases approximately from 85 to 40 or less when the ship amplitude diminishes from 3 7 m to 1 8 m the frequency is not shown also it is briefly commented that this attenuation reduction is produced by the nonlinear seal friction force another example of phc attenuation variation in function of the ship amplitude is presented in niedzwecki and thampii 1988 a large package is attached to the drill string and its drag is nonlinear the attenuation decreases in function of the ship amplitude which is opposite to the effect found here because the phc dominant force is the seal friction instead of the viscous friction of the air through the pipe eq 21 shows that if it is only considered the viscous friction the attenuation variation would also be proportional to the ship amplitude in the analyzed frequency fig 11 reproduces the attenuation reduction of the nonlinear phc system it changes from 79 x h o p e to 70 x h m i n with drill bit free and from 90 x h o p e to 84 x h m i n with drill bit in contact this behavior is obtained by the linear phc b s f x h m i n its linear seal friction coefficient is updated with the new maximum ship amplitude x h m i n a similar effect is obtained with frequency variation see eq 21 the linear phc force permits to obtain the frequency response with drill bit free and in contact for each ship amplitude see fig 12 these figures were plotted considering that the linear friction coefficient of phc is a function of the ship amplitude b p h c x h of eq 22 it means that each amplitude has its own coefficient b p h c therefore the attenuation in the studied frequency is also modified and it is inversely proportional to the ship amplitude see the vertical blue line of fig 12 with ω 0 9 rad s the data of attenuation and damping coefficient is condensed in table 3 a similar frequency response was obtained for a phc with drill bit in contact by gonzalez et al 2019 only considering upper and lower sections of drill string 6 1 2 12 km with drill bit in contact it is important to note that the case of 12 km studied in wada et al 2018 has an input ocean wave with an amplitude of approximately 0 1 m and the phc has an extra sheave link this extra sheave links is not considered in this article for drill string with 12 km length the first mode occurs in the spectra of ocean wave but the phc never amplifies the input signal with this amplitude see fig 13 however when the amplitude of the input signal is 1 m the frequency of the first vibration mode falls into the range of significant energy of the ocean wave and produces a resonance frequency the explanation is that the linear seal friction coefficient of phc b s f decreases 10 times with this amplitude see eq 21 this amplification provided by the linear system is corroborated by the nonlinear model in fig 14 b the amplification gain is larger than the linear model because the one obtained with the linearization was calculated exclusively with the speed of the input disturbance neglecting the crown block velocity which is greater than the velocity of the heave disturbance even so the linear model is able to predict the amplification in this frequency a possible solution to avoid this amplification consists in using a semi active system as a servo valve which can provide extra damping this solution was studied in a phc with drill bit free and without seal friction cuellar and fortaleza 2014 sanchez et al 2017 cuellar and fortaleza 2015 as result the phc attenuation was improved despite an insignificant energy consumption 6 2 compensator induced vibration civ 6 2 1 12 km with drill bit in contact the frequency of 0 66 rad s does not excite the high frequency modes for 12 km however the high modes of the system may be excited e g the input frequency of 1 rad s with amplitude 0 1 m and 1 m excites the system high frequencies as is presented in figs 15 and 16 the crown block movement is presented in fig 15 and is dominated by the high frequencies when the ship amplitude is 0 1 m whereas when the ship amplitude is 1 m the high frequencies seem to be noisy at first glance however these high frequencies are well defined in the wob see fig 16 the wob for 0 1 m always ensures that the drill bit is in contact with the formation but the wob for 1 m loses contact for some instants wob larger than 0 ottestad et al 2010 also shows that the drill bit is lifted of the formation by the seal friction effect if the nonlinear seal friction is neglected high frequency oscillations disappear from the wob response as stated in wada et al 2018 it is relevant to question which input frequencies cause the civ phenomenon which the high frequencies are excited by the civ and how this phenomenon occurs the key to answer these questions is to consider the phc as a transducer of heave motion into force this force presents high frequencies as shown in fig 17 these are characteristic of the seal friction see fig 4 its second harmonic has frequency 3 ω that is exactly 3 rad s this second harmonic frequency matches the third vibration mode of the system presented in fig 13 then this mode is excited and the wob presents a resonance in this frequency as is shown fig 17 wada et al 2018 uses a frequency of 0 63 rad s to excite the vibration mode of frequency 1 89 rad s for a drill string of 8 km exactly three times the value of the input frequency the fourth vibration mode of the system has a frequency of 4 2 rad s and is triggered by the third harmonic of the seal friction 5 ω with ω 0 8 rad s fig 18 the other high frequency modes could be triggered in a similar way a harmonic of the seal friction n ω n odd must match a system vibration mode all the modes of the system may be energized by the seal friction force however the energy of the seal friction harmonic is inversely proportional to the number of the harmonic as described by eq 19 decreasing the energy transmitted to the high modes e g the third vibration mode of fig 17 has the largest magnitude for the third mode even larger than the first mode with a magnitude of 16 kn for ship amplitude of 0 1 m and 40 kn for 1 m these magnitudes decrease when the fourth vibration mode of fig 17 is excited by the second harmonic of the seal friction 10 kn with 0 1 m and 14 kn with 1 m another important point observed with the fourier transformation is that the civ is more important as the ship amplitude is smaller in the case of 0 1 m ship amplitude of fig 17 the third vibration mode of the system is almost twice the value of the first the case of 1 m ship amplitude is different the third and first vibration mode have almost the same value the fourth vibration mode is more relevant for ship amplitude of 0 1 m than for ship amplitude of 1 m when compared to the first vibration mode in fig 18 then even if the frequency of the seal friction harmonic matches a high frequency vibration mode of the system the energy transmitted is lower 6 2 2 2 km with drill bit in contact the civ is not just a phenomenon that occurs in ultra long drill pipe as reported by hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b where civ is observed with a drill pipe of 2 7 km fig 19 shows the civ phenomena with the drill string of 2 km the first vibration mode of system has a frequency of 2 rad s see fig 12 and is excited by an input ocean wave of one third of its frequency as is shown in fig 19 a this case is explained in the same way that the civ of long drill string the second harmonic of the seal friction force energizes the first vibration mode of system see fig 19 b 6 2 3 12 km with drill bit free civ has only been reported when there is drill bit in contact in hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b and wada et al 2018 however fig 20 shows that the civ phenomena may occur even with the drill bit free fig 20 a shows the frequency response of the linear system its third vibration mode is 2 09 rad s fig 20 b presents the linear and the nonlinear responses of the crown block for a sinusoidal wave of frequency 0 69 rad s and amplitude x h o p e the civ with drill bit free is explained with the same reasoning used to explain the civ with drill bit in contact then the second harmonic of the seal friction excites the third vibration mode of the system fig 20 c shows the fourier transformation of the crown block position signal which has a peak in the frequency of 2 09 rad s that is exactly three times the input frequency 7 conclusions two effects produced by the seal friction of phc in drilling offshore dynamic were presented and explained the variation in function of the ship amplitude and frequency and the civ phenomenon the air friction force is the most irrelevant in the dynamic phc force the dynamic forces of phc are determined by the air stiffness and the seal friction forces due to its nonlinear behavior the seal friction has the largest influence on the phc dynamic force with the minimum ship amplitude and the minimum sprung mass also the seal friction causes an abrupt change in the phc dynamic force which is always presented in its maximum value and is f s f larger than the maximum value of the linear case the nonlinear behavior of the seal friction force generates higher frequencies than the natural frequency of the heave motion ω the peaks appear in the frequencies n ω with n odd and its magnitude is inversely proportional to n which is explained by the fourier transformation of square signal therefore these frequencies are also presented in the phc dynamic force the linearization of the phc was presented in detail and its approximation error is analyzed with respect to amplitude variation of the platform heave motion and different sprung masses the equivalent linear seal friction is inversely proportional to the ship heave velocity causing the variation of phc attenuation as function of the ship amplitude and frequency in the case of long drill pipe this behavior may produce a resonance frequency inside the interval of ocean frequencies the linear system is not able to reproduce the civ phenomena because it only considered the first harmonic of the seal friction force civ occurs when a harmonic of the seal friction different from the first matches a system vibration mode furthermore it is also presented that the civ happens in the long and short drill pipe with drill bit free or in contact the typical shape of the first three drill string vibration modes were obtained with the linear system the mode shapes are extremely close to the vibration mode with free top and fixed bottom this approximation holds and it is even better with the increasing of the drill string length because of the reduction of its stiffness in comparison to the bottom

21652,this article investigates two effects of seal friction of hydropneumatic passive heave compensator phc during offshore drilling for contact and non contact operations the first is the attenuation rate variation of the transmitted heave movement in function of the amplitude of the platform motion the second is the compensator induced vibration civ which induces longitudinal oscillations of frequencies higher than the heave motion these phenomena are explained by an analysis of phc forces linearization and frequency spectra and a modal analysis of the drill string dynamic with phc mode shapes and boundary conditions an active controller is proposed to mitigate the seal friction of phc in part ii of this two part paper series keywords ultra long drill string compensator induced vibration civ heave compensator longitudinal natural vibration seal friction 1 introduction typical offshore operations include lowering lifting and holding a load at sea these operations may be hampered by the occurrences of ocean waves which raise and lower the vessel heave motion heave compensator is used to mitigate this heave motion transmission from the platform to the load in offshore drilling operation with vessels heave compensator is fundamental to decouple the drill string from the vessel heave motion it prevents damage of the drill bit and string collapse of the borehole wall well kick and cease of the drilling operation which may cause loss of money and time as well as increase the risk of major accidents woodall mason et al 1976 there are four types of heave compensators such as passive heave compensator phc semi active heave compensator sahc active heave compensator ahc and hybrid heave compensator hhc the compensator addressed in this article is a hydropneumatic phc linear phc has been extensively studied as commented bywoodacre et al 2015 its design and behavior has been described for a non contact operation in sanchez et al 2017 however phc develops nonlinear forces hatleskog and dunningan 2006 present the linearization of phc forces with nonlinear seal friction and without weight on bit wob however only the stiffness linearization is detailed seal friction has a severely detrimental impact on the phc performance ottestad et al 2010 2012 hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b even so in the review of heave compensation woodacre et al 2015 reported the lack or absence of work or studies on the effects of nonlinear friction of hydraulic cylinders with respect to phc three phenomena associated with the phc with seal friction have been reported first is the cylinder stick slip in which the seal friction is too large to be easily overcome by the load kidera 1983 the second corresponds to the variation of attenuation ratio crown block movement ship movement as function of the amplitude of the ship displacement which is briefly commented in odp 2012 the third is the civ phenomenon which is manifested as oscillations of higher frequencies than those of the ship disturbance these oscillations are displayed in the crown block and in the wob hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b ascribed these oscillations to the contact instability between the drill bit and the formation wada et al 2018 analyzed the obtained data during ultradeep water drilling programs conducted by the scientific drilling vessel chikyu as a result it is indicated that the high frequencies are a possible influence of the seal friction in phc for ultra long drill pipe this phenomenon has been named compensator induced vibration civ civ excites the first three vibration modes of the system drill string with nonlinear phc and their vibration shape distribution has been analyzed for a particular ocean wave wada et al 2018 for this study the two last phenomena of the nonlinear friction in hydraulic cylinders with respect to phcs namely attenuation variation in function of the ship amplitude and civ are explained furthermore the phc dynamic force and its frequency spectrum is analyzed this force is also linearized and its linearization is detailed including its interval of validity thus both linear phc and drill string models are used in a modal analysis and determination of the shapes and boundary conditions of the typical modes excited by the seal friction this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the nonlinear model of phc and the lumped model of the drill string are presented section 3 describes the main points and conditions for numerical simulation in section 4 the nonlinear phc forces are analyzed and a detail linearization is conducted in section 5 the linear model of phc and drill string is deduced a modal analysis is carried out on this model to study the shape and boundary condition of each vibration mode section 6 shows the seal friction effects attenuation variation as function of the ship amplitude and the civ phenomena are explained section 7 draws conclusion and future works in part ii of this paper series an active subsystem is added and a robust controller is proposed to mitigate heave motion and civ phenomenon 2 phc and drill string in this section an overview of offshore drilling systems with phc and its model are presented the model of the phc and the drill string is divided into three parts firstly forces develop by the phc are shown secondly parameter equations of drill string are presented and explained finally equations of the dynamic model based on the previous phc force and drill string parameters are introduced 2 1 overview of drilling system and heave compensator fig 1 illustrates a schematic of the offshore drilling system with the hhc without the fast and dead line compensation arrangement for clarity the phc and ahc are placed on the derrick the phc supports the crown block an ensemble of sheaves supporting the traveling block through a wire hope this rope is connected to the draw work which have as a main function to provide a means of raising and lowering the traveling block the top drive is suspended from the traveling block its functions are to maintain and to rotate the drill string the drill string transmits the rotary motion and provides a flow path inside the drill string for drilling fluids to circulate from top drive to the drill bit fluids travel back to the sea floor through the space between the drill string and the walls of the hole and circulates from seabed to surface between the drill string and the riser which provides this temporary extension between the subsea well and surface on the subsea well a blowout preventer bop is placed it is a specialized valve to seal the well in the seabed the drill string is composed of drill pipes and a bottom hole assembly bha the latter is composed of a stabilizer a drill bit and drill collars the weight of the drill string traveling block crown block and top drive is supported by phc except for the wob that is the amount of downward force exerted on the drill bit wob variations are caused by the heave motion in simple words a phc is a significant traditional hydropneumatic suspension its main components are a cylinder accumulators and flow restrictions phc operation can be described as follows when the ship heaves up the gas of the cylinder is forced into the accumulator and is compressed to compensate the increased displacement and it stores energy this energy is dissipated by the seal friction of the cylinder and by the viscous friction of the airflow through the pipes when the ship goes down the cylinder housings descend and the gas of the accumulator is expanded flowing from the accumulator to the cylinder for more detailed explanation see hatleskog and dunningan 2006 phc mitigates the wob variation however the problem is that its seal friction may cause the drill bit to be lifted from the formation ottestad et al 2012 in order to avoid it and to improve the attenuation rate an ahc subsystem is added the most common actuator is a double acting hydraulic cylinder that is regulated by a servo valve or a pump swash angle hatleskog and dunnigan 2007a other kind of actuators are found in woodacre et al 2015 2 2 phc model three main forces developed by the phc are air spring f a s fluid friction f f f and seal friction f s f a detailed explanation is given in hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b and barr 2015 a more realistic and therefore complex phc model is deduced by hatletvedt et al 2018 this model accounts for temperature variation dry friction and non ideal gas behavior the air accumulator of phc acts as low rate spring and develops f a s which is given by eq 1 this equation represents the accumulator pressure change around the mean pressure p 0 due to the relative displacement between the ship x h and the crown block x c the parameter a is the cylinder area of phc v 0 is the gas accumulator volume of phc and r is the polytropic coefficient of gas 1 f a s t a p 0 1 a v 0 x c t x h t r the cylinder friction force f s f is modeled in a simplified manner with eq 2 the hyperbolic tangent function approximation is utilized to treat discontinuity issues associated with modeling friction as a constant with sign changes barr 2015 its scaling parameter h determines the rate of friction from one direction to another the kinetic friction coefficient of cylinder seal μ s f is considered constant under variations of pressure and velocity 2 f s f t μ s f t a n h h x c t x h t the air travels from the phc cylinder to the accumulator through pipes in a highly turbulent flow hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b such flow induces a fluid friction force also called viscous friction or hydrodynamic friction force this force has a viscous friction coefficient μ f f 3 f f f t μ f f s i g n x c t x h t x c t x h t 2 the sum of these forces is the dynamic force of the phc which is nonlinear 4 f d p h c t f a s t f f f t f s f t the phc dynamic force f d p h c does not include the static force of air spring that supports the weight of the drill string 5 f p h c t f d p h c t a p 0 2 3 drill string parameters a variety of models has been developed to investigate the axial vibration of the drill string without heave compensator ghasemloonia et al 2015 the most common model of drill string with phc is a lumped mass model and the drill string is decomposed into two sections upper and lower ottestad et al 2012 2010 haao and vangen 2012 hatleskog and dunnigan 2012 2007b gonzalez et al 2019 similarly barr 2015 and wada et al 2018 used more discretized lumped models the drill string configuration is represented as a lumped mass model the crown block and traveling block are the first elements see fig 2 the stiffness of each element k i of the drill string is expressed in eq 6 as function of its diameter d i its thickness t i and its length l i the damping coefficient of drill string b i is estimated with eq 7 in terms of the damping ratio ζ the element mass m i and the mass of drilling fluid inside of drill pipe m a i which is calculated with eq 8 and acts in consort with the drill string they move together but it does not influence the traction of the drill string due to the buoyant force hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b the weight of the drill string is modified because it is submerged in drilling fluid this weight is also called the wet weight and it is calculated multiplying the weight by the buoyancy factor b u o which is indicated by eq 9 it is related to the difference of drilling fluid and drill pipe densities ρ 3 and ρ 2 respectively the well bottom force f w e l l is applied on the lowest drill string element when there is a contact between drill bit and the formation but this force does not exist when the drill bit is lifted clear of the bottom hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b this phenomenon is neglected and it is considered a simple bottom stiffness as is described by eq 10 x w e l l is the bottom of the well position and k w e l l is the formation stiffness 6 k i 2 e π d i 2 d i 2 t i 2 4 l i 7 b i 2 ζ i k i m i m a i 8 m a i ρ 3 l i π d i 2 t i 2 9 b u o ρ 2 ρ 3 ρ 2 10 f w e l l t k w e l l x w e l l x i m t the above expressions were used in hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b except eq 7 which was found in wada et al 2018 2 4 model of drill string with phc the set of eqs 11 14 summarizes the model and fig 2 shows its schematic which is composed of crown block traveling block and drill string the forces acting on the crown block eq 11 are its own weight m c g phc force f p h c ahc force f a h c and wire rope force which is derived from the hooke s law and has a stiffness k w and a viscous damping coefficient b w the forces applied on the traveling block are the wire rope force the force of the upper drill string and its own weight eq 12 one degree of freedom lumped mass model is developed for the drill string and eq 13 is written for each element this equation considers the buoyancy factor b u o added mass of internal drilling fluid m a i stiffness k i and damping b i of the drill string the expressions of these parameters have already been defined in the previous subsection the lower drill string mass m i m has a different dynamic eq 14 because its weight is partially supported by the well bottom f w e l l 11 x c t f p h c t k w x t t x c t b w x t t x c t m c g f a h c t m c 12 x t t b w x c t x t t b i x i t x t t k w

configuration is detailed finally time simulation parameters are presented 3 1 sinusoidal heave disturbance for heave disturbance three sinusoidal signals are used where two signals are the limits and the third is the operation signal all three signals have the same period of 7 s frequency ω and the amplitudes are x h m i n 0 5 m x h o p e 1 m and x h m a x 1 5 m these amplitudes represent sea state number 1 2 and 3 respectively 3 2 drill string configuration the drill string configurations of 4 km and 8 km are presented in table 1 which is taken from wada et al 2018 and the length of each drill string section is approximated by a multiple of 100 m to simplify the model specifications there are three components for 4 km and five components for 8 km the parameters for each component are length outer diameter and thickness the components of 8 km and 4 km are rescaled by factors of 1 5 and 0 5 respectively to obtain the components of 12 km and 2 km as wada et al 2018 simulate the case of 12 km the bottom hole assembly bha comprises drill collar stabilizer and drill bit its length 0 3 km remains constant the others parameters of the drill string are calculated with eqs 6 9 3 3 time simulation the configuration of drill string described in previous section 3 2 is used the linear model is simulated with eqs 23 27 and the nonlinear with the set of eqs 11 14 the equations are solved using a fourth order runge kutta for the temporal simulations and their simulation parameters are a sample time of 0 01 s and a drill element length of 100 m for 2 km sample time of 0 001 s and the same drill element length value for 12 km table 2 contains the parameters values of drill string and phc 4 phc this section shows the dynamic force of phc with seal friction its shape and its frequency spectra are obtained for different sprung masses and ship heave disturbances with different amplitudes furthermore the linearization of the phc forces is shown and its interval of validation is established the results shown in this section have the follow approximation x c x c 0 b e c a u s e x h x c this is supported by phc and ahc attenuations of the transmitted heave amplitude larger than 85 and 95 respectively odp 2012 this approximation is more valid in the case of ahc because the attenuation is larger than with the phc then the phc dynamic force depends mainly on the ship heave movement 4 1 analysis of phc dynamic force the main disturbance force on the crown block is provided by the heave ship motion through the phc which operates as a transducer converting this heave motion into a force a good knowledge of this force is very important to properly understand the offshore drilling dynamic with phc and to design ahc controllers more efficiently phc component forces and dynamic force are shown in fig 3 for the three ship amplitudes of section 3 1 and for two drill string lengths 2 km and 12 km with the configurations of section 3 2 the air friction and the seal friction forces do not depend on the drill string mass as is shown in fig 3 only the air spring force depends on the sprung mass because it is associated with the drill string length which is evident in eqs 1 3 and in fig 3 the air friction force has the smallest response in the six cases and increases with the ship amplitude its maximum value is at 4 kn and occurs the maximum heave amplitude but its largest influence on the dynamic force is only 10 when the minimum drill string length is supported in fig 3 e the air spring force is proportional to the heave amplitude and the sprung mass so the most important case occurs at the maximum length of the drill string and at the maximum heave amplitude fig 3 f the seal friction force is a square wave of constant amplitude because its magnitude does not depend on the heave of the ship nor sprung mass as it was assumed here the dynamic force shape is mainly determined by the seal friction force and the air spring force in the case of the shortest length of drill string and the smallest heave amplitude the seal friction is the most important force has the biggest magnitude and determines the dynamic force shape which is almost a square wave fig 3 a the influence of seal friction on the dynamic force decreases as either the drill string length or heave ship amplitude increases because the air spring force also raises and becomes important even so an abrupt change is always presented in the maximum point of dynamic force which is produced by the seal friction force the value of this friction is always added to the maximum value of the dynamic force this means that the maximum of dynamic force is f s f greater with seal friction than without it the dynamic force has a similar shape to the load variation in the wire rope shown by hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b showing that the variation wob is highly affected by the phc force the fourier transformation spectra of phc forces are shown in fig 4 for the drill string length of 2 km and 12 km with the operation ship amplitude x h o p e the maximum value of dynamic force occurs in the same frequency of the ship heave disturbance 0 9 rad s this is the result of the sum of the seal friction and the air spring forces since the fluid friction force has insignificant magnitude the spectra of the phc dynamic force of fig 4 has peaks of frequencies 0 9 2 7 4 5 6 3 rad s and they are higher than the input frequency of the ship movement 0 9 rad s these higher frequencies are caused by the seal friction and present peaks in frequencies n ω with n odd 1 3 5 7 its amplitude is inversely proportional to n this is explained in the next subsection with the fourier transformation of a square wave eq 19 fig 4 shows that the gain of the second peak 2 7 rad s is approximately 20 of the first for the drill string of 2 km whereas for 12 km it is only 10 such result matches well with the observation of phc dynamic force which is less linear for small drill string lengths and a similar effect is obtained with smaller ship vertical velocities 4 2 linearization of phc forces phc forces are nonlinear making the analysis and control more complex than in the linear case for this reason a linearization of pneumatic phc with drill bit free wob was presented in hatleskog and dunningan 2006 matches well with the nonlinear phc behavior and is briefly described niedzwecki and thampii 1988 linearized the phc forces drag and air spring based on equal energy dissipation rate or least square minimization principle in this paper the linearization of each phc component is presented in detail as well as a robustness analysis with respect to variations of drill string length and heave amplitude of the ship the air spring force of eq 1 is linearized by application of taylor expansion at the point x c x h 0 this linearization has a physical meaning the variation of gas volume caused by the heave movement is small when compared to the total accumulator volume a similar assumption is considered in moreau et al 2004 and hatleskog and dunningan 2006 obtaining the same linearization 15 p 0 a 1 a v 0 x c t x h t r k p h c x h t x c t where the parameter k p h c is the linear stiffness of the air bank defined as 16 k p h c r a 2 p 0 v 0 the percentage error is described by the next equation without the point x c x h 0 17 e r f a s t 100 r a v 0 x h t x c t 1 a v 0 x c t x h t r 1 1 a v 0 x c t x h t r 1 fig 5 a presents the linear and nonlinear responses for a sinusoidal heave input without the static force these forces are different especially in the upper and lower parts compression and expansion because these points are further away from the linearization point the percentage error is only proportional to the heave ship amplitude see fig 5 b and it does not depend on the value of sprung mass however the absolute error is related to this parameter i e 1 3 kn for the drill string length of 12 km and the maximum amplitude and 0 5 kn for the drill string of 2 km and the maximum amplitude the air friction force has the quadratic expression of eq 3 it is linearized around an intermediate point m a x x c x h o p e 2 using the taylor expansion μ f f s i g n x c t x h t x c t x h t 2 b f f x c t x h t 18 b f f μ f f m a x x c x h o p e this linearization does not ensure robustness to ship amplitude variations because its gain is a function of the maximum heave ship amplitude and this parameter is not constant fig 6 shows the error does not reach significant values the maximum is 0 65 kn as mentioned in the previous subsection this force has small magnitude compared with the other forces developed by the phc the seal friction force of eq 2 has a behavior of a square wave for a sinusoidal input heave movement which can be represented as an infinite sum of sinusoidal waves using a fourier expansion 19 f s f t 4 π n 1 3 5 1 n s i n n ω t the first harmonic has the same frequency of the square wave and has the largest magnitude the other harmonics have frequencies n ω n odd and their amplitudes decrease in function of the parameter n as seen in fig 4 only the first harmonic is considered in the linearization but the other harmonics are essential to understand the civ phenomenon the ocean wave x h has a sinusoidal behavior that may be normalized with m a x x c x h o p e to obtain a maximum amplitude force of 4 μ s f π 20 μ s f t a n h h x c t x h t b s f x c t x h t 21 b s f 4 μ s f π m a x x c x h o p e the linear and nonlinear seal friction forces are shown in fig 7 for three amplitudes of ship the nonlinear force is the same whereas the linear forces are different this is explained by the linear force dependence on the maximum value of the relative velocity x c x h o p e which is variable if this value was updated for each wave in each period the better linear force could be obtained however its feasibility is questionable since the prediction of the input signal becomes mandatory the error between the linear and nonlinear force reaches the value of μ s f when the sign of the nonlinear seal friction changes the error is even larger when the ship amplitude is different from the operating amplitude finally the total friction coefficient of the phc b p h c is the sum of the coefficients b s f and b f f 22 b p h c b s f b f f the frequency variation of heave movement is not analyzed because it has similar consequence to the heave amplitude variation as is shown in eqs 18 and 21 5 analysis of linear system in this section the linear system of the drill string with the phc is determined a modal analysis is done with this linear system 5 1 linear model the dynamic model is described by eqs 11 14 there are no nonlinearities in the drill string and or in the traveling block equations only in the phc behavior which affects the crown block dynamic in eq 11 therefore the linear model uses the phc linear forces obtained in the previous section two linear models are defined in function of the input in the first model of eq 23 the input is the force of eq 24 which is caused by the ship heave motion and its velocity 23 x t a x t b f f x h t m y t c x t 24 f x h t k p h c x h t b p h c x h t where x is the state vector defined in eq 26 the matrix b f indicates that the force f x h is applied on the second estate equation which represents the crown block acceleration as ascribed by eq 27 the output system is the crown block position and it is established by the matrix c of eq 28 the matrix m has the masses and static parameters as the static pressure and the weight supported by the well bottom the matrix a is given by eq 25 in box i and the matrix m is presented in eq 29 to provide an example of a discretized drill string into two elements the matrix notation of a and m is simplified with m d i m i m a i m d i m m i m m a i m 26 x t x c t x c t x t t x t t x i t x i t x i m t x i m t 27 b f 0 1 m c 0 0 0 0 0 0 28 c 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 29 m 0 p

forces are neglected without the matrix m in order to ensure a single input single output siso implementation a new state x c m is defined per eq 31 hatleskog and dunningan 2006 and a new state vector x x h is defined in eq 32 finally the matrix b x h of eq 34 represents the input disturbance only in function of the heave motion 30 x x h t a x x h t b x h x h t y x h t c x x h t 31 x c m t x c t k

decomposition the system eigenvalues of eq 23 are computed with a ship heave amplitude of x h o p e and frequency ω 0 9 rad s these eigenvalues are distinct between each other then the i th eigenvector corresponds to the i th column of the modal matrix t 35 t v 1 v 2 v 2 n the original system is transformed with the modal matrix in 36 x m t a m x m t b m f x h t y m t c m x m t the matrices of this transformation are a m t 1 a t x m t t 1 x t b m t 1 b f and c m c t the modal system is denoted by the subscript m the matrix a m is diagonal and turns explicit its eigenvalues decoupling the original system in n subsystems of second order that have pairs of eigenvalues reals or complexes in order to facilitate the visualization fig 8 is plotted with re normalized eigenvectors considering for each eigenvector its element with the highest absolute value which always occurs in the top of the drill string and in the first vibration mode these values are 132 118 102 mm for the depths 4 8 12 km so the amplitude of the top drill string decreases 23 when the depth increases from 4 km to 12 km and increases approximately 50 for the second and third vibration mode so these two modes are more free in the top for deeper drilling on the other hand the bottom deflection of drill string decreases approximately 70 from 4 km to 12 km it means that the bottom is better recessed with increasing depth the mode shapes change with the drill string length the nodes and the maximum does not occur in the same places the maximum deflections of each mode are different the top deflection of the second and third modes are amplified around z 0 7 for 8 km and 12 km in these lengths are even larger than the deflection of the first mode at the same length this is important because these modes are excited by the civ and the maximum deflection produces the maximum acceleration that may cause drill string fatigue fig 9 presents the 3 d plot of the axial deflection and the real and imaginary eigenvector part the eigenvectors were rotated to have a zero phase at the top in this way it is simpler to compare the vibration modes of drill string length the mode shapes are extremely close to the mode of vibration for free and fixed bottom as the analytical solution of a beam with a free top end and a fixed bottom end this boundary condition of the first vibration mode has already been noted in wada et al 2018 and it was expected since the drill bit is in contact with the ground which has a much greater stiffness than the drill string and its top is connected to the phc which has a stiffness significantly smaller than the drill string fig 10 depicts the same deflections of fig 9 looking downward from the top end of the drill string the imaginary parts of the eigenvectors imply that all points of the drill string vibrate out of phase in each modal contribution it avoids that the displacements at all points reaches their maximums peaks simultaneously oliveto et al 1997 however maximum deflection at the top and bottom occur almost at the same time for first and third modes but in opposite directions for the second mode the phase of higher modes is more affected by the damping as is seen in the third mode whereas the first mode has the smallest phase variation the modal analysis was based on the matrix a that is a function of operation ship amplitude x h o p e and its frequency ω 0 9 rad s see above subsection if these parameters change the matrix a is also modified then the modes results vary too however the response between the interval x h m i n and x h m a x and frequency between 0 35 rad s and 1 rad s showed slight variations therefore the results presented are typical of these intervals 6 seal friction effect on phc performance the seal friction effects on the system are analyzed for long and short drill pipe of 2 km and 12 km with drill bit free and in contact these effects are attenuation variation in function of ship amplitude odp 2012 and the civ phenomena wada et al 2018 6 1 phc attenuation variation in function of ship amplitude 6 1 1 2 km with drill bit free and in contact fig 11 presents the crown block movement x c for four cases with drill bit free and in contact and with the operation and minimum heave waves i e x h o p e and x h m i n the responses with nonlinear linear b s f x h ope and linear b s f x h min phc are depicted in linear cases the stiffness k p h c is linearized around 0 and the viscous friction coefficient of the fluid b f f is obtained with the amplitude of the operation vessel x o p e the difference between the linear cases is the value of the coefficient of the seal friction b s f which is updated with the input amplitude the linear b s f x h o p e and the nonlinear have almost the same response for the operation ship amplitude in fig 11 a and b with drill bit free and in contact even if the linearization of seal friction force does not totally represent its nonlinear behavior as shown in fig 7 with this approach the linear phc may fit the nonlinear phc performance for a sinusoidal wave with drill bit free and in contact an acceptable linearization has been described in hatleskog and dunningan 2006 for phc with drill bit free however there is a warning with drill bit in contact the linearization is valid if the drill bit is maintained in contact with the formation because if the drill bit is lifted from the bottom of the well the dynamic is highly modified as commented by hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b the linear b s f x h o p e has an attenuation of the transmitted ship movement of 77 with drill bit free fig 11 a and c and 84 with drill bit in contact fig 11 b and d these attenuation values are maintained constant when there is a change of the maximum ship heave amplitude which does not match with the nonlinear behavior that has a variable attenuation in function of the ship amplitude similar behavior has already been reported in odp 2012 the attenuation decreases approximately from 85 to 40 or less when the ship amplitude diminishes from 3 7 m to 1 8 m the frequency is not shown also it is briefly commented that this attenuation reduction is produced by the nonlinear seal friction force another example of phc attenuation variation in function of the ship amplitude is presented in niedzwecki and thampii 1988 a large package is attached to the drill string and its drag is nonlinear the attenuation decreases in function of the ship amplitude which is opposite to the effect found here because the phc dominant force is the seal friction instead of the viscous friction of the air through the pipe eq 21 shows that if it is only considered the viscous friction the attenuation variation would also be proportional to the ship amplitude in the analyzed frequency fig 11 reproduces the attenuation reduction of the nonlinear phc system it changes from 79 x h o p e to 70 x h m i n with drill bit free and from 90 x h o p e to 84 x h m i n with drill bit in contact this behavior is obtained by the linear phc b s f x h m i n its linear seal friction coefficient is updated with the new maximum ship amplitude x h m i n a similar effect is obtained with frequency variation see eq 21 the linear phc force permits to obtain the frequency response with drill bit free and in contact for each ship amplitude see fig 12 these figures were plotted considering that the linear friction coefficient of phc is a function of the ship amplitude b p h c x h of eq 22 it means that each amplitude has its own coefficient b p h c therefore the attenuation in the studied frequency is also modified and it is inversely proportional to the ship amplitude see the vertical blue line of fig 12 with ω 0 9 rad s the data of attenuation and damping coefficient is condensed in table 3 a similar frequency response was obtained for a phc with drill bit in contact by gonzalez et al 2019 only considering upper and lower sections of drill string 6 1 2 12 km with drill bit in contact it is important to note that the case of 12 km studied in wada et al 2018 has an input ocean wave with an amplitude of approximately 0 1 m and the phc has an extra sheave link this extra sheave links is not considered in this article for drill string with 12 km length the first mode occurs in the spectra of ocean wave but the phc never amplifies the input signal with this amplitude see fig 13 however when the amplitude of the input signal is 1 m the frequency of the first vibration mode falls into the range of significant energy of the ocean wave and produces a resonance frequency the explanation is that the linear seal friction coefficient of phc b s f decreases 10 times with this amplitude see eq 21 this amplification provided by the linear system is corroborated by the nonlinear model in fig 14 b the amplification gain is larger than the linear model because the one obtained with the linearization was calculated exclusively with the speed of the input disturbance neglecting the crown block velocity which is greater than the velocity of the heave disturbance even so the linear model is able to predict the amplification in this frequency a possible solution to avoid this amplification consists in using a semi active system as a servo valve which can provide extra damping this solution was studied in a phc with drill bit free and without seal friction cuellar and fortaleza 2014 sanchez et al 2017 cuellar and fortaleza 2015 as result the phc attenuation was improved despite an insignificant energy consumption 6 2 compensator induced vibration civ 6 2 1 12 km with drill bit in contact the frequency of 0 66 rad s does not excite the high frequency modes for 12 km however the high modes of the system may be excited e g the input frequency of 1 rad s with amplitude 0 1 m and 1 m excites the system high frequencies as is presented in figs 15 and 16 the crown block movement is presented in fig 15 and is dominated by the high frequencies when the ship amplitude is 0 1 m whereas when the ship amplitude is 1 m the high frequencies seem to be noisy at first glance however these high frequencies are well defined in the wob see fig 16 the wob for 0 1 m always ensures that the drill bit is in contact with the formation but the wob for 1 m loses contact for some instants wob larger than 0 ottestad et al 2010 also shows that the drill bit is lifted of the formation by the seal friction effect if the nonlinear seal friction is neglected high frequency oscillations disappear from the wob response as stated in wada et al 2018 it is relevant to question which input frequencies cause the civ phenomenon which the high frequencies are excited by the civ and how this phenomenon occurs the key to answer these questions is to consider the phc as a transducer of heave motion into force this force presents high frequencies as shown in fig 17 these are characteristic of the seal friction see fig 4 its second harmonic has frequency 3 ω that is exactly 3 rad s this second harmonic frequency matches the third vibration mode of the system presented in fig 13 then this mode is excited and the wob presents a resonance in this frequency as is shown fig 17 wada et al 2018 uses a frequency of 0 63 rad s to excite the vibration mode of frequency 1 89 rad s for a drill string of 8 km exactly three times the value of the input frequency the fourth vibration mode of the system has a frequency of 4 2 rad s and is triggered by the third harmonic of the seal friction 5 ω with ω 0 8 rad s fig 18 the other high frequency modes could be triggered in a similar way a harmonic of the seal friction n ω n odd must match a system vibration mode all the modes of the system may be energized by the seal friction force however the energy of the seal friction harmonic is inversely proportional to the number of the harmonic as described by eq 19 decreasing the energy transmitted to the high modes e g the third vibration mode of fig 17 has the largest magnitude for the third mode even larger than the first mode with a magnitude of 16 kn for ship amplitude of 0 1 m and 40 kn for 1 m these magnitudes decrease when the fourth vibration mode of fig 17 is excited by the second harmonic of the seal friction 10 kn with 0 1 m and 14 kn with 1 m another important point observed with the fourier transformation is that the civ is more important as the ship amplitude is smaller in the case of 0 1 m ship amplitude of fig 17 the third vibration mode of the system is almost twice the value of the first the case of 1 m ship amplitude is different the third and first vibration mode have almost the same value the fourth vibration mode is more relevant for ship amplitude of 0 1 m than for ship amplitude of 1 m when compared to the first vibration mode in fig 18 then even if the frequency of the seal friction harmonic matches a high frequency vibration mode of the system the energy transmitted is lower 6 2 2 2 km with drill bit in contact the civ is not just a phenomenon that occurs in ultra long drill pipe as reported by hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b where civ is observed with a drill pipe of 2 7 km fig 19 shows the civ phenomena with the drill string of 2 km the first vibration mode of system has a frequency of 2 rad s see fig 12 and is excited by an input ocean wave of one third of its frequency as is shown in fig 19 a this case is explained in the same way that the civ of long drill string the second harmonic of the seal friction force energizes the first vibration mode of system see fig 19 b 6 2 3 12 km with drill bit free civ has only been reported when there is drill bit in contact in hatleskog and dunnigan 2007b and wada et al 2018 however fig 20 shows that the civ phenomena may occur even with the drill bit free fig 20 a shows the frequency response of the linear system its third vibration mode is 2 09 rad s fig 20 b presents the linear and the nonlinear responses of the crown block for a sinusoidal wave of frequency 0 69 rad s and amplitude x h o p e the civ with drill bit free is explained with the same reasoning used to explain the civ with drill bit in contact then the second harmonic of the seal friction excites the third vibration mode of the system fig 20 c shows the fourier transformation of the crown block position signal which has a peak in the frequency of 2 09 rad s that is exactly three times the input frequency 7 conclusions two effects produced by the seal friction of phc in drilling offshore dynamic were presented and explained the variation in function of the ship amplitude and frequency and the civ phenomenon the air friction force is the most irrelevant in the dynamic phc force the dynamic forces of phc are determined by the air stiffness and the seal friction forces due to its nonlinear behavior the seal friction has the largest influence on the phc dynamic force with the minimum ship amplitude and the minimum sprung mass also the seal friction causes an abrupt change in the phc dynamic force which is always presented in its maximum value and is f s f larger than the maximum value of the linear case the nonlinear behavior of the seal friction force generates higher frequencies than the natural frequency of the heave motion ω the peaks appear in the frequencies n ω with n odd and its magnitude is inversely proportional to n which is explained by the fourier transformation of square signal therefore these frequencies are also presented in the phc dynamic force the linearization of the phc was presented in detail and its approximation error is analyzed with respect to amplitude variation of the platform heave motion and different sprung masses the equivalent linear seal friction is inversely proportional to the ship heave velocity causing the variation of phc attenuation as function of the ship amplitude and frequency in the case of long drill pipe this behavior may produce a resonance frequency inside the interval of ocean frequencies the linear system is not able to reproduce the civ phenomena because it only considered the first harmonic of the seal friction force civ occurs when a harmonic of the seal friction different from the first matches a system vibration mode furthermore it is also presented that the civ happens in the long and short drill pipe with drill bit free or in contact the typical shape of the first three drill string vibration modes were obtained with the linear system the mode shapes are extremely close to the vibration mode with free top and fixed bottom this approximation holds and it is even better with the increasing of the drill string length because of the reduction of its stiffness in comparison to the bottom stiffness the effects are mitigated with the active control proposed in part ii of this paper series credit authorship contribution statement william humberto cuéllar sánchez formal analysis

21653,this article analyzes the spatial distribution of extreme waves generated by extratropical cyclones and studies the atmospheric conditions that lead to the most severe events in the southwestern portion of the south atlantic ocean significant wave heights from the ncep ww3 hindcast and atmospheric fields from ncep cfsr are selected for the analysis that joins automatic tracking of the storms with visual analyses of the most relevant cases the synoptic pattern of extreme events suggested that extreme waves can occur in three regions of the cyclones 1 behind the cold front 2 along the warm front and 3 ahead of the cold front the first pattern is widely reported in the literature while the others are unexplored in the region and are first reported in this paper it was also shown that the anticyclone position relative to the cyclone center plays an important role in the extreme waves in two ways 1 due to the increase of horizontal pressure gradient and consequently surface wind speed and 2 affecting the cyclone displacement speed which determines the fetch positioning and the wave generation process the novel features identified show that slow cyclones tend to promote longer events of extreme waves with impact on larger areas keywords extreme waves cyclone generated waves extratropical cyclones south atlantic ocean wave hindcasts 1 introduction extreme waves are usually associated with high risks to ships offshore structures and potential loss of human life the ocean areas along the southwestern and southern brazil have important ship routes ports and intense oil and gas industry therefore the knowledge of extreme wave climate and its spatial distribution is essential for operational forecasting metocean design criteria route planning among other activities associated with offshore industry the concern about extreme waves generated by cyclonic winds is large since they are related to the largest errors in wave simulations in deep water campos et al 2018 2020 babanin et al 2019 the release of new satellite products and data assimilation methods as well as better numerical models lead to recent progresses in wave forecasting and hindcasting however such improvements inevitably depend on the understanding of the atmospheric conditions responsible for the wave generation processes this paper aims to study the development of cyclone generated waves in the south and southeastern brazil through the characterization of atmospheric conditions along the south atlantic ocean a spatial approach to the selection of extreme events is applied to better analyze the influence of the synoptic pattern and its wind wave response several studies have contributed to the knowledge of wave climate in the western portion of the south atlantic ocean e g innocentini and caetano neto 1996 alves and melo 2001 campos et al 2012 dragani et al 2013 godoi et al 2014 romeu et al 2015 campos et al 2019 the seasonal oscillation of the south atlantic subtropical high sash plays an important role in the atmospheric circulation in the region together with the southward extratropical cyclones that affect particularly the south and southeastern extent of the brazilian coast the winter and fall present large values of wave height due to the large occurrence of cyclonic systems and the associated cold fronts pianca et al 2010 pianca et al 2010 found maximum hs values of 7 3 m in southern brazil with wave direction predominantly from south the most extreme waves in the region are related to extratropical cyclones over the south atlantic e g innocentini and caetano neto 1996 rocha et al 2003 dragani et al 2013 campos et al 2012 2018 rocha et al 2003 analyzed six cyclones associated with high sea waves along the brazilian coast in 1999 all cases were linked to cyclones originated around 30 s and 35 s influenced by a west southwestward anticyclone which intensifies the winds in the western sector of the cyclones this synoptic configuration is also reported by dragani et al 2013 who analyze the conditions of extreme wave events in the mouth of la plata river in 14 years the strong and persistent southeasterly winds over the continental shelf promote very energetic waves along south america from uruguay to central brazilian coast innocentini and caetano neto 1996 dragani et al 2013 romeu et al 2015 studied the wave climate in south of brazil by decomposing sea state in the primary and secondary wave systems using a cluster analysis they found six typical scenarios which include young swells from south and east mature swells from southeast and wind seas from east west and south romeu et al 2015 identified that the most energetic wave systems from south and southwest are mainly caused by extratropical cyclones that develop at the uruguayan and argentinean coasts more recently campos et al 2018 analyzed the 47 most extreme events between 2002 and 2009 detected by three offshore buoys in brazil using composites they found that extremes wave events are associated with cyclones generated around 40 s with southeastward displacement the relation between atmospheric pattern and wave climate are investigated in several studies mainly in northern hemisphere e g hanafin et al 2012 ponce de león and guedes soares 2014 2015 camus et al 2014 rueda et al 2016 bernardino and guedes soares 2016 bell et al 2017 kita et al 2018 de leo et al 2019 ponce de león and bettencourt 2019 camus et al 2014 developed a statistical downscaling framework to study wave climate based on weather types produced by the clustering of sea level pressure field however the statistical model presents failures when applied to non homogeneous data rueda et al 2019 which is the case of reanalysis products in the southern hemisphere as reported by stopa and cheung 2014 chawla et al 2013 and rascle and ardhuin 2013 the use of k mean clustering was also adopted by solari and alonso 2017 to a weather pattern classification method to extreme wave analysis an automatic classification of atmospheric conditions leading extreme waves are of great value but require a previous step in the recognition of existing synoptic patterns in order to set up the number of clusters used e g de leo et al 2019 moreover despite the importance of extratropical cyclones in extreme wave generation the knowledge of wave field evolution and synoptic features is still limited hanafin et al 2012 found a relation between the cyclone displacement speed and the wave group speed bell et al 2017 studied the role of cyclone relative air flows i e warm and cold conveyor belts in extreme waves in the northern sea kita et al 2018 investigated the development of ocean waves under explosive cyclone conditions in the northwestern pacific between 1994 and 2014 these studies addressed key features of extreme wave generation associated with cyclonic features that will be explored in this paper focused on the south atlantic ocean the main goal of the present work is to analyze the atmospheric patterns that lead to the development of cyclone generated extreme waves in the south and southeastern brazil independent extreme wave events are extracted from 6 years of reanalysis data and crossed with cyclone tracks information using an objective automated method the atmospheric conditions associated with the 10 most severe wave events are analyzed together with the spatial distribution of hs within the cyclone structure to obtain patterns of cyclone wave generation and its association with cyclone characteristics and lifecycle the dataset is described in section 2 1 section 2 2 is dedicated to the cyclone identification section 2 3 presents the selection of extreme wave events linked to the cyclones section 3 is dedicated to the analysis of the extreme events identified by the method and section 4 is focused on the atmospheric conditions that lead to the most extreme cases the final discussions are included in section 5 followed by the conclusions in section 6 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets the wave fields were obtained from the hindcast produced by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep derived from the wave model wavewatch iii tolman et al 2009 forced by the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis winds cfsr saha et al 2010 the wave hindcast has 3 h and 0 5 of time and space resolution respectively the parameter significant wave height hs is selected as it integrates the total energy of the spectrum in order to exclude shallow and intermediate water waves only grid points with a depth greater than 610 m have been selected fig 1 a limit that is obtained from the linear wave theory considering the lowest frequency defined by the wave model described as 0 035 s 1 by chawla et al 2011 the wave hindcast has been evaluated by chawla et al 2013 using altimeter and buoy data who found a general good performance in offshore locations nevertheless they reported an underestimation of hs in the southern hemisphere due to the underestimation of wind intensity particularly in the early part of the database prior to 1994 moreover stopa and cheung 2014 showed that cfsr has more seasonal variations in the waves and better agreement with buoy measurements than other reanalysis the atmospheric fields were also provided by ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr where the variables are available in 27 pressure levels and 0 5 0 5 horizontal resolution grid while the surface variables are in a gaussian t382 grid cfsr is part of the latest set of reanalysis which presented a significant improvement in atmospheric features representation due to the new data assimilation techniques and sources of observational data e g saha et al 2010 hodges et al 2011 stopa and cheung 2014 moreover cfsr shows a better performance in representing extreme winds and waves under intense extratropical events as described by stopa and cheung 2014 and campos and guedes soares 2016a b the domain has been selected based on the regional frequency analysis of campos et al 2019 who identified statistically homogeneous regions and defined the most severe locations in terms of hs and extreme quantiles in brazil fig 1 shows the area and the exact grid points selected for the analyses of the next sections the methodology joins automatic cyclone tracking with visual inspection of the meteorological events case by case for the period from 1999 to 2004 2 2 cyclone identification and tracking cyclones were automatically identified based on the relative vorticity calculated in spherical coordinates from the zonal and meridional wind components at 850 hpa performed by the track program hodges 1994 1995 the use of vorticity allows the detection of weak and fast moving systems as well as early stage cyclones sinclair 1994 these characteristics are important to wave generation because cyclones with a weak signal in the sea level pressure field may also generate moderate to strong winds sinclair 1994 highlighted the benefits of using vorticity to cyclones identification particularly in mid latitudes where strong pressure gradient may mask weak cyclonic systems and avoid their detection in the sea level pressure field as long as the focus of this work is cyclonic synoptic scale atmospheric system a spectral filter is applied in the vorticity before the identification and tracking procedure the filter removes the large scale atmospheric waves n 5 and small spatial scales n 42 from the relative vorticity field where the zonal wavenumber n corresponds to the number of wavelengths fitting within a full circumference around the globe at a given latitude i e the wavelength l 2πrsin ϕ n where r is earth s radius and ϕ is latitude cyclones are identified by local minima search in the relative vorticity field with the threshold of 1 0 10 5 s 1 as long as in the southern hemisphere negative vorticity correspond to cyclonic circulation the identification of the cyclone features is performed in a polar stereographic projection to avoid latitudinal bias sinclair 1997 to produce smoother tracks the positions are refined by determining the off grid locations using b spline interpolation and steepest descent minimization the tracking is performed after all cyclonic features are identified in all data frames time steps first a set of tracks is made by linking the detected features points using the nearest neighbor method then the tracks are refined by minimizing a cost function for the tracking smoothness which operates both forwards and backward in time the track smoothness depends on adaptive constraints which define the maximum displacement and displacement angle in a time step hodges 1999 the constraints applied are the same used by gramcianinov et al 2019 who performed several tests to obtain a configuration that represents cyclones in the atlantic ocean particularly near south america gramcianinov et al 2019 evaluated the tracking method and their applied constraints by comparing the automatic tracking to manual analysis using synoptic charts from the brazilian navy including the summer djf and winter jja of 2005 and found 89 of correspondence between subjective and objective tracking the relative vorticity threshold to the feature identification and wavenumbers used to the spectral filtering in this work are in agreement with the extratropical cyclonic diagnostics method developed by hoskins and hodges 2002 and widely used in scientific community e g hoskins and hodges 2005 dacre and grey 2013 gramcianinov et al 2019 more details about the track algorithm filtering processes and adaptive constraints can be found in hodges 1994 1995 1996 1999 anderson et al 2003 hodges and hoskins 2002 2005 and gramcianinov et al 2019 after the identification and tracking processes only systems that last longer than 12 h and have displacement from start to end greater than 500 km are considered for further analyses these criteria avoid thermal lows and stationary systems with minor relevance to the analyses but still capturing cyclonic winds essential to extreme waves it is important to note that the duration and displacement criteria adopted are more generalist than 24 h or 48 h and 1000 km used in the above mentioned literature the change in the selection criteria were made after the evaluation of the method applied in this paper the use of 12 h allows the identification of some troughs i e cyclonic wind circulation that are associated with extreme events but would be neglected by the 24 h our 48 h criteria the trough still generates cyclonic winds although this is not enough to classify it as a developing cyclone the decision to include troughs were done after some tests indicating that such atmospheric systems are important to extreme wave generation in the study region hence the criteria established in this work allow the detection of cyclonic systems important to extreme wave events in the region the track program provides a list containing the track for each identified cyclone with longitude and latitude in each time step of its lifecycle the track positional information was used to the selection of the cyclones associated with extreme waves described in the next section 2 3 selection of cyclone generated waves in this work extreme waves are defined as independent events of hs that exceed the 95th percentile hs95 hereafter related to the empiric probability distribution of each grid point of the domain fig 1 thus each grid point has its own threshold that varies with location in addition the independency assumes that only one value of hs is selected per storm or event per grid point following the methodology presented in fig 2 and based on campos et al 2019 which is divided in three steps 1 an autocorrelation function of hs for each grid point defines a window size for the statistical independency of events the first minimum of the second derivative of the autocorrelation function was used as a criteria to find the minimum value from which the associated time interval in hours is selected 2 the maximum of hs within the running window with size defined in the first step is calculated a process that is repeated for each grid point independently 3 the empiric probability function of independent events of hs is built and the 95th percentile is selected as the extreme value threshold the described methodology allows an automation of the process and facilitates the calculation for all grid points fig 3 shows the hs95 of independent events and the window size obtained for each grid point the choice of using the first minimum of the second derivative and not simply the first minimum of the autocorrelation function was based on several tests the second option leads to large values of window size beyond one week that do not correspond to what is expected in the region according to the previous studies the selection of independent extreme events so far has considered the analysis of each grid point separately the definition of extreme wave event and the association with cyclones is illustrated in fig 4 to extend the concept of extreme waves to a spatial approach two additional criteria have been imposed the extreme event of hs must exist in two or more neighboring points at the same time step fig 4a the extreme must exist for at least 12 h fig 4b the minimum duration of the extreme wave event has been added to exclude small and short events that are irrelevant to the analyses and do not jeopardize marine safety and offshore operations finally the cyclone tracks were assigned to each extreme wave event where the link between cyclones and waves was made by proximity using the first time step of each extreme wave event the algorithm searches the nearest cyclone within a radius of 1500 km fig 4c all points of the extreme event hs above the threshold and the location of the center of the cyclone minimum vorticity at 850 hpa are used for the distance calculation if a cyclone within 1500 km of any extreme hs point of the event at its start time is found the cyclone is then assigned to the event otherwise the event is classified as not associated with a cyclone the concept of the algorithm is summarized in fig 4c the use of distance in kilometers instead of degrees avoids the distortion of the sphere projection and allows an equal comparison between distances in all latitudes and longitudes considering the size of a baroclinic wave in middle latitudes 2000 3000 km the distance of 1500 km is enough to capture the maximum winds without the interference of other synoptic systems besides the automatic algorithm a visual inspection was performed to confirm the success of the methodology in six years 1999 2004 of analysis and considering the whole domain the method detected a total of 91 extreme events of hs from which only 4 are not associated with a cyclone and or cyclonic winds these non cyclonic events were confirmed to be related with anticyclones it is important to highlight that this result is sensible to some criteria and threshold used in the method such as the cyclone displacement and duration criteria and the extreme wave threshold changes in these parameters could increase or decrease the percentage of extreme wave events not associated with cyclones however the focus of the present work is to analyze the most extreme events and events associated with cyclonic winds which justify the choice described in section 2 2 and 2 3 3 description and overview of the extreme events a total of 87 extreme wave events are associated with cyclones between 1999 and 2004 table 1 shows the number of events mean and standard deviation by year and season most of the events occur in the winter 33 followed by the spring and fall with the same amount 23 and very few events in the summer 8 the higher frequency of events in the winter followed by fall and spring are in agreement with previous studies of parente and souza 1989 parente et al 2001 pinho 2003 and campos et al 2012 however campos et al 2012 have found more extreme events in the fall than in the spring considering both frequency and intensity the winter is the most important season summer is the season that mostly diverges from others and despite the low frequency a few rare events in the summer can have mean hs with values above the other seasons this indicates that the summer may not be excluded from the period of extreme wave events which is confirmed by the existence of summer cases in extremes ranked by melo et al 2010 and dragani et al 2013 however the small amount of events in this season 8 turns difficult the comparison of its mean intensity with the others seasons due to low statistical significance and high standard deviation the seasonal distribution of events may change depending on the year considering the inter annual variability the year of 2000 for example presented a large number of extreme events 16 followed by 2001 15 however the former presented more events during the winter while the last had more events occurring in the spring and fall in 1999 there were fewer events 12 but they were more equally distributed between seasons the inter annual variability is possibly related to the influence of enso and sam in the south atlantic storm track e g reboita et al 2015 but a longer reanalysis period with more years is needed to properly identify inter annual effects on extreme waves which is out of the scope of this study table 2 summarizes the most relevant results presenting the 10 most intense events according to maximum hs of each case the total points are the sum of grid points above hs95 during the event i e it quantifies the area affected by the event the duration is computed by the time in which the envelope of grid points above the hs95 threshold exist within the domain and the mean hs is calculated only considering these points of extreme the most extreme case of table 2 with maximum hs within the storm equal to 10 11 m has also the longest duration and the largest spatial coverage such combination however is not a requirement for extreme waves in the area the second and third most extreme events had shorter durations and smaller extension but still generated waves of 10 03 and 9 42 m of hs respectively table 2 also shows the maximum 10 m wind speed and minimum sea level pressure mslp within 6 and 5 radius from the cyclone center as computed by bengtsson et al 2009 as long as the vorticity field is smoothed during the tracking method the surface wind speed and mslp are good measurements of cyclone intensity e g bengtsson et al 2009 hodges et al 2011 the maximum surface wind speed in the cyclone fetches is around 30 m s the most intense winds of 34 56 m s is associated with the 8th most extreme wave event probably due to the shorter persistence of surface winds and with a smaller fetch it recalls the well known combination of wind speed duration and fetch described by the joint north sea wave project jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 the displacement speed of the cyclone during the extreme event provides additional information to better understand the propagation of fetch and the severity of events according to table 2 low propagation speeds are in general associated with higher values of hs fig 5 shows the density of the 87 cyclone tracks associated with extreme waves where one can observe cyclogenesis and propagation of the most important cyclones affecting the wave heights most cyclones present genesis over land between 25 s and 35 s in the region called by gramcianinov et al 2019 as la plata this cyclogenesis region is usually more active during austral winter and fall e g gan e rao 1991 hoskins and hodges 2005 which is confirmed to affect the extreme waves by campos et al 2018 note that table 2 shows the most extreme event occurred at the end of may despite the spiral poleward pattern of the storm track reported by previous work e g hoskins and hodges 2005 the track of associated cyclones of fig 5 shows a more west east orientation within western portion of south atlantic ocean machado et al 2010 shows a similar pattern studying 40 extreme wave events along the southern brazilian coast hs 6 m they found that 80 5 of the events are associated with cyclones generated nearby uruguay and 53 7 present a west east displacement which is very similar to the present findings therefore the operational monitoring of such area shaded in red in fig 5 is extremely important to improve simulations and forecasts of extreme waves in brazil 4 atmospheric condition and case studies fig 5 and table 2 describe the common features of cyclones that generated the most extreme waves in brazil it is relevant to analyze the particular features of each event since different combinations of wind speed fetch and duration can lead to the same value of extreme hs in order to avoid repetitive description and long explanation the first two cases from table 2 are analyzed in detail which were found to be the most relevant among the group of events besides the first two cases are the most intense between the 87 selected events they present a distinct extreme wave pattern from each other which leads to extreme hs in distinct sectors of the cyclone these differences are explored in the first two cases and the others are briefly commented and compared at the end of this section as long as they follow the first and second patterns additional cases are analyzed in section 4 3 to enrich the final discussion and to incorporate more events 4 1 case 1 may 23rd 2003 the top event of table 2 has the highest hs max 10 11 m as well as the largest extension i e the number of grid points above the extreme threshold and the longest duration lasting approximately four days the effect of the cyclone associated with this offshore event was reported by melo et al 2010 and machado et al 2010 who studied extreme coastal sea state conditions in the southern brazil melo et al 2010 reported the extreme hs event on may 25th reaching 8 79 m at rio grande continental shelf at 32 9 s 50 8 w fig 6 presents the synoptic conditions during the event and its evolution the cyclone is generated on may 22nd at 06 utc in northern argentina and moves eastward during the first 6 h the warm advection prevails within the cyclone promoting strong northwesterly winds in addition an extratropical anticyclone is located southward of the center of the cyclone increasing the gradient pressure in this quadrant of the cyclonic system the extreme hs event starts on may 23rd at 00 utc when the cold sector of the cyclone is still evolving over the continent the extreme waves occur along the warm front where the pressure gradient is large due to the southeastward anticyclone and the maximum winds reached 29 6 m s following the intensification of the cyclonic circulation to the south of the surface low the number of points with extreme hs growths in a clockwise pattern the maximum values of hs occur at 18 utc but the event remains under development particularly behind the cold front where the south southwesterly winds prevail the cyclone elongates in the meridional axis during the evolution and displacement eastward due to its multicore feature and the presence of the anticyclone this feature is also verified in the synoptic analysis from melo et al 2010 after may 25th part of the grid points with extreme waves stop following the cyclonic circulation and begin to propagate along the coast the separation of the extreme wave package is associated with the development of mature swell with faster group velocity and in addition it is seems to be associated with the development of a secondary convergence zone as a secondary cold front this is possible to see in fig 7 a and b through the vertical velocity at 500 hpa relative humidity at 700 hpa temperature advection and winds at 925 hpa the primary cold front is reaching 20 s and the black arrows in fig 7 highlights the position of the secondary front at 35 s the association of high relative humidity and upward motion indicate a signal of a front within the cyclone that is not easily noticed by using standard surface wind plots fig 8 shows the evolution of some cyclone characteristics during the same event the maximum values of hs occur 6 h after the maximum 10 m wind speed during the cyclone intensification stage related to the mslp it is possible to see that in the intensification stage the displacement speed of the cyclone is reduced at the bottom plot of fig 8 hence the combination of strong winds with low propagation speed of the cyclone created a condition for a rapid increase of hs during the first half of the cyclone life cycle the mean displacement speed of cyclones generated at this latitude according to previous studies is 12 6 3 8 m s gramcianinov et al 2019 while this case presented a mean speed of 6 5 m s which confirms the relative low speed of cyclone displacement 4 2 case 2 february 1st 2002 the second most extreme event was also associated with cyclogenesis over the continent around 30 s occurred on january 31st at 00 utc this event is one of the rare extreme waves that occurs in the summer and is also listed in the ranking of melo et al 2010 who reported a hs maximum of 7 50 m on february 2nd at rio grande continental shelf at 32 9 s 50 8 w on february 1st at 00 utc the cyclone moved eastward to the ocean and the southwesterly winds of its cold sector south of the center of the cyclone are placed with direction parallel to the shore different from case 1 there is no anticyclone located southeast of the cyclone during its early stages to promote significant shape deformation thus allowing the development of a large fetch along the coast where the extreme hs values took place at 12utc fig 9 a nevertheless the wind in the cold sector is later intensified by an extratropical anticyclone developed southwestward of the cyclone center that supports the persistence of the fetch fig 9b and c the extreme area seems to detach from the center cyclone after february 2nd at 06 utc fig 9d and once again the swell propagates out of the generation zone fig 9f due to the position close to the coast the wave group did not propagate for more than 12 h reaching the region offshore santa catarina state fig 9f and southeastern coast of brazil fig 10 shows the peak of hs with the same delay of 6 h compared to the peak of wind speed 30 51 m s similar to case 1 the rapid decrease of wind speeds lead to the decrease of wave heights and different from case 1 the extreme conditions occurred close to the minimum mean sea level pressure at the center of the cyclone when it start the decaying stage the short duration and small extension of this event when compared with case 1 can be addressed to the higher displacement speed which was 8 34 m s during the extreme wave event fig 10 the increase of the displacement speed may be also related to the interruption of the intensification of the cyclone as long as the slow displacement allows a better interaction with the genesis environment along southeastern south atlantic coast e g gramcianinov et al 2019 4 3 additional comments about other events cases 3 to 10 from table 2 follow the patterns described in cases 1 or 2 cases 3 to 5 7 and 8 present extreme hs in the cold sector of the cyclone with atmospheric conditions similar to case 2 cases 6 and 10 present extreme wave distribution similar to case 1 within the warm sector of the cyclone they are not shown in detail to avoid repetition but some important atmospheric features are highlighted to support the extreme wave pattern presented in sections 4 1 and 4 2 case 3 on december 8th 2003 at 12 utc was similar to the second case the extreme values appear behind the cold front in a region of southwesterly winds parallel to the coast this cyclone moved faster than one in case 2 during the extreme wave event 18 34 m s the south atlantic anticyclone located northeastward of the cyclone seems to modify the propagation to southward direction out of the area of study starting on october 21st 2002 at 12utc case 4 also presented the extreme hs pattern similar to the cases 2 and 3 however when compared to the case 3 this extreme wave event presents a longer duration and larger extension there is an important extratropical anticyclonic circulation over the continent west of the cyclone that elongates the fetch with a large area of intense winds that allows a more efficient propagation of extreme waves northeastward fig 11 the energetic swell generated by events like this case tends to affect lower latitudes depending on the position of the cyclone case 5 occurred on april 17th 1999 at 00 utc and presented a large extent and long duration affecting all regions defined by campos et al 2019 the extreme hs pattern was the same described in cases 2 3 and 4 in the cold sector of the cyclone the extratropical cyclone associated with this event presents a slow displacement speed 5 93 m s during the peak of extreme waves allowing a quasi stationary southwesterly wind fetch there is no intense extratropical anticyclone at the continent to support the pressure gradients such as reported in case 4 however the sash position eastward of the cyclone seems to block the cyclone propagation to the east justifying its low displacement speed fig 12 note the left half of the plots of fig 12 showing a large coverage of sash with 1025 and 1030 hpa that certainly affected the development and track of the aforementioned cyclone case 6 started on august 9th 2002 at 12 utc and presented an extreme hs pattern similar to case 1 this event has the extreme waves behind the cold front as usual but also along the warm front within the warm sector of the cyclone fig 13 it is notable the presence of an anticyclone east of cyclone center as observed in case 1 this extreme wave event presents two hs max peaks one associated with the northeasterly winds along the warm front which coincides with the maximum surface winds 31 65 m s and the large one during the decay stage of the cyclone associated with the southwesterly winds in the cold sector case 9 is the only event forced by a cyclone generated at much southerly latitude at the argentinean coast 45 s 50 s with typical cyclogenesis patterns described by gan and rao 1991 and hoskins and hodges 2005 the extratropical cyclone presents a northward trajectory at the beginning with its center reaching almost 40 s before changing track to the southeast fig 14 the large size of the systems is resulted from the combination of the surface cyclone with the middle level trough which promotes a large fetch with southwesterly winds while it moves northeastward fig 14b however the extreme occurs only in the southern part of the domain and does not last long since the cyclone moves southeastward similar to cases 1 and 6 fig 15 shows case 10 which also presents extreme waves at the warm side of the cyclone this case differentiates from others because the extreme occurs along the cold front at the convergence line of the winds the position of the sash increases the intensity of the northwesterly wind ahead of the cold front the strong warm advection suggests that this flow within the cyclone is associated with the warm conveyor belt which transports heat and moisture and supports the intensification of the system however further analysis may be necessary to confirm this feature finally the extreme hs pattern presented in cases 7 and 8 were in the cold sector of the extratropical cyclone southwest of the cold front and associated with a similar atmospheric conditions observed in cases 2 to 5 the anticyclonic circulation located westward of the cyclone center is present in all cases intensifying the southerly winds along the coast 5 discussion although the most extreme waves in the south atlantic ocean offshore south america have common features in terms of the generation process they present specific meteorological configurations important to be studied the synoptic analysis of the events initially confirmed some patterns already observed in the literature but it also reveals new features about the spatial distribution of the extreme events within the cyclones using the cases selected in this work it is possible to confirm that extreme waves in the western portion of the south atlantic and southern brazil are related to cyclones generated between 30 s and 35 s over the continent this is in agreement with previous studies such as rocha et al 2003 melo et al 2010 machado et al 2010 and campos et al 2018 that associated cyclones generated in this region to extreme wave events in the brazilian coast moreover some additional atmospheric influences have been found such as the presence of an extratropical transient anticyclone west southwest of the cyclone center strengthening the wind in the cold sector of the system which has been initially described by rocha et al 2003 and dragani et al 2013 this synoptic configuration associated with the position of the cyclone promotes persistent southwesterly winds along the coast considered the main driver of extreme waves in the region such atmospheric pattern is the most important for the coastal extreme wave events however two more patterns were found ahead of the cyclone s fronts that may be important to offshore structure and ship routes the displacement speed of the cyclone plays an important role controlling the wave development in the generation process the average displacement speed of cyclones in the region is 12 m s gramcianinov et al 2019 while the most extreme waves were associated with cyclones with displacement speed around 6 m s slow moving cyclones tend to promote a dynamic fetch that provided energy during a longer time to the wave growth while cyclones with higher displacement speeds inevitably bounds the wave generation because the strongest winds are constantly transferring momentum to new upcoming areas propagating eastward or southeastward without sufficient persistence over the same location that is necessary to generate energetic wave packages moreover cyclones with lower displacement speeds presented longer durations and the extremes waves tend to cover larger areas that can reach northern latitudes with a much broader impact in contrast fast cyclones seem to promote more local extremes with limited effect on neighboring areas hence slow moving cyclones are the most dangerous and interfere on weather downtime and increase risks associated with offshore and coastal structures since the wave energy is proportional to hs squared and longer events hardly impact on fatigue in addition ship routes are more intensively affected by such events due to the larger coverage of the extreme waves which balances risks versus fuel consumption and long journeys as discussed by vettor and guedes soares 2016 another important feature observed is the position of the anticyclones including both the south atlantic subtropical high sash and the transient anticyclone coming after the cold front west of the cyclone the climatological position of sash and the intensity and position of the transient anticyclones have a significant influence over the cyclone tracks the extreme events in summer seasons presented a southern sash that seems to push the cyclones tracks to southern latitudes cases 3 and 8 the presence of a rearward high pressure system over the continent increases the pressure gradient in the western sector of the cyclones promoting more intense winds and consequently higher hs therefore the positioning and intensification of these three elements sash cyclone and transient anticyclone and the phase between them control the pressure gradient and drive the size persistence and intensity of the fetch which directly impact the generation of extreme waves fig 16 summarize the situations found in this work regarding the position of the anticyclone in relation to the cyclone center and the extreme wave occurrence within the extratropical cyclone indeed the most surprising synoptic configuration was the detection of extreme hs values in the warm sector ahead of the cold front and along the warm front which has not been reported in the literature for the south atlantic so far the presence of an extratropical anticyclone located southeast of the cyclone center increases the north northeasterly winds developing extreme waves along the warm front case 1 and 6 figs 1 6 7 and 13 and 16c kita et al 2018 analyzing bomb cyclones reported significant wave generation along the warm front but in its cold side the other surprising configuration was the extreme waves placed ahead of the cold front in a region of strong north northwesterly winds case 10 figs 15 and 16b this configuration shows an n s elongated anticyclone at east northeast of the cyclone center which may be associated with the migration of sash to southern latitudes actually it has been verified that this is a combination of the quasi stationary sash merged with a smaller transient anticyclone when both high pressure systems are merged and a nearby low pressure system growths into a cyclone a large fetch is developed with northwestern winds above 35 m s fig 15 therefore in the special case 10 the intense sash close to the brazilian coast reinforce the northwesterly winds along the cold front in the warm side of the cyclone in a region of strong warm advection that may suggest the influence of the warm conveyor belt to the extreme wave generation bell et al 2017 reported similar cases in the north sea of extreme wave events in the coast forced by this cyclone air flow which has now been confirmed to happen in the south atlantic ocean 6 conclusions this work combines an automated method to detect independent extreme wave events with a cyclone tracker in order to study the characteristics of the most extreme cyclone generated waves in the western portion of the south atlantic ocean with special attention to southern brazil a total of 87 extreme wave events associated with cyclones was found and investigated in the period from 1999 to 2004 the average of 14 5 1 6 extreme wave events generated by cyclones per year suggests a very intense cyclonic activity and reinforce the importance of monitoring the cyclogenesis cyclone tracks and intensity of cyclones for extreme wave analysis and forecasting in the region the characteristics of the cyclones and impact on hs have been investigated the size of the fetch and wind intensity has been confirmed as important features as expected but the displacement speed of the cyclone surprisingly became one of the most important variables to distinguish the most extreme events the most dangerous cyclones are the ones with low displacement speed associated with longer events that generate much higher hs covering a larger area the continued force to wave growth occurs when the cyclone displacement speed is moving at the same speed as the wave group velocity and this effect is reported as dynamic fetch effective fetch extended fetch or trapped fetch mostly described in tropical cyclones e g young 1988 macafee and bowyer 2005 kudryavtsev et al 2015 detailed analyses of the 10 most extreme events allow finding extreme waves in three regions of the cyclone behind the cold front most common in the cold sector of the cyclone ahead of the cold front at the convergence zone of the winds and along the warm front in the warm sector of the cyclone the first pattern occurs in most of the cases including the most extreme events and it is widely reported by previous studies fig 16a e g rocha et al 2003 melo et al 2010 machado et al 2010 a careful analysis of anticyclones around the low pressure system led to the identification of two additional patterns never described before in the south atlantic which occur in the warm sector of the cyclone in the first of them the combination of the south atlantic subtropical high sash with a transient anticyclone propagating eastwards generates a very strong high pressure system that together with the extratropical cyclone on its west side leads to a large fetch with intense north northwesterly winds and high hs with southeastward direction fig 16b in the second synoptic pattern the presence of an anticyclone placed southeastward of the cyclone center increases the north northeasterly winds promoting extreme wave along warm front fig 16c credit authorship contribution

21653,this article analyzes the spatial distribution of extreme waves generated by extratropical cyclones and studies the atmospheric conditions that lead to the most severe events in the southwestern portion of the south atlantic ocean significant wave heights from the ncep ww3 hindcast and atmospheric fields from ncep cfsr are selected for the analysis that joins automatic tracking of the storms with visual analyses of the most relevant cases the synoptic pattern of extreme events suggested that extreme waves can occur in three regions of the cyclones 1 behind the cold front 2 along the warm front and 3 ahead of the cold front the first pattern is widely reported in the literature while the others are unexplored in the region and are first reported in this paper it was also shown that the anticyclone position relative to the cyclone center plays an important role in the extreme waves in two ways 1 due to the increase of horizontal pressure gradient and consequently surface wind speed and 2 affecting the cyclone displacement speed which determines the fetch positioning and the wave generation process the novel features identified show that slow cyclones tend to promote longer events of extreme waves with impact on larger areas keywords extreme waves cyclone generated waves extratropical cyclones south atlantic ocean wave hindcasts 1 introduction extreme waves are usually associated with high risks to ships offshore structures and potential loss of human life the ocean areas along the southwestern and southern brazil have important ship routes ports and intense oil and gas industry therefore the knowledge of extreme wave climate and its spatial distribution is essential for operational forecasting metocean design criteria route planning among other activities associated with offshore industry the concern about extreme waves generated by cyclonic winds is large since they are related to the largest errors in wave simulations in deep water campos et al 2018 2020 babanin et al 2019 the release of new satellite products and data assimilation methods as well as better numerical models lead to recent progresses in wave forecasting and hindcasting however such improvements inevitably depend on the understanding of the atmospheric conditions responsible for the wave generation processes this paper aims to study the development of cyclone generated waves in the south and southeastern brazil through the characterization of atmospheric conditions along the south atlantic ocean a spatial approach to the selection of extreme events is applied to better analyze the influence of the synoptic pattern and its wind wave response several studies have contributed to the knowledge of wave climate in the western portion of the south atlantic ocean e g innocentini and caetano neto 1996 alves and melo 2001 campos et al 2012 dragani et al 2013 godoi et al 2014 romeu et al 2015 campos et al 2019 the seasonal oscillation of the south atlantic subtropical high sash plays an important role in the atmospheric circulation in the region together with the southward extratropical cyclones that affect particularly the south and southeastern extent of the brazilian coast the winter and fall present large values of wave height due to the large occurrence of cyclonic systems and the associated cold fronts pianca et al 2010 pianca et al 2010 found maximum hs values of 7 3 m in southern brazil with wave direction predominantly from south the most extreme waves in the region are related to extratropical cyclones over the south atlantic e g innocentini and caetano neto 1996 rocha et al 2003 dragani et al 2013 campos et al 2012 2018 rocha et al 2003 analyzed six cyclones associated with high sea waves along the brazilian coast in 1999 all cases were linked to cyclones originated around 30 s and 35 s influenced by a west southwestward anticyclone which intensifies the winds in the western sector of the cyclones this synoptic configuration is also reported by dragani et al 2013 who analyze the conditions of extreme wave events in the mouth of la plata river in 14 years the strong and persistent southeasterly winds over the continental shelf promote very energetic waves along south america from uruguay to central brazilian coast innocentini and caetano neto 1996 dragani et al 2013 romeu et al 2015 studied the wave climate in south of brazil by decomposing sea state in the primary and secondary wave systems using a cluster analysis they found six typical scenarios which include young swells from south and east mature swells from southeast and wind seas from east west and south romeu et al 2015 identified that the most energetic wave systems from south and southwest are mainly caused by extratropical cyclones that develop at the uruguayan and argentinean coasts more recently campos et al 2018 analyzed the 47 most extreme events between 2002 and 2009 detected by three offshore buoys in brazil using composites they found that extremes wave events are associated with cyclones generated around 40 s with southeastward displacement the relation between atmospheric pattern and wave climate are investigated in several studies mainly in northern hemisphere e g hanafin et al 2012 ponce de león and guedes soares 2014 2015 camus et al 2014 rueda et al 2016 bernardino and guedes soares 2016 bell et al 2017 kita et al 2018 de leo et al 2019 ponce de león and bettencourt 2019 camus et al 2014 developed a statistical downscaling framework to study wave climate based on weather types produced by the clustering of sea level pressure field however the statistical model presents failures when applied to non homogeneous data rueda et al 2019 which is the case of reanalysis products in the southern hemisphere as reported by stopa and cheung 2014 chawla et al 2013 and rascle and ardhuin 2013 the use of k mean clustering was also adopted by solari and alonso 2017 to a weather pattern classification method to extreme wave analysis an automatic classification of atmospheric conditions leading extreme waves are of great value but require a previous step in the recognition of existing synoptic patterns in order to set up the number of clusters used e g de leo et al 2019 moreover despite the importance of extratropical cyclones in extreme wave generation the knowledge of wave field evolution and synoptic features is still limited hanafin et al 2012 found a relation between the cyclone displacement speed and the wave group speed bell et al 2017 studied the role of cyclone relative air flows i e warm and cold conveyor belts in extreme waves in the northern sea kita et al 2018 investigated the development of ocean waves under explosive cyclone conditions in the northwestern pacific between 1994 and 2014 these studies addressed key features of extreme wave generation associated with cyclonic features that will be explored in this paper focused on the south atlantic ocean the main goal of the present work is to analyze the atmospheric patterns that lead to the development of cyclone generated extreme waves in the south and southeastern brazil independent extreme wave events are extracted from 6 years of reanalysis data and crossed with cyclone tracks information using an objective automated method the atmospheric conditions associated with the 10 most severe wave events are analyzed together with the spatial distribution of hs within the cyclone structure to obtain patterns of cyclone wave generation and its association with cyclone characteristics and lifecycle the dataset is described in section 2 1 section 2 2 is dedicated to the cyclone identification section 2 3 presents the selection of extreme wave events linked to the cyclones section 3 is dedicated to the analysis of the extreme events identified by the method and section 4 is focused on the atmospheric conditions that lead to the most extreme cases the final discussions are included in section 5 followed by the conclusions in section 6 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets the wave fields were obtained from the hindcast produced by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep derived from the wave model wavewatch iii tolman et al 2009 forced by the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis winds cfsr saha et al 2010 the wave hindcast has 3 h and 0 5 of time and space resolution respectively the parameter significant wave height hs is selected as it integrates the total energy of the spectrum in order to exclude shallow and intermediate water waves only grid points with a depth greater than 610 m have been selected fig 1 a limit that is obtained from the linear wave theory considering the lowest frequency defined by the wave model described as 0 035 s 1 by chawla et al 2011 the wave hindcast has been evaluated by chawla et al 2013 using altimeter and buoy data who found a general good performance in offshore locations nevertheless they reported an underestimation of hs in the southern hemisphere due to the underestimation of wind intensity particularly in the early part of the database prior to 1994 moreover stopa and cheung 2014 showed that cfsr has more seasonal variations in the waves and better agreement with buoy measurements than other reanalysis the atmospheric fields were also provided by ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr where the variables are available in 27 pressure levels and 0 5 0 5 horizontal resolution grid while the surface variables are in a gaussian t382 grid cfsr is part of the latest set of reanalysis which presented a significant improvement in atmospheric features representation due to the new data assimilation techniques and sources of observational data e g saha et al 2010 hodges et al 2011 stopa and cheung 2014 moreover cfsr shows a better performance in representing extreme winds and waves under intense extratropical events as described by stopa and cheung 2014 and campos and guedes soares 2016a b the domain has been selected based on the regional frequency analysis of campos et al 2019 who identified statistically homogeneous regions and defined the most severe locations in terms of hs and extreme quantiles in brazil fig 1 shows the area and the exact grid points selected for the analyses of the next sections the methodology joins automatic cyclone tracking with visual inspection of the meteorological events case by case for the period from 1999 to 2004 2 2 cyclone identification and tracking cyclones were automatically identified based on the relative vorticity calculated in spherical coordinates from the zonal and meridional wind components at 850 hpa performed by the track program hodges 1994 1995 the use of vorticity allows the detection of weak and fast moving systems as well as early stage cyclones sinclair 1994 these characteristics are important to wave generation because cyclones with a weak signal in the sea level pressure field may also generate moderate to strong winds sinclair 1994 highlighted the benefits of using vorticity to cyclones identification particularly in mid latitudes where strong pressure gradient may mask weak cyclonic systems and avoid their detection in the sea level pressure field as long as the focus of this work is cyclonic synoptic scale atmospheric system a spectral filter is applied in the vorticity before the identification and tracking procedure the filter removes the large scale atmospheric waves n 5 and small spatial scales n 42 from the relative vorticity field where the zonal wavenumber n corresponds to the number of wavelengths fitting within a full circumference around the globe at a given latitude i e the wavelength l 2πrsin ϕ n where r is earth s radius and ϕ is latitude cyclones are identified by local minima search in the relative vorticity field with the threshold of 1 0 10 5 s 1 as long as in the southern hemisphere negative vorticity correspond to cyclonic circulation the identification of the cyclone features is performed in a polar stereographic projection to avoid latitudinal bias sinclair 1997 to produce smoother tracks the positions are refined by determining the off grid locations using b spline interpolation and steepest descent minimization the tracking is performed after all cyclonic features are identified in all data frames time steps first a set of tracks is made by linking the detected features points using the nearest neighbor method then the tracks are refined by minimizing a cost function for the tracking smoothness which operates both forwards and backward in time the track smoothness depends on adaptive constraints which define the maximum displacement and displacement angle in a time step hodges 1999 the constraints applied are the same used by gramcianinov et al 2019 who performed several tests to obtain a configuration that represents cyclones in the atlantic ocean particularly near south america gramcianinov et al 2019 evaluated the tracking method and their applied constraints by comparing the automatic tracking to manual analysis using synoptic charts from the brazilian navy including the summer djf and winter jja of 2005 and found 89 of correspondence between subjective and objective tracking the relative vorticity threshold to the feature identification and wavenumbers used to the spectral filtering in this work are in agreement with the extratropical cyclonic diagnostics method developed by hoskins and hodges 2002 and widely used in scientific community e g hoskins and hodges 2005 dacre and grey 2013 gramcianinov et al 2019 more details about the track algorithm filtering processes and adaptive constraints can be found in hodges 1994 1995 1996 1999 anderson et al 2003 hodges and hoskins 2002 2005 and gramcianinov et al 2019 after the identification and tracking processes only systems that last longer than 12 h and have displacement from start to end greater than 500 km are considered for further analyses these criteria avoid thermal lows and stationary systems with minor relevance to the analyses but still capturing cyclonic winds essential to extreme waves it is important to note that the duration and displacement criteria adopted are more generalist than 24 h or 48 h and 1000 km used in the above mentioned literature the change in the selection criteria were made after the evaluation of the method applied in this paper the use of 12 h allows the identification of some troughs i e cyclonic wind circulation that are associated with extreme events but would be neglected by the 24 h our 48 h criteria the trough still generates cyclonic winds although this is not enough to classify it as a developing cyclone the decision to include troughs were done after some tests indicating that such atmospheric systems are important to extreme wave generation in the study region hence the criteria established in this work allow the detection of cyclonic systems important to extreme wave events in the region the track program provides a list containing the track for each identified cyclone with longitude and latitude in each time step of its lifecycle the track positional information was used to the selection of the cyclones associated with extreme waves described in the next section 2 3 selection of cyclone generated waves in this work extreme waves are defined as independent events of hs that exceed the 95th percentile hs95 hereafter related to the empiric probability distribution of each grid point of the domain fig 1 thus each grid point has its own threshold that varies with location in addition the independency assumes that only one value of hs is selected per storm or event per grid point following the methodology presented in fig 2 and based on campos et al 2019 which is divided in three steps 1 an autocorrelation function of hs for each grid point defines a window size for the statistical independency of events the first minimum of the second derivative of the autocorrelation function was used as a criteria to find the minimum value from which the associated time interval in hours is selected 2 the maximum of hs within the running window with size defined in the first step is calculated a process that is repeated for each grid point independently 3 the empiric probability function of independent events of hs is built and the 95th percentile is selected as the extreme value threshold the described methodology allows an automation of the process and facilitates the calculation for all grid points fig 3 shows the hs95 of independent events and the window size obtained for each grid point the choice of using the first minimum of the second derivative and not simply the first minimum of the autocorrelation function was based on several tests the second option leads to large values of window size beyond one week that do not correspond to what is expected in the region according to the previous studies the selection of independent extreme events so far has considered the analysis of each grid point separately the definition of extreme wave event and the association with cyclones is illustrated in fig 4 to extend the concept of extreme waves to a spatial approach two additional criteria have been imposed the extreme event of hs must exist in two or more neighboring points at the same time step fig 4a the extreme must exist for at least 12 h fig 4b the minimum duration of the extreme wave event has been added to exclude small and short events that are irrelevant to the analyses and do not jeopardize marine safety and offshore operations finally the cyclone tracks were assigned to each extreme wave event where the link between cyclones and waves was made by proximity using the first time step of each extreme wave event the algorithm searches the nearest cyclone within a radius of 1500 km fig 4c all points of the extreme event hs above the threshold and the location of the center of the cyclone minimum vorticity at 850 hpa are used for the distance calculation if a cyclone within 1500 km of any extreme hs point of the event at its start time is found the cyclone is then assigned to the event otherwise the event is classified as not associated with a cyclone the concept of the algorithm is summarized in fig 4c the use of distance in kilometers instead of degrees avoids the distortion of the sphere projection and allows an equal comparison between distances in all latitudes and longitudes considering the size of a baroclinic wave in middle latitudes 2000 3000 km the distance of 1500 km is enough to capture the maximum winds without the interference of other synoptic systems besides the automatic algorithm a visual inspection was performed to confirm the success of the methodology in six years 1999 2004 of analysis and considering the whole domain the method detected a total of 91 extreme events of hs from which only 4 are not associated with a cyclone and or cyclonic winds these non cyclonic events were confirmed to be related with anticyclones it is important to highlight that this result is sensible to some criteria and threshold used in the method such as the cyclone displacement and duration criteria and the extreme wave threshold changes in these parameters could increase or decrease the percentage of extreme wave events not associated with cyclones however the focus of the present work is to analyze the most extreme events and events associated with cyclonic winds which justify the choice described in section 2 2 and 2 3 3 description and overview of the extreme events a total of 87 extreme wave events are associated with cyclones between 1999 and 2004 table 1 shows the number of events mean and standard deviation by year and season most of the events occur in the winter 33 followed by the spring and fall with the same amount 23 and very few events in the summer 8 the higher frequency of events in the winter followed by fall and spring are in agreement with previous studies of parente and souza 1989 parente et al 2001 pinho 2003 and campos et al 2012 however campos et al 2012 have found more extreme events in the fall than in the spring considering both frequency and intensity the winter is the most important season summer is the season that mostly diverges from others and despite the low frequency a few rare events in the summer can have mean hs with values above the other seasons this indicates that the summer may not be excluded from the period of extreme wave events which is confirmed by the existence of summer cases in extremes ranked by melo et al 2010 and dragani et al 2013 however the small amount of events in this season 8 turns difficult the comparison of its mean intensity with the others seasons due to low statistical significance and high standard deviation the seasonal distribution of events may change depending on the year considering the inter annual variability the year of 2000 for example presented a large number of extreme events 16 followed by 2001 15 however the former presented more events during the winter while the last had more events occurring in the spring and fall in 1999 there were fewer events 12 but they were more equally distributed between seasons the inter annual variability is possibly related to the influence of enso and sam in the south atlantic storm track e g reboita et al 2015 but a longer reanalysis period with more years is needed to properly identify inter annual effects on extreme waves which is out of the scope of this study table 2 summarizes the most relevant results presenting the 10 most intense events according to maximum hs of each case the total points are the sum of grid points above hs95 during the event i e it quantifies the area affected by the event the duration is computed by the time in which the envelope of grid points above the hs95 threshold exist within the domain and the mean hs is calculated only considering these points of extreme the most extreme case of table 2 with maximum hs within the storm equal to 10 11 m has also the longest duration and the largest spatial coverage such combination however is not a requirement for extreme waves in the area the second and third most extreme events had shorter durations and smaller extension but still generated waves of 10 03 and 9 42 m of hs respectively table 2 also shows the maximum 10 m wind speed and minimum sea level pressure mslp within 6 and 5 radius from the cyclone center as computed by bengtsson et al 2009 as long as the vorticity field is smoothed during the tracking method the surface wind speed and mslp are good measurements of cyclone intensity e g bengtsson et al 2009 hodges et al 2011 the maximum surface wind speed in the cyclone fetches is around 30 m s the most intense winds of 34 56 m s is associated with the 8th most extreme wave event probably due to the shorter persistence of surface winds and with a smaller fetch it recalls the well known combination of wind speed duration and fetch described by the joint north sea wave project jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 the displacement speed of the cyclone during the extreme event provides additional information to better understand the propagation of fetch and the severity of events according to table 2 low propagation speeds are in general associated with higher values of hs fig 5 shows the density of the 87 cyclone tracks associated with extreme waves where one can observe cyclogenesis and propagation of the most important cyclones affecting the wave heights most cyclones present genesis over land between 25 s and 35 s in the region called by gramcianinov et al 2019 as la plata this cyclogenesis region is usually more active during austral winter and fall e g gan e rao 1991 hoskins and hodges 2005 which is confirmed to affect the extreme waves by campos et al 2018 note that table 2 shows the most extreme event occurred at the end of may despite the spiral poleward pattern of the storm track reported by previous work e g hoskins and hodges 2005 the track of associated cyclones of fig 5 shows a more west east orientation within western portion of south atlantic ocean machado et al 2010 shows a similar pattern studying 40 extreme wave events along the southern brazilian coast hs 6 m they found that 80 5 of the events are associated with cyclones generated nearby uruguay and 53 7 present a west east displacement which is very similar to the present findings therefore the operational monitoring of such area shaded in red in fig 5 is extremely important to improve simulations and forecasts of extreme waves in brazil 4 atmospheric condition and case studies fig 5 and table 2 describe the common features of cyclones that generated the most extreme waves in brazil it is relevant to analyze the particular features of each event since different combinations of wind speed fetch and duration can lead to the same value of extreme hs in order to avoid repetitive description and long explanation the first two cases from table 2 are analyzed in detail which were found to be the most relevant among the group of events besides the first two cases are the most intense between the 87 selected events they present a distinct extreme wave pattern from each other which leads to extreme hs in distinct sectors of the cyclone these differences are explored in the first two cases and the others are briefly commented and compared at the end of this section as long as they follow the first and second patterns additional cases are analyzed in section 4 3 to enrich the final discussion and to incorporate more events 4 1 case 1 may 23rd 2003 the top event of table 2 has the highest hs max 10 11 m as well as the largest extension i e the number of grid points above the extreme threshold and the longest duration lasting approximately four days the effect of the cyclone associated with this offshore event was reported by melo et al 2010 and machado et al 2010 who studied extreme coastal sea state conditions in the southern brazil melo et al 2010 reported the extreme hs event on may 25th reaching 8 79 m at rio grande continental shelf at 32 9 s 50 8 w fig 6 presents the synoptic conditions during the event and its evolution the cyclone is generated on may 22nd at 06 utc in northern argentina and moves eastward during the first 6 h the warm advection prevails within the cyclone promoting strong northwesterly winds in addition an extratropical anticyclone is located southward of the center of the cyclone increasing the gradient pressure in this quadrant of the cyclonic system the extreme hs event starts on may 23rd at 00 utc when the cold sector of the cyclone is still evolving over the continent the extreme waves occur along the warm front where the pressure gradient is large due to the southeastward anticyclone and the maximum winds reached 29 6 m s following the intensification of the cyclonic circulation to the south of the surface low the number of points with extreme hs growths in a clockwise pattern the maximum values of hs occur at 18 utc but the event remains under development particularly behind the cold front where the south southwesterly winds prevail the cyclone elongates in the meridional axis during the evolution and displacement eastward due to its multicore feature and the presence of the anticyclone this feature is also verified in the synoptic analysis from melo et al 2010 after may 25th part of the grid points with extreme waves stop following the cyclonic circulation and begin to propagate along the coast the separation of the extreme wave package is associated with the development of mature swell with faster group velocity and in addition it is seems to be associated with the development of a secondary convergence zone as a secondary cold front this is possible to see in fig 7 a and b through the vertical velocity at 500 hpa relative humidity at 700 hpa temperature advection and winds at 925 hpa the primary cold front is reaching 20 s and the black arrows in fig 7 highlights the position of the secondary front at 35 s the association of high relative humidity and upward motion indicate a signal of a front within the cyclone that is not easily noticed by using standard surface wind plots fig 8 shows the evolution of some cyclone characteristics during the same event the maximum values of hs occur 6 h after the maximum 10 m wind speed during the cyclone intensification stage related to the mslp it is possible to see that in the intensification stage the displacement speed of the cyclone is reduced at the bottom plot of fig 8 hence the combination of strong winds with low propagation speed of the cyclone created a condition for a rapid increase of hs during the first half of the cyclone life cycle the mean displacement speed of cyclones generated at this latitude according to previous studies is 12 6 3 8 m s gramcianinov et al 2019 while this case presented a mean speed of 6 5 m s which confirms the relative low speed of cyclone displacement 4 2 case 2 february 1st 2002 the second most extreme event was also associated with cyclogenesis over the continent around 30 s occurred on january 31st at 00 utc this event is one of the rare extreme waves that occurs in the summer and is also listed in the ranking of melo et al 2010 who reported a hs maximum of 7 50 m on february 2nd at rio grande continental shelf at 32 9 s 50 8 w on february 1st at 00 utc the cyclone moved eastward to the ocean and the southwesterly winds of its cold sector south of the center of the cyclone are placed with direction parallel to the shore different from case 1 there is no anticyclone located southeast of the cyclone during its early stages to promote significant shape deformation thus allowing the development of a large fetch along the coast where the extreme hs values took place at 12utc fig 9 a nevertheless the wind in the cold sector is later intensified by an extratropical anticyclone developed southwestward of the cyclone center that supports the persistence of the fetch fig 9b and c the extreme area seems to detach from the center cyclone after february 2nd at 06 utc fig 9d and once again the swell propagates out of the generation zone fig 9f due to the position close to the coast the wave group did not propagate for more than 12 h reaching the region offshore santa catarina state fig 9f and southeastern coast of brazil fig 10 shows the peak of hs with the same delay of 6 h compared to the peak of wind speed 30 51 m s similar to case 1 the rapid decrease of wind speeds lead to the decrease of wave heights and different from case 1 the extreme conditions occurred close to the minimum mean sea level pressure at the center of the cyclone when it start the decaying stage the short duration and small extension of this event when compared with case 1 can be addressed to the higher displacement speed which was 8 34 m s during the extreme wave event fig 10 the increase of the displacement speed may be also related to the interruption of the intensification of the cyclone as long as the slow displacement allows a better interaction with the genesis environment along southeastern south atlantic coast e g gramcianinov et al 2019 4 3 additional comments about other events cases 3 to 10 from table 2 follow the patterns described in cases 1 or 2 cases 3 to 5 7 and 8 present extreme hs in the cold sector of the cyclone with atmospheric conditions similar to case 2 cases 6 and 10 present extreme wave distribution similar to case 1 within the warm sector of the cyclone they are not shown in detail to avoid repetition but some important atmospheric features are highlighted to support the extreme wave pattern presented in sections 4 1 and 4 2 case 3 on december 8th 2003 at 12 utc was similar to the second case the extreme values appear behind the cold front in a region of southwesterly winds parallel to the coast this cyclone moved faster than one in case 2 during the extreme wave event 18 34 m s the south atlantic anticyclone located northeastward of the cyclone seems to modify the propagation to southward direction out of the area of study starting on october 21st 2002 at 12utc case 4 also presented the extreme hs pattern similar to the cases 2 and 3 however when compared to the case 3 this extreme wave event presents a longer duration and larger extension there is an important extratropical anticyclonic circulation over the continent west of the cyclone that elongates the fetch with a large area of intense winds that allows a more efficient propagation of extreme waves northeastward fig 11 the energetic swell generated by events like this case tends to affect lower latitudes depending on the position of the cyclone case 5 occurred on april 17th 1999 at 00 utc and presented a large extent and long duration affecting all regions defined by campos et al 2019 the extreme hs pattern was the same described in cases 2 3 and 4 in the cold sector of the cyclone the extratropical cyclone associated with this event presents a slow displacement speed 5 93 m s during the peak of extreme waves allowing a quasi stationary southwesterly wind fetch there is no intense extratropical anticyclone at the continent to support the pressure gradients such as reported in case 4 however the sash position eastward of the cyclone seems to block the cyclone propagation to the east justifying its low displacement speed fig 12 note the left half of the plots of fig 12 showing a large coverage of sash with 1025 and 1030 hpa that certainly affected the development and track of the aforementioned cyclone case 6 started on august 9th 2002 at 12 utc and presented an extreme hs pattern similar to case 1 this event has the extreme waves behind the cold front as usual but also along the warm front within the warm sector of the cyclone fig 13 it is notable the presence of an anticyclone east of cyclone center as observed in case 1 this extreme wave event presents two hs max peaks one associated with the northeasterly winds along the warm front which coincides with the maximum surface winds 31 65 m s and the large one during the decay stage of the cyclone associated with the southwesterly winds in the cold sector case 9 is the only event forced by a cyclone generated at much southerly latitude at the argentinean coast 45 s 50 s with typical cyclogenesis patterns described by gan and rao 1991 and hoskins and hodges 2005 the extratropical cyclone presents a northward trajectory at the beginning with its center reaching almost 40 s before changing track to the southeast fig 14 the large size of the systems is resulted from the combination of the surface cyclone with the middle level trough which promotes a large fetch with southwesterly winds while it moves northeastward fig 14b however the extreme occurs only in the southern part of the domain and does not last long since the cyclone moves southeastward similar to cases 1 and 6 fig 15 shows case 10 which also presents extreme waves at the warm side of the cyclone this case differentiates from others because the extreme occurs along the cold front at the convergence line of the winds the position of the sash increases the intensity of the northwesterly wind ahead of the cold front the strong warm advection suggests that this flow within the cyclone is associated with the warm conveyor belt which transports heat and moisture and supports the intensification of the system however further analysis may be necessary to confirm this feature finally the extreme hs pattern presented in cases 7 and 8 were in the cold sector of the extratropical cyclone southwest of the cold front and associated with a similar atmospheric conditions observed in cases 2 to 5 the anticyclonic circulation located westward of the cyclone center is present in all cases intensifying the southerly winds along the coast 5 discussion although the most extreme waves in the south atlantic ocean offshore south america have common features in terms of the generation process they present specific meteorological configurations important to be studied the synoptic analysis of the events initially confirmed some patterns already observed in the literature but it also reveals new features about the spatial distribution of the extreme events within the cyclones using the cases selected in this work it is possible to confirm that extreme waves in the western portion of the south atlantic and southern brazil are related to cyclones generated between 30 s and 35 s over the continent this is in agreement with previous studies such as rocha et al 2003 melo et al 2010 machado et al 2010 and campos et al 2018 that associated cyclones generated in this region to extreme wave events in the brazilian coast moreover some additional atmospheric influences have been found such as the presence of an extratropical transient anticyclone west southwest of the cyclone center strengthening the wind in the cold sector of the system which has been initially described by rocha et al 2003 and dragani et al 2013 this synoptic configuration associated with the position of the cyclone promotes persistent southwesterly winds along the coast considered the main driver of extreme waves in the region such atmospheric pattern is the most important for the coastal extreme wave events however two more patterns were found ahead of the cyclone s fronts that may be important to offshore structure and ship routes the displacement speed of the cyclone plays an important role controlling the wave development in the generation process the average displacement speed of cyclones in the region is 12 m s gramcianinov et al 2019 while the most extreme waves were associated with cyclones with displacement speed around 6 m s slow moving cyclones tend to promote a dynamic fetch that provided energy during a longer time to the wave growth while cyclones with higher displacement speeds inevitably bounds the wave generation because the strongest winds are constantly transferring momentum to new upcoming areas propagating eastward or southeastward without sufficient persistence over the same location that is necessary to generate energetic wave packages moreover cyclones with lower displacement speeds presented longer durations and the extremes waves tend to cover larger areas that can reach northern latitudes with a much broader impact in contrast fast cyclones seem to promote more local extremes with limited effect on neighboring areas hence slow moving cyclones are the most dangerous and interfere on weather downtime and increase risks associated with offshore and coastal structures since the wave energy is proportional to hs squared and longer events hardly impact on fatigue in addition ship routes are more intensively affected by such events due to the larger coverage of the extreme waves which balances risks versus fuel consumption and long journeys as discussed by vettor and guedes soares 2016 another important feature observed is the position of the anticyclones including both the south atlantic subtropical high sash and the transient anticyclone coming after the cold front west of the cyclone the climatological position of sash and the intensity and position of the transient anticyclones have a significant influence over the cyclone tracks the extreme events in summer seasons presented a southern sash that seems to push the cyclones tracks to southern latitudes cases 3 and 8 the presence of a rearward high pressure system over the continent increases the pressure gradient in the western sector of the cyclones promoting more intense winds and consequently higher hs therefore the positioning and intensification of these three elements sash cyclone and transient anticyclone and the phase between them control the pressure gradient and drive the size persistence and intensity of the fetch which directly impact the generation of extreme waves fig 16 summarize the situations found in this work regarding the position of the anticyclone in relation to the cyclone center and the extreme wave occurrence within the extratropical cyclone indeed the most surprising synoptic configuration was the detection of extreme hs values in the warm sector ahead of the cold front and along the warm front which has not been reported in the literature for the south atlantic so far the presence of an extratropical anticyclone located southeast of the cyclone center increases the north northeasterly winds developing extreme waves along the warm front case 1 and 6 figs 1 6 7 and 13 and 16c kita et al 2018 analyzing bomb cyclones reported significant wave generation along the warm front but in its cold side the other surprising configuration was the extreme waves placed ahead of the cold front in a region of strong north northwesterly winds case 10 figs 15 and 16b this configuration shows an n s elongated anticyclone at east northeast of the cyclone center which may be associated with the migration of sash to southern latitudes actually it has been verified that this is a combination of the quasi stationary sash merged with a smaller transient anticyclone when both high pressure systems are merged and a nearby low pressure system growths into a cyclone a large fetch is developed with northwestern winds above 35 m s fig 15 therefore in the special case 10 the intense sash close to the brazilian coast reinforce the northwesterly winds along the cold front in the warm side of the cyclone in a region of strong warm advection that may suggest the influence of the warm conveyor belt to the extreme wave generation bell et al 2017 reported similar cases in the north sea of extreme wave events in the coast forced by this cyclone air flow which has now been confirmed to happen in the south atlantic ocean 6 conclusions this work combines an automated method to detect independent extreme wave events with a cyclone tracker in order to study the characteristics of the most extreme cyclone generated waves in the western portion of the south atlantic ocean with special attention to southern brazil a total of 87 extreme wave events associated with cyclones was found and investigated in the period from 1999 to 2004 the average of 14 5 1 6 extreme wave events generated by cyclones per year suggests a very intense cyclonic activity and reinforce the importance of monitoring the cyclogenesis cyclone tracks and intensity of cyclones for extreme wave analysis and forecasting in the region the characteristics of the cyclones and impact on hs have been investigated the size of the fetch and wind intensity has been confirmed as important features as expected but the displacement speed of the cyclone surprisingly became one of the most important variables to distinguish the most extreme events the most dangerous cyclones are the ones with low displacement speed associated with longer events that generate much higher hs covering a larger area the continued force to wave growth occurs when the cyclone displacement speed is moving at the same speed as the wave group velocity and this effect is reported as dynamic fetch effective fetch extended fetch or trapped fetch mostly described in tropical cyclones e g young 1988 macafee and bowyer 2005 kudryavtsev et al 2015 detailed analyses of the 10 most extreme events allow finding extreme waves in three regions of the cyclone behind the cold front most common in the cold sector of the cyclone ahead of the cold front at the convergence zone of the winds and along the warm front in the warm sector of the cyclone the first pattern occurs in most of the cases including the most extreme events and it is widely reported by previous studies fig 16a e g rocha et al 2003 melo et al 2010 machado et al 2010 a careful analysis of anticyclones around the low pressure system led to the identification of two additional patterns never described before in the south atlantic which occur in the warm sector of the cyclone in the first of them the combination of the south atlantic subtropical high sash with a transient anticyclone propagating eastwards generates a very strong high pressure system that together with the extratropical cyclone on its west side leads to a large fetch with intense north northwesterly winds and high hs with southeastward direction fig 16b in the second synoptic pattern the presence of an anticyclone placed southeastward of the cyclone center increases the north northeasterly winds promoting extreme wave along warm front fig 16c credit authorship contribution

21654,the nonlinear oscillations of the floating structures anchored by cables are studied in three dimensions the floating structure is anchored by four symmetric mooring lines and the mooring lines are fixed on the seafloor at the other ends the stiffness matrix of 3d cable element has been established and applied to analyze the dynamics of the 3d floating structures anchored by cables the complex compatibility conditions which relate the responses of the floating body and cables have been proposed the equations of motion for the mooring lines and floating body are individually formulated then they are combined as an entire system by utilizing the compatibility conditions at last the entire system is analyzed numerically with horizontal harmonic excitations applied on the floating body the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force are studied as the excitation frequency changes the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force are also investigated for varieties of cable parameters keywords nonlinear elemental stiffness matrix 3d cable element compatibility conditions 1 introduction a lot of attention has been attracted for the floating structures in civil and ocean engineering over the past few decades in order for the utilization of ocean space and exploration of marine resources some advantages of floating structures over permanent structures are that they are easy and fast to construct without destroying the eco system of marine floating structure which is anchored by cables includes floating body and several mooring lines it is one of the most popularly used offshore floating structures the mooring line is much more important for supporting the floating structure due to its nonlinear force acting on the floating body during vibration the nonlinearity of the mooring forces originates not only from the geometric nonlinearity due to the catenary profile of the cable but also from the material nonlinearity therefore the mooring lines is required to be modeled accurately and the coupled analysis between the floating body and mooring lines is necessary for studying the nonlinear characteristics of the type of structure patel and lynch 1983 garrett 2005 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2018 the nonlinear oscillations of the floating structures anchored by cables were analyzed in the past decades the linear springs jain 1980 ogawa 1984 sannasiraj et al 1998 tang et al 2011 were utilized to represent the mooring lines for holding the floating body the equations of motion for the floating body are formulated by adding the spring constants into the stiffness part the mooring cables were also modeled by using the nonlinear springs esmailzadeh and goodarzi 2001 umar and datta 2003 rosales and filipich 2006 montasir et al 2015 with the assumption of quasi static manner the nonlinear mooring force is represented as a nonlinear function of the response of floating body using the force excursion relationship and it is added to the stiffness part of the equations of the floating body although it is much more convenient to analyze the oscillations of the floating structures anchored by cables using these two methods the results obtained by modeling the mooring lines as linear or nonlinear springs are not accurate enough due to the fact that they cannot reflect the dynamics of the mooring lines hence the accurate modeling of the mooring lines is much more important for analyzing the coupled dynamic behaviors of the structure the transient motion of the submerged cables was firstly investigated by using the central finite difference method walton and polachek 1960 the approach of lumped mass was developed and popularly used for conducting the dynamic analysis of the marine cables huang 1994 vaz and patel 1995 driscoll et al 2000 buckham et al 2003 with the cables modeling by linear element and the equations establishing at each connected node the nonlinear vibrations of floating spherical buoy anchored by mooring cables was investigated zhu and yoo 2016 cables are discretized into lumped mass elements and the forces acting on the cables are obtained by using an element fixed frame the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the moored floating structures was also conducted by modeling the cable by a slender elastic rod garrett 1982 2005 tahar and kim 2008 the added mass effect of the polyester mooring lines should be taken into consideration because the density of the utilized cable material is comparable to that of fluid tahar and kim 2008 the tangent stiffness matrix of two node catenary element jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 was formulated by taking into account the effects of both self weight and pretension the 3d beam model was applied to analyze the nonlinear oscillations of the mooring cables used for floating offshore wind turbine petrone et al 2015 the coupled analysis of the floating structures and mooring system was also conducted by modeling the mooring lines as beam element kim et al 2013 in which the effect of bending and torsional stiffness of the mooring lines was ignored in the numerical study the motions of the platform are analyzed by updating the dynamic mooring forces applied on the platform the motions of the mooring lines are then studied by updating the boundary conditions therefore more computational effort is required because the equations of motion for the mooring lines and platform need to be worked out repeatedly at each time interval this paper extends the work by wang et al 2018 to three dimensional 3d system in order to reflect more dynamic behaviors of the cable moored floating structures the bending stiffness of the mooring lines is ignored in this study because the mooring lines behavior like cable and the cable element is a purely tensile element a numerical model representing a 3d nonlinear cable element is formulated based upon the extended hamilton principle pai 2007 in which the nonlinear elemental stiffness matrix rather than the tangent stiffness matrix is obtained the validation of the 3d nonlinear cable element is presented through the comparison with the existing methods o brien and francis 1964 jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 a rigid body which has six degrees of freedom was used to represent the floating body the effects of added mass and hydrodynamic drag forces for both the mooring cables and platform are taken into consideration the compatibility conditions are presented in which the responses of the floating body and cables are related at the connected location then the equations of motions for both the floating body and mooring lines are formulated as an entire system using the compatibility conditions finally the entire system is analyzed numerically with horizontal harmonic excitations applied on the platform the advantage of formulating and analyzing the entire system is that the computation efficiency is enhanced compared with the traditional method in which the equations of motion of the mooring lines and platform are solved repeatedly at each time interval the amplitudes for both the responses of the floating body and the maximum mooring force are studied for various fluid velocities and excitation frequencies the effects of some parameters such as the sag to span ratios and inclination angles of mooring lines are also investigated 2 problem description fig 1 presents a 3d floating structure anchored by cables the floating structure is simplified as a rigid cuboid box in this study the system is only subjected to harmonic excitation without considering the excitations of wind wave and earthquake etc the top end of each mooring line c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 is linked to the nodes a b c

respectively then eqs 33 and 34 can be combined together using eq 37 by taking out the redundant equations related to the motions of a b c and d from eq 33 finally the equations of motion for the

damping ratio ω 1 denotes the fundamental natural frequency of the corresponding linear system of eq 38 and ω 2 denotes one of the higher natural frequencies of the modes that significantly contribute to the dynamic response the classical fourth order runge kutta method is finally applied to solve eq 38 4 validation of cable element a suspended cable hanging between two supports at the same elevation is considered as shown in fig 12 the length between two supports is l 304 8 m the sag at the mid span is d 30 48 m the mass density young s modulus and cross sectional area of the cable are respectively ρ 8 5775 1 0 3 kg m 3 e 1 31 1 0 11 n m 2 and a 5 4825 1 0 4 m 2 the cable is subjected to a concentrated load of f 3 5586 1 0 4 n which is placed at l 1 121 92 m from the left support the horizontal and vertical displacements at the loaded point are calculated using the presented cable elements the comparisons with the existing studies o brien and francis 1964 jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 are shown in table 1 from which a good agreement is observed 5 illustrative example table 2 summarize the parameters of the 3d cable moored floating structures the drag force in the longitudinal direction of cable element is often ignored dnv 2010a therefore in this study the drag coefficient in the longitudinal direction of cable element is set to be 0 01 huang 1994 zhu and yoo 2016 the drag coefficients in the normal directions of cable element are set to be 1 dnv 2010b the fluid velocity is assumed in the x axis with amplitudes being 0 0 25 and 0 5 m s convergency analysis has been conducted that eleven cable elements are enough for discretizing each mooring line the height of the platform which is submerged undersea is obtained as h s 1 332 m by using eq 1 the added mass of the platform are then expressed as m a x 0 304 ρ π w c 2 h s m a y 0 141 ρ π w a 2 w c and m a z 0 221 ρ π w a 2 h s kennard 1967 the platform is excited by harmonic forces f x t f 1 s i n ω t and f z t f 2 s i n ω t in which the amplitudes are f 1 1 1 0 4 n and f 2 w c w a f 1 so that the resultant force is in the x 1 direction the first five natural frequencies of the corresponding linear system of eq 38 are 0 316 rad s mode mainly in z direction 0 363 rad s mode mainly in z direction 0 987 rad s mode mainly in x direction 1 250 rad s mode mainly in y direction and 2 447 rad s mode mainly in z direction therefore ω 1 is chosen as the fundamental natural frequency 0 316 rad s and ω 2 is chosen as 2 447 rad s in eq 40 fig 13 shows the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and excitation frequencies ω which ranges from 0 1 to 1 5 rad s with the increment δ ω 0 001 rad s it is observed from fig 13 that u p v p α p of the platform and maximum mooring force attain the maximum values when ω is equal to 0 982 rad s for various fluid velocities the maximum values of w p and γ p of the floating body are obtained when ω equals 0 314 rad s for various fluid velocities therefore these two frequencies are denoted as the resonant frequencies of the structure it is also seen from fig 13 that the responses and maximum mooring force decrease as the fluid velocity increases around the resonant frequencies the parametric study such as the sag to span ratio and inclination angle of cables are further presented in the following two cases 5 1 case 1 ω 0 314 rad s fig 14 presents the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and sag to span ratios of mooring lines with inclination angle being 40 from fig 14 w p and γ p of the platform increase with the sag to span ratio decreasing from 1 70 to 1 80 under the same fluid velocity then they decrease with d l further decreasing from 1 80 to 1 140 this is due to the fact that as the sag to span ratio decreases from 1 70 to 1 80 the fundamental natural frequency of the formulated linear system increases from 0 304 to 0 313 rad s which is closer to the excitation frequency ω as the sag to span ratio decreases from 1 80 to 1 140 the fundamental natural frequency of the formulated linear system increases from 0 313 to 0 317 rad s which is farther away from the excitation frequency ω hence the resonance state of the system is achieved when d l 1 80 θ 40 and ω 0 314 rad s which is necessary to be taken into consideration in the design of the structure it is also observed that u p of the platform always decreases and the maximum mooring force always increases with d l decreasing from 1 70 to 1 140 under the same fluid velocity fig 15 shows the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and inclination angles of mooring lines with sag to span ratio remaining as 1 100 according to fig 15 w p and γ p of the platform increase with the inclination angle increasing from 34 to 42 under the same fluid velocity then they decrease with the inclination angle further increasing to 48 this is because as the inclination angle increases from 34 to 42 the fundamental natural frequency of the formulated linear system decreases from 0 329 to 0 310 rad s which is closer to the excitation frequency ω as the inclination angle increases from 42 to 48 the fundamental natural frequency of the formulated linear system decreases from 0 310 to 0 284 rad s which is farther away from the excitation frequency ω it indicates that the resonance state of the system is reached when θ 42 d l 1 100 and ω 0 314 rad s which is supposed to be prevented during the design of the structure it is also observed from fig 15 that u p of the floating body always increases and the maximum mooring force always decreases with the inclination angle increasing from 34 to 48 under the same fluid velocity 5 2 case 2 ω 0 982 rad s fig 16 presents the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and sag to span ratios of cables with inclination angle being 40 in fig 16 u p and α p of the floating body increase with the sag to span ratio decreasing from 1 70 to 1 90 under the same fluid velocity then they decrease with d l further decreasing from 1 90 to 1 140 this is due to the fact that as the sag to span ratio decreases from 1 70 to 1 90 the third natural frequency of the formulated linear system increases from 0 966 to 0 984 rad s which is closer to the excitation frequency ω as the sag to span ratio decreases from 1 90 to 1 140 the third natural frequency of the formulated linear system increases from 0 984 to 0 987 rad s which is farther away from the excitation frequency ω hence the resonance state of the system is achieved when d l 1 90 θ 40 and ω 0 982 rad s which is required to be taken into consideration for the design of the structure it is also observed from fig 16 that w p of the floating body always decreases and the maximum mooring force always increases with d l decreasing from 1 70 to 1 140 under the same fluid velocity fig 17 shows the amplitudes for both the responses of the floating body and the maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and inclination angles of cables with initial sag to span ratio remaining as 1 100 according to fig 17 u p and α p of the floating body increase with the inclination angle increasing from 34 to 40 under the same fluid velocity then they decrease with the inclination angle further increasing to 48 this is because as the inclination angle increases from 34 to 40 the third natural frequency of the formulated linear system decreases from 1 037 to 0 987 rad s which is closer to the excitation frequency ω as the inclination angle increases from 40 to 48 the third natural frequency of the formulated linear system decreases from 0 987 to 0 869 rad s which is farther away from the excitation frequency ω it indicates that the resonance state of the system is reached when θ 40 d l 1 100 and ω 0 982 rad s which is supposed to be prevented during the design of the structure it is also observed from fig 17 that the inclination angle does not influence w p of the platform much and the maximum mooring force always decreases with the inclination angle increasing from 34 to 48 under the same fluid velocity 6 conclusions in this paper the extended hamilton principle is adopted to derive the nonlinear elemental stiffness matrix of 3d cable the motion equations of the mooring cables are formulated by using the 3d cable element and the platform is modeled as rigid body the nonlinear hydrodynamic drag forces and added mass of both the mooring lines and floating body are included in formulating the equations of motion then the compatibility conditions which relate the responses of the platform and cables are introduced to formulate the nonlinear equations of motion for both the mooring lines and platform as an entire system the nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the 3d cable moored floating structures are analyzed in detail by numerically solving the equations of motion for the entire system the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force in steady state are investigated with various fluid velocities and excitation frequencies the resonant behaviors of the nonlinear system can be observed which can be utilized as design reference for the structure from the numerical results it is also concluded that changes of the sag to span ratio and inclination angle of mooring lines lead to significant changes in the responses of the moored floating structure and the maximum mooring force in the cable credit

are fixed on the seafloor at the other ends the stiffness matrix of 3d cable element has been established and applied to analyze the dynamics of the 3d floating structures anchored by cables the complex compatibility conditions which relate the responses of the floating body and cables have been proposed the equations of motion for the mooring lines and floating body are individually formulated then they are combined as an entire system by utilizing the compatibility conditions at last the entire system is analyzed numerically with horizontal harmonic excitations applied on the floating body the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force are studied as the excitation frequency changes the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force are also investigated for varieties of cable parameters keywords nonlinear elemental stiffness matrix 3d cable element compatibility conditions 1 introduction a lot of attention has been attracted for the floating structures in civil and ocean engineering over the past few decades in order for the utilization of ocean space and exploration of marine resources some advantages of floating structures over permanent structures are that they are easy and fast to construct without destroying the eco system of marine floating structure which is anchored by cables includes floating body and several mooring lines it is one of the most popularly used offshore floating structures the mooring line is much more important for supporting the floating structure due to its nonlinear force acting on the floating body during vibration the nonlinearity of the mooring forces originates not only from the geometric nonlinearity due to the catenary profile of the cable but also from the material nonlinearity therefore the mooring lines is required to be modeled accurately and the coupled analysis between the floating body and mooring lines is necessary for studying the nonlinear characteristics of the type of structure patel and lynch 1983 garrett 2005 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2018 the nonlinear oscillations of the floating structures anchored by cables were analyzed in the past decades the linear springs jain 1980 ogawa 1984 sannasiraj et al 1998 tang et al 2011 were utilized to represent the mooring lines for holding the floating body the equations of motion for the floating body are formulated by adding the spring constants into the stiffness part the mooring cables were also modeled by using the nonlinear springs esmailzadeh and goodarzi 2001 umar and datta 2003 rosales and filipich 2006 montasir et al 2015 with the assumption of quasi static manner the nonlinear mooring force is represented as a nonlinear function of the response of floating body using the force excursion relationship and it is added to the stiffness part of the equations of the floating body although it is much more convenient to analyze the oscillations of the floating structures anchored by cables using these two methods the results obtained by modeling the mooring lines as linear or nonlinear springs are not accurate enough due to the fact that they cannot reflect the dynamics of the mooring lines hence the accurate modeling of the mooring lines is much more important for analyzing the coupled dynamic behaviors of the structure the transient motion of the submerged cables was firstly investigated by using the central finite difference method walton and polachek 1960 the approach of lumped mass was developed and popularly used for conducting the dynamic analysis of the marine cables huang 1994 vaz and patel 1995 driscoll et al 2000 buckham et al 2003 with the cables modeling by linear element and the equations establishing at each connected node the nonlinear vibrations of floating spherical buoy anchored by mooring cables was investigated zhu and yoo 2016 cables are discretized into lumped mass elements and the forces acting on the cables are obtained by using an element fixed frame the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the moored floating structures was also conducted by modeling the cable by a slender elastic rod garrett 1982 2005 tahar and kim 2008 the added mass effect of the polyester mooring lines should be taken into consideration because the density of the utilized cable material is comparable to that of fluid tahar and kim 2008 the tangent stiffness matrix of two node catenary element jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 was formulated by taking into account the effects of both self weight and pretension the 3d beam model was applied to analyze the nonlinear oscillations of the mooring cables used for floating offshore wind turbine petrone et al 2015 the coupled analysis of the floating structures and mooring system was also conducted by modeling the mooring lines as beam element kim et al 2013 in which the effect of bending and torsional stiffness of the mooring lines was ignored in the numerical study the motions of the platform are analyzed by updating the dynamic mooring forces applied on the platform the motions of the mooring lines are then studied by updating the boundary conditions therefore more computational effort is required because the equations of motion for the mooring lines and platform need to be worked out repeatedly at each time interval this paper extends the work by wang et al 2018 to three dimensional 3d system in order to reflect more dynamic behaviors of the cable moored floating structures the bending stiffness of the mooring lines is ignored in this study because the mooring lines behavior like cable and the cable element is a purely tensile element a numerical model representing a 3d nonlinear cable element is formulated based upon the extended hamilton principle pai 2007 in which the nonlinear elemental stiffness matrix rather than the tangent stiffness matrix is obtained the validation of the 3d nonlinear cable element is presented through the comparison with the existing methods o brien and francis 1964 jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 a rigid body which has six degrees of freedom was used to represent the floating body the effects of added mass and hydrodynamic drag forces for both the mooring cables and platform are taken into consideration the compatibility conditions are presented in which the responses of the floating body and cables are related at the connected location then the equations of motions for both the floating body and mooring lines are formulated as an entire system using the compatibility conditions finally the entire system is analyzed numerically with horizontal harmonic excitations applied on the platform the advantage of formulating and analyzing the entire system is that the computation efficiency is enhanced compared with the traditional method in which the equations of motion of the mooring lines and platform are solved repeatedly at each time interval the amplitudes for both the responses of the floating body and the maximum mooring force are studied for various fluid velocities and excitation frequencies the effects of some parameters such as the sag to span ratios and inclination angles of mooring lines are also investigated 2 problem description fig 1 presents a 3d floating structure anchored by cables the floating structure is simplified as a rigid cuboid box in this study the

respectively ρ 8 5775 1 0 3 kg m 3 e 1 31 1 0 11 n m 2 and a 5 4825 1 0 4 m 2 the cable is subjected to a concentrated load of f 3 5586 1 0 4 n which is placed at l 1 121 92 m from the left support the horizontal and vertical displacements at the loaded point are calculated using the presented cable elements the comparisons with the existing studies o brien and francis 1964 jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 are shown in table 1 from which a good agreement is observed 5 illustrative example table 2 summarize the parameters of the 3d cable moored floating structures the drag force in the longitudinal direction of cable element is often ignored dnv 2010a therefore in this study the drag coefficient in the longitudinal direction of cable element is set to be 0 01 huang 1994 zhu and yoo 2016 the drag coefficients in the normal directions of cable element are set to be 1 dnv 2010b the fluid velocity is assumed in the x axis with amplitudes being 0 0 25 and 0 5 m s convergency analysis has been conducted that eleven cable elements are enough for discretizing each mooring line the height of the platform which is submerged undersea is obtained as h s 1 332 m by using eq 1 the added mass of the platform are then expressed as m a x 0 304 ρ π w c 2 h s m a y 0 141 ρ π w a 2 w c and m a z 0 221 ρ π w a 2 h s kennard 1967 the platform is excited by harmonic forces f x t f 1 s i n ω t and f z t f 2 s i n ω t in which the amplitudes are f 1 1 1 0 4 n and f 2 w c w a f 1 so that the resultant force is in the x 1 direction the first five natural frequencies of the corresponding linear system of eq 38 are 0 316 rad s mode mainly in z direction 0 363 rad s mode mainly in z direction 0 987 rad s mode mainly in x direction 1 250 rad s mode mainly in y direction and 2 447 rad s mode mainly in z direction therefore ω 1 is chosen as the fundamental natural frequency 0 316 rad s and ω 2 is chosen as 2 447 rad s in eq 40 fig 13 shows the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and excitation frequencies ω which ranges from 0 1 to 1 5 rad s with the increment δ ω 0 001 rad s it is observed from fig 13 that u p v p α p of the platform and maximum mooring force attain the maximum values when ω is equal to 0 982 rad s for various fluid velocities the maximum values of w p and γ p of the floating body are obtained when ω equals 0 314 rad s for various fluid velocities therefore these two frequencies are denoted as the resonant frequencies of the structure it is also seen from fig 13 that the responses and maximum mooring force decrease as the fluid velocity increases around the resonant frequencies the parametric study such as the sag to span ratio and inclination angle of cables are further presented in the following two cases 5 1 case 1 ω 0 314 rad s fig 14 presents the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and sag to span ratios of mooring lines with inclination angle being 40 from fig 14 w p and γ p of the platform increase with the sag to span ratio decreasing from 1 70 to 1 80 under the same fluid velocity then they decrease with d l further decreasing from 1 80 to 1 140 this is due to the fact that as the sag to span ratio decreases from 1 70 to 1 80 the fundamental natural frequency of the formulated linear system increases from 0 304 to 0 313 rad s which is closer to the excitation frequency ω as the sag to span ratio decreases from 1 80 to 1 140 the fundamental natural frequency of the formulated linear system increases from 0 313 to 0 317 rad s which is farther away from the excitation frequency ω hence the resonance state of the system is achieved when d l 1 80 θ 40 and ω 0 314 rad s which is necessary to be taken into consideration in the design of the structure it is also observed that u p of the platform always decreases and the maximum mooring force always increases with d l decreasing from 1 70 to 1 140 under the same fluid velocity fig 15 shows the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and inclination angles of mooring lines with sag to span ratio remaining as 1 100 according to fig 15 w p and γ p of the platform increase with the inclination angle increasing from 34 to 42 under the same fluid velocity then they decrease with the inclination angle further increasing to 48 this is because as the inclination angle increases from 34 to 42 the fundamental natural frequency of the formulated linear system decreases from 0 329 to 0 310 rad s which is closer to the excitation frequency ω as the inclination angle increases from 42 to 48 the fundamental natural frequency of the formulated linear system decreases from 0 310 to 0 284 rad s which is farther away from the excitation frequency ω it indicates that the resonance state of the system is reached when θ 42 d l 1 100 and ω 0 314 rad s which is supposed to be prevented during the design of the structure it is also observed from fig 15 that u p of the floating body always increases and the maximum mooring force always decreases with the inclination angle increasing from 34 to 48 under the same fluid velocity 5 2 case 2 ω 0 982 rad s fig 16 presents the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and sag to span ratios of cables with inclination angle being 40 in fig 16 u p and α p of the floating body increase with the sag to span ratio decreasing from 1 70 to 1 90 under the same fluid velocity then they decrease with d l further decreasing from 1 90 to 1 140 this is due to the fact that as the sag to span ratio decreases from 1 70 to 1 90 the third natural frequency of the formulated linear system increases from 0 966 to 0 984 rad s which is closer to the excitation frequency ω as the sag to span ratio decreases from 1 90 to 1 140 the third natural frequency of the formulated linear system increases from 0 984 to 0 987 rad s which is farther away from the excitation frequency ω hence the resonance state of the system is achieved when d l 1 90 θ 40 and ω 0 982 rad s which is required to be taken into consideration for the design of the structure it is also observed from fig 16 that w p of the floating body always decreases and the maximum mooring force always increases with d l decreasing from 1 70 to 1 140 under the same fluid velocity fig 17 shows the amplitudes for both the responses of the floating body and the maximum mooring force in steady state for various fluid velocities and inclination angles of cables with initial sag to span ratio remaining as 1 100 according to fig 17 u p and α p of the floating body increase with the inclination angle increasing from 34 to 40 under the same fluid velocity then they decrease with the inclination angle further increasing to 48 this is because as the inclination angle increases from 34 to 40 the third natural frequency of the formulated linear system decreases from 1 037 to 0 987 rad s which is closer to the excitation frequency ω as the inclination angle increases from 40 to 48 the third natural frequency of the formulated linear system decreases from 0 987 to 0 869 rad s which is farther away from the excitation frequency ω it indicates that the resonance state of the system is reached when θ 40 d l 1 100 and ω 0 982 rad s which is supposed to be prevented during the design of the structure it is also observed from fig 17 that the inclination angle does not influence w p of the platform much and the maximum mooring force always decreases with the inclination angle increasing from 34 to 48 under the same fluid velocity 6 conclusions in this paper the extended hamilton principle is adopted to derive the nonlinear elemental stiffness matrix of 3d cable the motion equations of the mooring cables are formulated by using the 3d cable element and the platform is modeled as rigid body the nonlinear hydrodynamic drag forces and added mass of both the mooring lines and floating body are included in formulating the equations of motion then the compatibility conditions which relate the responses of the platform and cables are introduced to formulate the nonlinear equations of motion for both the mooring lines and platform as an entire system the nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the 3d cable moored floating structures are analyzed in detail by numerically solving the equations of motion for the entire system the amplitudes for both the responses of the platform and the maximum mooring force in steady state are investigated with various fluid velocities and excitation frequencies the resonant behaviors of the nonlinear system can be observed which can be utilized as design reference for the structure from the numerical results it is also concluded that changes of the sag to span ratio and inclination angle of mooring lines lead to significant changes in the responses of the moored floating structure and the maximum mooring force in the cable credit
