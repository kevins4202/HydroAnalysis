22765,an experimental investigation is conducted to obtain the nominal wake of a four screw ship in a towing tank using a particle image velocimetry piv measurement system a computational study on the viscous flow fields of the ship at different scales is carried out using the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method without considering the free surface effect the scale effect for the axial nominal wake field of the inside and outside propeller discs is analyzed in detail the results show that the cfd results and piv data are in good agreement different circumferential distribution patterns of the axial nominal wake field exist between the inside and outside propeller discs especially in the zone behind the brackets the mean wake fraction of the inside propeller is generally larger than that of the outside propeller when different radii are considered for both the inside and outside propellers the mean axial wake fraction is relatively large in the inner radius area 0 3 r r 0 6 whereas it is relatively small and almost coincident in the outer radius area 0 7 r r at different scales ω x axial wake fraction decreases nonlinearly with the increase in reynolds number for

screw vessels such as two screw ships and four screw ships have been developed in recent years the wake field of such ships is quite different from that of general single screw ships in a four screw ship four propellers are distributed symmetrically by the longitudinal section in the center plane as shown in fig 1 the inside propeller is located closer to the stern whereas the outside propeller is located closer to the bow this results in a difference between the respective wake fields of the propellers which leads to load imbalance between the inside and outside propellers the nominal wake field plays an important role in propeller performance and the scale effect of the wake field leads to significant differences in the cavitation exciting force noise and propulsive performance between a model and full scale ship over the years the scale effect of the wake field has been an important issue of concern in the early stages researchers performed experiment and theoretical research primarily on single propeller ships and proposed a series of extrapolation methods to convert the nominal wake field of the model test into that of the full scale ships dyne 1974 hoekstra 1975 tanaka 1983 garcia 1989 however with the development in computer technology it is possible to employ cfd methods to simulate the wake field of a full scale ship this provides a novel means to investigate this issue choi et al 2009 2010 eca and hoekstra 1975 min and kang 2010 castro et al 2011 wang et al 2015a b studied the viscous flow field of a single screw ship using the rans method and proposed an extrapolation method to convert the model scale wake field to a full scale one gaggero et al 2017 and pereira et al 2017 compared the wake field prediction results using different turbulence models and found that the rsm turbulence model is the most accurate turbulence model for the nominal wake prediction andrea farkas et al 2018 studied the flow around a full scale ship at different draughts however all of the above mentioned studies focused on only single screw ships some other scholars performed research considering multi screw ships and vessels with appendages ok 2004 studied the scale effect of the wake field of a ship with wake equalizing ducts wed the calculation results showed that the influence of the duct on the wake field of a full scale ship is more obvious in comparison to the model one johannsen 2000 and han et al 2006 studied the scale effect of the wake field of a ship with a vortex generator their research indicated that for the model scale the vortices generated by the vortex generator are in contact with the propeller disc whereas in the full scale ship the vortices lie above the propeller disc abdel maksoud and heinke 2002 compared the model and full scale wake fields for a twin screw ship with a propeller shaft and shaft brackets the study demonstrated that the difference in wake field between the model and the full scale ship significantly influences the accuracy of prediction of cavitation and the acoustic performance of the ship wang et al 2015a b taking dtmb5415 a two screw ship as the research object studied the viscous flow field of ships of various scales without considering the free surface effect giorgio tani et al 2017 concluded that for a fast twin screw ship the full scale nominal wake field is significantly less decelerated than the corresponding wake in the model scale however the shape of the wake is similar because of the appendages and different spacing positions of the inside and outside propellers the wake fields of four screw ships are more complicated than those of single screw or two screw ships in addition the load difference between inside and outside propellers is found in the course of the four propeller ship navigation while the load of inner and outer propellers is almost the same in model test however no previous study has considered the scale effect for four screw ships thus in this study the wake fields of a four screw ship at different scales including full scale are calculated using cfd simulations the commercial software package star ccm is used for grid generation and for the numerical simulations in addition the experimental data of the wake field at model scale λ 59 is obtained by conducting a piv test the remaining paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the piv test performed in a towing tank in section 3 the numerical procedure used in this study is briefly described the numerical results along with the verification and validation procedures are presented and discussed in section 4 finally the conclusions drawn from this research are summarized and the future research scope is highlighted 2 experimental description this section describes the experimental facilities ship model test set ups and measurement techniques 2 1 facility description piv measurements of the wake fields of a four screw ship were conducted in the towing tank 108 m long 7 m wide and 3 5 m deep at harbin engineering university heu china the maximum speed of the towing carriage with a main bridge and sub bridge is 6 5 0 003 m s the vehicle loaded piv system used to collect the data was attached to the sub bridge 2 2 model and test set up description the principal parameters of the ship are listed in table 1 the test model was manufactured in the towing tank laboratory in heu the ship framework which was engraved by a numerical control machine was made from plywood and the hull was made from glass fiber reinforced plastics the appendage size was relatively small and it was thus difficult to accurately process the appendage using conventional methods thus we processed the appendages using a 3d printer the stern and appendages were black anodized in order to minimize the surface reflections the ship model modeling process and test model set up in the towing tank are shown in fig 2 2 3 piv measurements the piv system used in this study is a customized stereoscopic underwater system for towing tanks dantec dynamics inc skovlunde denmark polyamide seeding particles with diameters of 50 μm dantec dynamics inc were used as the tracer particles and the particle liquid concentration was 150 g m3 i e approximately 150 g of particles were mixed with 1 m3 of water piv analysis was conducted in batch processes using dantec dynamicstudio v6 0 software the exact size of the effective observation window was approximately 320 mm 280 mm width height the velocity vectors were calculated using the adaptive correlation method dantec dynamics 2015 with initial 128 128 pixel interrogation windows and final 32 32 pixel interrogation windows an overlap of 50 among the neighboring interrogation windows is used during correlation analysis process local neighborhood validation compares individual vectors to the local vectors in the neighborhood vector area size 3 3 and any spurious vectors are removed and replaced by vectors calculated through the local interpolation of the vectors present in the area typically the bad vectors were fewer than 2 before post processing the final spacing vector grid of one velocity vector in the time averaged velocity map is 2 19 2 19 mm2 the acquisition frequency is 7 5 hz and the separation time between two consecutive illuminations of the tracer particles was 400 μs the piv setups with the test model are shown in fig 3 the speed of the ship model vm is 1 94 m s corresponding to f r 0 2789 the measurement planes mp of the wake field are the inside and outside propeller discs mpin x lpp 0 074 mpout x lpp 0 116 where x lpp 0 represents the stern the schematics of the piv measurement planes are shown in fig 4 3 numerical model 3 1 geometry to study the scale effect of the considered four screw ship a series of scale models were simulated wang et al 2015a b obtained almost the same numerical results with and without considering the free surface thus in this study we ignored the free surface effect to improve the computation efficiency the numerical simulation parameters for the different scales are listed in table 2 3 2 mesh grid and computational configurations all trimmed meshes were generated using the star ccm software to minimize the influence of the mesh the grid topologies for models of different scales were the same except for the absolute near wall spacing which was calculated by the wall function and y values see wang et al 2015 the detailed cfd meshes are shown in fig 5 and details of these grids are summarized in tables 3 and 4 the computational domain and boundary conditions for the following ranges are shown in fig 6 2 0 l pp x 3 0 l pp 0 0 l pp y 1 5 l pp and 0 0 l pp z 1 5 l pp the right handed coordinate system for comparison was fixed to x 0 0 ap on the undisturbed water plane of longitudinal section in the center plane the sst k ω model menter 1994 is used in this study to simulate the strong adverse pressure gradient flow field with considering the impact of the shear force exerted by the wall of the model the three dimensional viscous flow field is solved using the finite volume method based on the segregated flow solver in star ccm computational fluid dynamics code the formulation is fully coupled and based on pressure with second order upwind spatial discretization being used for the convective flux terms and second order central discretization being used for the diffusion terms the full scale computation is carried out using parallel processing in 108 cores 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparisons between cfd results and test data in model scale the right handed local coordinate systems of inside and outside propellers and the definition of the angles are shown in fig 7 the origin of the coordinates is the respective center of the inside and outside propellers it can be seen from fig 8 that the test results of the inside propeller disc are more complete than those of the outside one if there was no special explanation figure a represents the result of outside propeller and figure b represents the result of inside propeller this can be ascribed to the measurement position of the outside propeller which is fairly close to the inside bossing and shaft see fig 4 and may result in reflection and obstruction areas those examples concerning ship wake gui et al 2001 felice and pereira 2007 yoon et al 2014 mainly focus on the piv investigations on the single screw ship wake or the bare hull wake of the twin screw ship the measurement regions in these examples are relatively open areas without any obstruction there are few published research works measuring the wake flow of multi screw ships with full appendages in this work the test results of the inside propeller are used to verify the accuracy of numerical calculation comparisons of the velocity contour between the calculated results and piv data are shown in fig 9 white and red dotted lines in the figure denote 1 0r and 0 7r respectively it is seen that the calculated results and piv data are in good agreement the trend of velocity contour distribution between the calculated results and piv data is consistent moreover fig 10 compares the circumferential wake distributions at 0 7r it shows that the measured and calculated results essentially overlap except for the region around 0 4 2 uncertainty analysis of numerical results it is important to perform an uncertainty analysis of non dimensional axial velocity in numerical simulations rans is a steady simulation method thus the simulation uncertainty u sn is composed of grid uncertainty u g and iterative uncertainty u i that is 1 u s n 2 u g 2 u i 2 in this study an uncertainty analysis is performed following the procedures proposed by stern et al 2006 and xing and stern 2010 with three sets of computation grids coarse medium and fine at the scale factors λ 59 8 and 1 full scale three sets of grids are used to evaluate convergence with grid refinement ratio r g 1 41 according to the recommendation of ittc the computation results for three sets of grid at r r 0 7 and λ 59 are shown in fig 11 and the numerical uncertainty analysis procedure is illustrated below taking r r 0 7 as example the calculated values of the non dimensional axial velocity are drawn out at intervals of 10 the values calculated by coarse medium and fine grids are noted as s g c i s g m i and s g f i i 1 37 respectively the grid changes ε for coarse medium and medium fine grids at every circumferential angle are defined by 2 ε g m c i s g m i s g c i i 1 37 ε g f m i s g f i s g m i i 1 37 for point variables ε g m c i and ε g f m i should be dealt with based on the l2 norm i e ε g 2 i 1 i 37 ε g 2 thus the grid converge ratio r g is calculated by 3 r g ε g f m 2 ε g m c 2 the estimated order of accuracy p g r e is calculated by 4 p g r e ln ε g m c 2 ε g f m 2 ln r the distance metric to the asymptotic range p g is defined by 5 p g p g r e p g t h where p g t h is the theoretical order of accuracy the grid uncertainty at every circumferential angle u g i is calculated by 6 u g i 2 45 0 85 p g ε g f m i r p g r e 1 0 p g 1 16 4 p g 14 8 ε g f m i r p g r e 1 p g 1 the global uncertainty u g 2 at each radius is dealt with u g i based on the l2 norm according to the work of zhang et al 2008 iterative uncertainty is smaller than second order small quantity of the grid uncertainty and it is considered to be negligible in comparison to the grid uncertainty thus the numerical simulation uncertainty u sn was equal to grid uncertainty u g the parameters of the verification study with three different scales λ 59 8 1 are shown in tables 5 7 respectively the grid convergence ratios r g 1 are listed in tables 5 7 for each radius which means that the calculation results are monotonically convergent 4 3 comparison of wake flow field between inside and outside propellers because of the different positions of the inner and outer propellers their wake flow fields are quite different which will result in a variety of propeller performance fig 12 shows the non dimensional axial velocity contours on the inside and outside propeller discs respectively it indicates that there is a clear low speed zone behind the bracket the shape of the low speed zone corresponds to the angle of the bracket there is a high speed zone between the bracket arm for both inside and outside propeller disc there is no v x v 0 1 velocity contour on the inside propeller disc while it exists on the outside propeller disc the mean wake fraction of the inside propeller disc ω i n 0 158 is 25 greater than that of the outside one ω o u t 0 122 which will result in a greater inside propeller load compared with that of the outside propeller to illustrate the cause of the difference between inside and outside propeller discs we exhibit more transversal planes along the x direction before the propeller disk plane shown in fig 13 we add the superscript in out to distinguish the inside and outside propeller disc planes p0 in represents the inside propeller disc plane and p0 out represents the outside propeller disc plane respectively fig 14 shows the change process of axial velocity contour of the inside and outside transversal planes it can be seen that the wake field distributions of p4 out and p3 out are similar to the single screw ship wake field except for the symmetry when the currents flow through the brackets the suction surface of bracket acts as an accelerator the high speed zones can be found between the bracket arms in p2 out and p1 out when it comes to the inside transversal planes it shows that the p4 in is closer to the amidships than p4 out and the deadwood has a great influence on the wake field distribution of p4 in comparing with p4 in the velocity contour in p3 in deflects to the amidships which results from the sharply shrink of stern lines the closed high speed velocity contour located between the bracket arms in p2 in and p1 in also show inward trend especially for the 0 6 and 0 7 velocity contour fig 15 shows the vortex structure shedding from the bossing it shows that there are two vortices shedding from the bossing and flowing to the propeller disc however the difference is that the vortices shedding from the outside bossing flow downstream close to the shaft while the inside vortices turn upward when flowing to the inside propeller disc fig 16 shows the vorticity contour of propeller discs white and red dashed lines in the figure denote 1 0r and 0 7r respectively and red solid circles denote wake vortices of wake field it shows that vortices of outer propeller disc are located inside 0 7r while the inner one are located outside 0 7r this is ascribed to the hull lines and the position of propellers the shape of the hull shrinks rapidly over the inside propeller shaft this leads to streamlines turning upward see fig 17 which guide the vortices to turn up accordingly in contrast the shape of the hull over the outside shaft has a small contraction amplitude and the streamlines over the outside shaft turns up tightly since turbulent flow is a pulsating motion the physical quantities in turbulent flow can be regarded as the sum of mean and pulsation values i e v x v x v x in order to estimate the turbulence fluctuation the turbulence intensity ε pope 2000 is usually introduced 7 ε 1 3 v x 2 v y 2 v z 2 v 0 2 where v x v y and v z are the three components of fluctuating velocity and v 0 is the inflow velocity the circumferential distribution of turbulence characteristics of wake field are shown in fig 18 wherein the green region 60 θ 30 is a locally high turbulent region which corresponds to the area behind brackets the pulsating velocity plots indicate that the fluctuation of v x is concentrated in the green region and in the other area the fluctuation values are relatively small similar change rules are found when it comes to ε it is remarkable that the values of ε i n at 0 7r are generally larger than those of ε o u t this attributes to the interference of upward vortices see fig 16 the radial distribution of ε along y r 0 and z r 0 the yellow dashed lines showing in fig 16 are compared in fig 19 with the respect to y r 0 the values of ε o u t is larger than those of ε i n which is mainly due to the boundary layer flow of bracket arm fig 16 shows that the y r 0 dashed line in outside propeller disc is closed to the high turbulent region induced by the bracket arm in terms of z r 0 opposite trend is presented in fig 19 b in fact the flow of inside propeller disc along z r 0 are affected by turbulent region red solid line rectangle in fig 16 induced by ship hull which will result in flow instability it follows that the values of ε i n is larger than that of ε o u t this finding suggests that the inside propeller will generate greater unsteady forces 4 4 scale effect of wake field of propeller disc the non dimensional axial velocity contours on the propeller disc in different scales are shown in fig 20 for the sake of comparison and analysis the distribution range of all contours in fig 20 are set as 0 1 and the interval is set as 0 1 the following results are obtained on comparing the results of the outside propeller velocity contours at different scales shown in fig 20 left 1 the v x v 0 1 and v x v 0 0 9 velocity contours gradually contract toward the center disc with the increase in the reynolds number especially the v x v 0 0 9 velocity contour contracts inward 2 the zone behind the brackets is more complicated there is no v x v 0 0 8 velocity contour on the upper left position at λ 59 and the area of the closed curve of the v x v 0 0 8 velocity contour at the 12 o clock position is relatively small in addition the v x v 0 0 7 velocity contours are two independent closed curves at λ 59 with the increase in the reynolds number the v x v 0 0 8 velocity contour appears on the upper left position of the propeller disc and its area increases gradually at the same time the areas of v x v 0 0 8 velocity contour at the 12 o clock position and v x v 0 0 7 velocity contours increase gradually with the increase in the reynolds number the two independent closed curves v x v 0 0 7 and v x v 0 0 8 melt into each other at λ 36 and λ 8 when it comes to the inside propeller fig 20 right main characteristics can be concluded as follow 1 the v x v 0 0 9 velocity contours gradually contract toward the center disc with the increase in the reynolds number as a result the area of the fan shaped zone effected by the brackets decreased gradually 2 with the increase of reynolds number the axial velocity contours gradually shrink toward the center of the propeller disk and some of the axial velocity contours v x v 0 0 8 undergo the process of contraction fracture and even disappearance this contraction effect is consistent with sasajima and tanaka 1966 and schuiling et al 2011 basic idea of the wake conversion method fig 21 compares the velocity contours of three different scales λ 1 16 59 from the smallest model λ 59 to the full scale λ 1 the contraction effect can be indicated more clearly 4 5 scale effect of wake fraction of propeller disc fig 22 shows the circumferential distribution of the axial wake fraction on the propeller disc at different scales here we use the circumferential distribution of the axial wake fraction on propeller disc at 0 7r as the example to analyze the scale effect of wake fraction as shown in fig 22 the wake fraction exhibits a regular change with the scale effect especially in the range of 120 θ 120 the zone behind the brackets the larger the model the smaller is the wake peak behind the brackets see fig 23 ω h 1 and ω h 2 are the amplitudes of wake peak corresponding to the bracket arms which indicates that the wake field of full scale model is more uniform than the model scale s this can be attributed to the scale effect of appendages in the other ranges corresponding to the underpart of the propeller disc the wake fraction curves at different scales are almost coincident which indicates that the wake field in this area suffers from a light scale effect the variation in the mean axial wake fraction at each radius with the increase in reynolds number is shown in fig 24 it can be seen that the mean axial wake fraction at different radii decreases gradually with the increase in the reynolds number for both the inside and outside propellers in addition a lateral comparison indicates that the mean wake fraction at different radii of the inside propeller is generally greater than that of the outside propeller as for the outside propeller the mean axial wake fraction is relatively large in the inner radius area 0 3 r r 0 5 in the outer radius area 0 6 r r the mean axial wake fraction at different radii is relatively small and almost coincident the inside propeller exhibits a variation trend similar to that of the outside propeller but the inner radius area and outer radius area change into 0 3 r r 0 6 and 0 7 r r respectively volume integration is used to calculate the mean axial wake fraction after obtaining each measuring point value at different radii and angular position it can be expressed as follows 8 ω x 0 2 π r h r ω x r θ r d r d θ 0 2 π r h r r d r d θ where r h is the innermost radius andr is the propeller radius the variation in ω x of the inside and outside propeller discs with the increase in the reynolds number is summarized and shown in fig 25 a it indicates that the value of ω x of the inside propeller is greater than that of the outside propeller at all scales in addition the value of ω x decreases with the increase in the reynolds number for both the inside and outside propeller discs and a nonlinear relationship is found between them to characterize the difference and connection of ω x between the inside and outside propeller discs we define a new variable the wake fraction difference δ ω x it can be expressed as follows 9 δ ω x 2 ω x i n ω x o u t ω x i n ω x o u t where ω x i n and ω x o u t are the mean wake fractions of the inside propeller and outside propellers respectively fig 25 b shows the variation in δ ω x with the increase in the reynolds number δ ω x increases linearly with the increase in the reynolds number this phenomenon indicates that the wake fraction difference between the inside and outside propeller discs suffers from a considerable scale effect the larger the scale of the model the greater the difference in wake fraction between inside and outside propeller discs as a result the difference between the inside and outside propeller performances will increase with the increase in the model scale 4 6 harmonics analysis of wake field the circumferential non uniformity of the wake makes the attack angle and velocity of the propeller inflow drastically change which results in the rotational noise of the propeller furthermore the non uniformity of the inlet also has a significant influence on the cavitation noise characteristics of the propeller and then induces the stern vibration and damage of the hull structure in order to analyze the inhomogeneity of the wake flow field the harmonic analysis method is usually adopted fig 26 shows the harmonics component of axial wake field at 0 7r and 0 9r see yousheng and guoqiang 1984 0 7r is the characteristic radius of propeller load while 0 9r is the characteristic radius of propeller cavitation they directly affect the bearing force and the fluctuation pressure of the propeller respectively for both inside and outside discs at different scales the amplitude of 1 and 2 order harmonics components are larger than others with the increase in order the amplitude attenuated dramatically with the increase of the model scale the low order harmonics components decreases gradually this indicates that the wake field of full scale model is more uniform than the model scale s and the harmonics components play a great role in propeller exciting force which indicates that the larger the model the smaller the exciting force will be 4 7 further discussion traditionally the propellers designed in the uniform velocity field or the propeller designed according to the wake field obtained by model test which may result in that the designed propeller can t match with the real wake field causing a series of problem such as heavy cavitation noise vibration as well as load imbalance in ship navigation these problems can be avoided by making the designed propeller matching with the wake field and the purpose of wake adapted propeller design is that designing propeller diameter blade number pitch distribution caber distribution and so on rationally making the designed propeller match with the wake field thus an aim of this study is to provide more accurate design input for wake adapted propeller design this wake field comparison between inside and outside propeller can guide the differential and wake adapted propeller design for the four screw ship and the monotonic characteristics of the wake field is able to offer reasonable modifications of wake field when carrying out wake adapted propeller design for a four screw ship 5 conclusions in order to explore the influence of the scale effect on the wake field the wake field of a four screw ship is examined in a towing tank by using the piv measurement system furthermore calculations were conducted using a series of different scale models without considering the free surface effect to investigate the scale effect the following research results were obtained 1 for the four screw ship the circumferential distribution patterns of the axial nominal wake fields are different between the inside and outside propeller discs because of the different positions especially in the zone behind the brackets 2 the analysis of the scale effect of the wake field shows that the velocity contours gradually contract toward the center disc with the increase in the reynolds number for both the inside and outside propellers 3 in the range of 120 θ 120 with the increase in the reynolds number the wake fractions of the inside and outside propellers decrease gradually whereas in the other ranges which correspond to the underpart of the propeller disc the wake fraction curves at different scales are almost coincident this indicates that the wake field in the underpart area experiences a light scale effect 4 δ ω x increases with the increase in the reynolds number and there is an approximately linear relationship between them this indicates that the wake fields of inside and outside the propeller disc experience a large scale effect and a larger scale of the model corresponds to a greater difference between the wake fractions 5 with the increase of the model scale the harmonics components decreases gradually which indicates that the wake field of full scale model is more uniform than the model scale s to investigate the scale effect on a four screw ship we mainly focus on the variation of axial wake with scale in this study and the test method need to be improved to obtain more complete test data of wake field for the four screw ship in our subsequent research we are supposed to find a more considerate test procedures and then we will study the influence of wake flow field on the unsteady load of propeller acknowledgements the present work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51679052

screw vessels such as two screw ships and four screw ships have been developed in recent years the wake field of such ships is quite different from that of general single screw ships in a four screw ship four propellers are distributed symmetrically by the longitudinal section in the center plane as shown in fig 1 the inside propeller is located closer to the stern whereas the outside propeller is located closer to the bow this results in a difference between the respective wake fields of the propellers which leads to load imbalance between the inside and outside propellers the nominal wake field plays an important role in propeller performance and the scale effect of the wake field leads to significant differences in the cavitation exciting force noise and propulsive performance between a model and full scale ship over the years the scale effect of the wake field has been an important issue of concern in the early stages researchers performed experiment and theoretical research

the accuracy of prediction of cavitation and the acoustic performance of the ship wang et al 2015a b taking dtmb5415 a two screw ship as the research object studied the viscous flow field of ships of various scales without considering the free surface effect giorgio tani et al 2017 concluded that for a fast twin screw ship the full scale nominal wake field is significantly less decelerated than the corresponding wake in the model scale however the shape of the wake is similar because of the appendages and different spacing positions of the inside and outside propellers the wake fields of four screw ships are more complicated than those of single screw or two screw ships in addition the load difference between inside and outside propellers is found in the course of the four propeller

discussed in section 4 finally the conclusions drawn from this research are summarized and the future research scope is highlighted 2 experimental description this section describes the experimental facilities ship model test set ups and measurement techniques 2 1 facility description piv measurements of the wake fields of a four screw ship were conducted in the towing tank 108 m long 7 m wide and 3 5 m deep at harbin engineering university heu china the maximum speed of the towing carriage with a main bridge and sub bridge is 6 5 0 003 m s the vehicle loaded piv system used to collect the data was attached to the sub bridge 2 2 model and test set up description the principal parameters of the ship are listed in table 1 the test model was manufactured in the towing tank laboratory in heu the ship framework which was engraved by a numerical control machine was made from plywood and the hull was made from glass fiber reinforced plastics the appendage size was relatively small and it was thus difficult to accurately process the appendage using conventional methods thus we processed the appendages using a 3d printer the stern and appendages were black anodized in order to minimize the surface reflections the ship model modeling process and test model set up in the towing tank are shown in fig 2 2 3 piv measurements the piv system used in this study is a customized stereoscopic underwater system for towing tanks dantec dynamics inc skovlunde denmark polyamide seeding particles with diameters of 50 μm dantec dynamics inc were used as the tracer particles and the particle liquid concentration was 150 g m3 i e approximately 150 g of particles were mixed with 1 m3 of water piv analysis was conducted in batch processes using dantec dynamicstudio v6 0 software the exact size of the effective observation window was approximately 320 mm 280 mm width height the velocity vectors were calculated using the adaptive correlation method dantec dynamics 2015 with initial 128 128 pixel interrogation windows and final 32 32 pixel interrogation windows an overlap of 50 among the neighboring interrogation windows is used during correlation analysis process local neighborhood validation compares individual vectors to the local vectors in the neighborhood vector area size 3 3 and any spurious vectors are removed and replaced by vectors calculated through the local interpolation of the vectors present in the area typically the bad vectors were fewer than 2 before post processing the final spacing vector grid of one velocity vector in the time averaged velocity map is 2 19 2 19 mm2 the acquisition frequency is 7 5 hz and the separation time between two consecutive illuminations of the tracer particles was 400 μs the piv setups with the test model are shown in fig 3 the speed of the ship model vm is 1 94 m s corresponding to f r 0 2789 the measurement planes mp of the wake field are the inside and outside propeller discs mpin x lpp 0 074 mpout x lpp 0 116 where x lpp 0 represents the stern the schematics of the piv measurement planes are shown in fig 4 3 numerical model 3 1 geometry to study the scale effect of the considered four screw ship a series of scale models were simulated wang et al 2015a b obtained almost the same numerical results with and without considering the free surface thus in this study we ignored the free surface effect to improve the computation efficiency the numerical simulation parameters for the different scales are listed in table 2 3 2 mesh grid and computational configurations all trimmed meshes were generated using the star ccm software to minimize the influence of the mesh the grid topologies for models of different scales were the same except for the absolute near wall spacing which was calculated by the wall function and y values see wang et al 2015 the detailed cfd meshes are shown in fig 5 and details of these grids are summarized in tables 3 and 4 the computational domain and boundary conditions for the following ranges are shown in fig 6 2 0 l pp x 3 0 l pp 0 0 l pp y 1 5 l pp and 0 0 l pp z 1 5 l pp the right handed coordinate system for comparison was fixed to x 0 0 ap on the undisturbed water plane of longitudinal section in the center plane the sst k ω model menter 1994 is used in this study to simulate the strong adverse pressure gradient flow field with considering the impact of the shear force exerted by the wall of the model the three dimensional viscous flow field is solved using the finite volume method based on the segregated flow solver in star ccm computational fluid dynamics code the formulation is fully coupled and based on pressure with second order upwind spatial discretization being used for the convective flux terms and second order central discretization being used for the diffusion terms the full scale computation is carried out using parallel processing in 108 cores 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparisons between cfd results and test data in model scale the right handed local coordinate systems of inside and outside propellers and the definition of the angles are shown in fig 7 the origin of the coordinates is the respective center of the inside and outside propellers it can be seen from fig 8 that the test results of the inside propeller disc are more complete than those of the outside one if there was no special explanation figure a represents the result of outside propeller and figure b represents the result of inside propeller this can be ascribed to the measurement position of the outside propeller which is fairly close to the inside bossing and shaft see fig 4 and may result in reflection and obstruction areas those examples concerning ship wake gui et al 2001 felice and pereira 2007 yoon et al 2014 mainly focus on the piv investigations on the single screw ship wake or the bare hull wake of the twin screw ship the measurement regions in these examples are relatively open areas without any obstruction there are few published research works measuring the wake flow of multi screw ships with full appendages in this work the test results of the inside propeller are used to verify the accuracy of numerical calculation comparisons of the velocity contour between the calculated results and piv data are shown in fig 9 white and red dotted lines in the figure denote 1 0r and 0 7r respectively it is seen that the calculated results and piv data are in good agreement the trend of velocity contour distribution between the calculated results and piv data is consistent moreover fig 10 compares the circumferential wake distributions at 0 7r it shows that the measured and calculated results essentially overlap except for the region around 0 4 2 uncertainty analysis of numerical results it is important to perform an uncertainty analysis of non dimensional axial velocity in numerical simulations rans is a steady simulation method thus the simulation uncertainty u sn is composed of grid uncertainty u g and iterative uncertainty u i that is 1 u s n 2 u g 2 u i 2 in this study an uncertainty analysis is performed following the procedures proposed by stern et al 2006 and xing and stern 2010 with three sets of computation grids coarse medium and fine at the scale factors λ 59 8 and 1 full scale three sets of grids are used to evaluate convergence with grid refinement ratio r g 1 41 according to the recommendation of ittc the computation results for three sets of grid at r r 0 7 and λ 59 are shown in fig 11 and the numerical uncertainty analysis procedure is illustrated below taking r r 0 7 as example the calculated values of the non dimensional axial velocity are drawn out at intervals of 10 the values calculated by coarse medium and fine grids are noted as s g c i s g m i and s g f i i 1 37 respectively the grid changes ε for coarse medium and medium fine grids at every circumferential angle are defined by 2 ε g m c i s g m i s g c i i 1 37 ε g f m i s g f i s g m i i 1 37 for point variables ε g m c i and ε g f m i should be dealt with based on the l2 norm i e ε g 2 i 1 i 37 ε g 2 thus the grid converge ratio r g is calculated by 3 r g ε g f m 2 ε g m c 2 the estimated order of accuracy p g r e is calculated by 4 p g r e ln ε g m c 2 ε g f m 2 ln r the distance metric to the asymptotic range p g is defined by 5 p g p g r e p g t h where p g t h is the theoretical order of accuracy the grid uncertainty at every circumferential angle u g i is calculated by 6 u g i 2 45 0 85 p g ε g f m i r p g r e 1 0 p g 1 16 4 p g 14 8 ε g f m i r p g r e 1 p g 1 the global uncertainty u g 2 at each radius is dealt with u g i based on the l2 norm according to the work of zhang et al 2008 iterative uncertainty is smaller than second order small quantity of the grid uncertainty and it is considered to be negligible in comparison to the grid uncertainty thus the numerical simulation uncertainty u sn was equal to grid uncertainty u g the parameters of the verification study with three different scales λ 59 8 1 are shown in tables 5 7 respectively the grid convergence ratios r g 1 are listed in tables 5 7 for each radius which means that the calculation results are monotonically convergent 4 3 comparison of wake flow field between inside and outside propellers because of the different positions of the inner and outer propellers their wake flow fields are quite different which will result in a variety of propeller performance fig 12 shows the non dimensional axial velocity contours on the inside and outside propeller discs respectively it indicates that there is a clear low speed zone behind the bracket the shape of the low speed zone corresponds to the angle of the bracket there is a high speed zone between the bracket arm for both inside and outside propeller disc there is no v x v 0 1 velocity contour on the inside propeller disc while it exists on the outside propeller disc the mean wake fraction of the inside propeller disc ω i n 0 158 is 25 greater than that of the outside one ω o u t 0 122 which will result in a greater inside propeller load compared with that of the outside propeller to illustrate the cause of the difference between inside and outside propeller discs we exhibit more transversal planes along the x direction before the propeller disk plane shown in fig 13 we add the superscript in out to distinguish the inside and outside propeller disc planes p0 in represents the inside propeller disc plane and p0 out represents the outside propeller disc plane respectively fig 14 shows the change process of axial velocity contour of the inside and outside transversal planes it can be seen that the wake field distributions of p4 out and p3 out are similar to the single screw ship wake field except for the symmetry when the currents flow through the brackets the suction surface of bracket acts as an accelerator the high speed zones can be found between the bracket arms in p2 out and p1 out when it comes to the inside transversal planes it shows that the p4 in is closer to the amidships than p4 out and the deadwood has a great influence on the wake field distribution of p4 in comparing with p4 in the velocity contour in p3 in deflects to the amidships which results from the sharply shrink of stern lines the closed high speed velocity contour located between the bracket arms in p2 in and p1 in also show inward trend especially for the 0 6 and 0 7 velocity contour fig 15 shows the vortex structure shedding from the bossing it shows that there are two vortices shedding from the bossing and flowing to the propeller disc however the difference is that the vortices shedding from the outside bossing flow downstream close to the shaft while the inside vortices turn upward when flowing to the inside propeller disc fig 16 shows the vorticity contour of propeller discs white and red dashed lines in the figure denote 1 0r and 0 7r respectively and red solid circles denote wake vortices of wake field it shows that vortices of outer propeller disc are located inside 0 7r while the inner one are located outside 0 7r this is ascribed to the hull lines and the position of propellers the shape of the hull shrinks rapidly over the inside propeller shaft this leads to streamlines turning upward see fig 17 which guide the vortices to turn up accordingly in contrast the shape of the hull over the outside shaft has a small contraction amplitude and the streamlines over the outside shaft turns up tightly since turbulent flow is a pulsating motion the physical quantities in turbulent flow can be regarded as the sum of mean and pulsation values i e v x v x v x in order to estimate the turbulence fluctuation the turbulence intensity ε pope 2000 is usually introduced 7 ε 1 3 v x 2 v y 2 v z 2 v 0 2 where v x v y and v z are the three components of fluctuating velocity and v 0 is the inflow velocity the circumferential distribution of turbulence characteristics of wake field are shown in fig 18 wherein the green region 60 θ 30 is a locally high turbulent region which corresponds to the area behind brackets the pulsating velocity plots indicate that the fluctuation of v x is concentrated in the green region and in the other area the fluctuation values are relatively small similar change rules are found when it comes to ε it is remarkable that the values of ε i n at 0 7r are generally larger than those of ε o u t this attributes to the interference of upward vortices see fig 16 the radial distribution of ε along y r 0 and z r 0 the yellow dashed lines showing in fig 16 are compared in fig 19 with the respect to y r 0 the values of ε o u t is larger than those of ε i n which is mainly due to the boundary layer flow of bracket arm fig 16 shows that the y r 0 dashed line in outside propeller disc is closed to the high turbulent region induced by the bracket arm in terms of z r 0 opposite trend is presented in fig 19 b in fact the flow of inside propeller disc along z r 0 are affected by turbulent region red solid line rectangle in fig 16 induced by ship hull which will result in flow instability it follows that the values of ε i n is larger than that of ε o u t this finding suggests that the inside propeller will generate greater unsteady forces 4 4 scale effect of wake field of propeller disc the non dimensional axial velocity contours on the propeller disc in different scales are shown in fig 20 for the sake of comparison and analysis the distribution range of all contours in fig 20 are set as 0 1 and the interval is set as 0 1 the following results are obtained on comparing the results of the outside propeller velocity contours at different scales shown in fig 20 left 1 the v x v 0 1 and v x v 0 0 9 velocity contours gradually contract toward the center disc with the increase in the reynolds number especially the v x v 0 0 9 velocity contour contracts inward 2 the zone behind the brackets is more complicated there is no v x v 0 0 8 velocity contour on the upper left position at λ 59 and the area of the closed curve of the v x v 0 0 8 velocity contour at the 12 o clock position is relatively small in addition the v x v 0 0 7 velocity contours are two independent closed curves at λ 59 with the increase in the reynolds number the v x v 0 0 8 velocity contour appears on the upper left position of the propeller disc and its area increases gradually at the same time the areas of v x v 0 0 8 velocity contour at the 12 o clock position and v x v 0 0 7 velocity contours increase gradually with the increase in the reynolds number the two independent closed curves v x v 0 0 7 and v x v 0 0 8 melt into each other at λ 36 and λ 8 when it comes to the inside propeller fig 20 right main characteristics can be concluded as follow 1 the v x v 0 0 9 velocity contours gradually contract toward the center disc with the increase in the reynolds number as a result the area of the fan shaped zone effected by the brackets decreased gradually 2 with the increase of reynolds number the axial velocity contours gradually shrink toward the center of the propeller disk and some of the axial velocity contours v x v 0 0 8 undergo the process of contraction fracture and even disappearance this contraction effect is consistent with sasajima and tanaka 1966 and schuiling et al 2011 basic idea of the wake conversion method fig 21 compares the velocity contours of three different scales λ 1 16 59 from the smallest model λ 59 to the full scale λ 1 the contraction effect can be indicated more clearly 4 5 scale effect of wake fraction of propeller disc fig 22 shows the circumferential distribution of the axial wake fraction on the propeller disc at different scales here we use the circumferential distribution of the axial wake fraction on propeller disc at 0 7r as the example to analyze the scale effect of wake fraction as shown in fig 22 the wake fraction exhibits a regular change with the scale effect especially in the range of 120 θ 120 the zone behind the brackets the larger the model the smaller is the wake peak behind the brackets see fig 23 ω h 1 and ω h 2 are the amplitudes of wake peak corresponding to the bracket arms which indicates that the wake field of full scale model is more uniform than the model scale s this can be attributed to the scale effect of appendages in the other ranges corresponding to the underpart of the propeller disc the wake fraction curves at different scales are almost coincident which indicates that the wake field in this area suffers from a light scale effect the variation in the mean axial wake fraction at each radius with the increase in reynolds number is shown in fig 24 it can be seen that the mean axial wake fraction at different radii decreases gradually with the increase in the reynolds number for both the inside and outside propellers in addition a lateral comparison indicates that the mean wake fraction at different radii of the inside propeller is generally greater than that of the outside propeller as for the outside propeller the mean axial wake fraction is relatively large in the inner radius area 0 3 r r 0 5 in the outer radius area 0 6 r r the mean axial wake fraction at different radii is relatively small and almost coincident the inside propeller exhibits a variation trend similar to that of the outside propeller but the inner radius area and outer radius area change into 0 3 r r 0 6 and 0 7 r r respectively volume integration is used to calculate the mean axial wake fraction after obtaining each measuring point value at different radii and angular position it can be expressed as follows 8 ω x 0 2 π r h r ω x r θ r d r d θ 0 2 π r h r r d r d θ where r h is the innermost radius andr is the propeller radius the variation in ω x of the inside and outside propeller discs with the increase in the reynolds number is summarized and shown in fig 25 a it indicates that the value of ω x of the inside propeller is greater than that of the outside propeller at all scales in addition the value of ω x decreases with the increase in the reynolds number for both the inside and outside propeller discs and a nonlinear relationship is found between them to characterize the difference and connection of ω x between the inside and outside propeller discs we define a new variable the wake fraction difference δ ω x it can be expressed as follows 9 δ ω x 2 ω x i n ω x o u t ω x i n ω x o u t where ω x i n and ω x o u t are the mean wake fractions of the inside propeller and outside propellers respectively fig 25 b shows the variation in δ ω x with the increase in the reynolds number δ ω x increases linearly with the increase in the reynolds number this phenomenon indicates that the wake fraction difference between the inside and outside propeller discs suffers from a considerable scale effect the larger the scale of the model the greater the difference in wake fraction between inside and outside propeller discs as a result the difference between the inside and outside propeller performances will increase with the increase in the model scale 4 6 harmonics analysis of wake field the circumferential non uniformity of the wake makes the attack angle and velocity of the propeller inflow drastically change which results in the rotational noise of the propeller furthermore the non uniformity of the inlet also has a significant influence on the cavitation noise characteristics of the propeller and then induces the stern vibration and damage of the hull structure in order to analyze the inhomogeneity of the wake flow field the harmonic analysis method is usually adopted fig 26 shows the harmonics component of axial wake field at 0 7r and 0 9r see yousheng and guoqiang 1984 0 7r is the characteristic radius of propeller load while 0 9r is the characteristic radius of propeller cavitation they directly affect the bearing force and the fluctuation pressure of the propeller respectively for both inside and outside discs at different scales the amplitude of 1 and 2 order harmonics components are larger than others with the increase in order the amplitude attenuated dramatically with the increase of the model scale the low order harmonics components decreases gradually this indicates that the wake field of full scale model is more uniform than the model scale s and the harmonics components play a great role in propeller exciting force which indicates that the larger the model the smaller the exciting force will be 4 7 further discussion traditionally the propellers designed in the uniform velocity field or the propeller designed according to the wake field obtained by model test which may result in that the designed propeller can t match with the real wake field causing a series of problem such as heavy cavitation noise vibration as well as load imbalance in ship navigation these problems can be avoided by making the designed propeller matching with the wake field and the purpose of wake adapted propeller design is that designing propeller diameter blade number pitch distribution caber distribution and so on rationally making the designed propeller match with the wake field thus an aim of this study is to provide more accurate design input for wake adapted propeller design this wake field comparison between inside and outside propeller can guide the differential and wake adapted propeller design for the four screw ship and the monotonic characteristics of the wake field is able to offer reasonable modifications of wake field when carrying out wake adapted propeller design for a four screw ship 5 conclusions in order to explore the influence of the scale effect on the wake field the wake field of a four screw ship is examined in a towing tank by using the piv measurement system furthermore calculations were conducted using a series of different scale models without considering the free surface effect to investigate the scale effect the following research results were obtained 1 for the four screw ship the circumferential distribution patterns of the axial nominal wake fields are different between the inside and outside propeller discs because of the different positions especially in the zone behind the brackets 2 the analysis of the scale effect of the wake field shows that the velocity contours gradually contract toward the center disc with the increase in the reynolds number for both the inside and outside propellers 3 in the range of 120 θ 120 with the increase in the reynolds number the wake fractions of the inside and outside propellers decrease gradually whereas in the other ranges which correspond to the underpart of the propeller disc the wake fraction curves at different scales are almost coincident this indicates that the wake field in the underpart area experiences a light scale effect 4 δ ω x increases with the increase in the reynolds number and there is an approximately linear relationship between them this indicates that the wake fields of inside and outside the propeller disc experience a large scale effect and a larger scale of the model corresponds to a greater difference between the wake fractions 5 with the increase of the model scale the harmonics components decreases gradually which indicates that the wake field of full scale model is more uniform than the model scale s to investigate the scale effect on a four screw ship we mainly focus on the variation of axial wake with scale in this study and the test method need to be improved to obtain more complete test data of wake field for the four screw ship in our subsequent research we are supposed to find a more considerate test procedures and then we will study the influence of wake flow field on the unsteady load of propeller acknowledgements the present work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51679052

database wave climate tomawac 1 introduction the knowledge of ocean waves is of great significance for coastal engineering purposes in coastal areas the wave transformation due to varying water depth and wave breaking can not only change alongshore and cross shore currents but it can drive sediment transport nielsen 1992 warner et al 2010 bai and cheung 2013 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2014 zhang

threats to coastal and ocean engineering and human lives cooper and forristall 1997 a better understanding of ocean waves depends on long term wave information to analyze the mean and extreme waves buoy measurements and satellite altimetry data can be used to analyze wave climate a wave buoy station is the best way to record a long time series of waves but this cannot capture the spatial distributions of wave fields satellites can derive wave information along their tracks but only significant wave height are provided with a non regular temporal resolution appendini et al 2014 kalra et al 2005 due to limited observations wave modeling is an alternative tool to provide high resolution and long term wave information on a regional or global scale since 1990s state of the art medium and large scale wave modeling is possible with the third generation models developed wave models such as wam wamdig 1988 wavewatch iii tolman 1991 swan booij et al 1999 and tomawac benoit et al 1996

be as high as 7 5 km liang et al 2019 established a global wave hindcast database based on the swan model and the era interim wind database these global hindcast wave databases can be used to analyze long term wave climates and trends but the spatial resolution is usually too coarse to represent complex wave fields in coastal areas to produce detailed nearshore wave prediction tiberi wadier et al 2016 constructed a numerical wave database covering the atlantic ocean with a resolution of 1 km along the french coast in the period from 1979 to 2010 the chinese coast faces the northwest pacific ocean typhoons with strong winds and waves occur frequently in summer and autumn posing significant risks to the coastal infrastructures offshore facilities and ships wang et al 2017 shi et al 2017 in winter and spring impacted by the east asian monsoon north northwesterly winds spread from north to south across the eastern coast of china with wind speeds of approximately 5 9 ms 1 the variation of surface winds within the four seasons helps to induce obvious variations in the wave distributions wave data of long duration are needed to thoroughly understand the complex extreme and mean wave states along the chinese coast but such data are rare many studies based on field measurements or satellite altimetry data have been conducted to analyze the extreme and mean distributions of waves in this region xu and huang 2011 feng and jiang 2015 due to the limitations of the observations these studies can only present local wave information or distributions with low resolution wave models have been implemented over the northwest pacific ocean to construct forecast and hindcast waves liang et al 2016 used swan to investigate the wave climate of the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea for

south china sea and the east china sea this paper presents the construction of the wave database and the applications of the data to analyze the wave climate and trends along the chinese coast the hindcast wave database covering main parts of the pacific zone so various components of waves caused by different wind belts can be considered the model is run over the period from 1979 to 2017 and

interactions madsen and sorensen 1992 respectively 2 2 model setup to get a high resolution wave state at a modest computational cost two nested wave models are used the coarse grid with a larger domain covers the main parts of the pacific ocean from 76 s to 66 n latitude and 100 e to 82 w longitude see fig 1 no wave spectrum is imposed at the boundaries the waves are generated only by wind forcing inside the numerical domain the fine grid focuses on the chinese coast including the bohai sea the yellow sea the east china sea and the north part of the south china sea fig 1 the coarse grid has a resolution of 1 o in the east part of the pacific ocean increasing up to 0 2 o in the northwest pacific and to 10 km resolution along the chinese coast this coarse grid provides wave spectra boundary condition to the fine grid the fine grid has a spatial resolution of 1 km along the coasts in order to capture the wave transformation induced by complex topography and bathymetry in coastal areas the bathymetric data used in the two grids are obtained from the gebco database the oceanic grid comprises 28 946 nodes and 55 549 elements and the coastal grid comprises 91 976 nodes and 178 682 elements the number of directions in the 360 is 36 and the frequencies of the simulated waves are divided into 32 frequencies from 0 0345 hz to 0 66 hz with an increase step of 1 1 the time steps for the coarse and fine grids are 300 s and 200 s respectively the wave simulations cover 39 years from 1979 to 2017 the wave models are forces by the 10 m wind fields from the cfsr database saha et al 2010 the cfsr wind database provides hourly wind components the wind is on a regular grid with spatial resolution of 0 312 and temporal resolution of 1 h these wind fields are linearly interpolated on the coarse and fine grids fig 1 comparisons between the cfsr wind data and those observed by four buoy stations fig 1 are shown in fig 2 the locations of the buoys are shown in table 1 the cfsr performs well in general for all four stations both of the tendency and magnitude of the wind speed and directions provided by cfsr agree well with the measured data the maximum values of wind speed in b3 and b4 are induced by typhoons that means the wind database can capture the maximum values of wind speed during typhoon period with good accuracy to quantitatively assess the match between cfsr wind data and observations the normalized bias nb and the symmetrically normalized root mean square error hh hanna and heinold 1985 mentaschi et al 2015 have been used which are defined as 3 n b 1 n s i o i 1 n o i 4 h h 1 n s i o i 2 1 n s i o i where n is the number of data points o i is reference data obtained from observations and s i is the result provided by the cfsr database the nb indicates the average component of the error and a value closer to zero means a better numerical prediction the hh combines the average and scatter components of the errors which is a synthetic indicator to evaluate the performance of the model for the wind direction the n b d and h h d have been normalized by employing a 2 π radiant angle 5 n b d 1 n mod s i o i 2 π 1 n o i mod s i o i 2 π s i o i i f s i o i π mod s i o i 2 π s i o i i f s i o i π 6 h h d 1 n mod s i o i 2 2 π 1 n abs s i o i mod s i o i 2 π s i o i i f s i o i π mod s i o i 2 π s i o i i f s i o i π where the operator abs means absolute value the statistical parameters are listed in table 2 overall the cfsr underestimates the values of wind speeds and wind direction compared with the observations but the discrepancies in wind speed are less than 6 and in wind direction are under 7 that means the cfsr database can provide reasonable wind data for wave simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation to evaluate the performance of the model for simulating waves four buoys located along the chinese coast fig 1 were used to validate the wave model figs 3 and 4 show comparisons between observed and hindcast significant wave height swh and mean period mp for a two month period at the four buoys good agreement is observed between numerical results and buoy measurements for both swh and mp buoys b1 and b2 are located on the northern chinese coast in these areas the anti cyclones developed over siberia usually occur in winter and spring which is the dominant sources of wind forcing and wind waves he et al 2018 from figs 3a b and 4a b we can see that the model can well simulate the variations of swh and mp induced by the anti cyclones for peaks of swh a slight underestimation from the simulations can be seen at b1 during march 8 10 2016 the other two buoys b3 and b4 are located on the southeast chinese coast this region is prone to typhoon waves in summer and autumn feng et al 2012 during typhoon periods the highest peaks reached an swh of 7 m at buoy b3 and up to 3 m at b4 the peaks of swh can be well simulated by the model fig 3c and d in addition mp from simulations reproduces the variations of the observations quite well fig 5 shows the comparisons of wave direction wd in winter and spring the buoys b1 and b2 are mainly impacted by the east asian monsoon the wd is relative stable in north to northeast directions in summer and autumn the interactions between the east asian summer monsoon and the west pacific summer monsoon induced frequent typhoon events the wd becomes more diverse as shown in fig 5 it can be seen the model can predict the variations of the wd with good accuracy the parameters of nb and hh are used to estimate the discrepancies between wave data obtained from simulations and observations the statistical parameters are listed in table 3 the nb between simulations and buoy observations is less than 0 03 for swh while the bias of mp is less than 0 04 all of the nb of mp are negative in proximity of the buoy stations which indicates underestimation of mp by the model but the underestimation of mp is less than 4 for the mp the hh shows that the maximum values of errors are 0 21 for swh and 0 23 for mp the numerical results also show a good prediction of wd since the n b d is lower than 0 04 and h h d is under 0 25 as shown in fig 3 there are four typhoon events occurred at b3 and b4 the magnitudes of nb and hh during the typhoon events are shown in table 4 the maximum values of nb are 4 for swh 5 for mp and 5 for wd the values of hh are less than 0 21 for swh 0 20 for mp and 0 23 for wd thus the wave model can well predict the wave parameters for normal and severe wave conditions at the four buoy stations the comparisons between simulations and buoy measurements can only show the accuracy of numerical simulations at the few probes to obtain the distributions of bias along the chinese coast the simulations are compared with altimeter observations from satellites the altimeter observations are from the globwave database globwave ifremer fr which includes altimeter observations of swh for nine satellites from 1985 until 2019 the numerical results of swh were extracted on the tracks coordinates the wave domain was divided into cells of 0 4 o 0 4 o and the bias between the observed and simulated swh was computed for each cell the mean values for the cells from 1990 to 2017 are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that over the most part of the domain the nb varies between 0 04 the values of nb is less than 0 02 around taiwan and in the regions between hainan and taiwan which corresponds to an accurate reproduction of swh in the north part of the chinese coast and region close to the southwest boundary the negative nb is about 0 03 to 0 04 which reflects the underestimation of swh by the wave model in these areas 3 2 wave climate around chinese coasts 3 2 1 maximum swh and mp wave climate analysis for the chinese coast was determined using the wave hindcast data fig 7 shows the maximum values of swh and mp from 1979 to 2017 it is seen that the maximum swh was found in the east china sea and south china sea the extreme waves increased from north to south the maximum value of swh in the bohai sea was approximately 5 m while in the yellow sea it was under 10 m in the east china sea and northern south china sea the extreme wave heights were much larger the highest swh approximate 18 m occurred off the east coast of taiwan island and was highly correlated with typhoon tracks li et al 2018 typhoons occur frequently along the southeast coast of china over the past 50 years 254 typhoon events have impacted the coasts feng et al 2012 these can induce extreme waves with a maximum swh of 12 14 m in most coastal areas of the east china sea and south china sea as seen in fig 7 protected by taiwan island and hainan island the taiwan strait and areas northwest of hainan have a maximum swh of relatively smaller amplitude ranging from 6 m to 10 m the lower panel of fig 7 shows the distribution of maximum mp which has a strong correlation to the maximum values of swh the maximum values of mp which are about 14 s also occur off the eastern taiwan coast fig 8 presents the distribution of the seasonal maximum swh of the four seasons over the entire temporal span the spatial distributions show an obviously seasonal cycle in summer and autumn the maximum swh generally exceeds 10 m and can reach up to 18 m along typhoon tracks in the east china sea and south china sea in winter and spring the swh is relatively weak with values of less than 6 m in most of the computational domain 3 2 2 100 year return period swh the annual maximum swh were extracted from the hindcast wave database the extreme waves with a given return period can beobtained by using the gumbel distribution castillo 1988 with expressions as follows 7 d x exp exp x α β where d x represents the cumulative distribution function x is the value of a random variable x α and β are the location and scale parameters the mean μ and standard deviation σ is given by 8 μ α γ β 9 σ π β 6 where γ 0 5772 is the euler mascheroni constant for a given t year return year the value of x t can be estimated by 10 x t α β ln ln 1 1 t the annual maximum swh at each grid point in the coastal grid were calculated and the distribution of the 100 year return period swh is shown in fig 9 the distribution of 100 year return period swh is consistent with that of the maximum swh in 1979 2017 fig 7 the largest values of swh more than 20 m are observed in the areas east of taiwan island the 100 year return period swh in the bohai sea are less than 7 m whereas those in the yellow sea are between 6 m and 12 m in the east china sea and north part of the south china sea impacted by typhoon the values of the 100 year return swh are much larger which are 14 22 m and 12 14 m respectively 3 2 3 mean swh and mp the mean values of swh and mp are shown in fig 10 the mean values were calculated by averaging the simulated swh and mp over the 39 year period the mean values of swh increase from land to sea and the values along the chinese coast are within 1 8 m the distribution of swh decreases from south to north the largest values 2 1 m are found to the southeast of taiwan island the lowest mean values of swh and mp are found in bohai sea and the northern yellow sea with mean values of swh under 1 0 m and mp lower than 5 s fig 11 shows the distribution of the mean values of swh for the four seasons the seasonal mean values show a different spatial distribution compared to the annual maximum values the spatial distributions of swh are generally similar within season however the values of swh vary significantly in autumn and winter the mean swh values are relatively larger at 1 3 2 5 m in the northern south china sea 1 6 2 5 m in the east china sea 1 1 5 m in the yellow sea and 0 5 0 8 in the bohai sea in spring and summer the mean values of swh in the northern south china sea and east china sea decrease to under 1 8 m and approximately 0 5 1 0 m and 0 5 0 8 m in the northern yellow sea and bohai sea respectively the maximum values of the mean swh occur in winter at more than 2 5 m at the taiwan strait and southeast of taiwan in winter the east asian monsoon generated from siberia drives cold air from north to south these winds turn to north northeasterly over lower latitudes with wind speeds of up to 9 m s 1 at the taiwan strait resulting in maximum values of swh in these areas in summer however the main wind direction is southerly the overall magnitude of the wind speed is less than half that in winter thus the mean values of swh are much smaller in summer than in autumn and winter in summer the waves are not only generated by local wind but they are impacted by swell from the open pacific ocean the southeasterly swell even dominates the wave climate along chinese coastal areas in summer frequent typhoon events occur in the southeast part of chinese nearshore zones which leads to maximum values of swh in summer off the east coast of taiwan the distributions of seasonal mean mp are presented in fig 12 the maximum values of mp occur in autumn off eastern taiwan with corresponding peak values of swh as seen in fig 11 however in winter and spring the corresponding mean mp at the taiwan strait does not show obviously peak values consistent with the distribution of swh as can also be seen in fig 11 this can be attributed to the prevailing wind directions which are northeast and northwest in winter and spring respectively influenced by the chinese mainland the wind waves cannot be well developed due to the limited fetch length thus the dominant waves in winter and spring are locally generated wind waves with a relatively smaller period than the mixed waves with swells in summer and autumn sheltered by the taiwan island the magnitudes of mp at the strait are even smaller than those of the surrounding seas in summer 3 3 severe wave analysis and long term trends so far we have analyzed the maximum and mean values of swh and mp although the maximum and mean values can represent part of ocean wave information there are many other aspects such as extreme wave number duration and intensity which are also important for coastal protection shipping and offshore construction following the method proposed by weisse and günther 2007 we introduce a severe event threshold set which is the 99th percentile of the total swh based on the values of set the parameters of the extreme events number duration and intensity can be defined as 11 n 1 m i 1 m n j 12 p 1 m i 1 m j 1 n j p i j n j 13 i 1 m i 1 m j 1 n j i i j n j where m is the number of years of the data series n j is the annual number of extreme events p i j is the time of the extreme event when the swh remains above the value of set and i i j is the difference between the maximum swh during a severe event and the set value fig 13 shows the severe wave event climate around the chinese coast based on the hindcast database from 1979 to 2017 the distribution of the 99th percentile swh is presented in fig 13a the maximum value of the 99th percentile swh 6 0 m occurs around taiwan island toward the north the maximum 99th percentile swh decreases to less than 5 m in the yellow sea and approximately 3 m in the bohai sea in the northern south china sea the maximum 99th percentile swh is 4 5 m decreasing to about 2 3 m near the coast enhanced by the winter monsoon the 99th percentile swh in central taiwan strait is up to 6 m close to the coastline the extreme waves are less than 3 m as the main wave energy has been dissipated by bottom friction and breaking turning to the annual number of severe events the regions of highest frequency are at the bohai sea the northern yellow sea the taiwan strait and the northwest part of the south china sea with average severe wave events numbering 5 6 per year in most of the east china sea and south china sea the severe event threshold set is exceeded on average 2 5 4 0 times a year with a mean duration of about 10 15 h in the yellow sea and bohai sea the average duration increases to 20 25 h per extreme event the longest average duration of up to 30 h can be found to the southwest of taiwan island the typical intensities of these events vary between 0 5 m and 1 5 m in the yellow sea and bohai sea in the east and south china seas the maximum intensities can be up to 3 0 m in regions with typhoon tracks figs 14 16 show the seasonal mean of the extreme event number duration and intensity it can be noticed that the occurrence of extreme waves varies significantly by season in the bohai sea northern yellow sea and taiwan strait the severe events are mainly observed in winter and autumn on average 3 and 1 2 times respectively these severe wave events can be attributed to the northeast wind induced by the east asian monsoon in the remainder of the east china sea and south china sea however set values are exceeded in summer and autumn these extreme waves are mainly induced by typhoon events the seasonal differences of the events can also be noticed in the seasonal distributions of the average duration influenced by typhoon events the average durations are approximate 20 25 h in summer and autumn in the east china sea and south china sea in the bohai sea and yellow sea the events mainly occur in winter with durations of 10 15 h the average intensity also shows obvious seasonal differences in regions impacted by typhoon events severe wave events are more intense with an average intensity of 2 3 m in contrast the average intensities in the bohai sea and yellow sea are less than 1 m wave climate trend is described by a linear slope of the severe wave event characteristics at each computation node a positive slope indicates an increase of a characteristic and a negative slope represents a decrease the calculated slope was assessed by the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1955 only areas with slopes statistically different from zero at the 95 significance level are shown fig 17 presents the linear trends for the 99th percentile swh overall positive trends are observed in most part of chinese seas this increasing trend in swh is consistent with previous studies such as young and babanin 2011 and zheng and li 2015 the maximum increase 3 cm yr 1 of the 99th percentile swh can be found southeast of taiwan in the north part of the east china sea the positive trends are weakened by an increase in extreme swh on the order of 1 2 cm yr 1 this increasing trend of the extreme swh is induced by the more intense typhoon events occurring in summer and autumn in this area yumoto and matsuura 2001 ho et al 2004 in the northern yellow sea and the bohai sea there is no significant trend with a positive slope of less than 1 5 cm yr 1 in the northern south china sea the rate of increase of swh is around 1 2 cm yr 1 and the positive trends are weakened near the west coast of hainan island figs 18 20 shows the linear trends of the annual mean number duration and intensity of the severe events in most parts of the chinese seas the rate of increase decrease is less than 0 05 times per year exceptions can be found in the southwestern bohai sea the northern yellow sea and the northern south china sea the maximum value of the rate of increase is 0 17 time per year and the maximum rate of decrease is 0 2 time per year the trends of duration can be seen in fig 19 in most parts of the east china sea the trends that are statistically significant are less than 95 which are not shown the changes in duration are not significant the increasing trends of the duration occur mainly in the western bohai sea areas southeast of taiwan island and the central part between hainan and taiwan island decreasing trends can be found in most of the yellow sea and areas southwest of taiwan island with the strongest negative trends of 0 3 0 4 h yr 1 fig 20 shows the distribution of extreme event intensity trends the positive negative trends are highly correlated with the increasing decreasing trends of the durations fig 19 the maximum increase rate is 0 06 m yr 1 occurring mainly in the southeast and southwest areas off the taiwan coast and the central area between hainan and taiwan island the maximum decrease rate 0 06 m yr 1 is observed near the south coast of taiwan 4 conclusions a chinese wave database cwave using the wave model tomawac covering the period from 1979 to 2017 is presented the computational grids are refined along the chinese coast with spatial resolution of about 1 km the wave model is forced with the wind field from cfsr database over the whole domain using observations from four buoy stations the model s capability to reproduce time series of swh and mp is assessed results show that the model can well predict the variations of swh and mp in both extreme and general waves the nb between simulations and observations is under 0 03 for swh and 0 04 for mp spatial distributions of bias are obtained through comparison to satellite altimetry data in most chinese sea areas this database can provide long and homogeneous time series of wave parameters such as swh mp and wave direction with high spatial resolution 1 km along the chinese coast these data are essential to wave climate analysis as current observational instruments cannot provide data with high spatial and temporal detail the maximum 100 year return period and mean values of wave parameters were analyzed based on the wave database over the period from 1979 to 2017 the spatial distributions of the maximum and mean swh show that the waves increase from north to south induced by typhoon events the maximum swh occurs off the east coast of taiwan with a value of 18 m and the corresponding maximum mp is 14 s to demonstrate the seasonal variation of swh and mp the distributions of maximum and mean swh are presented there is a noticeable seasonal difference in the variation of maximum and mean values the maximum values of swh up to 18 m occur along the southeast coast of china along typhoon tracks in summer and autumn the maximum swh in winter and spring is much weaker with values less than 6 m the seasonal distributions of the mean values of swh are much different than those of the maximum values the mean values in autumn and winter are relatively larger than in spring and summer the differences can be attributed to seasonal changes in the magnitude of the wind speed the analysis of severe wave events and long term trends was also carried out based on the set values in this study it was chosen as the 99th percentile swh the results reveal that the regions around taiwan island experience the maximum set values about 6 m severe events occur most frequently about 5 6 annually in the bohai sea northern yellow sea taiwan strait and northwestern south china sea these events are mainly induced by high wind speeds in autumn and winter in the remaining part of the east and south china seas the number decreases to 2 5 3 5 times per year which is impacted by typhoon events in summer and autumn the average durations above the set values are 20 30 h during typhoon events and 10 15 h in winter the intensity induced by typhoons can be 2 3 m larger than the set values while waves induced by cold waves have a maximum swh less than 1 m above the set values the long term trends are represented by the linear slopes of severe event characteristics the analysis reveals an increasing trend in most part of the chinese seas and the rate of increase decrease is lower than 0 05 times per year the trends of the 99th percentile swh are mainly associated with changes in the number and intensity of severe wave events the trends in times and durations are not obvious with a maximum of 0 2 times and 0 5 h per year the intensity remains nearly unchanged in the yellow sea and bohai sea but increases approximately 6 cm per year along the typhoon tracks however it must be pointed out that the long term hindcast wave fields are driven by the cfsr wind fields which are not statistically homogeneous with time saha et al 2010 thus the long term trends of wave climate might be impacted by inhomogeneities in the wind analyses to improve the understanding of wave climate change homogeneous wave fields in time are needed to well describe the wave climate for the past several decades acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfc0405402 2017yfc0405401 the national natural science foundation of china 41706087 51879096 the

22766,a new wave database has been built over the period of 1979 2017 which can provide wave parameters with high spatial 1 km along chinese coast and temporal 1 h resolutions buoy data and satellite altimeter data are used to evaluate the accuracy of the wave hindcasts wave climate analysis is the next stage in which the yearly seasonal maximum 100 year return period and mean wave characteristics are analyzed the maximum of the significant wave height swh in summer and autumn are larger than those in the other seasons while the seasonal mean values in autumn and winter are larger severe wave events analysis reveals the maximum values of the 99th percentile swh approximate 6 m are located around taiwan island the average durations for the events during typhoons are 20 30 h with swh 2 3 m above the 99th percentile swh in contrast the durations are 10 15 h with intensities less than 1 m in winter for long term trends the 99th percentile swh increases in most part of the chinese seas of 0 5 3 cm per year the changes in times and durations over the past 39 years are not obvious but the intensity increases approximate 6 cm per year along typhoon tracks keywords wave modeling wave database wave climate tomawac 1 introduction the knowledge of ocean waves is of great significance for coastal engineering purposes in coastal areas the wave transformation due to varying water depth and wave breaking can not only change alongshore and cross shore currents but it can drive sediment transport nielsen 1992 warner et al 2010 bai and cheung 2013 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 sui et al 2016 by changing currents and sediment transport ocean waves can impact coastal geomorphology masselink et al 2006 chen et al 2018 liao et al 2018 and coastline stability posing threats to coastal and ocean engineering and human lives cooper and forristall 1997 a better understanding of ocean waves depends on long term wave information to analyze the mean and extreme waves buoy measurements and satellite altimetry data can be used to analyze wave climate a wave buoy station is the best way to record a long time series of waves but this cannot capture the spatial distributions of wave fields satellites can derive wave information along their tracks but only significant wave height are provided with a non regular temporal resolution appendini et al 2014 kalra et al 2005 due to limited observations wave modeling is an alternative tool to provide high resolution and long term wave information on a regional or global scale since 1990s state of the art medium and large scale wave modeling is possible with the third generation models developed wave models such as wam wamdig 1988 wavewatch iii tolman 1991 swan booij et al 1999 and tomawac benoit et al 1996 have been widely used to produce forecasts and hindcasts of ocean waves in on average and extreme conditions these models solve the spectral action balance equation with no a priori restrictions on the shape of the spectrum many efforts have been carried out to assess global sterl et al 1998 cox and swail 2001 caires and sterl 2005 or regional waves kaas et al 1996 soares et al wang and swail

the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr wind data to construct a global wave database with a grid resolution of 0 5 o from 1979 to 2010 but for the selected coastal areas the grid resolutions can be as high as 7 5 km liang et al 2019 established a global wave hindcast database based on the swan model and the era interim wind database these global hindcast wave databases can be used to analyze long term wave climates and trends but the spatial resolution is usually too coarse to represent complex wave fields in coastal areas to produce detailed nearshore wave prediction tiberi wadier et al 2016 constructed a numerical wave database covering the atlantic ocean with a resolution of 1 km along the french coast in the period from 1979 to 2010 the chinese coast faces the northwest pacific ocean typhoons with strong winds and waves occur frequently in summer and autumn posing significant risks to the coastal infrastructures offshore facilities and ships wang et al 2017 shi et al 2017 in winter and spring impacted by the east asian monsoon north northwesterly winds spread from north to south across the eastern coast of china with wind speeds of approximately 5 9 ms 1 the variation of surface winds within the four seasons helps to induce obvious variations in the wave distributions wave data of long duration are needed to thoroughly understand the complex extreme and mean wave states along the chinese coast but such data are rare many studies based on field measurements or satellite altimetry data have been conducted to analyze the extreme and mean distributions of waves in this region xu and huang 2011 feng and jiang 2015 due to the limitations of the observations these studies can only present local wave information or distributions with low resolution wave models have been implemented over the northwest pacific ocean to construct forecast and hindcast waves liang et al 2016 used swan to investigate the wave climate of the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea for the period from 1990 to 2011 zheng and li 2015 explored the climatic long term trends of significant wave height swh in the china sea xu et al 2017 analyzed the temporal and spatial variations in wave fields in the pacific ocean from 2002 to 2011 shao et al 2018 applied a new formula in the simulation of typical cyclone wind fields and obtained more accurate wave predictions during 2011 2014 in the south china sea and the east china sea this paper presents the construction of the wave database and the applications of the data to analyze the wave climate and trends along the chinese coast the hindcast wave database covering main parts of the pacific zone so various components of waves caused by different wind belts can be considered the model is run over the period from 1979 to 2017 and driven by the cfsr wind data this paper is structured as follows the methodology including equations of the wave model numerical domain grid and model setup is described in section 2 section 3 shows the validation and discussion of the results annual and seasonal distributions of maximum and mean wave parameters are presented severe wave events and linear trends of annual 99th percentile swh annual average number duration and intensity of the severe events are discussed finally the paper is concluded in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 model description tomawac benoit et al 1996 was developed by the edf r d s lnhe and is part of the telemac mascaret system www opentelemac org the model solves the wave action balance equation which can be expressed in a spherical spatial coordinate system as 1 n t c λ n λ cos 1 φ c φ n φ c σ n f r c θ n θ q t o t f r 2 q t o t q i n q d s q n l q b f q b r q t r where n is the wave action density spectrum φ is the latitude λ is the longitude f r is the radian frequency and θ represents directions the term q t o t is the source term as regards energy density in shallow water q t o t includes six physical processes reflected in the second equation these are wave growth by the wind janssen 1989 1991 snyder et al 1981 yan 1987 tolman 1992 whitecapping komen et al 1984 janssen 1991 van der westhuysen et al 2007 non linear resonant quadruplet interactions hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 tolman 2004 gagnaiew renou et al 2010 bottom friction bouws and komen 1983 wave breaking induced by bathymetry battjes and janssen 1978 and nonlinear triad interactions madsen and sorensen 1992 respectively 2 2 model setup to get a high resolution wave state at a modest computational cost two nested wave models are used the coarse grid with a larger domain covers the main parts of the pacific ocean from 76 s to 66 n latitude and 100 e to 82 w longitude see fig 1 no wave spectrum is imposed at the boundaries the waves are generated only by wind forcing inside the numerical domain the fine grid focuses on the chinese coast including the bohai sea the yellow sea the east china sea and the north part of the south china sea fig 1 the coarse grid has a resolution of 1 o in the east part of the pacific ocean increasing up to 0 2 o in the northwest pacific and to 10 km resolution along the chinese coast this coarse grid provides wave spectra boundary condition to the fine grid the fine grid has a spatial resolution of 1 km along the coasts in order to capture the wave transformation induced by complex topography and bathymetry in coastal areas the bathymetric data used in the two grids are obtained from the gebco database the oceanic grid comprises 28 946 nodes and 55 549 elements and the coastal grid comprises 91 976 nodes and 178 682 elements the number of directions in the 360 is 36 and the frequencies of the simulated waves are divided into 32 frequencies from 0 0345 hz to 0 66 hz with an increase step of 1 1 the time steps for the coarse and fine grids are 300 s and 200 s respectively the wave simulations cover 39 years from 1979 to 2017 the wave models are forces by the 10 m wind fields from the cfsr database saha et al 2010 the cfsr wind database provides hourly wind components the wind is on a regular grid with spatial resolution of 0 312 and temporal resolution of 1 h these wind fields are linearly interpolated on the coarse and fine grids fig 1 comparisons between the cfsr wind data and those observed by four buoy stations fig 1 are shown in fig 2 the locations of the buoys are shown in table 1 the cfsr performs well in general for all four stations both of the tendency and magnitude of the wind speed and directions provided by cfsr agree well with the measured data the maximum values of wind speed in b3 and b4 are induced by typhoons that means the wind database can capture the maximum values of wind speed during typhoon period with good accuracy to quantitatively assess the match between cfsr wind data and observations the normalized bias nb and the symmetrically normalized root mean square error hh hanna and heinold 1985 mentaschi et al 2015 have been used which are defined as 3 n b 1 n s i o i 1 n o i 4 h h 1 n s i o i 2 1 n s i o i where n is the number of data points o i is reference data obtained from observations and s i is the result provided by the cfsr database the nb indicates the average component of the error and a value closer to zero means a better numerical prediction the hh combines the average and scatter components of the errors which is a synthetic indicator to

absolute value the statistical parameters are listed in table 2 overall the cfsr underestimates the values of wind speeds and wind direction compared with the observations but the discrepancies in wind speed are less than 6 and in wind direction are under 7 that means the cfsr database can provide reasonable wind data for wave simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation to evaluate the performance of the model for simulating waves four buoys located along the chinese coast fig 1 were used to validate the wave model figs 3 and 4 show comparisons between observed and hindcast significant wave height swh and mean period mp for a two month period at the four buoys good agreement is observed between numerical results and buoy measurements for both swh and mp buoys b1 and b2 are located on the northern chinese coast in these areas the anti cyclones developed over siberia usually occur in winter and spring which is the dominant sources of wind forcing and wind waves he et al 2018 from figs 3a b and 4a b we can see that the model can well simulate the variations of swh and mp induced by the anti cyclones for peaks of swh a slight underestimation from the simulations can be seen at b1 during march 8 10 2016 the other two buoys b3 and b4 are located on the southeast chinese coast this region is prone to typhoon waves in summer and autumn feng et al 2012 during typhoon periods the highest peaks reached an swh of 7 m at buoy b3 and up to 3 m at b4 the peaks of swh can be well simulated by the model fig 3c and d in addition mp from simulations reproduces the variations of the observations quite well fig 5 shows the comparisons of wave direction wd in winter and spring the buoys b1 and b2 are mainly impacted by the east asian monsoon the wd is relative stable in north to northeast directions in summer and autumn the interactions between the east asian summer monsoon and the west pacific summer monsoon induced frequent typhoon events the wd becomes more diverse as shown in fig 5 it can be seen the model can predict the variations of the wd with good accuracy the parameters of nb and hh are used to estimate the discrepancies between wave data obtained from simulations and observations the statistical parameters are listed in table 3 the nb between simulations and buoy observations is less than 0 03 for swh while the bias of mp is less than 0 04 all of the nb of mp are negative in proximity of the buoy stations which indicates underestimation of mp by the model but the underestimation of mp is less than 4 for the mp the hh shows that the maximum values of errors are 0 21 for swh and 0 23 for mp the numerical results also show a good prediction of wd since the n b d is lower than 0 04 and h h d is under 0 25 as shown in fig 3 there are four typhoon events occurred at b3 and b4 the magnitudes of nb and hh during the typhoon events are shown in table 4 the maximum values of nb are 4 for swh 5 for mp and 5 for wd the values of hh are less than 0 21 for swh 0 20 for mp and 0 23 for wd thus the wave model can well predict the wave parameters for normal and severe wave conditions at the four buoy stations the comparisons between simulations and buoy measurements can only show the accuracy of numerical simulations at the few probes to obtain the distributions of bias along the chinese coast the simulations are compared with altimeter observations from satellites the altimeter observations are from the globwave database globwave ifremer fr which includes altimeter observations of swh for nine satellites from 1985 until 2019 the numerical results of swh were extracted on the tracks coordinates the wave domain was divided into cells of 0 4 o 0 4 o and the bias between the observed and simulated swh was computed for each cell the mean values for the cells from 1990 to 2017 are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that over the most part of the domain the nb varies between 0 04 the values of nb is less than 0 02 around taiwan and in the regions between hainan and taiwan which corresponds to an accurate reproduction of swh in the north part of the chinese coast and region close to the southwest boundary the negative nb is about 0 03 to 0 04 which reflects the underestimation of swh by the wave model in these areas 3 2 wave climate around chinese coasts 3 2 1 maximum swh and mp wave climate analysis for the chinese coast was determined using the wave hindcast data fig 7 shows the maximum values of swh and mp from 1979 to 2017 it is seen that the maximum swh was found in the east china sea and south china sea the extreme waves increased from north to south the maximum value of swh in the bohai sea was approximately 5 m while in the yellow sea it was under 10 m in the east china sea and northern south china sea the extreme wave heights were much larger the highest swh approximate 18 m occurred off the east coast of taiwan island and was highly correlated with typhoon tracks li et al 2018 typhoons occur frequently along the southeast coast of china over the past 50 years 254 typhoon events have impacted the coasts feng et al 2012 these can induce extreme waves with a maximum swh of 12 14 m in most coastal areas of the east china sea and south china sea as seen in fig 7 protected by taiwan island and hainan island the taiwan strait and areas northwest of hainan have a maximum swh of relatively smaller amplitude ranging from 6 m to 10 m the lower panel of fig 7 shows the distribution of maximum mp which has a strong correlation to the maximum values of swh the maximum values of mp which are about 14 s also occur off the eastern taiwan coast fig 8 presents the distribution of the seasonal maximum swh of the four seasons over the entire temporal span the spatial distributions show an obviously seasonal cycle in summer and autumn the maximum swh generally exceeds 10 m and can reach up to 18 m along typhoon tracks in the east china sea and south china sea in winter and spring the swh is relatively weak with values of less than 6 m in most of the computational domain 3 2 2 100 year return period swh the annual maximum swh were extracted from the hindcast wave database the extreme waves with a given return period can beobtained by using the gumbel distribution castillo 1988 with expressions as follows 7 d x exp exp x α β where d x represents the cumulative distribution function x is the value of a random variable x α and β are the location and scale parameters the mean μ and standard deviation σ is given by 8 μ α γ β 9 σ π β 6 where γ 0 5772 is the euler mascheroni constant for a given t year return year the value of x t can be estimated by 10 x t α β ln ln 1 1 t the annual maximum swh at each grid point in the coastal grid were calculated and the distribution of the 100 year return period swh is shown in fig 9 the distribution of 100 year return period swh is consistent with that of the maximum swh in 1979 2017 fig 7 the largest values of swh more than 20 m are observed in the areas east of taiwan island the 100 year return period swh in the bohai sea are less than 7 m whereas those in the yellow sea are between 6 m and 12 m in the east china sea and north part of the south china sea impacted by typhoon the values of the 100 year return swh are much larger which are 14 22 m and 12 14 m respectively 3 2 3 mean swh and mp the mean values of swh and mp are shown in fig 10 the mean values were calculated by averaging the simulated swh and mp over the 39 year period the mean values of swh increase from land to sea and the values along the chinese coast are within 1 8 m the distribution of swh decreases from south to north the largest values 2 1 m are found to the southeast of taiwan island the lowest mean values of swh and mp are found in bohai sea and the northern yellow sea with mean values of swh under 1 0 m and mp lower than 5 s fig 11 shows the distribution of the mean values of swh for the four seasons the seasonal mean values show a different spatial distribution compared to the annual maximum values the spatial distributions of swh are generally similar within season however the values of swh vary significantly in autumn and winter the mean swh values are relatively larger at 1 3 2 5 m in the northern south china sea 1 6 2 5 m in the east china sea 1 1 5 m in the yellow sea and 0 5 0 8 in the bohai sea in spring and summer the mean values of swh in the northern south china sea and east china sea decrease to under 1 8 m and approximately 0 5 1 0 m and 0 5 0 8 m in the northern yellow sea and bohai sea respectively the maximum values of the mean swh occur in winter at more than 2 5 m at the taiwan strait and southeast of taiwan in winter the east asian monsoon generated from siberia drives cold air from north to south these winds turn to north northeasterly over lower latitudes with wind speeds of up to 9 m s 1 at the taiwan strait resulting in maximum values of swh in these areas in summer however the main wind direction is southerly the overall magnitude of the wind speed is less than half that in winter thus the mean values of swh are much smaller in summer than in autumn and winter in summer the waves are not only generated by local wind but they are impacted by swell from the open pacific ocean the southeasterly swell even dominates the wave climate along chinese coastal areas in summer frequent typhoon events occur in the southeast part of chinese nearshore zones which leads to maximum values of swh in summer off the east coast of taiwan the distributions of seasonal mean mp are presented in fig 12 the maximum values of mp occur in autumn off eastern taiwan with corresponding peak values of swh as seen in fig 11 however in winter and spring the corresponding mean mp at the taiwan strait does not show obviously peak values consistent with the distribution of swh as can also be seen in fig 11 this can be attributed to the prevailing wind directions which are northeast and northwest in winter and spring respectively influenced by the chinese mainland the wind waves cannot be well developed due to the limited fetch length thus the dominant waves in winter and spring are locally generated wind waves with a relatively smaller period than the mixed waves with swells in summer and autumn sheltered by the taiwan island the magnitudes of mp at the strait are even smaller than those of the surrounding seas in summer 3 3 severe wave analysis and long term trends so far we have analyzed the maximum and mean values of swh and mp although the maximum and mean values can represent part of ocean wave information there are many other aspects such as extreme wave number duration and intensity which are also important for coastal protection shipping and offshore construction following the method proposed by weisse and günther 2007 we introduce a severe event threshold set which is the 99th percentile of the total swh based on the values of set the parameters of the extreme events number duration and intensity can be defined as 11 n 1 m i 1 m n j 12 p 1 m i 1 m j 1 n j p i j n j 13 i 1 m i 1 m j 1 n j i i j n j where m is the number of years of the data series n j is the annual number of extreme events p i j is the time of the extreme event when the swh remains above the value of set and i i j is the difference between the maximum swh during a severe event and the set value fig 13 shows the severe wave event climate around the chinese coast based on the hindcast database from 1979 to 2017 the distribution of the 99th percentile swh is presented in fig 13a the maximum value of the 99th percentile swh 6 0 m occurs around taiwan island toward the north the maximum 99th percentile swh decreases to less than 5 m in the yellow sea and approximately 3 m in the bohai sea in the northern south china sea the maximum 99th percentile swh is 4 5 m decreasing to about 2 3 m near the coast enhanced by the winter monsoon the 99th percentile swh in central taiwan strait is up to 6 m close to the coastline the extreme waves are less than 3 m as the main wave energy has been dissipated by bottom friction and breaking turning to the annual number of severe events the regions of highest frequency are at the bohai sea the northern yellow sea the taiwan strait and the northwest part of the south china sea with average severe wave events numbering 5 6 per year in most of the east china sea and south china sea the severe event threshold set is exceeded on average 2 5 4 0 times a year with a mean duration of about 10 15 h in the yellow sea and bohai sea the average duration increases to 20 25 h per extreme event the longest average duration of up to 30 h can be found to the southwest of taiwan island the typical intensities of these events vary between 0 5 m and 1 5 m in the yellow sea and bohai sea in the east and south china seas the maximum intensities can be up to 3 0 m in regions with typhoon tracks figs 14 16 show the seasonal mean of the extreme event number duration and intensity it can be noticed that the occurrence of extreme waves varies significantly by season in the bohai sea northern yellow sea and taiwan strait the severe events are mainly observed in winter and autumn on average 3 and 1 2 times respectively these severe wave events can be attributed to the northeast wind induced by the east asian monsoon in the remainder of the east china sea and south china sea however set values are exceeded in summer and autumn these extreme waves are mainly induced by typhoon events the seasonal differences of the events can also be noticed in the seasonal distributions of the average duration influenced by typhoon events the average durations are approximate 20 25 h in summer and autumn in the east china sea and south china sea in the bohai sea and yellow sea the events mainly occur in winter with durations of 10 15 h the average intensity also shows obvious seasonal differences in regions impacted by typhoon events severe wave events are more intense with an average intensity of 2 3 m in contrast the average intensities in the bohai sea and yellow sea are less than 1 m wave climate trend is described by a linear slope of the severe wave event characteristics at each computation node a positive slope indicates an increase of a characteristic and a negative slope represents a decrease the calculated slope was assessed by the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1955 only areas with slopes statistically different from zero at the 95 significance level are shown fig 17 presents the linear trends for the 99th percentile swh overall positive trends are observed in most part of chinese seas this increasing trend in swh is consistent with previous studies such as young and babanin 2011 and zheng and li 2015 the maximum increase 3 cm yr 1 of the 99th percentile swh can be found southeast of taiwan in the north part of the east china sea the positive trends are weakened by an increase in extreme swh on the order of 1 2 cm yr 1 this increasing trend of the extreme swh is induced by the more intense typhoon events occurring in summer and autumn in this area yumoto and matsuura 2001 ho et al 2004 in the northern yellow sea and the bohai sea there is no significant trend with a positive slope of less than 1 5 cm yr 1 in the northern south china sea the rate of increase of swh is around 1 2 cm yr 1 and the positive trends are weakened near the west coast of hainan island figs 18 20 shows the linear trends of the annual mean number duration and intensity of the severe events in most parts of the chinese seas the rate of increase decrease is less than 0 05 times per year exceptions can be found in the southwestern bohai sea the northern yellow sea and the northern south china sea the maximum value of the rate of increase is 0 17 time per year and the maximum rate of decrease is 0 2 time per year the trends of duration can be seen in fig 19 in most parts of the east china sea the trends that are statistically significant are less than 95 which are not shown the changes in duration are not significant the increasing trends of the duration occur mainly in the western bohai sea areas southeast of taiwan island and the central part between hainan and taiwan island decreasing trends can be found in most of the yellow sea and areas southwest of taiwan island with the strongest negative trends of 0 3 0 4 h yr 1 fig 20 shows the distribution of extreme event intensity trends the positive negative trends are highly correlated with the increasing decreasing trends of the durations fig 19 the maximum increase rate is 0 06 m yr 1 occurring mainly in the southeast and southwest areas off the taiwan coast and the central area between hainan and taiwan island the maximum decrease rate 0 06 m yr 1 is observed near the south coast of taiwan 4 conclusions a chinese wave database cwave using the wave model tomawac covering the period from 1979 to 2017 is presented the computational grids are refined along the chinese coast with spatial resolution of about 1 km the wave model is forced with the wind field from cfsr database over the whole domain using observations from four buoy stations the model s capability to reproduce time series of swh and mp is assessed results show that the model can well predict the variations of swh and mp in both extreme and general waves the nb between simulations and observations is under 0 03 for swh and 0 04 for mp spatial distributions of bias are obtained through comparison to satellite altimetry data in most chinese sea areas this database can provide long and homogeneous time series of wave parameters such as swh mp and wave direction with high spatial resolution 1 km along the chinese coast these data are essential to wave climate analysis as current observational instruments cannot provide data with high spatial and temporal detail the maximum 100 year return period and mean values of wave parameters were analyzed based on the wave database over the period from 1979 to 2017 the spatial distributions of the maximum and mean swh show that the waves increase from north to south induced by typhoon events the maximum swh occurs off the east coast of taiwan with a value of 18 m and the corresponding maximum mp is 14 s to demonstrate the seasonal variation of swh and mp the distributions of maximum and mean swh are presented there is a noticeable seasonal difference in the variation of maximum and mean values the maximum values of swh up to 18 m occur along the southeast coast of china along typhoon tracks in summer and autumn the maximum swh in winter and spring is much weaker with values less than 6 m the seasonal distributions of the mean values of swh are much different than those of the maximum values the mean values in autumn and winter are relatively larger than in spring and summer the differences can be attributed to seasonal changes in the magnitude of the wind speed the analysis of severe wave events and long term trends was also carried out based on the set values in this study it was chosen as the 99th percentile swh the results reveal that the regions around taiwan island experience the maximum set values about 6 m severe events occur most frequently about 5 6 annually in the bohai sea northern yellow sea taiwan strait and northwestern south china sea these events are mainly induced by high wind speeds in autumn and winter in the remaining part of the east and south china seas the number decreases to 2 5 3 5 times per year which is impacted by typhoon events in summer and autumn the average durations above the set values are 20 30 h during typhoon events and 10 15 h in winter the intensity induced by typhoons can be 2 3 m larger than the set values while waves induced by cold waves have a maximum swh less than 1 m above the set values the long term trends are represented by the linear slopes of severe event characteristics the analysis reveals an increasing trend in most part of the chinese seas and the rate of increase decrease is lower than 0 05 times per year the trends of the 99th percentile swh are mainly associated with changes in the number and intensity of severe wave events the trends in times and durations are not obvious with a maximum of 0 2 times and 0 5 h per year the intensity remains nearly unchanged in the yellow sea and bohai sea but increases approximately 6 cm per year along the typhoon tracks however it must be pointed out that the long term hindcast wave fields are driven by the cfsr wind fields which are not statistically homogeneous with time saha et al 2010 thus the long term trends of wave climate might be impacted by inhomogeneities in the wind analyses to improve the understanding of wave climate change homogeneous wave fields in time are needed to well describe the wave climate for the past

22767,the cap effects on the wave forces acting on the piles underneath the cap are important for the estimation of the wave loads on the elevated pile cap foundations of sea crossing bridges full scale 3 dimensional numerical simulations are carried out for large square caps with piles placed at different locations underneath the influences of wave height wave length cap dimension and submerged depth on the cap effects are investigated the analytical method is introduced and its solutions are compared with the numerical simulation results the results show that the wave forces on piles are influenced by the free surface runup and rundown in front of the cap and the negative force on the pile near the front edge of the cap can be remarkably larger than the positive force with large wave height the cap coefficient k c a p decreases with the increase of the relative cap dimension the cap shows force increasing effect on piles when the relative cap dimension is smaller i e k c a p 1 which should be highly concerned in the sea crossing bridge design keywords computational fluid dynamics cfd cap effect wave force pile cap foundation sea crossing bridge flow field 1 introduction in recent decades the constructions of the sea crossing bridges have undergone rapid development in china such as the east sea bridge the hangzhou bay bridge the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge etc further the bridge across qiongzhou strait has been planned with the increased water depth in navigable water level the elevated caps with pile group are commonly used as the foundations for the most sea crossing bridges due to the harsh environment in the offshore region the extreme value of wave loads on foundations is an important factor for the design and construction of the sea crossing bridges the substructure of sea crossing bridges is usually an irregular composite composed of pile group pile cap and pier whose dimensions are large and vary with the loads of the superstructure as an example fig 1 shows the sketch of an elevated cap foundation of a cable stayed bridge for the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge the tremendous loads of the superstructure require considerably large dimensions of the cap supported by a large number of piles underneath the complex geometry makes the estimation of the wave loads on substructures quite difficult currently the determination of wave current loads on foundations of already constructed sea crossing bridges in china is mainly dependent on the laboratory experiments that focus on engineering application taking the hangzhou bay bridge and the east sea bridge for example the specific physical experiments were performed to serve the design lan et al 2005 the estimation methods of wave loads acting on pile cap and pile group foundation are different because of their relative dimensions to wave length the morison equation morison et al 1950 is thought to be a good approximation for evaluating wave forces on a slender pile under the condition that the dimension of the pile is so small that the presence of the pile does not disturb the wave field based on the morison equation the total wave force consists of a velocity dependent drag force and an acceleration dependent inertia force note that an appropriate choice of wave theory and hydrodynamic coefficients drag coefficient c d and inertia coefficient c m is essential for wave force calculation when using the morison equation the wave load on a single slender pile which is located in pile group composed of closely spaced vertical piles is significantly affected by the neighboring piles mindao et al 1987 introduced two parameters named shelter coefficient and interference coefficient for tandem arrangement and side by side arrangement of the piles respectively both the coefficients are proposed in terms of the force ratio k g f p g f s p in which f p g is the wave force on a slender pile within pile group and f s p is the wave force on an isolated single pile it is found that the wave induced force on a slender pile within pile group depends on the keulegan carpenter number k c u max t d u max is the maximum horizontal velocity t is wave period and d is pile diameter and relative spacing between the neighboring piles li et al 1992 bonakdar and oumeraci 2014 generally the pile cap is large enough to produce scattering effects the morison equation is then inappropriate because diffraction must be considered based on the linear diffraction theory wave forces and moments on a large circular cylinder can be estimated by an analytical solution developed by maccamy and fuchs 1954 this method has been verified by some experiments mogridge and jamieson 1975 neelamani et al 1989 for bridge foundations a combined method for calculating wave loads is presented by pan et al 2013 the wave force on cap is calculated according to the diffraction theory such as the boundary element method while the wave loads on pile group are calculated by applying the morison equation then the total wave loads on a foundation is the sum of the two separated calculated forces the difficulties in estimating the wave forces on substructures of sea crossing bridges are not only caused by the enormous difference of pile size and cap size which results in the different calculation methods are used i e the morison equation and the linear diffraction theory respectively but also caused by the interactions between the piles in pile group and the interactions between the cap and piles underneath the influences of interactions between piles namely shelter coefficient and interference coefficient have been studied widely such as mindao et al 1987 however the interaction between the cap and piles underneath receives few attentions for example the total wave load on a foundation is suggested to be obtained by summing the wave force on pile group and wave force on cap by pan et al 2013 but the interaction effect between the cap and piles is neglected wave loads studies on similar pile supported structures such as jetties and offshore platforms whose slabs are ordinarily exposed in air have drawn more attentions and accordingly several estimation methods have been proposed cuomo et al 2007 the caps of the foundations of sea crossing bridges are ordinarily partially submerged in normal water level situation especially for major navigable bridges cap height is designed to be not fully submerged in local high water level for navigation safety also not too high to ensure the pile group is not exposed in local low water level for aesthetic purpose the special position and the considerable dimensions of the cap would result in significant disturbance to the wave field which would introduce non negligible force changes on the piles underneath the cap in addition the cap bottom could be now and then wetted and dry in one wave circle with extreme wave conditions it is much more complicated in such conditions with air entrapped under cap during the wave structure interaction chen et al 2018 with the foundation of the east sea bridge in china as a prototype a series of model tests have been performed by liu et al 2007 to determine wave current loads on oblique piles and pile group a reduction coefficient of 0 7 was suggested for the force reducing effect on the wave current forces on pile groups with cap chen et al 2018 investigated high rise pile cap foundation used to support offshore wind turbines in the donghai bridge wind farm china they found that the maximum horizontal wave load on all the piles with the cap can increase by 30 compared with those without the cap and the maximum horizontal wave load on a single pile is nearly doubled these studies indicate that the influence of cap involves both force reducing and increasing effects on piles however systematical studies on the influencing parameters for cap effects on pile group are rare to the best of our knowledge this study aims to give insight into the mechanisms of how the wave force changes on piles by the influence of the cap and how the cap effect coefficient changes with the main influencing parameters such as the wave height wave length cap dimension and submerged depth 2 numerical methods and validation 2 1 modeling of the numerical wave tank a well established numerical code ansys fluent is used to perform the 3 dimensional 3d computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis the ansys fluent using finite volume method fvm solves reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to obtain the pressure field and the consequent forces on structure ansys fluent previously has been used to study the interaction between the bridge superstructure and waves with 2 dimensional 2d model xu and cai 2014 xu et al 2017 huang and xiao 2009 used the k ε turbulence model to simulate the 2d incompressible flow of viscous fluid zhan et al 2014 established a 3d numerical wave tank with renormalization group rng k ε turbulence model for irregular wave propagation over partly vegetated waters results of these studies show that ansys fluent is capable of simulating wave structure interaction quite well the conservations of the mass and momentum in the rans equations are respectively as follows 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i ρ g i x j μ u i x j u j x i ρ u i u

p is pressure g i is acceleration μ and μ t are molecular and eddy viscosities respectively δ i j is kronecker delta ρ u i u j is reynolds stress which represents the effects of the turbulent flow on the mean flow field and k 1 2 u i u j is turbulent kinetic energy to appropriately model the reynolds stress the rng k ε model which is based on renormalization group method is employed as the turbulence closure for the rans equations the detail of this model can be found in orszag and yakhot 1986 the wall treatment of scalable wall function was applied in order to increase the flexibility of grid size near wall the scalable wall function uses a lower limiter to achieve y plus 11 06 which prevents the first grid point to slide into the linear profile area therefore any size of fine grids can be used with the scalable wall function cheng and tak 2006 the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 has been applied in ansys fluent to capture the free surface motions the mixture multiphase model consists of air and water and each of two phases is considered to have a separately defined volume fraction 4 α x t 0 a i r 1 w a t e r 0 α s 1 f r e e s u r f a c e then the density and dynamic viscosity of cells filled with mixed fluid can be determined by the volume fraction the volume fraction function is determined by solving equation 5 α t x i α u i x i α 1 α u α i 0 where u α is a relative compression velocity weller et al 1998 and the last term on left hand side is artificial compression term to limit numerical diffusion the free surfaces are extracted as α w a t e r 0 5 in the following simulations a three dimensional numerical wave tank with a length of 500 m height of 25 m is used in the study to simulate the wave interaction with structures as shown in fig 2 the water depth is fixed as h 15 m and the width of the wave tank varies with the dimension of the structures a region of 30 m is constructed to accommodate modeling of the piston type wave maker center of the structures cap or piles will be placed in the wave propagating region where 250 m away from the wave paddle a wave absorption zone is installed at the end of the tank in a 150 m long region at the top of the numerical wave tank where the fluid is air the boundary condition is set as opening with relative pressure 0 pa allowing the air flow through the boundary the wave paddle bottom and back wall of the numerical wave tank are modeled as solid walls where no slip boundary condition is applied in widthwise direction the sidewalls are set as symmetrical boundary the left hand boundary of the wave maker region incorporates the dynamic mesh chen et al 2016 in this region the paddle moves sinusoidally with specified mesh motion velocity u 6 u s π t sin 2 π t t where s is the stroke of the piston t is the wave period and t is time the relation between the stroke of the piston and the wave height is given below gomes et al 2009 7 h s 2 cosh 2 k 0 h 1 sinh 2 k 0 h 2 k 0 h where h is the wave height and k 0 is the wave number the user define function udf in ansys fluent code allows us to control the motion of the paddle by giving the velocity of the paddle at each time step in wave absorption zone the computational velocity is reduced to zero and the free surface is reduced to the still water level in a smooth manner celebi 1997 an artificial damping term ρ θ u i is added to the left side of momentum equation eq 2 in which 8 θ 0 0 x x 0 x x 0 x 1 x 0 θ 1 x 0 x x 1 where x 0 and x 1 are the start and end coordinates of the absorption zone respectively θ 1 is the damping coefficient which can be determined empirically larsen and dancy 1983 romate 1992 chen et al 2014 discussed the effectiveness of θ 1 and based on which θ 1 3 is applied in all the simulations in this study the full scale simulations of the pile cap model require large computational domain considering the effects of side walls to lower computing cost non uniform grids are utilized for different regions in the following sections an empty wave tank without any structures is modeled first and the mesh sensitivity study is carried out to confirm the proper grid distribution for wave generation and propagation then all the wave cases used in this study are examined in the empty wave tank to obtain the accurate incident wave conditions and to confirm the effectiveness of the absorption zone then the capability of the numerical model to simulate wave forces on cylinder is validated with experimental data and the grid convergence is studied for the meshes around the cylinder 2 2 validation of the numerical wave tank a numerical wave tank without structure was modeled first to verify the wave generation propagation and absorption in ansys fluent software 2d simulation of waves using k ε turbulence model will cause significant wave decaying in order to overcome this problem width of the wave tank is set as 50 m and meshed with 10 grids uniformly discretization hexahedral grids are generated for computation domain as shown in fig 3 a total of 50 grids are distributed at vertical direction with refined mesh of d z 0 05 m at the vicinity of the mean water level to capture the free surface the water depth is 15 m and the influence of the bottom wall on the formation of waves at the free surface is negligible thus girds with size of d z 0 1 m are installed near the bottom wall and y plus value is not considered in spanwise direction mesh is refined near the wave paddle with minimum d x 0 1 m uniform grids with size of d x 2 m are installed in wave propagating region the grid size in absorption zone is increased gradually towards the back wall to save computing cost two sets of regular waves as listed in table 1 will be used for the simulations of pile cap model set 1 are waves of t 8 s with varying wave heights from h 1 m 5 m and set 2 for t 6 s 8 s and 10 s with same wave height h 2 m the fifth order stokes wave of t 8 s and h 5 m is examined first which is the most stringent case with the largest wave steepness used in the study the time step is fixed as d t 0 025 s and the total simulation time is 150 s time series of the surface elevation measured at x 0 m are presented in fig 4 the grid convergence study for wave propagation is carried out by varying the uniform grid size in wave propagating region from d x 1 m 6 m see fig 4 a evident wave decaying is observed for grid size 4 m and 6 m the damping effect is reduced as the grid size is reduced to 2 m and the improvement in the results on further reducing the grid size to 1 m is neglectable thus grid size of d x 2 m at wave propagating direction is selected for the following simulations fig 4 b is the completed time series of the measured elevation at x 0 m the measured wave amplitude in the final periodic state is stable after first few waves and the nonlinear feature of larger crest amplitudes than trough amplitudes is well pronounced fig 5 presents the corresponding surface elevation in the numerical wave tank at t 90 s it is seen that the wave energy is absorbed smoothly in the absorption zone x 100 m and no evident reflection is observed however the measured wave height in the final periodic state is about 4 66 m for the case of t 8 s and h 5 m evident discrepancy with the inputted wave heights are also observed for other cases as listed in table 1 this is because the motion of the piston type wave maker controlled by eq 6 is based on the first order wavemaker theory for large wave steepness the generated waves evolve by self adjusting during propagation and result in lower wave height this phenomenon is more pronounced for shorter waves and commonly observed for laboratory generated waves madsen 1970 fig 6 presents the whole time series of the measured surface elevation for the cases of t 6 s and t 10 s with the same input wave height h 2 m larger discrepancy is observed for shorter waves of t 6 s and more accurate wave height h 1 98 m is measured for t 10 s considering these the measured values listed in table 1 are used in the following analysis as the actual incident wave conditions 2 3 validation of the wave loads calculated by the numerical model the numerical model was validated by simulating the experiments carried out at the large wave flume gwk hannover germany by mo et al 2007 the numerically computed values of the free surface elevation around the cylinder and the wave forces on the cylinder were compared with the experimental data to confirm the accuracy of the numerical model the wave flume in the experiments is 309 m of length 5 m of width and 7 m of depth a cylinder of diameter d 0 7 m was placed 111 m downstream of the wave maker and strain gages were placed at the top and bottom of the cylinder to measure wave forces wave gages were placed at several locations around the cylinder to measure the time histories of the free surface elevations non breaking regular wave with a wave height h 1 2 m and wave period t 4 s was generated in water with initial depth h 4 76 m in this simulation the numerical wave tank is 120 m of length 5 m of width and 8 m of height the cylinder is placed in the center with respect to the side walls as shown in fig 7 the grids distribution for this simulation follows the same pattern as that for the empty wave tank validated in section 2 2 but the grid size in different regions have been scaled down 3 to 4 times considering the scale of this simulation is smaller non uniform grids with minimum grid d z 0 02 m near the free surface and bottom are placed in the vertical direction in the streamwise direction uniform grids of d x 0 5 m are placed upstream and downstream of the cylinder for wave propagation finer grids with d x 0 1 m 0 5 m are installed near the wavemaker and coarser grids of d x 0 5 m 2 m are placed in the absorption zone uniform grids of d y 0 2 m is placed in the widthwise direction finer grids are placed in the region around the cylinder surface with the inner most grid size set as 0 02 m and there were 60 grids along the perimeter of the cylinder four wave gages named wg1 wg2 wg3 and wg4 are positioned near the cylinder to record the surface elevations wave gage wg0 located at 29 5 m upstream of the cylinder is set to confirm the incident wave condition which is measured as h 1 2 m the mesh sensitivety to the wave force on cylinder is studied by varying the grid size of the inner most layer around the cylinder from 0 005 m to 0 1 m fig 8 a presents the comparison of the calculated inline wave forces and four lines are overlapped with each other mo et al 2007 noted that the force measured in the experiment matched well with the inertia force given by the morison equation with c m 2 indicating the forces are inertia dominated with k c 6 1 improvement with finer grids for wall treatment is unnecessary and the selected grid size i e 0 02 m is sufficiently small to calculate the force on cylinder with the inner most grid size of 0 02 m the numerically calculated inline force on cylinder is compared with the experimental data in fig 8 b and excellent agreement is observed the numerically obtained free surface elevations recorded by the four wave gages around the cylinder are compared with the experimental data in fig 9 the free surface elevations are normalized by the peak value recorded by the wg1 in general the numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental measurements some characteristic ripples at the wave troughs measured in front of the cylinder by wg2 are well predicted see fig 9 b the good agreement demonstrates confidence in using this numerical model in this study 3 analytical formulae for wave forces on the piles under square cap to investigate the cap effects on the wave forces acting on piles the understanding of the flow field disturbed by the cap is important it is difficult to obtain the analytical solutions of the 3d flow field under the square cap therefore the analytical solution of the 2d flow field is aimed the dimensions of the caps are so large that it is reasonable to treat the cap as a two dimensional obstacle fixed in the free surface when the incident waves propagate perpendicular to the front surface as shown in fig 10 in which d is the dimension of the cap in wave direction s is the submerged depth of the cap and h is the water depth mei and black 1969 proposed a solution for this problem as the basis of numerical computations within the framework of linearized potential theory which is outlined in the following with assumptions of a perfect fluid and small amplitudes the velocity potential 9 φ x z t ϕ x z e i ω t is split into a symmetric and an asymmetric part 10 ϕ x z ϕ s x z ϕ a x z 2 in which ϕ s x z and ϕ a x z are symmetric and asymmetric parts respectively then the analysis can be restricted to x 0 only the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the potential for regions ω 1 and ω 2 see fig 10 can be expressed by appropriate eigen function expansions for brevity the potentials for our concerning region ω 2 are outlined here 11 ϕ 2 s x z i g a ω b 0 s y 0 λ 0 z n 1 b n s cosh λ n x cosh λ n b y n λ n z x d 2 h z s 12 ϕ 2 a x z i g a ω b 0 a x b y 0 λ 0 z n 1 b n a sinh λ n x sinh λ n b y n λ n z x d 2 h z s where i 1 a is the incident wave amplitude ω is the wave frequency g is gravity acceleration b is half cap length and y n λ n z is the orthonormal set over the interval s z 0 with λ n n π h s n 0 1 2 when the orthonormal conditions are used the linear equations with respect to the unknown coefficients b 0 s and b n a can be obtained using the continuity of ϕ at x d 2 and the continuity of the horizontal velocity ϕ x at x d 2 details about solving the equations can be found in mei and black 1969 then the velocity and acceleration at any point x y in the region ω 2 can be obtained as u φ 2 x and u 2 φ 2 x t respectively our interest is the wave forces on piles located in region ω 2 the diameter d of the piles is relatively small compared with the wave length thus wave force on a pile under cap can be obtained by submitting the horizontal particle velocities and accelerations into the morison equation 13 f p h s 1 2 c d ρ d u u c m ρ π d 2 4 u d z 4 wave forces on the piles under square cap 4 1 set up of the pile cap model the pile cap foundation in the simulations is composed of a square cap and three piles as shown in fig 11 the side length d of the cap is 30 m with the height of 5 m the cap is semi submerged in still water the water depth h is15 m and the submerged depth s is 2 5 m three piles with the same diameter d 1 m named as p1 p2 and p3 are placed near the leading edge in the middle and before the rear edge of the cap respectively the purpose of this set up is to qualitatively compare the cap effects on the piles of different locations because the distribution of the piles under cap could be complicated and the spacing between piles is small in real foundations see fig 1 the locations of pile p1 and p3 are fixed at 0 1 d away from the leading and trailing edges of the cap respectively the same set up has been applied for the caps with different dimensions in section 5 in order to focus on cap effects on piles only the center to center spacing between the neighboring piles is larger than 5 d in this case thus the influence between the piles is neglectable bonakdar and oumeraci 2015 note that we set up the pile cap model whose cap bottom is always wetted in whole wave cycle intentionally because the effect of the entrapped air under cap is not considered in this study the center of the pile cap foundation is placed at x 0 m in the computational domain defined from x 250 m 250 m with width of 16 d as shown in fig 12 a in order to compare the wave forces on piles with and without the influence of the cap the wave force on an isolated single pile with diameter d 1 m under the same wave conditions were also simulated similar computational domain with the same length and a width of 20 m was used the isolated single pile was placed at the central location as well as shown in fig 12 b note that the wave force on isolated single pile f s p is calculated by integrating pressure over z in the range of the same effective length of the piles in the cases with cap see fig 11 b non uniform grids are installed in the computational domain similar as the empty wave tank described in section 2 2 the mesh refinement around the pile cap model is shown in fig 13 to save the computing cost the y plus value restricted under 300 is only considered on the surfaces of the piles with the finest first layer grid size of 0 002 m the first layer grids on surfaces of the cap are refined with grid size of 0 1 m in widthwise direction non uniform grids with d y 0 1 m near the cap to d y 5 m near the side walls are installed 4 2 wave forces on the piles under square cap regular waves of set 1 listed in table 1 were selected as the incident waves the relative wave height h h ranges from 0 06 to 0 31 covering linear waves to 5th order stokes waves with the pile diameter d 1 m the k c number ranges from 3 1 where inertia regime dominates to 14 3 where both drag force and inertia force must be considered the total simulation time is 120 s with fixed time step d t 0 025 s to ensure numerical stability during the entire simulation fig 14 presents the completed time histories of the inline wave forces on p1 p2 and p3 for the two representative cases i e h h 0 06 and h h 0 31 it is seen for both cases that the stable final periodic state of the force curve is observed after about t 60 s for all the cases the first period after t 80 s will be taken as the effective time duration for further analysis the inline wave forces on piles under the cap for the low relative wave height h h 0 06 are compared with that of the isolated single pile f s p in fig 15 a the inline force curves of the three piles and the isolated single pile approximately remain sinusoidal with the linear incident waves the amplitudes of the wave forces on the three piles under the cap are smaller than that of the isolated single pile indicating the presence of the cap shows force reducing effect on the piles underneath among the three piles p1 has the largest positive peak value and the largest negative peak value the positive peak values of the p2 and p3 are approximately equal to their negative peak values as to p1 the negative peak value is slightly larger than the positive peak value for the case of h h 0 31 shown in fig 15 b the nonlinearity of the incident waves is demonstrated by the asymmetry of the wave force curve of the isolated single pile whose positive peak value is reasonably larger than the negative peak value with the estimated k c 14 3 the drag force component and the inertia force component are both important in this case and the phase difference makes the wave force curve exhibit wider crests and troughs when summing these two components the positive peak forces of the three piles under the cap is smaller than that of the isolated single pile which shows the same force reducing effect of the cap as the case of h h 0 06 among the three piles p1 has the largest positive peak force and the largest negative peak force the negative peak force is evidently larger than the positive force on p1 the variation of the largest positive and negative forces on piles with h h is presented in fig 16 the peak values of the wave forces on the isolated single pile without cap f s p are also plotted to form a baseline comparison it can be concluded from fig 16 that 1 the largest positive force of the isolated single pile gradually becomes larger than the largest negative force with the increase of h h due to the increasing nonlinearity of the incident waves 2 compared with the largest positive wave forces on the isolated single pile the largest positive wave forces on the piles p1 p2 and p3 are reduced by the cap effects 3 the largest negative wave forces on the pile p1 are remarkably increased compared with that of the isolated single pile the increment becomes larger when h h increases however the largest negative forces on the pile p2 are smaller than those on the isolated single pile except for h h 0 31 where the largest negative forces are almost equal to that on the isolated single pile see fig 16 b the same pattern is observed for the pile p3 shown in fig 16 c 4 with the influence of the cap evident difference between positive and negative forces is observed for the pile p1 for all the cases and the difference becomes larger when h h increases for h h 0 31 the largest negative force on p1 is 47 larger than the positive force for the pile p2 and p3 the largest positive and negative forces are almost equal to each other when the wave height is smaller i e h h 0 06 and 0 13 as h h increases the negative force gradually become larger than the positive force i e h h 0 25 and 0 31 but to a less extent than p1 4 3 causes of the large force on the pile near the front edge of the cap to investigate the causes of the large force on the pile p1 two wave gages w g f and w g p 1 were used as shown in fig 11 w g f is placed closely in front of the cap and w g p 1 is placed near the sidewall with the same coordinate x as the pile p1 the measured surface elevations and the wave force on pile p1 are drawn together the cases of h h 0 06 and h h 0 31 in fig 17 the surface elevations are normalized by the maximum amplitude η m a x measured by w g p 1 in fig 17 a the peak value of the wave force on p1 occurs synchronously with the zero crossing of the surface elevation measured by w g p 1 as well as the peak forces on p1 marked as b and e in fig 17 b implying they are mainly the acceleration dependent inertia force note that the distance between the locations of w g f and w g p 1 along x direction is small compared with the wave length while in fig 17 b phase advance of approximately 0 4 π is observed for the surface elevation measured by w g f compared with w g p 1 the increased phase difference implies earlier appearance of the crests and troughs measured by w g f which is almost in phase with the peak forces of p1 similar phase advance is observed for the wave trough measured by w g f in fig 17 a the heightened or lowered surface elevations in front of the cap cause pressure difference in the vicinity of the pile p1 which increases the water particle acceleration and eventually results in larger wave force on p1 furthermore the heightened crest and lowered trough measured by w g f are basically symmetrical for h h 0 06 while for h h 0 31 the crest measured by w g f is 24 higher than the incident wave crest and the trough is 86 lower than the incident wave trough this explains the phenomenon of the negative force on p1 larger than the positive force is more evident for larger relative wave height i e h h 0 31 to obtain further clarity on the wave structure interaction fig 18 presents the snapshots of the velocity distribution on the vertical plane through the three pile centers and the free surface elevation contours at the five instants t 78 s t 79 s t 80 2 s t 82 s and t 83 s which are marked as a b c d and e in fig 17 b the red line in the velocity distribution snapshot is the wave profile measured on the side wall representing the undisturbed wave surface elevation fig 18 a shows the wave crest approaches the cap with the water particles moving upward in front of the cap in fig 18 b the wave runup at the front face of the cap increases the horizontal flow velocities around the pile p1 are small indicating that the horizontal flow acceleration is around its peak value the first peak of wave force on p1 appears at the instant marked as b in fig 17 b with the part of the flow going underneath the cap a sunken crest appears in front of the cap shown by the free surface elevation contours in fig 18 c the wave crest is passing the location of p1 and the horizontal velocity around p1 almost reaches its peak value summation of the velocity dependent drag force and acceleration dependent inertia force reaches the second peak value marked as c in fig 17 b the interaction between waves and the cap not only dissipates part of wave energy but also reserves a part of potential energy in the form of the heightened free surface which is converted from the kinetic energy of the water particle during the running up process in fig 18 d when the wave trough approaches the surface elevation in front of the cap starts to drop down with a majority of water particles moving upstream and downward and small parts moving downstream the potential energy reserved in the heightened surface elevation converts into the kinetic energy of the moving water particles and makes the surface elevation in front of the cap drop down quickly in fig 18 e the elevation in front of the cap is remarkably lower than that of the undisturbed wave elevation that is represented by the red line the evident sunken surface in front of the cap can be seen from the free surface elevation contours lowered surface elevation in front of the cap increases the negative particle accelerations which is occurring around p1 and ultimately induces larger negative wave force of p1 generally the wave runup and rundown in front of the cap increases the wave force on the pile near the front edge of the cap namely p1 the wave rundown is more significant than the wave runup corresponding to the larger negative force on p1 than the positive force on the other hand the surface elevations of the transmitted waves at the downstream should have similar effects on the wave force on pile p3 but the wave amplitudes behind the cap are considerably reduced 0 47 h for the case of h h 0 06 and 0 49 h for the case of h h 0 31 were measured behind the cap meanwhile the wave runup and rundown behind the cap are not in phase with the peak forces on p3 therefore the wave forces on p3 are barely influenced by the surface elevations of the transmitted waves at the downstream and no evident increase of the wave force on p3 is observed 5 cap effects on wave forces acting on the piles underneath the cap to quantify the cap effects on the wave forces on piles the cap effect coefficient is defined 14 k c a p f p m a x f s p m a x f p and f s p are the wave forces on the piles with and without cap respectively absolute value of peak forces is taken to make the cap effect coefficient be conservative because the negative force on pile under cap is probably larger than the positive force based on the analytical solution previous works by mei and black 1969 have shown that the wave energy transmitted through the surface obstacle is strongly dependent on the obstacle dimension submerged depth and wave length the influence of these parameters on the cap effect coefficient are investigated separately in the following subsections 5 1 influence of wave height on cap effect coefficients the influences of wave height on the wave forces on the piles under cap have been discussed in section 4 with the cases of set 1 listed in table 1 fig 19 presents the variation of k c a p for piles p1 p2 and p3 with the relative wave heights compared with the analytical value calculated by eq 13 with hydrodynamic coefficients c d 1 2 and c m 2 0 the analytical method is based on the linearized potential theory with small amplitude assumption which does not reflect the effects of the free surface runup and rundown in front of the cap thus all the analytical values were calculated at the center underneath the cap it is seen in fig 19 that the cap effect coefficient k c a p of p1 increases from 0 97 to 1 2 when h h increases from 0 06 to 0 31 for p2 and p3 the k c a p almost remains as a constant around 0 75 and agrees well with analytical values indicating that the force reducing effect on the piles with certain distances away from the leading edge of the cap does not evidently vary with the incident wave heights 5 2 influence of the relative cap dimension on cap effect coefficients the influences of the relative cap dimension d l on the cap effect coefficients are investigated four caps with dimension of d 7 5 m 15 m 30 m and 45 m are considered and the relative cap dimension d h accordingly ranges from 0 5 to 3 the same set up as shown in fig 11 is applied i e the diameter of the piles is still d 1 m and the piles p1 and p3 are placed 0 1 d away from the leading and trailing edges of the cap respectively the length of the computational domain remains unchanged as 500 m but the width 16 d varies corresponding to the cap dimension three regular waves of set 2 listed in table 1 with wave lengths ranging from 53 4 m to 109 4 m are used as incident waves the corresponding cases of isolated single pile without cap are also simulated with the same wave conditions to obtain the absolute peak value f s p m a x the variation of the wave forces on piles with cap dimension is presented in fig 20 in each subfigure the left part shows the horizontal positive and negative peak forces of each case it is noticed that for the isolated single pile the positive peak forces are larger than the negative forces as a result only the positive forces on the isolated single pile are presented larger negative forces than positive forces on p1 are obviously seen in all the cases presented in the figure for each wave case slightly larger difference between the positive and negative forces on p1 is observed for the small cap dimension d h 0 5 in which the pile p1 is closer to the leading edge of the cap and is more affected by the surface elevation in front of the cap for cases with longer wave length l 82 9 m and l 109 4 m evident larger negative forces than positive forces on p2 and p3 are also observed for small cap dimensions d h 0 5 and d h 1 the right part in each subfigure of fig 20 shows the variation of the cap effect coefficient k c a p with the relative cap dimension when d h 0 5 the values of k c a p for p1 p2 and p3 are close to each other and are larger than 1 0 regardless of the wave length indicating that the smaller cap dimension has almost the same force increasing effects on the three piles the wave force on p2 is slightly smaller than p1 and p3 this is because the spacing between the neighboring piles is small the center to center distance between the piles is fixed as 0 4 d the sheltering effect between the piles becomes non neglectable and reduces the wave force on p2 on increasing cap dimension d h k c a p decreases gradually and becomes smaller than 1 0 meaning the presence of the cap shows force reducing effect on the piles in addition the difference between the wave forces on p1 p2 and p3 becomes larger and the wave forces on the three piles are in the order as p1 p2 p3 for example when d h increases from 0 5 to 3 in fig 20 a the k c a p of p1 changes from 1 2 to 0 8 while k c a p for p3 changes from 1 15 to 0 06 approximately generally k c a p decreases with the increasing cap dimension in each case with different wave length and the comparison between three wave cases shows that k c a p increases with the increase of wave length the analytical value shows the same trend as the numerical results and still matches well with k c a p of p2 which is weakly affected by both the wave runup at the front and wave rundown at rear of the cap the results of the simulations indicate that both the cap dimension and wave length affect the cap effects on piles to some extent the wave energy transmitted through the interspace under cap implies the strength of the wave loads on piles previous works by mei and black 1969 have shown that the transmitted wave is weaker for waves with shorter wave length and the obstacle with larger dimension it justifies the decrease trend of k c a p shown in fig 20 and the phenomenon that the force reducing effect is more pronounced for shorter wave length the cap effect coefficient k c a p are plotted against the relative cap dimension d l in fig 21 it is seen that the overlapped data points for different cap dimensions match well with each other in a clear decreasing trend with the increase of d l as well as the analytical value although the analytical method underestimates the wave force on the pile near the front edge of the cap it still could be used to give rough estimation for the cap effects on the piles right underneath the cap when d l 0 25 k c a p for the piles at different locations under cap is larger than 1 0 and scatters around 1 2 the force increasing effect on the piles should be considered in engineering practice when d l 0 25 the presence of the cap shows force reducing effect on piles but to different extent for piles at different locations 5 3 influence of the cap submerged depth on cap effect coefficients the cap height is an important structural parameter for bridge foundations and the submerged depth varies with sea levels in the following simulations the cap dimension remains unchanged as d h 2 and the same set up shown in fig 11 is applied the cap top remains 2 5 m above the still water level and four the submerged depths i e s 1 5 m 2 5 m 4 5 m and 6 5 m are considered the wave cases of set 2 listed in table 1 are selected as incident waves the cap bottom is always submerged in a whole wave cycle in the following simulations even for the smallest submerged depth s 1 5 m the wave forces on piles varying with the relative submerged depth s h are presented in fig 22 from the left part of each subfigure it is seen that the peak values of the wave forces on piles decrease with the increasing submerged depth the wave force on the single pile also decreases almost linearly with the increasing submerged depth this is expected because the integrating length of the piles is reduced due to the increasing submerged depth of the cap for each wave case the difference between the positive and negative forces on p1 gradually becomes smaller with the increasing submerged depth this could be explained by the increasing vertical distance from the free surface to p1 which reduces the influence of the surface elevation the difference between the positive and negative forces on p2 and p3 seems not affected by the submerged depth of the cap the right part of each subfigure in fig 22 presents the variation of k c a p with the cap submerged depth it is seen that the k c a p of the piles under cap shows slight increasing trend as the submerged depth increases from the comparison between the results of different wave lengths larger difference of the k c a p among p1 p2 and p3 is observed for shorter wave length i e l 53 4 m when the wave length is larger i e l 109 4 m the difference among p1 p2 and p3 decreases and the k c a p of three piles shows same increasing rate while in each plot the difference between the k c a p of p1 p2 and p3 remains almost unchanged when the submerged depth increases the analytical values still match well with the k c a p of p2 in each plot the analytical value shows more clearly that the increasing rate of k c a p is larger for longer waves generally the submerged depth of the cap determines the effective length of the pile which directly influences the total wave force on the pile the forces on piles with and without cap evidently vary with the change of cap submerged depth while the ratios of these forces namely the cap effect coefficient are slightly affected by the cap submerged depth 6 conclusions the full scale 3d numerical simulations based on ansys fluent and the analytical method based on linear potential theory combined with morison equation are employed to investigate the cap effects on piles in this study the set up of the numerical model including wave generation and absorption boundary conditions grid size turbulence model etc has been validated the influences of both structural and wave parameters i e wave height wave length cap dimension and cap submerged depth on the cap effect coefficient have been investigated numerical simulations for square cap with three underneath piles located near the front edge p1 right in the middle p2 and near the rear edge p3 are carried out for different wave height the results show that the largest negative force on p1 is obviously increased compared with isolated single pile and it is more significant when the relative wave height is large free surface elevation and velocity field around the cap have been investigated which reveals that the earlier appearance of the wave runup and rundown are in phase with the peak forces on p1 the wave rundown in front of the cap is more evident than the wave runup for larger wave height which results in relatively lager negative force than the positive force on p1 the cap effect coefficient k c a p of p1 increases on increasing h h but remains almost constant for p2 and p3 indicating that the cap effects on the piles with distance away from the front edge of the cap do not vary with the incident wave heights the influences of cap dimension d and wave length l on cap effect coefficient have been studied the relative cap dimension d l is identified as the most relevant parameter for cap effect coefficient the cap effect coefficient k c a p decreases with the increase of d l for all the piles underneath the cap for small d l k c a p of three piles is larger than 1 and the difference of k c a p between the three piles is small on increasing d l k c a p of the three piles decreases with different rate and becomes smaller than 1 showing force reducing effects on piles and the wave forces on three piles are in the order as p1 p2 p3 comparison between the results of different wave lengths shows that the force reducing effect is more evident for shorter wave length cases at last the influence of cap submerged depth has been studied for different cap submerged depths the pattern of the wave forces on p1 p2 and p3 remains unchanged the peak forces on the piles under cap decrease as cap submerged depth increases while the increasing cap effect coefficient is observed because the forces on corresponding isolated single pile are calculated with same effective length of the piles under cap the cap effect coefficients are slightly affected by cap submerged depths in addition although the analytical method cannot take the effects of surface elevations into consideration but it is validated to be capable of predicting the wave force on the pile right underneath the cap e g p2 which is weakly affected by surface elevations around the cap the study shows that the cap effects on the wave forces acting on piles are affected by both the cap dimension and wave length the presence of the cap shows not only the force reducing effects on piles with large relative cap dimension d l but also force increasing effects with small d l clear differences of wave force are also observed between the piles of different locations under large cap particularly the wave force on the pile near the front edge of the cap is strongly affected by the wave runup and rundown in front of the cap and the effect is more pronounced with nonlinear waves current study is confined with the situation that the cap bottom is always wetted in whole wave cycle further work is expected to investigate the effects of the air entrapped under cap which may cause huge impact loading on piles the cap effects on the total wave force acting on pile group in which the shelter and interference effects between piles as well as phase difference must be considered are also worth of further study in the future acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51478390 51678491 and thanks go to the science and

scale 3 dimensional numerical simulations are carried out for large square caps with piles placed at different locations underneath the influences of wave height wave length cap dimension and submerged depth on the cap effects are investigated the analytical method is introduced and its solutions are compared with the numerical simulation results the results show that the wave forces on piles are influenced by the free surface runup and rundown in front of the cap and the negative force on the pile near the front edge of the cap can be remarkably larger than the positive force with large wave height the cap coefficient k c a p decreases with the increase of the relative cap dimension the cap shows force increasing effect on piles when the relative cap dimension is smaller i e k c a p 1 which should be highly concerned in the sea crossing bridge design keywords computational fluid dynamics cfd cap effect wave force pile cap foundation sea crossing bridge flow field 1 introduction in recent decades the constructions of the sea crossing bridges have undergone rapid development in china such as the east sea bridge the hangzhou bay bridge the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge etc further the bridge across qiongzhou strait has been planned with the increased water depth in navigable water level the elevated caps with pile group are commonly used as the foundations for the most sea crossing bridges due to the harsh environment in the offshore region the extreme value of wave loads on foundations is an important factor for the design and construction of the sea crossing bridges the substructure of sea crossing bridges is usually an irregular composite composed of pile group pile cap and pier whose dimensions are large and vary with the loads of the superstructure as an example fig 1 shows the sketch of an elevated cap foundation of a cable stayed bridge for the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge the tremendous loads of the superstructure require considerably large dimensions of the cap supported by a large number of piles underneath the complex geometry makes the estimation of the wave loads on substructures quite difficult currently the determination of wave current loads on foundations of already constructed sea crossing bridges in china is mainly dependent on the laboratory experiments that focus on engineering application taking the hangzhou bay bridge and the east sea bridge for example the specific physical experiments were performed to serve the design lan et al 2005 the estimation methods of wave loads acting on pile cap and pile group foundation are different because of their relative dimensions to wave length the morison equation morison et al 1950 is thought to be a good approximation for evaluating wave forces on a slender pile under the condition that the dimension of the pile is so small that the presence of the pile does not disturb the wave field based on the morison equation the total wave force consists of a velocity dependent drag force and an acceleration dependent inertia force note that an appropriate choice of wave theory and hydrodynamic coefficients drag coefficient c d and inertia coefficient c m is essential for wave force calculation when using the morison equation the wave load on a single slender pile which is located in pile group composed of closely spaced vertical piles is significantly affected by the neighboring piles mindao et al 1987 introduced two parameters named shelter coefficient and interference coefficient for tandem arrangement and side by side arrangement of the piles respectively both the coefficients are proposed in terms of the force ratio k g f p g f s p in which f p g is the wave force on a slender pile within pile group and f s p is the wave force on an isolated single pile it is found that the wave induced force on a slender pile within pile group depends on the keulegan carpenter number k c u max t d u max is the maximum horizontal velocity t is wave period and d is pile diameter and relative spacing between the neighboring piles li et al 1992 bonakdar and oumeraci 2014 generally the pile cap is large enough to produce scattering effects the morison equation is then inappropriate because diffraction must be considered based on the linear diffraction theory wave forces and moments on a large circular cylinder can be estimated by an analytical solution developed by maccamy and fuchs 1954 this method has been verified by some experiments mogridge and jamieson 1975 neelamani et al 1989 for bridge foundations a combined method for calculating wave loads is presented by pan et al 2013 the wave force on cap is calculated according to the diffraction theory such as the boundary element method while the wave loads on pile group are calculated by applying the morison equation then the total wave loads on a foundation is the sum of the two separated calculated forces the difficulties in estimating the wave forces on substructures of sea crossing bridges are not only caused by the enormous difference of pile size and cap size which results in the different calculation methods are used i e the morison equation and the linear diffraction theory respectively but also caused by the interactions between the piles in pile group and the interactions between the cap and piles underneath the influences of interactions between piles namely shelter coefficient and interference coefficient have been studied widely such as mindao et al 1987 however the interaction between the cap and piles underneath receives few attentions for example the total wave load on a foundation is suggested to be obtained by summing the wave force on pile group and wave force on cap by pan et al 2013 but the interaction effect between the cap and piles is neglected wave loads studies on similar pile supported structures such as jetties and offshore platforms whose slabs are ordinarily exposed in air have drawn more attentions and accordingly several estimation methods have been proposed cuomo et al 2007 the caps of the foundations of sea crossing bridges are ordinarily partially submerged in normal water level situation especially for major navigable bridges cap height is designed to be not fully submerged in local high water level for navigation safety also not too high to ensure the pile group is not exposed in local low water level for aesthetic purpose the special position and the considerable dimensions of the cap would result in significant disturbance to the wave field which would introduce non negligible force changes on the piles underneath the cap in addition the cap bottom could be now and then wetted and dry in one wave circle with extreme wave conditions it is much more complicated in such conditions with air entrapped under cap during the wave structure interaction chen et al 2018 with the foundation of the east sea bridge in china as a prototype a series of model tests have been performed by liu et al 2007 to determine wave current loads on oblique piles and pile group a reduction coefficient of 0 7 was suggested for the force reducing effect on the wave current forces on pile groups with cap chen et al 2018 investigated high rise pile cap foundation used to support offshore wind turbines in the donghai bridge wind farm china they found that the maximum horizontal wave load on all the piles with the cap can increase by 30 compared with those without the cap and the maximum horizontal wave load on a single pile is nearly doubled these studies indicate that the influence of cap involves both force reducing and increasing effects on piles however systematical studies on the influencing parameters for cap effects on pile group are rare to the best of our knowledge this study aims to give insight into the mechanisms of how the wave force changes on piles by the influence of the cap and how the cap effect coefficient changes with the main influencing parameters such as the wave height wave length cap dimension and submerged depth 2 numerical methods and validation 2 1 modeling of the numerical wave tank a well established numerical code ansys fluent is used to perform the 3 dimensional 3d computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis the ansys fluent using finite volume method fvm solves reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to obtain the pressure field and the consequent forces on structure ansys fluent previously has been used to study the interaction between the bridge superstructure and waves with 2 dimensional 2d model xu and cai 2014 xu et al 2017 huang and xiao 2009 used the k ε turbulence model to simulate the 2d incompressible flow of viscous fluid zhan et al 2014 established a 3d numerical wave tank with renormalization group rng k ε turbulence model for irregular wave propagation over partly vegetated waters results of these studies show that ansys fluent is capable of simulating wave structure interaction quite well the conservations of the mass and momentum in the rans equations are respectively as follows 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i ρ g i x j μ u i x j u j x i ρ u i u

p is pressure g i is acceleration μ and μ t are molecular and eddy viscosities respectively δ i j is kronecker delta ρ u i u j is reynolds stress which represents the effects of the turbulent flow on the mean flow field and k 1 2 u i u j is turbulent kinetic energy to appropriately model the reynolds stress the rng k ε model which is based on renormalization group method is employed as the turbulence closure for the rans equations the detail of this model can be found in orszag and yakhot 1986 the wall treatment of scalable wall function was applied in order to increase the flexibility of grid size near wall the scalable wall function uses a lower limiter to achieve y plus 11 06 which prevents the first grid point to slide into the linear profile area therefore any size of fine grids can be used with the scalable wall function cheng and tak 2006 the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 has been applied in ansys fluent to capture the free surface motions the mixture multiphase model consists of air and water and each of two phases is considered to have a separately defined volume fraction 4 α x t 0 a i r 1 w a t e r 0 α s 1 f r e e s u r f a c e then the density and dynamic viscosity of cells filled with mixed fluid can be determined by the volume fraction the volume fraction function is determined by solving equation 5 α t x i α u i x i α 1 α u α i 0 where u α is a relative compression velocity weller et al 1998 and the last term on left hand side is artificial compression term to limit numerical diffusion the free surfaces are extracted as α w a t e r 0 5 in the following simulations a three dimensional numerical wave tank with a length of 500 m height of 25 m is used in the study to simulate the wave interaction with structures as shown in fig 2 the water depth is fixed as h 15 m and the width of the wave tank varies with the dimension of the structures a region of 30 m is constructed to accommodate modeling of the piston type wave maker center of the structures cap or piles will be placed in the wave propagating region where 250 m away from the wave paddle a wave absorption zone is installed at the end of the tank in a 150 m long region at the top of the numerical wave tank where the fluid is air the boundary condition is set as opening with relative pressure 0 pa allowing the air flow through the boundary the wave paddle bottom and back wall of the numerical wave tank are modeled as solid walls where no slip boundary condition is applied in widthwise direction the sidewalls are set as symmetrical boundary the left hand boundary of the wave maker region incorporates the dynamic mesh chen et al 2016 in this region the paddle moves sinusoidally with specified mesh motion velocity u 6 u s π t sin 2 π t t where s is the stroke of the piston t is the wave period and t is time the relation between the stroke of the piston and the wave height is given below gomes et al 2009 7 h s 2 cosh 2 k 0 h 1 sinh 2 k 0 h 2 k 0 h where h is the wave height and k 0 is the wave number the user define function udf in ansys fluent code allows us to control the motion of the paddle by giving the velocity of the paddle at each time step in wave absorption zone the computational velocity is reduced to zero and the free surface is reduced to the still water level in a smooth manner celebi 1997 an artificial damping term ρ θ u i is added to the left side of momentum equation eq 2 in which 8 θ 0 0 x x 0 x x 0 x 1 x 0 θ 1 x 0 x x 1 where x 0 and x 1 are the start and end coordinates of the absorption zone respectively θ 1 is the damping coefficient which can be determined empirically larsen and dancy 1983 romate 1992 chen et al 2014 discussed the effectiveness of θ 1 and based on which θ 1 3 is applied in all the simulations in this study the full scale simulations of the pile cap model require large computational domain considering the effects of side walls to lower computing cost non uniform grids are utilized for different regions in the following sections an empty wave tank without any structures is modeled first and the mesh sensitivity study is carried out to confirm the proper grid distribution for wave generation and propagation then all the wave cases used in this study are examined in the empty wave tank to obtain the accurate incident wave conditions and to confirm the effectiveness of the absorption zone then the capability of the numerical model to simulate wave forces on cylinder is validated with experimental data and the grid convergence is studied for the meshes around the cylinder 2 2 validation of the numerical wave tank a numerical wave tank without structure was modeled first to verify the wave generation propagation and absorption in ansys fluent software 2d simulation of waves using k ε turbulence model will cause significant wave decaying in order to overcome this problem width of the wave tank is set as 50 m and meshed with 10 grids uniformly discretization hexahedral grids are generated for computation domain as shown in fig 3 a total of 50 grids are distributed at vertical direction with refined mesh of d z 0 05 m at the vicinity of the mean water level to capture the free surface the water depth is 15 m and the influence of the bottom wall on the formation of waves at the free surface is negligible thus girds with size of d z 0 1 m are installed near the bottom wall and y plus value is not considered in spanwise direction mesh is refined near the wave paddle with minimum d x 0 1 m uniform grids with size of d x 2 m are installed in wave propagating region the grid size in absorption zone is increased gradually towards the back wall to save computing cost two sets of regular waves as listed in table 1 will be used for the simulations of pile cap model set 1 are waves of t 8 s with varying wave heights from h 1 m 5 m and set 2 for t 6 s 8 s and 10 s with same wave height h 2 m the fifth order stokes wave of t 8 s and h 5 m is examined first which is the most stringent case with the largest wave steepness used in the study the time step is fixed as d t 0 025 s and the total simulation time is 150 s time series of the surface elevation measured at x 0 m are presented in fig 4 the grid convergence study for wave propagation is carried out by varying the uniform grid size in wave propagating region from d x 1 m 6 m see fig 4 a evident wave decaying is observed for grid size 4 m and 6 m the damping effect is reduced as the grid size is reduced to 2 m and the improvement in the results on further reducing the grid size to 1 m is neglectable thus grid size of d x 2 m at wave propagating direction is selected for the following simulations fig 4 b is the completed time series of the measured elevation at x 0 m the measured wave amplitude in the final periodic state is stable after first few waves and the nonlinear feature of larger crest amplitudes than trough amplitudes is well pronounced fig 5 presents the corresponding surface elevation in the numerical wave tank at t 90 s it is seen that the wave energy is absorbed smoothly in the absorption zone x 100 m and no evident reflection is observed however the measured wave height in the final periodic state is about 4 66 m for the case of t 8 s and h 5 m evident discrepancy with the inputted wave heights are also observed for other cases as listed in table 1 this is because the motion of the piston type wave maker controlled by eq 6 is based on the first order wavemaker theory for large wave steepness the generated waves evolve by self adjusting during propagation and result in lower wave height this phenomenon is more pronounced for shorter waves and commonly observed for laboratory generated waves madsen 1970 fig 6 presents the whole time series of the measured surface elevation for the cases of t 6 s and t 10 s with the same input wave height h 2 m larger discrepancy is observed for shorter waves of t 6 s and more accurate wave height h 1 98 m is measured for t 10 s considering these the measured values listed in table 1 are used in the following analysis as the actual incident wave conditions 2 3 validation of the wave loads calculated by the numerical model the numerical model was validated by simulating the experiments carried out at the large wave flume gwk hannover germany by mo et al 2007 the numerically computed values of the free surface elevation around the cylinder and the wave forces on the cylinder were compared with the experimental data to confirm the accuracy of the numerical model the wave flume in the experiments is 309 m of length 5 m of width and 7 m of depth a cylinder of diameter d 0 7 m was placed 111 m downstream of the wave maker and strain gages were placed at the top and bottom of the cylinder to measure wave forces wave gages were placed at several locations around the cylinder to measure the time histories of the free surface elevations non breaking regular wave with a wave height h 1 2 m and wave period t 4 s was generated in water with initial depth h 4 76 m in this simulation the numerical wave tank is 120 m of length 5 m of width and 8 m of height the cylinder is placed in the center with respect to the side walls as shown in fig 7 the grids distribution for this simulation follows the same pattern as that for the empty wave tank validated in section 2 2 but the grid size in different regions have been scaled down 3 to 4 times considering the scale of this simulation is smaller non uniform grids with minimum grid d z 0 02 m near the free surface and bottom are placed in the vertical direction in the streamwise direction uniform grids of d x 0 5 m are placed upstream and downstream of the cylinder for wave propagation finer grids with d x 0 1 m 0 5 m are installed near the wavemaker and coarser grids of d x 0 5 m 2 m are placed in the absorption zone uniform grids of d y 0 2 m is placed in the widthwise direction finer grids are placed in the region around the cylinder surface with the inner most grid size set as 0 02 m and there were 60 grids along the perimeter of the cylinder four wave gages named wg1 wg2 wg3 and wg4 are positioned near the cylinder to record the surface elevations wave gage wg0 located at 29 5 m upstream of the cylinder is set to confirm the incident wave condition which is measured as h 1 2 m the mesh sensitivety to the wave force on cylinder is studied by varying the grid size of the inner most layer around the cylinder from 0 005 m to 0 1 m fig 8 a presents the comparison of the calculated inline wave forces and four lines are overlapped with each other mo et al 2007 noted that the force measured in the experiment matched well with the inertia force given by the morison equation with c m 2 indicating the forces are inertia dominated with k c 6 1 improvement with finer grids for wall treatment is unnecessary and the selected grid size i e 0 02 m is sufficiently small to calculate the force on cylinder with the inner most grid size of 0 02 m the numerically calculated inline force on cylinder is compared with the experimental data in fig 8 b and excellent agreement is observed the numerically obtained free surface elevations recorded by the four wave gages around the cylinder are compared with the experimental data in fig 9 the free surface elevations are normalized by the peak value recorded by the wg1 in general the numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental measurements some characteristic ripples at the wave troughs measured in front of the cylinder by wg2 are well predicted see fig 9 b the good agreement demonstrates confidence in using this numerical model in this study 3 analytical formulae for wave forces on the piles under square cap to investigate the cap effects on the wave forces acting on piles the understanding of the flow field disturbed by the cap is important it is difficult to obtain the analytical solutions of the 3d flow field under the square cap therefore the analytical solution of the 2d flow field is aimed the dimensions of the caps are so large that it is reasonable to treat the cap as a two dimensional obstacle fixed in the free surface when the incident waves propagate perpendicular to the front surface as shown in fig 10 in which d is the dimension of the cap in wave direction s is the submerged depth of the cap and h is the water depth mei and black 1969 proposed a solution for this problem as the basis of numerical computations within the framework of linearized potential theory which is outlined in the following with assumptions of a perfect fluid and small amplitudes the velocity potential 9 φ x z t ϕ x z e i ω t is split into a symmetric and an asymmetric part 10 ϕ x z ϕ s x z ϕ a x z 2 in which ϕ s x z and ϕ a x z are symmetric and asymmetric parts respectively then the analysis can be restricted to x 0 only the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the potential for regions ω 1 and ω 2 see fig 10 can be expressed by appropriate eigen function expansions for brevity the potentials for our concerning region ω 2 are outlined here 11 ϕ 2 s x z i g a ω b 0 s y 0 λ 0 z n 1 b n s cosh λ n x cosh λ n b y n λ n z x d 2 h z s 12 ϕ 2 a x z i g a ω b 0 a x b y 0 λ 0 z n 1 b n a sinh λ n x sinh λ n b y n λ n z x d 2 h z s where i 1 a is the incident wave amplitude ω is the wave frequency g is gravity acceleration b is half cap length and y n λ n z is the orthonormal set over the interval s z 0 with λ n n π h s n 0 1 2 when the orthonormal conditions are used the linear equations with respect to the unknown coefficients b 0 s and b n a can be obtained using the continuity of ϕ at x d 2 and the continuity of the horizontal velocity ϕ x at x d 2 details about solving the equations can be found in mei and black 1969 then the velocity and acceleration at any point x y in the region ω 2 can be obtained as u φ 2 x and u 2 φ 2 x t respectively our interest is the wave forces on piles located in region ω 2 the diameter d of the piles is relatively small compared with the wave length thus wave force on a pile under cap can be obtained by submitting the horizontal particle velocities and accelerations into the morison equation 13 f p h s 1 2 c d ρ d u u c m ρ π d 2 4 u d z 4 wave forces on the piles under square cap 4 1 set up of the pile cap model the pile cap foundation in the simulations is composed of a square cap and three piles as shown in fig 11 the side length d of the cap is 30 m with the height of 5 m the cap is semi submerged in still water the water depth h is15 m and the submerged depth s is 2 5 m three piles with the same diameter d 1 m named as p1 p2 and p3 are placed near the leading edge in the middle and before the rear edge of the cap respectively the purpose of this set up is to qualitatively compare the cap effects on the piles of different locations because the distribution of the piles under cap could be complicated and the spacing between piles is small in real foundations see fig 1 the locations of pile p1 and p3 are fixed at 0 1 d away from the leading and trailing edges of the cap respectively the same set up has been applied for the caps with different dimensions in section 5 in order to focus on cap effects on piles only the center to center spacing between the neighboring piles is larger than 5 d in this case thus the influence between the piles is neglectable bonakdar and oumeraci 2015 note that we set up the pile cap model whose cap bottom is always wetted in whole wave cycle intentionally because the effect of the entrapped air under cap is not considered in this study the center of the pile cap foundation is placed at x 0 m in the computational domain defined from x 250 m 250 m with width of 16 d as shown in fig 12 a in order to compare the wave forces on piles with and without the influence of the cap the wave force on an isolated single pile with diameter d 1 m under the same wave conditions were also simulated similar computational domain with the same length and a width of 20 m was used the isolated single pile was placed at the central location as well as shown in fig 12 b note that the wave force on isolated single pile f s p is calculated by integrating pressure over z in the range of the same effective length of the piles in the cases with cap see fig 11 b non uniform grids are installed in the computational domain similar as the empty wave tank described in section 2 2 the mesh refinement around the pile cap model is shown in fig 13 to save the computing cost the y plus value restricted under 300 is only considered on the surfaces of the piles with the finest first layer grid size of 0 002 m the first layer grids on surfaces of the cap are refined with grid size of 0 1 m in widthwise direction non uniform grids with d y 0 1 m near the cap to d y 5 m near the side walls are installed 4 2 wave forces on the piles under square cap regular waves of set 1 listed in table 1 were selected as the incident waves the relative wave height h h ranges from 0 06 to 0 31 covering linear waves to 5th order stokes waves with the pile diameter d 1 m the k c number ranges from 3 1 where inertia regime dominates to 14 3 where both drag force and inertia force must be considered the total simulation time is 120 s with fixed time step d t 0 025 s to ensure numerical stability during the entire simulation fig 14 presents the completed time histories of the inline wave forces on p1 p2 and p3 for the two representative cases i e h h 0 06 and h h 0 31 it is seen for both cases that the stable final periodic state of the force curve is observed after about t 60 s for all the cases the first period after t 80 s will be taken as the effective time duration for further analysis the inline wave forces on piles under the cap for the low relative wave height h h 0 06 are compared with that of the isolated single pile f s p in fig 15 a the inline force curves of the three piles and the isolated single pile approximately remain sinusoidal with the linear incident waves the amplitudes of the wave forces on the three piles under the cap are smaller than that of the isolated single pile indicating the presence of the cap shows force reducing effect on the piles underneath among the three piles p1 has the largest positive peak value and the largest negative peak value the positive peak values of the p2 and p3 are approximately equal to their negative peak values as to p1 the negative peak value is slightly larger than the positive peak value for the case of h h 0 31 shown in fig 15 b the nonlinearity of the incident waves is demonstrated by the asymmetry of the wave force curve of the isolated single pile whose positive peak value is reasonably larger than the negative peak value with the estimated k c 14 3 the drag force component and the inertia force component are both important in this case and the phase difference makes the wave force curve exhibit wider crests and troughs when summing these two components the positive peak forces of the three piles under the cap is smaller than that of the isolated single pile which shows the same force reducing effect of the cap as the case of h h 0 06 among the three piles p1 has the largest positive peak force and the largest negative peak force the negative peak force is evidently larger than the positive force on p1 the variation of the largest positive and negative forces on piles with h h is presented in fig 16 the peak values of the wave forces on the isolated single pile without cap f s p are also plotted to form a baseline comparison it can be concluded from fig 16 that 1 the largest positive force of the isolated single pile gradually becomes larger than the largest negative force with the increase of h h due to the increasing nonlinearity of the incident waves 2 compared with the largest positive wave forces on the isolated single pile the largest positive wave forces on the piles p1 p2 and p3 are reduced by the cap effects 3 the largest negative wave forces on the pile p1 are remarkably increased compared with that of the isolated single pile the increment becomes larger when h h increases however the largest negative forces on the pile p2 are smaller than those on the isolated single pile except for h h 0 31 where the largest negative forces are almost equal to that on the isolated single pile see fig 16 b the same pattern is observed for the pile p3 shown in fig 16 c 4 with the influence of the cap evident difference between positive and negative forces is observed for the pile p1 for all the cases and the difference becomes larger when h h increases for h h 0 31 the largest negative force on p1 is 47 larger than the positive force for the pile p2 and p3 the largest positive and negative forces are almost equal to each other when the wave height is smaller i e h h 0 06 and 0 13 as h h increases the negative force gradually become larger than the positive force i e h h 0 25 and 0 31 but to a less extent than p1 4 3 causes of the large force on the pile near the front edge of the cap to investigate the causes of the large force on the pile p1 two wave gages w g f and w g p 1 were used as shown in fig 11 w g f is placed closely in front of the cap and w g p 1 is placed near the sidewall with the same coordinate x as the pile p1 the measured surface elevations and the wave force on pile p1 are drawn together the cases of h h 0 06 and h h 0 31 in fig 17 the surface elevations are normalized by the maximum amplitude η m a x measured by w g p 1 in fig 17 a the peak value of the wave force on p1 occurs synchronously with the zero crossing of the surface elevation measured by w g p 1 as well as the peak forces on p1 marked as b and e in fig 17 b implying they are mainly the acceleration dependent inertia force note that the distance between the locations of w g f and w g p 1 along x direction is small compared with the wave length while in fig 17 b phase advance of approximately 0 4 π is observed for the surface elevation measured by w g f compared with w g p 1 the increased phase difference implies earlier appearance of the crests and troughs measured by w g f which is almost in phase with the peak forces of p1 similar phase advance is observed for the wave trough measured by w g f in fig 17 a the heightened or lowered surface elevations in front of the cap cause pressure difference in the vicinity of the pile p1 which increases the water particle acceleration and eventually results in larger wave force on p1 furthermore the heightened crest and lowered trough measured by w g f are basically symmetrical for h h 0 06 while for h h 0 31 the crest measured by w g f is 24 higher than the incident wave crest and the trough is 86 lower than the incident wave trough this explains the phenomenon of the negative force on p1 larger than the positive force is more evident for larger relative wave height i e h h 0 31 to obtain further clarity on the wave structure interaction fig 18 presents the snapshots of the velocity distribution on the vertical plane through the three pile centers and the free surface elevation contours at the five instants t 78 s t 79 s t 80 2 s t 82 s and t 83 s which are marked as a b c d and e in fig 17 b the red line in the velocity distribution snapshot is the wave profile measured on the side wall representing the undisturbed wave surface elevation fig 18 a shows the wave crest approaches the cap with the water particles moving upward in front of the cap in fig 18 b the wave runup at the front face of the cap increases the horizontal flow velocities around the pile p1 are small indicating that the horizontal flow acceleration is around its peak value the first peak of wave force on p1 appears at the instant marked as b in fig 17 b with the part of the flow going underneath the cap a sunken crest appears in front of the cap shown by the free surface elevation contours in fig 18 c the wave crest is passing the location of p1 and the horizontal velocity around p1 almost reaches its peak value summation of the velocity dependent drag force and acceleration dependent inertia force reaches the second peak value marked as c in fig 17 b the interaction between waves and the cap not only dissipates part of wave energy but also reserves a part of potential energy in the form of the heightened free surface which is converted from the kinetic energy of the water particle during the running up process in fig 18 d when the wave trough approaches the surface elevation in front of the cap starts to drop down with a majority of water particles moving upstream and downward and small parts moving downstream the potential energy reserved in the heightened surface elevation converts into the kinetic energy of the moving water particles and makes the surface elevation in front of the cap drop down quickly in fig 18 e the elevation in front of the cap is remarkably lower than that of the undisturbed wave elevation that is represented by the red line the evident sunken surface in front of the cap can be seen from the free surface elevation contours lowered surface elevation in front of the cap increases the negative particle accelerations which is occurring around p1 and ultimately induces larger negative wave force of p1 generally the wave runup and rundown in front of the cap increases the wave force on the pile near the front edge of the cap namely p1 the wave rundown is more significant than the wave runup corresponding to the larger negative force on p1 than the positive force on the other hand the surface elevations of the transmitted waves at the downstream should have similar effects on the wave force on pile p3 but the wave amplitudes behind the cap are considerably reduced 0 47 h for the case of h h 0 06 and 0 49 h for the case of h h 0 31 were measured behind the cap meanwhile the wave runup and rundown behind the cap are not in phase with the peak forces on p3 therefore the wave forces on p3 are barely influenced by the surface elevations of the transmitted waves at the downstream and no evident increase of the wave force on p3 is observed 5 cap effects on wave forces acting on the piles underneath the cap to quantify the cap effects on the wave forces on piles the cap effect coefficient is defined 14 k c a p f p m a x f s p m a x f p and f s p are the wave forces on the piles with and without cap respectively absolute value of peak forces is taken to make the cap effect coefficient be conservative because the negative force on pile under cap is probably larger than the positive force based on the analytical solution previous works by mei and black 1969 have shown that the wave energy transmitted through the surface obstacle is strongly dependent on the obstacle dimension submerged depth and wave length the influence of these parameters on the cap effect coefficient are investigated separately in the following subsections 5 1 influence of wave height on cap effect coefficients the influences of wave height on the wave forces on the piles under cap have been discussed in section 4 with the cases of set 1 listed in table 1 fig 19 presents the variation of k c a p for piles p1 p2 and p3 with the relative wave heights compared with the analytical value calculated by eq 13 with hydrodynamic coefficients c d 1 2 and c m 2 0 the analytical method is based on the linearized potential theory with small amplitude assumption which does not reflect the effects of the free surface runup and rundown in front of the cap thus all the analytical values were calculated at the center underneath the cap it is seen in fig 19 that the cap effect coefficient k c a p of p1 increases from 0 97 to 1 2 when h h increases from 0 06 to 0 31 for p2 and p3 the k c a p almost remains as a constant around 0 75 and agrees well with analytical values indicating that the force reducing effect on the piles with certain distances away from the leading edge of the cap does not evidently vary with the incident wave heights 5 2 influence of the relative cap dimension on cap effect coefficients the influences of the relative cap dimension d l on the cap effect coefficients are investigated four caps with dimension of d 7 5 m 15 m 30 m and 45 m are considered and the relative cap dimension d h accordingly ranges from 0 5 to 3 the same set up as shown in fig 11 is applied i e the diameter of the piles is still d 1 m and the piles p1 and p3 are placed 0 1 d away from the leading and trailing edges of the cap respectively the length of the computational domain remains unchanged as 500 m but the width 16 d varies corresponding to the cap dimension three regular waves of set 2 listed in table 1 with wave lengths ranging from 53 4 m to 109 4 m are used as incident waves the corresponding cases of isolated single pile without cap are also simulated with the same wave conditions to obtain the absolute peak value f s p m a x the variation of the wave forces on piles with cap dimension is presented in fig 20 in each subfigure the left part shows the horizontal positive and negative peak forces of each case it is noticed that for the isolated single pile the positive peak forces are larger than the negative forces as a result only the positive forces on the isolated single pile are presented larger negative forces than positive forces on p1 are obviously seen in all the cases presented in the figure for each wave case slightly larger difference between the positive and negative forces on p1 is observed for the small cap dimension d h 0 5 in which the pile p1 is closer to the leading edge of the cap and is more affected by the surface elevation in front of the cap for cases with longer wave length l 82 9 m and l 109 4 m evident larger negative forces than positive forces on p2 and p3 are also observed for small cap dimensions d h 0 5 and d h 1 the right part in each subfigure of fig 20 shows the variation of the cap effect coefficient k c a p with the relative cap dimension when d h 0 5 the values of k c a p for p1 p2 and p3 are close to each other and are larger than 1 0 regardless of the wave length indicating that the smaller cap dimension has almost the same force increasing effects on the three piles the wave force on p2 is slightly smaller than p1 and p3 this is because the spacing between the neighboring piles is small the center to center distance between the piles is fixed as 0 4 d the sheltering effect between the piles becomes non neglectable and reduces the wave force on p2 on increasing cap dimension d h k c a p decreases gradually and becomes smaller than 1 0 meaning the presence of the cap shows force reducing effect on the piles in addition the difference between the wave forces on p1 p2 and p3 becomes larger and the wave forces on the three piles are in the order as p1 p2 p3 for example when d h increases from 0 5 to 3 in fig 20 a the k c a p of p1 changes from 1 2 to 0 8 while k c a p for p3 changes from 1 15 to 0 06 approximately generally k c a p decreases with the increasing cap dimension in each case with different wave length and the comparison between three wave cases shows that k c a p increases with the increase of wave length the analytical value shows the same trend as the numerical results and still matches well with k c a p of p2 which is weakly affected by both the wave runup at the front and wave rundown at rear of the cap the results of the simulations indicate that both the cap dimension and wave length affect the cap effects on piles to some extent the wave energy transmitted through the interspace under cap implies the strength of the wave loads on piles previous works by mei and black 1969 have shown that the transmitted wave is weaker for waves with shorter wave length and the obstacle with larger dimension it justifies the decrease trend of k c a p shown in fig 20 and the phenomenon that the force reducing effect is more pronounced for shorter wave length the cap effect coefficient k c a p are plotted against the relative cap dimension d l in fig 21 it is seen that the overlapped data points for different cap dimensions match well with each other in a clear decreasing trend with the increase of d l as well as the analytical value although the analytical method underestimates the wave force on the pile near the front edge of the cap it still could be used to give rough estimation for the cap effects on the piles right underneath the cap when d l 0 25 k c a p for the piles at different locations under cap is larger than 1 0 and scatters around 1 2 the force increasing effect on the piles should be considered in engineering practice when d l 0 25 the presence of the cap shows force reducing effect on piles but to different extent for piles at different locations 5 3 influence of the cap submerged depth on cap effect coefficients the cap height is an important structural parameter for bridge foundations and the submerged depth varies with sea levels in the following simulations the cap dimension remains unchanged as d h 2 and the same set up shown in fig 11 is applied the cap top remains 2 5 m above the still water level and four the submerged depths i e s 1 5 m 2 5 m 4 5 m and 6 5 m are considered the wave cases of set 2 listed in table 1 are selected as incident waves the cap bottom is always submerged in a whole wave cycle in the following simulations even for the smallest submerged depth s 1 5 m the wave forces on piles varying with the relative submerged depth s h are presented in fig 22 from the left part of each subfigure it is seen that the peak values of the wave forces on piles decrease with the increasing submerged depth the wave force on the single pile also decreases almost linearly with the increasing submerged depth this is expected because the integrating length of the piles is reduced due to the increasing submerged depth of the cap for each wave case the difference between the positive and negative forces on p1 gradually becomes smaller with the increasing submerged depth this could be explained by the increasing vertical distance from the free surface to p1 which reduces the influence of the surface elevation the difference between the positive and negative forces on p2 and p3 seems not affected by the submerged depth of the cap the right part of each subfigure in fig 22 presents the variation of k c a p with the cap submerged depth it is seen that the k c a p of the piles under cap shows slight increasing trend as the submerged depth increases from the comparison between the results of different wave lengths larger difference of the k c a p among p1 p2 and p3 is observed for shorter wave length i e l 53 4 m when the wave length is larger i e l 109 4 m the difference among p1 p2 and p3 decreases and the k c a p of three piles shows same increasing rate while in each plot the difference between the k c a p of p1 p2 and p3 remains almost unchanged when the submerged depth increases the analytical values still match well with the k c a p of p2 in each plot the analytical value shows more clearly that the increasing rate of k c a p is larger for longer waves generally the submerged depth of the cap determines the effective length of the pile which directly influences the total wave force on the pile the forces on piles with and without cap evidently vary with the change of cap submerged depth while the ratios of these forces namely the cap effect coefficient are slightly affected by the cap submerged depth 6 conclusions the full scale 3d numerical simulations based on ansys fluent and the analytical method based on linear potential theory combined with morison equation are employed to investigate the cap effects on piles in this study the set up of the numerical model including wave generation and absorption boundary conditions grid size turbulence model etc has been validated the influences of both structural and wave parameters i e wave height wave length cap dimension and cap submerged depth on the cap effect coefficient have been investigated numerical simulations for square cap with three underneath piles located near the front edge p1 right in the middle p2 and near the rear edge p3 are carried out for different wave height the results show that the largest negative force on p1 is obviously increased compared with isolated single pile and it is more significant when the relative wave height is large free surface elevation and velocity field around the cap have been investigated which reveals that the earlier appearance of the wave runup and rundown are in phase with the peak forces on p1 the wave rundown in front of the cap is more evident than the wave runup for larger wave height which results in relatively lager negative force than the positive force on p1 the cap effect coefficient k c a p of p1 increases on increasing h h but remains almost constant for p2 and p3 indicating that the cap effects on the piles with distance away from the front edge of the cap do not vary with the incident wave heights the influences of cap dimension d and wave length l on cap effect coefficient have been studied the relative cap dimension d l is identified as the most relevant parameter for cap effect coefficient the cap effect coefficient k c a p decreases with the increase of d l for all the piles underneath the cap for small d l k c a p of three piles is larger than 1 and the difference of k c a p between the three piles is small on increasing d l k c a p of the three piles decreases with different rate and becomes smaller than 1 showing force reducing effects on piles and the wave forces on three piles are in the order as p1 p2 p3 comparison between the results of different wave lengths shows that the force reducing effect is more evident for shorter wave length cases at last the influence of cap submerged depth has been studied for different cap submerged depths the pattern of the wave forces on p1 p2 and p3 remains unchanged the peak forces on the piles under cap decrease as cap submerged depth increases while the increasing cap effect coefficient is observed because the forces on corresponding isolated single pile are calculated with same effective length of the piles under cap the cap effect coefficients are slightly affected by cap submerged depths in addition although the analytical method cannot take the effects of surface elevations into consideration but it is validated to be capable of predicting the wave force on the pile right underneath the cap e g p2 which is weakly affected by surface elevations around the cap the study shows that the cap effects on the wave forces acting on piles are affected by both the cap dimension and wave length the presence of the cap shows not only the force reducing effects on piles with large relative cap dimension d l but also force increasing effects with small d l clear differences of wave force are also observed between the piles of different locations under large cap particularly the wave force on the pile near the front edge of the cap is strongly affected by the wave runup and rundown in front of the cap and the effect is more pronounced with nonlinear waves current study is confined with the situation that the cap bottom is always wetted in whole wave cycle further work is expected to investigate the effects of the air entrapped under cap which may cause huge impact loading on piles the cap effects on the total wave force acting on pile group in which the shelter and interference effects between piles as well as phase difference must be considered are also worth of further study in the future acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51478390 51678491 and thanks go to the science and

22768,heat transfer is difficult to predict in hydrate bearing reservoirs during drilling especially during drilling fluid invasion which may induce hydrate dissociation and cause accidents such as wellbore instability landslide and collapse in this research we simulated the real drilling process in a three dimensional large scale hydrate bearing reservoir with circulating drilling fluid the real time temperature variations at different positions in the sediments were measured under different reservoir s initial temperatures to reflect the processes of drilling fluid invasion and hydrate phase transitions the results indicate that the heat transfer process in hydrate bearing reservoirs can be divided into six periods and thus is more complex than that in conventional reservoirs where heat transfer processes can be divided into three periods this is due to the coupled effects between drilling fluid invasion and hydrate phase transitions on the one hand high temperature drilling fluids can decompose the original hydrates while hydrate dissociation can absorb heat and reduce the surrounding temperature further the local pressure increase due to the fluid discharged from hydrate dissociation may also delay drilling fluid invasion hydrate dissociation and reformation can also alter the original pore structure and change the flow state in this study a temperature profile close to the equilibrium temperature corresponding to the reservoir pressure was observed indicating the period of hydrate phase transitions in addition hydrate dissociation occurred earlier and faster when the reservoir s initial temperature was higher therefore it was suggested that a suitable temperature not much higher than the reservoir s initial temperature and as much as possible below the phase equilibrium of the drilling fluid should be chosen to maintain the hydrate bearing layer stability and avoid unnecessary accidents during deepwater drilling keywords gas hydrate deepwater drilling fluid phase transition heat transfer 1 introduction natural gas hydrate is a type of flammable crystalline compound consisting of light hydrocarbon compounds ch4 c2h6 c3h8 and c2h4 and water molecules under high pressure and low temperature chong et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 owing to features such as huge reserves wide distribution and low pollution natural gas hydrate is regarded as a potential alternative source of green energy makogon 2010 a series of development methods including thermal stimulation depressurization inhibitor injection and co2 replacement and combinations of these methods have been proposed zhang et al 2017 song et al 2018 wang et al 2018a b in addition owing to its unique phase transition properties hydrates can be used to desalinate sea water store natural gas and separate different gas mixtures shi et al 2009 wang et al 2012 however the phase transitions of hydrates may cause engineering problems during deepwater drilling which threaten the safety and integrity of the operation generally hydrate related risks are divided into two categories one comprises flow assurance issues caused by the hydrate formation under suitable environmental conditions free liquid water and gas can transform into solid hydrate particles plugging the pipeline and changing the flow state gao et al 2018a b the other comprises reservoir stability issues caused by hydrate dissociation large amounts of compressible fluid discharged into the limited space of pores in a short time by hydrate dissociation can increase the local pressure and destroy the original pore structure causing the disasters such as landslides and collapses during ocean explorations kwon et al 2009 if they are not handled properly these risks threaten the environment and the safety of equipment and workers in the past decades scholars have studied the hydrate properties to explain the phase transition mechanisms and predict the corresponding rules for safety the energy transition between gas liquid solid phases during the thermal dissociation of hydrates has been analysed and the heat released from hydrate dissociation has been measured using calorimeters kamath et al 1984 rueff et al 1985 then the internal dynamic reactions gas water two phase flow and heat transfer in the hydrate dissociation zone were confirmed to be the key factors controlling hydrate dissociation hong et al 2003 considering the layer growth from hydrate deposition on the wall a hydro thermo hydrate coupling model was established to predict the hydrate formation wang et al 2016 2018a b the hydrate deposition rates in horizontal and vertical gas dominated pipelines were also calculated through stress analysis and deposition conversion respectively wang et al 2017a b gao et al 2018a b with the assistance of advanced test technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging mri and computed tomography ct scanning hydrates phase transitions at gas water interfaces and in porous media were also investigated kuang et al 2018 furthermore samples permeability under different conditions were measured for production efficiency evaluation wang et al 2017a b up to now the hydrate related reactions in both pipes and porous media have been studied extensively but the effects of special conditions in drilling engineering in particular drilling fluid invasion have been rarely considered because hydrates are always sensitive to their surrounding pressure and temperature the circulation of a high temperature drilling fluid may induce hydrate dissociation if the reservoir is invaded affecting the strength of the cement and the porosity permeability and other porous media physical properties simultaneously li et al 2014 the coupled interaction between external inflows and hydrate phase transitions makes it harder to predict the flow state in hydrate bearing reservoirs precisely because the drilling fluid circulation is essential in drilling engineering understanding the heat transfer mechanisms in hydrate bearing reservoirs with drilling fluid invasion is important to prevent the corresponding production risks 2 analysis of heat transfer in hydrate bearing reservoirs during drilling the heat transfer process during drilling in conventional reservoirs with drilling fluid invasion includes heat conduction caused by temperature differences convection occurring during fluid flow in the pores and thermal radiation which is very small compared to the whole temperature field and thus can always be ignored the state of heat energy is constantly changing along with the drilling fluid invasion front flowing forward in the reservoir compared with conventional reservoirs the heat transfer in hydrate reservoirs with drilling fluid invasion is more complex as well as the reactions mentioned above it also comprises energy variations caused by the natural gas hydrate dissociation and reformation zhao et al 2012 which can affect the reservoir s initial temperature distribution bhade and phirani 2015 as shown in fig 1 temperature and pressure are the main factors affecting the stability of hydrates sloan et al 2010 at the beginning of the drilling fluid invasion the hydrate reservoir gains additional energy from the wellbore when the local temperature exceeds the equilibrium temperature the hydrate crystals in the pores will gradually decompose the endothermic effect of the dissociation will reduce the local temperature and the discharged products will increase the local pressure xu and germanovich 2007 hindering the heat transfer to some extent in addition the local excesst pressure may be transferred to the surroundings and reconvert the discharged gas into hydrates changing the original porosity and permeability of the reservoir meanwhile hydrates reformation will consume some of the dissociated gas and reduce the local pressure until equilibrium is reached during this process the difference between the internal and external pressures can inhibit further drilling fluid invasion and push the discharged fluid towards the wellbore the discharged fluid and hydrate reformation can block the throats in the layers thus the hydrate phase transitions may significantly influence the heat transfer process due to endothermic exothermic effects as shown in fig 2 to study the complicated heat transfer processes in hydrate bearing reservoirs during drilling fluid invasion we designed a set of apparatus and associated experimental procedures the central thermal boundary and the cold edge boundary are simulated by constant high temperature drilling fluid circulation and a constant low temperature environment respectively although the prepared sample is more similar to the well nearby zone and the whole scale is limited by the reactor size then the coupled rules for drilling fluid invasion and hydrate bearing reservoirs have been obtained to provide theoretical support for ensuring safety and improving efficiency during trial development 3 experimental apparatus and procedure 3 1 experimental apparatus the apparatus used for the experiment consisted in injection reaction drilling fluid circulation and data acquisition units as shown in fig 3 the injection unit was used to supply the gas and the liquid solution to the reaction unit and comprised a natural gas container liquid container mixing vessel pump pressure gauge and control valve the reaction unit was used to simulate a typical deepwater reservoir environment and consisted in a reactor and a thermostat the drilling fluid circulation unit which represents the drilling fluid circulation system consisted in a mud tank mud pump recycle pool and control valve the data acquisition unit consisted in several sensors and a data collection computer for real time monitoring of the parameters in the porous media all these equipment were supplied by hai an petroleum scientific research instrument co ltd the reactor is a cylindrical steel container internal effective height 400 mm radius 200 mm sealed with a rubber plug it has a maximum allowable working pressure of 20 mpa to simulate a porous medium the reactor was filled with 0 048 m3 of quartz sand with particles size of 300 600 μm supplied by qingdao wanhong mining co ltd the prepared sample porosity was calculated to be approximately 30 by measuring the initial displaced gas volume chen et al 2018 and the horizontal permeability calculated with the darcy formula gao et al 2019 was approximately 21 md this is in accordance with the field data and related research works carried out in canada japan and the south china sea chen et al 2011 nine different groups of sensors were arranged 50 mm 100 mm and 150 mm away from the centre of the reactor all at a vertical distance of 200 mm from the bottom of the reactor the nine groups were split into three segments each consisting of three groups of sensors arranged to form straight lines the angle between each line was 120 as shown in fig 4 the sensors were used to collect and record real time temperature and had an accuracy of approximately 0 1 k the corresponding sensors on each straight line made up 3 concentric circles the porous media used in the experiment were evenly packed it was assumed that the data were correct when the sensor signals on the same circle were the same the sensors 50 mm 100 mm and 150 mm away from the concentric circle centre of the reactor were marked as no 1 no 2 and no 3 respectively 3 2 experimental procedure the reactor was placed in a thermostat with a temperature range of 267 373 k 0 1 k r22 fluorine was used as refrigerant because of its excellent chemical and thermal stability according to the phase equilibrium curve the experimental pressure 7 mpa and temperatures 276 k 278 k and 280 k were selected to meet the conditions of methane hydrate formation methane gas was charged to the reactor 3 times to purge out residual air before starting the experiment the initial temperatures of methane and quartz packs were approximately 293 298 k sodium dodecyl sulfate sds was used as surfactant to promote the formation and accumulation of hydrates wu and zhang 2010 the sds aqueous solution 600 ppm self prepared and methane gas purity of 99 99 supplied by qingdao airtech gas co ltd were mixed in the mixing vessel until sufficient dissolution then the mixed fluid was injected into the quartz sand until the specified pressure was reached the surrounding temperature was reduced by adjusting the thermostat until the specified value was reached because methane is consumed during hydrates formation and the corresponding pressure will reduce it was necessary to keep replenishing the gas to maintain the pressure at the set point until the system became stable the formation of hydrates in the system was considered to be completed and reached equilibrium after 12 h the saturation was calculated to be 31 according to the quantity of methane gas consumed chen et al 2019 the reservoir permeability was reduced to 2 4 md after the hydrate formation was completed and equilibrium was reached the drilling fluid temperature was set to 293 k a specific heater was installed in the mud tank to rapidly warm the flowing fluid and keep the temperature of the drilling fluid constant the drilling fluid used for the experiment comprised a 0 2 wt nacl solution self prepared and a high pressure pump was used to circulate the fluid all the sensor signals were monitored and recorded by a computer the high temperature drilling fluid was pumped into the wellbore through the centre of the reactor and circulated out through the pipeline with methane gas and water including the dissociated fluid the circulation of the drilling fluid was continued until the data recorded by the sensors were steady and the reservoir temperature field was stable a conventional reservoir with drilling fluid invasion was simulated under the same conditions to compare it with the hydrate reservoir the reactor was filled with 0 048 m3 of quartz sand of uniform size and sds aqueous solution without methane gas so no hydrate was formed the same experimental procedure as for the hydrate reservoir was applied for the conventional reservoir 4 results and discussion 4 1 heat transfer comparison between hydrate and conventional reservoirs the experimental data were recorded and screened every 3 min to obtain clear results the curves of temperature versus time at different positions under the reservoir s initial temperature and initial pressure of 276 k and 7 mpa respectively during drilling fluid invasion were obtained for both the conventional and hydrate reservoirs as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively in fig 5 the heat transfer in a typical conventional reservoir during fluid invasion is divided into 3 periods the first period also referred to as period one shows heat transfer by conduction in this period hot drilling fluid has not reached the sensors and the energy generated by the thermal difference is instantaneously transmitted between the rock skeleton and the fluid the change in the reservoir temperature is relatively small in the second period also referred to as period two there is combined heat transfer action by both conduction and convection during this period the hot drilling fluid reaches the sensors and an improved heat transfer by conduction is observed accordingly the reservoir temperature increased rapidly in the third period also referred to as period three there is almost thermal equilibrium between the reservoir and the drilling fluid and the reservoir temperature is approximately stable from the temperature versus time curves in fig 5 it can be seen that during period one sensor no 1 close to the centre of the reactor has the shortest time while sensor no 3 near the wall edge of the reactor has the longest time when the drilling fluid was in direct contact with the reservoir the temperature increased significantly and went from period one to period two as a result of the additional heat transfer by convection and the improved heat transfer by conduction to some extent the time span of period one indirectly reflects the moving sequence and corresponding average velocity of the drilling fluid invasion front this coincides with the time section of the auxiliary resistance sensors at the end of period three the equilibrium temperature at sensor no 1 50 mm away from the wellbore was the highest followed by sensors no 2 100 mm away from the wellbore and sensor no 3 150 mm away from the wellbore these were determined by the constant temperature of the central thermal boundary and cold edge boundary the rate of heat transfer at sensor no 1 was also faster than those observed at sensors no 2 and no 3 due to the decreasing temperature difference caused by heat loss in the flowing process the heat transfer process in the hydrate reservoir is more complex than that in the conventional reservoir as shown in fig 6 according to the shape of the curves the heat transfer during drilling fluid invasion in the hydrate reservoir can be divided into 6 periods the first period also referred to as period one is merely heat transfer by conduction the second period also referred to as period two is the combined action of heat transfer by both conduction and convection during this period the hot drilling fluid reaches the sensors position with an heat transfer improved by conduction and the curve increases rapidly when the local temperature exceeded the hydrate equilibrium critical temperature approximately 281 k in this research the whole system reached the third period period three in period three the hydrate in the porous media began to decompose and complicated the heat transfer process on the one hand the hydrate dissociation reduced the surrounding temperature because it is an endothermic reaction in addition large amounts of liquid and gas were generated by hydrate dissociation and were discharged into the limited space of the pores this caused the local pressure to be much higher than the initial one causing the fluid to escape from the pore spaces hindering further penetration of the drilling fluid these processes affected the heat transfer and caused the local temperature to fluctuate within a small range when the reduced temperature and increased pressure reached appropriate values the natural gas including the original gas in the pore and decomposed gas combined with free water to regenerate hydrate crystals the period during this process is referred to as period four and has both positive and negative influences on the original reservoir temperature field the positive effect is that hydrate reformation is an exothermic reaction which consumes gas reducing the local pressure and to some extent releasing heat the negative effect is that the new regenerated hydrate crystals are distributed randomly which blocks throats changing the original pore structure reducing permeability and hindering the free flow of the drilling fluid according to the experimental analysis the reformation rate of the new hydrate crystals was much lower than the dissociation rate of the original hydrate crystals period three occurred before period four covered the whole process of period four and was dominated the process due to the continuous supply of wellbore heat energy the fifth period also referred to as period five indicates that the original hydrate crystals were completely decomposed and no hydrate was regenerated in this period heat transfer is similar to that in conventional reservoirs with drilling fluid invasion finally the sixth period also referred to as period six is close to the thermal equilibrium between the reservoir and the drilling fluid with nearly stable reservoir temperature from the curves in fig 6 it can be seen that the results in periods one and two can also indirectly reflect the moving state and corresponding average velocity of the drilling fluid invasion front in the experiments on the hydrate reservoir the electrical resistivity fluctuated slightly in period one which did not occur in the conventional reservoir as shown in fig 7 in the figure the relative electrical resistivity rer represents the ratio of the real time electrical resistivity to the initial electrical resistivity at this time the drilling fluid had not reached the sensors and there was no hydrate decomposition the electrical resistivity fluctuations in period one may be caused by the diffusion of the fluid which are caused by the hydrate closest to the wellbore in fig 6 the time spans of sensor no 1 in periods three and four were shorter than those of sensor no 2 the circulating drilling fluid had a lower temperature and flux at the position of sensor no 2 with a stronger resistance to hydrate dissociation compared to that at the position of sensor no 1 the greater was the distance from the central area heat source the slower was the hydrate dissociation rate and the smaller was the distance from the reactor outer wall cold source the easier it was to satisfy the conditions for hydrate reformation therefore the wave caused by hydrate phase transitions in the curves of sensor no 2 was longer than that in the curves of sensor no 1 the time spans of sensor no 2 in periods three and four were much shorter than those of sensor no 3 moreover the hydrate saturation at sensor no 3 may be higher than at sensors no 1 and no 2 because the former was closer to the reactor s outer wall cold source this phenomenon is known as the climbing effect and has been mentioned in previous literature and experiments yang et al 2012 li et al 2013 the results obtained from the conventional and hydrate reservoirs under the same conditions are extremely different the biggest difference is between the waves in periods three and four which were caused by the hydrate dissociation and reformation in addition for the same sensors the slopes of the curves of periods one and two in the hydrate reservoir are smaller than those in the conventional reservoir due to poor thermal property of the solid hydrate itself in contrast the hydrate blockage weakens the heat transfer by convection however the slopes of the curves of period five in the hydrate reservoir experiments are always steeper than those of period three in the conventional reservoir experiments this is because the original hydrates in the reservoir were completely decomposed this increased the reservoir porosity and permeability and promoted the flow of high temperature drilling fluid 4 2 effect of initial reservoir temperature the real time temperature data at different positions in the hydrate reservoir during drilling fluid invasion at a 7 mpa pressure and temperatures of 278 k and 280 k are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the heat transfer rules are similar to those in fig 6 and the curves can also be divided into 6 periods the curves of sensors no 1 no 2 and no 3 were plotted individually under different conditions to analyse the influence of different reservoir s initial temperatures on the heat transfer as shown in fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 from the figures it can be seen that reservoir s initial temperature affects the starting and maximum values of the curve near equilibrium the curves rise with increasing reservoir s initial temperature further the larger is the temperature difference between the reservoir and the drilling fluid the steeper are the slopes of the curves in periods one and two this means that there was an improved heat transfer effect the trends and slopes of the curves at 276 k and 278 k are very similar after period two the curves representing sensor no 3 nearly overlap on the other hand the curve at 280 k is significantly higher than the two curves at lower temperatures in addition the curves of periods three and four are very short compared to those obtained with the hydrate reservoir there is hardly any wave in the curve of sensor no 3 due to the reservoir s initial temperature 280 k being closer to the phase equilibrium temperature of the hydrate under 7 mpa this has a negative effect on hydrate formation but a positive effect on the hydrate dissociation the higher the reservoir s initial temperature was the earlier the hydrate decomposed which led to the phase equilibrium with a shorter wave it can also be deduced that the lower is the initial temperature the larger is the amount of hydrate which is reflected by the wavelength 5 conclusions in this research the heat transfer in hydrate bearing reservoirs during drilling fluid invasion was investigated through experimental simulations considering the hydrate phase transition characteristics the coupled relationship of the drilling fluid invasion and hydrate bearing reservoir was analysed although the distance between the central thermal boundary with constant high temperature drilling fluid circulation and cold edge boundary with a constant low temperature environment is limited by the reactor size and the real situation in the reservoir cannot be completely reproduced the following findings provide some theory support for ensuring safety and improving the efficiency during hydrate trial developments 1 the heat transfer process in hydrate reservoirs can be divided into 6 periods unlike in conventional reservoirs where the process is divided into 3 periods there is a platform stage indicating hydrate dissociation reformation in the hydrate reservoir in this study the heat transfer was delayed by the hydrate phase transitions due to endothermic effects and local pressure increase in addition the reactions can be reversed by pushing the drilling fluid and changing the porosity and permeability of the porous medium which can not to be ignored 2 the reservoir s initial temperature has significant effects on the heat transfer process in hydrate reservoirs the higher is the reservoir s initial temperature the earlier the hydrate reservoir reaches phase equilibrium and the faster the hydrate decomposes the reservoir s initial temperature also influences the temperature distribution in the reservoir at the end of the invasion changing the hydrate dissociation zone to some extents therefore it is suggested that a suitable temperature not much higher than the reservoir s initial temperature as far as possible below the phase equilibrium of the circulating drilling fluid should be chosen to maintain the hydrate reservoir stability and make effective use of the weak thermodynamic properties of the solid hydrate during the drilling process acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the national natural science foundation of china no 51876222 no 51622405 the program for changjiang

22768,heat transfer is difficult to predict in hydrate bearing reservoirs during drilling especially during drilling fluid invasion which may induce hydrate dissociation and cause accidents such as wellbore instability landslide and collapse in this research we simulated the real drilling process in a three dimensional large scale hydrate bearing reservoir with circulating drilling fluid the real time temperature variations at different positions in the sediments were measured under different reservoir s initial temperatures to reflect the processes of drilling fluid invasion and hydrate phase transitions the results indicate that the heat transfer process in hydrate bearing reservoirs can be divided into six periods and thus is more complex than that in conventional reservoirs where heat transfer processes can be divided into three periods this is due to the coupled effects between drilling fluid invasion and hydrate phase transitions on the one hand high temperature drilling fluids can decompose the original hydrates while hydrate dissociation can absorb heat and reduce the surrounding temperature further the local pressure increase due to the fluid discharged from hydrate dissociation may also delay drilling fluid invasion hydrate dissociation and reformation can also alter the original pore structure and change the flow state in this study a temperature profile close to the equilibrium temperature corresponding to the reservoir pressure was observed indicating the period of hydrate phase transitions in addition hydrate dissociation occurred earlier and faster when the reservoir s initial temperature was higher therefore it was suggested that a suitable temperature not much higher than the reservoir s initial temperature and as much as possible below the phase equilibrium of the drilling fluid should be chosen to maintain the hydrate bearing layer stability and avoid unnecessary accidents during deepwater drilling keywords gas hydrate deepwater drilling fluid phase transition heat transfer 1 introduction natural gas hydrate is a type of flammable crystalline compound consisting of light hydrocarbon compounds ch4 c2h6 c3h8 and c2h4 and water molecules under high pressure and low temperature chong et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 owing to features such as huge reserves wide distribution and low pollution natural gas hydrate is regarded as a potential alternative source of green energy makogon 2010 a series of development methods including thermal stimulation depressurization inhibitor injection and co2 replacement and combinations of these methods have been proposed zhang et al 2017 song et al 2018 wang et al 2018a b in addition owing to its unique phase transition properties hydrates can be used to desalinate sea water store natural gas and separate different gas mixtures shi et al 2009 wang et al 2012 however the phase transitions of hydrates may cause engineering problems during deepwater drilling which threaten the safety and integrity of the operation generally hydrate related risks are divided into two categories one comprises flow assurance issues caused by the hydrate formation under suitable environmental conditions free liquid water and gas can transform into solid hydrate particles plugging the pipeline and changing the flow state gao et al 2018a b the other comprises reservoir stability issues caused by hydrate dissociation large amounts of compressible fluid discharged into the limited space of pores in a short time by hydrate dissociation can increase the local pressure and destroy the original pore structure causing the disasters such as landslides and collapses during ocean explorations kwon et al 2009 if they are not handled properly these risks threaten the environment and the safety of equipment and workers in the past decades scholars have studied the hydrate properties to explain the phase transition mechanisms and predict the corresponding rules for safety the energy transition between gas liquid solid phases during the thermal dissociation of hydrates has been analysed and the heat released from hydrate dissociation has been measured using calorimeters kamath et al 1984 rueff et al 1985 then the internal dynamic reactions gas water two phase flow and heat transfer in the hydrate dissociation zone were confirmed to be the key factors controlling hydrate dissociation hong et al 2003 considering the layer growth from hydrate deposition on the wall a hydro thermo hydrate coupling model was established to predict the hydrate formation wang et al 2016 2018a b the hydrate deposition rates in horizontal and vertical gas dominated pipelines were also calculated through stress analysis and deposition conversion respectively wang et al 2017a b gao et al 2018a b with the assistance of advanced test technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging mri and computed tomography ct scanning hydrates phase transitions at gas water interfaces and in porous media were also investigated kuang et al 2018 furthermore samples permeability under different conditions were measured for production efficiency evaluation wang et al 2017a b up to now the hydrate related reactions in both pipes and porous media have been studied extensively but the effects of special conditions in drilling engineering in particular drilling fluid invasion have been rarely considered because hydrates are always sensitive to their surrounding pressure and temperature the circulation of a high temperature drilling fluid may induce hydrate dissociation if the reservoir is invaded affecting the strength of the cement and the porosity permeability and other porous media physical properties simultaneously li et al 2014 the coupled interaction between external inflows and hydrate phase transitions makes it harder to predict the flow state in hydrate bearing reservoirs precisely because the drilling fluid circulation is essential in drilling engineering understanding the heat transfer mechanisms in hydrate bearing reservoirs with drilling fluid invasion is important to prevent the corresponding production risks 2 analysis of heat transfer in hydrate bearing reservoirs during drilling the heat transfer process during drilling in conventional reservoirs with drilling fluid invasion includes heat conduction caused by temperature differences convection occurring during fluid flow in the pores and thermal radiation which is very small compared to the whole temperature field and thus can always be ignored the state of heat energy is constantly changing along with the drilling fluid invasion front flowing forward in the reservoir compared with conventional reservoirs the heat transfer in hydrate reservoirs with drilling fluid invasion is more complex as well as the reactions mentioned above it also comprises energy variations caused by the natural gas hydrate dissociation and reformation zhao et al 2012 which can affect the reservoir s initial temperature distribution bhade and phirani 2015 as shown in fig 1 temperature and pressure are the main factors affecting the stability of hydrates sloan et al 2010 at the beginning of the drilling fluid invasion the hydrate reservoir gains additional energy from the wellbore when the local temperature exceeds the equilibrium temperature the hydrate crystals in the pores will gradually decompose the endothermic effect of the dissociation will reduce the local temperature and the discharged products will increase the local pressure xu and germanovich 2007 hindering the heat transfer to some extent in addition the local excesst pressure may be transferred to the surroundings and reconvert the discharged gas into hydrates changing the original porosity and permeability of the reservoir meanwhile hydrates reformation will consume some of the dissociated gas and reduce the local pressure until equilibrium is reached during this process the difference between the internal and external pressures can inhibit further drilling fluid invasion and push the discharged fluid towards the wellbore the discharged fluid and hydrate reformation can block the throats in the layers thus the hydrate phase transitions may significantly influence the heat transfer process due to endothermic exothermic effects as shown in fig 2 to study the complicated heat transfer processes in hydrate bearing reservoirs during drilling fluid invasion we designed a set of apparatus and associated experimental procedures the central thermal boundary and the cold edge boundary are simulated by constant high temperature drilling fluid circulation and a constant low temperature environment respectively although the prepared sample is more similar to the well nearby zone and the whole scale is limited by the reactor size then the coupled rules for drilling fluid invasion and hydrate bearing reservoirs have been obtained to provide theoretical support for ensuring safety and improving efficiency during trial development 3 experimental apparatus and procedure 3 1 experimental apparatus the apparatus used for the experiment consisted in injection reaction drilling fluid circulation and data acquisition units as shown in fig 3 the injection unit was used to supply the gas and the liquid solution to the reaction unit and comprised a natural gas container liquid container mixing vessel pump pressure gauge and control valve the reaction unit was used to simulate a typical deepwater reservoir environment and consisted in a reactor and a thermostat the drilling fluid circulation unit which represents the drilling fluid circulation system consisted in a mud tank mud pump recycle pool and control valve the data acquisition unit consisted in several sensors and a data collection computer for real time monitoring of the parameters in the porous media all these equipment were supplied by hai an petroleum scientific research instrument co ltd the reactor is a cylindrical steel container internal effective height 400 mm radius 200 mm sealed with a rubber plug it has a maximum allowable working pressure of 20 mpa to simulate a porous medium the reactor was filled with 0 048 m3 of quartz sand with particles size of 300 600 μm supplied by qingdao wanhong mining co ltd the prepared sample porosity was calculated to be approximately 30 by measuring the initial displaced gas volume chen et al 2018 and the horizontal permeability calculated with the darcy formula gao et al 2019 was approximately 21 md this is in accordance with the field data and related research works carried out in canada japan and the south china sea chen et al 2011 nine different groups of sensors were arranged 50 mm 100 mm and 150 mm away from the centre of the reactor all at a vertical distance of 200 mm from the bottom of the reactor the nine groups were split into three segments each consisting of three groups of sensors arranged to form straight lines the angle between each line was 120 as shown in fig 4 the sensors were used to collect and record real time temperature and had an accuracy of approximately 0 1 k the corresponding sensors on each straight line made up 3 concentric circles the porous media used in the experiment were evenly packed it was assumed that the data were correct when the sensor signals on the same circle were the same the sensors 50 mm 100 mm and 150 mm away from the concentric circle centre of the reactor were marked as no 1 no 2 and no 3 respectively 3 2 experimental procedure the reactor was placed in a thermostat with a temperature range of 267 373 k 0 1 k r22 fluorine was used as refrigerant because of its excellent chemical and thermal stability according to the phase equilibrium curve the experimental pressure 7 mpa and temperatures 276 k 278 k and 280 k were selected to meet the conditions of methane hydrate formation methane gas was charged to the reactor 3 times to purge out residual air before starting the experiment the initial temperatures of methane and quartz packs were approximately 293 298 k sodium dodecyl sulfate sds was used as surfactant to promote the formation and accumulation of hydrates wu and zhang 2010 the sds aqueous solution 600 ppm self prepared and methane gas purity of 99 99 supplied by qingdao airtech gas co ltd were mixed in the mixing vessel until sufficient dissolution then the mixed fluid was injected into the quartz sand until the specified pressure was reached the surrounding temperature was reduced by adjusting the thermostat until the specified value was reached because methane is consumed during hydrates formation and the corresponding pressure will reduce it was necessary to keep replenishing the gas to maintain the pressure at the set point until the system became stable the formation of hydrates in the system was considered to be completed and reached equilibrium after 12 h the saturation was calculated to be 31 according to the quantity of methane gas consumed chen et al 2019 the reservoir permeability was reduced to 2 4 md after the hydrate formation was completed and equilibrium was reached the drilling fluid temperature was set to 293 k a specific heater was installed in the mud tank to rapidly warm the flowing fluid and keep the temperature of the drilling fluid constant the drilling fluid used for the experiment comprised a 0 2 wt nacl solution self prepared and a high pressure pump was used to circulate the fluid all the sensor signals were monitored and recorded by a computer the high temperature drilling fluid was pumped into the wellbore through the centre of the reactor and circulated out through the pipeline with methane gas and water including the dissociated fluid the circulation of the drilling fluid was continued until the data recorded by the sensors were steady and the reservoir temperature field was stable a conventional reservoir with drilling fluid invasion was simulated under the same conditions to compare it with the hydrate reservoir the reactor was filled with 0 048 m3 of quartz sand of uniform size and sds aqueous solution without methane gas so no hydrate was formed the same experimental procedure as for the hydrate reservoir was applied for the conventional reservoir 4 results and discussion 4 1 heat transfer comparison between hydrate and conventional reservoirs the experimental data were recorded and screened every 3 min to obtain clear results the curves of temperature versus time at different positions under the reservoir s initial temperature and initial pressure of 276 k and 7 mpa respectively during drilling fluid invasion were obtained for both the conventional and hydrate reservoirs as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively in fig 5 the heat transfer in a typical conventional reservoir during fluid invasion is divided into 3 periods the first period also referred to as period one shows heat transfer by conduction in this period hot drilling fluid has not reached the sensors and the energy generated by the thermal difference is instantaneously transmitted between the rock skeleton and the fluid the change in the reservoir temperature is relatively small in the second period also referred to as period two there is combined heat transfer action by both conduction and convection during this period the hot drilling fluid reaches the sensors and an improved heat transfer by conduction is observed accordingly the reservoir temperature increased rapidly in the third period also referred to as period three there is almost thermal equilibrium between the reservoir and the drilling fluid and the reservoir temperature is approximately stable from the temperature versus time curves in fig 5 it can be seen that during period one sensor no 1 close to the centre of the reactor has the shortest time while sensor no 3 near the wall edge of the reactor has the longest time when the drilling fluid was in direct contact with the reservoir the temperature increased significantly and went from period one to period two as a result of the additional heat transfer by convection and the improved heat transfer by conduction to some extent the time span of period one indirectly reflects the moving sequence and corresponding average velocity of the drilling fluid invasion front this coincides with the time section of the auxiliary resistance sensors at the end of period three the equilibrium temperature at sensor no 1 50 mm away from the wellbore was the highest followed by sensors no 2 100 mm away from the wellbore and sensor no 3 150 mm away from the wellbore these were determined by the constant temperature of the central thermal boundary and cold edge boundary the rate of heat transfer at sensor no 1 was also faster than those observed at sensors no 2 and no 3 due to the decreasing temperature difference caused by heat loss in the flowing process the heat transfer process in the hydrate reservoir is more complex than that in the conventional reservoir as shown in fig 6 according to the shape of the curves the heat transfer during drilling fluid invasion in the hydrate reservoir can be divided into 6 periods the first period also referred to as period one is merely heat transfer by conduction the second period also referred to as period two is the combined action of heat transfer by both conduction and convection during this period the hot drilling fluid reaches the sensors position with an heat transfer improved by conduction and the curve increases rapidly when the local temperature exceeded the hydrate equilibrium critical temperature approximately 281 k in this research the whole system reached the third period period three in period three the hydrate in the porous media began to decompose and complicated the heat transfer process on the one hand the hydrate dissociation reduced the surrounding temperature because it is an endothermic reaction in addition large amounts of liquid and gas were generated by hydrate dissociation and were discharged into the limited space of the pores this caused the local pressure to be much higher than the initial one causing the fluid to escape from the pore spaces hindering further penetration of the drilling fluid these processes affected the heat transfer and caused the local temperature to fluctuate within a small range when the reduced temperature and increased pressure reached appropriate values the natural gas including the original gas in the pore and decomposed gas combined with free water to regenerate hydrate crystals the period during this process is referred to as period four and has both positive and negative influences on the original reservoir temperature field the positive effect is that hydrate reformation is an exothermic reaction which consumes gas reducing the local pressure and to some extent releasing heat the negative effect is that the new regenerated hydrate crystals are distributed randomly which blocks throats changing the original pore structure reducing permeability and hindering the free flow of the drilling fluid according to the experimental analysis the reformation rate of the new hydrate crystals was much lower than the dissociation rate of the original hydrate crystals period three occurred before period four covered the whole process of period four and was dominated the process due to the continuous supply of wellbore heat energy the fifth period also referred to as period five indicates that the original hydrate crystals were completely decomposed and no hydrate was regenerated in this period heat transfer is similar to that in conventional reservoirs with drilling fluid invasion finally the sixth period also referred to as period six is close to the thermal equilibrium between the reservoir and the drilling fluid with nearly stable reservoir temperature from the curves in fig 6 it can be seen that the results in periods one and two can also indirectly reflect the moving state and corresponding average velocity of the drilling fluid invasion front in the experiments on the hydrate reservoir the electrical resistivity fluctuated slightly in period one which did not occur in the conventional reservoir as shown in fig 7 in the figure the relative electrical resistivity rer represents the ratio of the real time electrical resistivity to the initial electrical resistivity at this time the drilling fluid had not reached the sensors and there was no hydrate decomposition the electrical resistivity fluctuations in period one may be caused by the diffusion of the fluid which are caused by the hydrate closest to the wellbore in fig 6 the time spans of sensor no 1 in periods three and four were shorter than those of sensor no 2 the circulating drilling fluid had a lower temperature and flux at the position of sensor no 2 with a stronger resistance to hydrate dissociation compared to that at the position of sensor no 1 the greater was the distance from the central area heat source the slower was the hydrate dissociation rate and the smaller was the distance from the reactor outer wall cold source the easier it was to satisfy the conditions for hydrate reformation therefore the wave caused by hydrate phase transitions in the curves of sensor no 2 was longer than that in the curves of sensor no 1 the time spans of sensor no 2 in periods three and four were much shorter than those of sensor no 3 moreover the hydrate saturation at sensor no 3 may be higher than at sensors no 1 and no 2 because the former was closer to the reactor s outer wall cold source this phenomenon is known as the climbing effect and has been mentioned in previous literature and experiments yang et al 2012 li et al 2013 the results obtained from the conventional and hydrate reservoirs under the same conditions are extremely different the biggest difference is between the waves in periods three and four which were caused by the hydrate dissociation and reformation in addition for the same sensors the slopes of the curves of periods one and two in the hydrate reservoir are smaller than those in the conventional reservoir due to poor thermal property of the solid hydrate itself in contrast the hydrate blockage weakens the heat transfer by convection however the slopes of the curves of period five in the hydrate reservoir experiments are always steeper than those of period three in the conventional reservoir experiments this is because the original hydrates in the reservoir were completely decomposed this increased the reservoir porosity and permeability and promoted the flow of high temperature drilling fluid 4 2 effect of initial reservoir temperature the real time temperature data at different positions in the hydrate reservoir during drilling fluid invasion at a 7 mpa pressure and temperatures of 278 k and 280 k are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the heat transfer rules are similar to those in fig 6 and the curves can also be divided into 6 periods the curves of sensors no 1 no 2 and no 3 were plotted individually under different conditions to analyse the influence of different reservoir s initial temperatures on the heat transfer as shown in fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 from the figures it can be seen that reservoir s initial temperature affects the starting and maximum values of the curve near equilibrium the curves rise with increasing reservoir s initial temperature further the larger is the temperature difference between the reservoir and the drilling fluid the steeper are the slopes of the curves in periods one and two this means that there was an improved heat transfer effect the trends and slopes of the curves at 276 k and 278 k are very similar after period two the curves representing sensor no 3 nearly overlap on the other hand the curve at 280 k is significantly higher than the two curves at lower temperatures in addition the curves of periods three and four are very short compared to those obtained with the hydrate reservoir there is hardly any wave in the curve of sensor no 3 due to the reservoir s initial temperature 280 k being closer to the phase equilibrium temperature of the hydrate under 7 mpa this has a negative effect on hydrate formation but a positive effect on the hydrate dissociation the higher the reservoir s initial temperature was the earlier the hydrate decomposed which led to the phase equilibrium with a shorter wave it can also be deduced that the lower is the initial temperature the larger is the amount of hydrate which is reflected by the wavelength 5 conclusions in this research the heat transfer in hydrate bearing reservoirs during drilling fluid invasion was investigated through experimental simulations considering the hydrate phase transition characteristics the coupled relationship of the drilling fluid invasion and hydrate bearing reservoir was analysed although the distance between the central thermal boundary with constant high temperature drilling fluid circulation and cold edge boundary with a constant low temperature environment is limited by the reactor size and the real situation in the reservoir cannot be completely reproduced the following findings provide some theory support for ensuring safety and improving the efficiency during hydrate trial developments 1 the heat transfer process in hydrate reservoirs can be divided into 6 periods unlike in conventional reservoirs where the process is divided into 3 periods there is a platform stage indicating hydrate dissociation reformation in the hydrate reservoir in this study the heat transfer was delayed by the hydrate phase transitions due to endothermic effects and local pressure increase in addition the reactions can be reversed by pushing the drilling fluid and changing the porosity and permeability of the porous medium which can not to be ignored 2 the reservoir s initial temperature has significant effects on the heat transfer process in hydrate reservoirs the higher is the reservoir s initial temperature the earlier the hydrate reservoir reaches phase equilibrium and the faster the hydrate decomposes the reservoir s initial temperature also influences the temperature distribution in the reservoir at the end of the invasion changing the hydrate dissociation zone to some extents therefore it is suggested that a suitable temperature not much higher than the reservoir s initial temperature as far as possible below the phase equilibrium of the circulating drilling fluid should be chosen to maintain the hydrate reservoir stability and make effective use of the weak thermodynamic properties of the solid hydrate during the drilling process acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the national natural science foundation of china no 51876222 no 51622405 the program for changjiang

22769,a practical and robust system identification modelling method for ship manoeuvring motion is presented to alleviate the impact of noise induced problems such as parameter drift or over fitting on the model reliability the method is based on ν nu support vector machine ν svm algorithm which can automatically control the number of support vectors to ensure the sparsity of the solution multiple standard manoeuvring datasets are simultaneously used as training data to cope with the parameter drift issues the proposed method is validated by using polluted simulated data of three different levels the results demonstrate that the identified model has good generalisation verifying the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm keywords ship manoeuvring modelling system identification support vector machines 1 introduction accurate ship manoeuvring mathematical model is an essential foundation for the study of ship manoeuvring and control in the study of ship manoeuvrability simulation based on the mathematical model is the primary method of ship manoeuvrability prediction e g sutulo et al 2002 in addition designing modern control systems often requires model based controller whose performance is closely related to the mathematical model therefore establishing reliable mathematical models to meet the application requirement has a high practical value sutulo and guedes soares 2011 among the modelling method the system identification si based approach provides a practical and efficient way that requires low experiment time and cost only the state information and inertia terms are needed for this method and it is not required to measure the forces furthermore this method can be applied to a full scale vessel to avoid the scale effects in the application of an identification modelling method the identification algorithm extracts the characteristics of ship dynamics from the training data however the training data often contain noise which is the main reason to cause problems such as parameter drift and overfitting in the identification to improve the reliability of identification modelling researchers have proposed different methods in the past two decades the improvement of some identification methods is mainly from the perspective of processing training data hwang 1980 discovered the problem of parameter drift and applied parallel processing to process the training data while the results show that parameter drift still occurs yoon and rhee 2003 proposed the estimation before modelling technique to filter the training data and to estimate the forces and state information first besides the modification of the input scenario was suggested to provide more information as the alternative araki et al 2012 used cfd free running trial data to obtain the training data which can avoid the measurement noise in the free running tests data pre processing method was also proposed by luo and li 2017 such as the difference method and the method of additional excitation the results show that the collinearity can be diminished significantly but cannot be eliminated some studies perera et al 2016 revestido herrero and velasco gonzález 2012 pointed out that the zigzag test may not have enough excitation for a large number of parameters revestido herrero and velasco gonzález 2012 applied the stepwise method to select the parameters for a new model however the chosen model structure has limitations because it may not be suitable for predicting other manoeuvres that have different dynamic characteristics than the manoeuvres in the training data gavrilin and steen 2018 applied sensitivity analysis and repeated identification to the passenger ferry landegode and concluded that the true parameters in the mmg model cannot be identified from full scale tests wang and zou 2018 argued that one should be cautious to use a single standard manoeuvre as the training data because the zigzag test datasets of different rudder angle range may contain different dynamic characteristics in this study the goal is set to get a predictive model that focuses on the prediction performance instead of on the identified parameters multiple standard manoeuvring datasets are applied simultaneously as the training data to cope with the parameter drift problem including datasets from 10 10 20 20 zigzag tests and 35 turning test ensuring the ability to predict manoeuvring motion under more extensive range of rudder angles identification modelling methods are also studied from the perspective of the identification algorithm in addition to the traditional si techniques some new identification techniques have been applied in the past two decades such as neural network nn support vector machine svm genetic algorithms and optimisation method nn has been applied widely in the modelling of ship manoeuvring mahfouz and haddara 2003 moreira and guedes soares 2003 rajesh and bhattacharyya 2008 such as recursive neural networks and feedforward neural networks however the neural networks methods have some defects such as poor generalisation and the local extremum a classic genetic algorithm using hausdorff metric was used as an offline identification algorithm in sutulo and guedes soares 2014 the method was validated using simulated responses polluted with the white noise xu et al 2018a applied the genetic algorithm to identify the parameters in a modified version of the abkowitz model the zigzag manoeuvre tests of a chemical tanker ship model were carried out and the datasets were used to validate the method tran khanh et al 2013 proposed a method based on mathematical programming techniques to estimate the optimal ship hydrodynamic parameters perera et al 2015 developed a nonlinear parameter estimation method under dynamic data handling conditions by using an extended kalman filter but concluded that the estimation of the parameters of nonlinear vessel steering model can only be achieved when violent manoeuvres are performed du et al 2017 proposed the multi objective optimisation to identify the optimal hydrodynamic coefficients and the model for ship manoeuvring in a confined waterway has been considered in recent years svm has been applied in the modelling of ship manoeuvring motions svm has three advantages high generalisation performance a globally optimal solution and overcoming the curse of dimensionality luo and zou 2009 performed the studies on parameter identification of the abkowitz model by using least squares support vector machine lssvm the hyper parameter in lssvm algorithm was optimised by particle swarm optimisation pso luo et al 2016 and the artificial bee colony algorithm zhu et al 2017 xu et al 2018b developed an online version of a sequential least square support vector machine to estimate the parameters of vessel steering in real time which compared well with a lssvm run offline the sequential ls svm was trained by different zigzag manoeuvres and was shown to be able of dynamic estimation of the nonlinear parameters however a drawback of lssvm is the lack of sparsity as all the data points become support vectors svs zhang and zou 2011 applied ε svm to identify the abkowitz model using the simulation data without noise as training data ε svm can control the number of svs by parameter ε and then solves the quadratic problem to obtain the global optimal solution however there is still the problem of choosing an appropriate parameter ε which is related to the degree of disturbance in the training data in this paper ν nu svm is applied to solve this problem by constructing the cost function to adjust the parameter ε optimally controlling the number of svs ν svm can tune the insensitivity tube automatically by a constant parameter ν this makes the identification method to be robust under training data at different levels of disturbance the present study proposes a robust identification modelling method for a nonlinear model of ship manoeuvring motion where ν svm is used for the first time for identification modelling of ship manoeuvring motion multiple standard manoeuvring datasets are used as training data simultaneously to obtain more information the final aim is to get a predictive model of the manoeuvring motion at normal speed polluted training data is used to test the method and process noise is considered by using different model structures for identification and training data simulation the generalisation performance is verified by predicting manoeuvring motions not included in the training data the rest of the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the mathematical basis of the ν svm algorithm section 3 derives the regression model for identification from the mathematical model of 3dof ship manoeuvring motion where a mariner class vessel is used as the study object section 4 describes the procedure of identification modelling by using ν svm in section 5 the identification modelling results are illustrated and analysed finally section 6 summarises with conclusions 2 ν support vector machine regression support vector machines svm for regression also known as ε svm in cortes and vapnik 1995 aims to solve a quadratic programming problem based on the principle of structural risk minimisation ε svm has good generalisation performance and the ability to avoid parameter over fitting the parameter ε in ε svm controls the sparseness property which directly affects the performance of the algorithm therefore the prior determination of the desired accuracy ε is a crucial issue in order to better solve this problem a new algorithm is applied called ν nu svm which can automatically adjust ε and predetermine the fraction of training sample as support vectors schölkopf et al 2000 it is not necessary to re determine the parameter ε if the training dataset is polluted by different levels of noise which makes the algorithm more intelligent and robust suppose the training dataset are given as x 1 y 1 x i y i x n y n x k r n y k r the regression problem is to find a function f x to approximate the training dataset taking the form 1 f x w t φ x b where w is the weight vector φ is the nonlinear function b is the bias term for ε svm algorithm according to the structural risk minimisation principle the risk bound is minimised by the following optimisation problem 2 min w ξ k 1 2 w t w c 1 l i 1 l ξ i ξ i subject to 3 a w x i b y i ε ξ i 3 b y i w x i b ε ξ i 3 c ξ i 0 equation 2 is also called the ε insensitive cost function where ξ ε is called ε insensitive training error described by ξ ε max 0 ξ ε only the errors above some ε 0 will be penalised the subset of these data is also called support vectors svs the regularisation constant c determines the trade off between model complexity and ε insensitive training error l is the dimension of the corresponding variables the notation is a shorthand for variables with and without an asterisk i e ξ i and are both satisfied the inequality in υ svm algorithm the ε insensitive cost function is used but ε serves as a variable of the optimisation problem becoming an additional term in the cost function that attempts to minimize ε hence the optimisation problem becomes 4 min w ξ k 1 2 w t w c υ ε 1 l i 1 l ξ i ξ i subject to 5 a y i w t φ x i b ε ξ i 5 b w t φ x i b y i ε ξ i 5 c ξ

η i ξ i i 1 l α i ξ i y i w t φ x i b ε i 1 l α i ξ i w t φ x i b y i ε where α i β η i are lagrange multipliers the optimal solution is given by the saddle point of the lagrangian therefore the conditions for optimality are 7 a l w 0 w i α i α i φ x i 7 b l b 0 i 1 l α i α i 0 7 c l ξ i 0 c υ i α i α i β 0 7 d l ε 0 c l α i η i 0 substituting eq 7 into eq 6 the υ svm optimisation formula is obtained in a quadratic programming form 8 min α i 1 2 i j 1 l α i α i α j α j φ x i t φ x j i 1 l α i α i y i subject to 9 a i 1 l α i α i 0 9 b α i 0 c l 9 c i 1 l α i α i c υ the dot product of φ x can be substituted by kernel functions which can avoid the dimensionality curse in this study the linear kernel is used 10 k x i x j φ x i t φ x j i 1 n j 1 n then the regression function eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 11 f x i 1 l α i α i φ x i φ x b where the weight vector w is formulated as i 1 l α i α i φ x i represented by svs therefore only the training data belonging to the svs will affect the regression results if the resulting ε is nonzero the hyper parameter υ is an upper bound on the relative number of training points lying outside the insensitivity tube and a lower bound on the number of svs relative to the total number of training data which belongs to 0 1 by using the υ svm algorithm the insensitivity tube width is automatically adjusted by automatically determining the hyper parameter ε the relative number of svs is determined in advance by the constant υ for the free running test of ship manoeuvring the data always contains noise such as measurement error and environmental disturbance in this case the υ svm method is more suitable for the dynamic identification of ocean vehicles which can ensure generalisation performance and stability while taking into account the modelling efficiency 3 mathematical model for identification to identify the model a regression model in eq 1 format is deduced from the 3dof model of ship manoeuvring motion the model structure of ship manoeuvring motion is assumed to be known in advance the final model is obtained by identifying the unknown parameters in the model there are different ways to express the hydrodynamic forces and moments in the mathematical model of the ship manoeuvring motion which leads to different model structures the selection of model structure is a trade off between model complexity and model capacity to improve the stability of the identified model the model structure should be simplified appropriately while ensuring meeting the requirements in the present study the 3dof abkowtiz model of a mariner class vessel is taken as a case study this model structure is modified based on the mathematical model in chislett and strom tejsen 1965 fossen 1994 which ignore the influence of port starboard asymmetry by removing three small value coefficients the hydrodynamic forces and moments are expressed as moderately complex 3rd order polynomial expressions with 10 coefficients in surge equation and 12 coefficients in sway and yaw equation respectively 3 1 dynamic model to describe the 3dof ship manoeuvring motion two right handed reference frames are adopted a an earth fixed reference frame o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and b a body fixed reference frame o x y z in the body fixed coordinate system the x axis is pointing to the bow the y axis to starboard the rigid body kinetics in surge sway and yaw motions can be expressed as 12 a m u r v x g r 2 x 12 b m v u r x g r y 12 c i z r m x g v u r n where m is the ship mass i z is the moment of inertia about the z axis x g is the position of the centre of gravity in the longitudinal direction of the body fixed coordinate system u v r are the surge speed sway speed and yaw rate x y n are hydrodynamic force moment the

original dimensional forms by multiplying the first two equations of eq 17 by u 2 l and multiplying the last equation by u 2 l 2 in this way the velocity terms and acceleration terms can be expressed in their dimensional forms while the other terms are still expressed in non dimensional forms then the equations are discretised by using euler s stepping method and get the multiple linear regression model the regression model can be written as a matrix form 18 a u t 1 u t a x t 18 b v t 1 v t b y t 18 c r t 1 r t c z t where the left hand side terms of eq 18 are the outputs at time t 1 a b c are unknown constant parameter vectors to be identified corresponding to the weight vector w in eq 1 x t y t z t are the input vectors at time t corresponding to the φ in eq 1 as can be seen from eq 17 the parameters in vectors b and c are the combinations of hydrodynamic coefficients in equations of sway and yaw motion the input vectors and parameter vectors can be written as 19 a x t u t u t l u 2

eq 18 the input and output information need to be acquired in advance where the speed terms and the rudder angle can be obtained by common sensors the acceleration derivatives can be obtained by some mature calculation method such as the slender body theory 4 identification modelling via ν svm 4 1 goal definition in the actual data acquisition process the data is inevitably polluted by measurement noise and environmental disturbance in this case the estimated parameters are prone to drift from the actual values due to the collinearity between the parameters which is called parameter drift after the parameter drift occurs the identified model is still generally able to accurately predict the motion in the training data but it cannot guarantee the prediction accuracy of other motions especially when the collinearity structure of the parameters corresponding to the test datasets is different or unknown although many methods have been studied to diminish parameter drift it cannot be eliminated without adding more training data therefore if the target is to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients it will be difficult to achieve under noise interference in this study the ultimate goal is set to establish an accurate forecasting model instead of obtaining correct hydrodynamic coefficients the forecasting model is expected to be able to predict the normal manoeuvres under design speed with rudder angle range from zero to full rudder and then can be applied to simulators controller simulations and planning algorithms in the future if the identified model can meet the forecasting requirements the parameter drift within a reasonable range can be tolerated to achieve this target the training data is required to contain as many dynamics as possible 4 2 training data preparation the selection and processing of training data are critical to the generalisation performance of the identification model to improve the stability and generalisation performance of the model the most straightforward solution is to add more training data that characterises different dynamics most previous studies typically applied a single standard manoeuvring data as training data such as 20 20 zigzag manoeuvres luo and zou 2009 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 zhu et al 2017 however it has been argued that the zigzag test with varying angles of rudder contains different dynamic features wang and zou 2018 which means adding more manoeuvring datasets is reasonable in the present work multiple manoeuvring datasets are simultaneously used as training data including the standard 10 10 20 20 zigzag manoeuvres and 35 turning manoeuvre these datasets are relatively easy to obtain because they are the tests required by the standards for ship maneuverability imo 2002 these manoeuvring datasets are sequentially combined in end to end form and the length of each dataset is optimised by the d optimality criterion then the difference method is used to improve the data structure more details about the length optimisation and difference method can be found in wang and zou 2018 then the dataset is divided into a large and a small group for training and evaluation called training set and holdout set respectively according to the derived regression model eq 18 the input of training data for each time step contains surge speed sway speed yaw rate and rudder angle to avoid characteristics of the larger range of values dominating characteristics of the smaller range of values the variables in the training set are standardised and centralised suppose a linear regression model is given as eq 20 the scaling will be in the form of eq 21 each characteristic is scaled to the range 1 1 20 y β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n 21 y y σ y β 1 x 1 x 1 σ x 1 β 2 x 2 x 2 σ x 2 β n x n x n σ x n where y are the response variables x 1 x n are predictor variables and β 1 β n are the parameters to be identified y x n are the mean values of the variables and σ is the variance of the variable β 1 β n are the estimated parameter of the scaled regression model 4 3 modelling and validation the corresponding item in eq 18 is brought into the optimisation problem eq 8 to solve the quadratic programming problem the hyper parameter c is set by the method of grid search and cross validation and the hyper parameter ν is set manually considering the computing efficient and sample data structure the smaller the ν the fewer the support vectors and the faster the calculation will be after the optimal solution is obtained the identified model is derived from eq 11 the validation of the modelling method is focused on the generalisation performance which is the ability to predict other manoeuvring motion not included in the training dataset before verifying the generalisation performance the first step is to evaluate the degree of overfitting which has a significant impact on the generalisation performance comparing the prediction on the training and holdout sets if the performance on the training set is significantly better it suggests overfitting then the hyper parameter c needs to be fine tuned and to repeat the process to get the best performance in evaluating the generalisation performance of the identified model other manoeuvring motions are used including 10 5 15 5 20 5 20 10 25 5 zigzag tests predicting the above manoeuvres by the identified model the state information is compared with the actual sequence 5 verification and validation 5 1 selection of samples a mariner class vessel is taken as the object of research in order to test the adaptive ability and the generalisation performance of the algorithm the polluted data from computer simulation programs are used as the training data moreover the uncertainty of model structure during the identification process is considered a model with different hydrodynamic force moment expressions is selected as the simulator the hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained from the pmm tests and more details can be found in the literature strom tejsen 1965 the training data has a total of 2100 data points including the three standard manoeuvres namely 10 10 20 20 zigzag and 35 turning circle manoeuvres each with 700 data points with a time interval of 0 5 s the training data is polluted artificially by varying degrees of white noise to simulate the effects of disturbance such as measurement noise the method of noise generation refers to the literature sutulo and guedes soares 2014 using the formula as 22 ζ i ζ 0 i ζ max k 0 k ζ ξ i where ζ 0 i is the original clean response and ζ max k 0 k ζ ξ i is the disturbance part concretely ζ max is the maximum absolute value of the clean response k ζ is the reduction factor for the different dofs response which is set to 0 05 for the rudder angle 0 2 for the surge velocity and 1 0 for the other responses ξ i is the gaussian white noise process k 0 is the general reduction factor used to characterise the degree of noise which is selected as 1 5 10 the three cases will be referred as noise level 1 nlv1 noise level 2 nlv2 and noise level 3 nlv3 respectively these levels simulate different degrees of measurement noise which are related to the type of sensors and the way of data collection for instance noise level 1 corresponds to the data from precision sensors or pre processed noise level 2 and 3 can be the data collected by a normal navigation unit or other conventional sensors 5 2 identification results the proposed method is used to model the ship manoeuvring motion from the free running test dataset the hyper parameter υ is selected as 0 3 table 1 shows the ε values and the number of svs during the identification modelling under three noise cases as the degree of noise increases the ε value is adaptively adjusted for example the value of ε in noise level 3 is adjusted to be nearly 10 times the value of ε in noise level 1 thereby ensuring the stability of the number of svs the number of svs remains almost the same around 634 in this situation the insensitivity tube with radius ε is tuned automatically for an intuitive illustration fig 1 shows the change of insensitivity tube in the sway motion under different noise cases the black circle represents the training data point the blue triangle symbol represents the regression value and the two red lines are the boundary of the tube the insensitivity tube controls the number of the svs only they affect the regression results the above results indicate that the adaptive adjustment of the method is active so that the algorithm ensures the sparsity of the solutions under different training data this can improve the efficiency and robustness of the identification table 2 presents a comparison of the identification coefficients with the original coefficients chislett and strom tejsen 1965 these coefficients are identified under the excitation of clean dataset and three noise levels datasets for the clean datasets most coefficients can be accurately identified but some identified coefficients have a sign error one possible reason is that the training data does not have enough information for each coefficient another reason may be the process noise caused by the uncertainty of the model structure the parameter drift occurs when using datasets of three noise levels the higher the noise level the more severe the parameter drifts this problem arises when identifying under noise interference but it is actually caused by multicollinearity therefore it is difficult to eliminate parameter drift without adding more training data as described in section 4 1 the proposed identification scheme aims to establish an accurate forecasting model rather than obtaining correct hydrodynamic coefficients thereby the validation of the model will be focused on the generalisation ability 5 3 validation of the generalisation performance the primary evaluation criteria of the forecasting model are the generalisation performance in the present work the generalisation performance of the identified model is verified by forecasting the manoeuvres including 10 5 15 5 20 5 25 5 30 5 20 10 zigzag manoeuvres root mean square error rmse and symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape are used to measure the prediction accuracy of the forecasting method smape is defined by the formula 23 s m a p e 100 n t 1 n f t a t a t f t 2 where a t is the actual value and f t is the predictive value the result provides a percentage error between 0 and 200 which is smaller when the forecast is more accurate the predictions of the speeds in the 3dof motions and the heading angle are compared with the original data the cases of 10 5 15 5 20 10 and 30 5 zigzag manoeuvres are shown in figs 2 5 the forecasts results of 20 5 and 25 5 zigzag manoeuvres are similar to those of 20 10 30 5 zigzag manoeuvres respectively figs 6 and 7 show the evaluation index for manoeuvring motion prediction the effect of noise on forecast results is still somewhat noticeable the accuracy of the forecast under noise level 1 is better than that under noise level 3 especially for the surge motion prediction but overall the prediction results agree well with the actual data the time series of velocities can be well fitted under different degree of noise interference which means an accurate prediction of trajectory from the perspective of rmse index the predictions of the manoeuvres are accurate under noise disturbance there is still room for improvement in the prediction of large rudder angle manoeuvres the forecasts of sway speed and yaw rate are accurate in the first 100s but then a cumulative deviation occurs the analysis results obtained from the smape index are approximate the prediction accuracy of most cases is satisfactory that having a smape index of less than 20 except for the prediction of sway velocity and yaw rate in large rudder angle cases in the design of training data 35 turning circle manoeuvre is selected to cover the dynamic characteristics for large rudder angle motion but the results indicate that the excitation for this region may not be sufficient since turning circle motion involves much steady motion in the prediction of the 10 5 zigzag manoeuvres under noise level 3 there is a deviation in the prediction of the surge speed there may be two reasons for the deviation first the variation range of the surge speed is relatively small under small rudder angle when the large noise pollution makes it difficult to distinguish the dynamic characteristics the over fitting is generated second since the state variables in small rudder angle motion are less fluctuating relative to those in the large rudder angle motion the weighting of the regression accuracy of the large rudder angle motion becomes larger when performing the grid search of the parameters it suggests that the configuration of training data needs to be further improved in future work in summary identification modelling can meet the requirements of accurately predicting the normal manoeuvres of stable propeller revolution it is also relatively stable under noise interference the results demonstrate the effectiveness and good generalization performance of the proposed method 6 conclusion this paper proposes a ν svm based identification method to establish a predictive model of ship manoeuvring motion the advantages of ν svm are able to automatically determine parameter ε and pre determine the number of svs when the collected data is polluted ν svm can ensure the sparsity of the solution through adaptive adjustment this will reduce the time required for tuning and better leverage the advantages of the svm algorithm to maintain efficiency and accuracy the modelling purpose is set to forecasting rather than identifying parameters multiple manoeuvring motions are simultaneously used as training data to provide more dynamic features parameter drift still occurs but by acquiring more information from the training data the impact of parameter drift is minimised the effects of parameter drift can be tolerated under the premise of ensuring generalisation performance as a result the proposed method can model manoeuvring motion efficiently under different levels of noise pollution the prediction of other manoeuvres proves that the model has a good generalisation

22769,a practical and robust system identification modelling method for ship manoeuvring motion is presented to alleviate the impact of noise induced problems such as parameter drift or over fitting on the model reliability the method is based on ν nu support vector machine ν svm algorithm which can automatically control the number of support vectors to ensure the sparsity of the solution multiple standard manoeuvring datasets are simultaneously used as training data to cope with the parameter drift issues the proposed method is validated by using polluted simulated data of three different levels the results demonstrate that the identified model has good generalisation verifying the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm keywords ship manoeuvring modelling system identification support vector machines 1 introduction accurate ship manoeuvring mathematical model is an essential foundation for the study of ship manoeuvring and control in the study of ship manoeuvrability simulation based on the mathematical model is the primary method of ship manoeuvrability prediction e g sutulo et al 2002 in addition designing modern control systems often requires model based controller whose performance is closely related to the mathematical model therefore establishing reliable mathematical models to meet the application requirement has a high practical value sutulo and guedes soares 2011 among the modelling method the system identification si based approach provides a practical and efficient way that requires low experiment time and cost only the state information and inertia terms are needed for this method and it is not required to measure the forces furthermore this method can be applied to a full scale vessel to avoid the scale effects in the application of an identification modelling method the identification algorithm extracts the characteristics of ship dynamics from the training data however the training data often contain noise which is the main reason to cause problems such as parameter drift and overfitting in the identification to improve the reliability of identification modelling researchers have proposed different methods in the past two decades the improvement of some identification methods is mainly from the perspective of processing training data hwang 1980 discovered the problem of parameter drift and applied parallel processing to process the training data while the results show that parameter drift still occurs yoon and rhee 2003 proposed the estimation before modelling technique to filter the training data and to estimate the forces and state information first besides the modification of the input scenario was suggested to provide more information as the alternative araki et al 2012 used cfd free running trial data to obtain the training data which can avoid the measurement noise in the free running tests data pre processing method was also proposed by luo and li 2017 such as the difference method and the method of additional excitation the results show that the collinearity can be diminished significantly but cannot be eliminated some studies perera et al 2016 revestido herrero and velasco gonzález 2012 pointed out that the zigzag test may not have enough excitation for a large number of parameters revestido herrero and velasco gonzález 2012 applied the stepwise method to select the parameters for a new model however the chosen model structure has limitations because it may not be suitable for predicting other manoeuvres that have different dynamic characteristics than the manoeuvres in the training data gavrilin and steen 2018 applied sensitivity analysis and repeated identification to the passenger ferry landegode and concluded that the true parameters in the mmg model cannot be identified from full scale tests wang and zou 2018 argued that one should be cautious to use a single standard manoeuvre as the training data because the zigzag test datasets of different rudder angle range may contain different dynamic characteristics in this study the goal is set to get a predictive model that focuses on the prediction performance instead of on the identified parameters multiple standard manoeuvring datasets are applied simultaneously as the training data to cope with the parameter drift problem including datasets from 10 10 20 20 zigzag tests and 35 turning test ensuring the ability to predict manoeuvring motion under more extensive range of rudder angles identification modelling methods are also studied from the perspective of the identification algorithm in addition to the traditional si techniques some new identification techniques have been applied in the past two decades such as neural network nn support vector machine svm genetic algorithms and optimisation method nn has been applied widely in the modelling of ship manoeuvring mahfouz and haddara 2003 moreira and guedes soares 2003 rajesh and bhattacharyya 2008 such as recursive neural networks and feedforward neural networks however the neural networks methods have some defects such as poor generalisation and the local extremum a classic genetic algorithm using hausdorff metric was used as an offline identification algorithm in sutulo and guedes soares 2014 the method was validated using simulated responses polluted with the white noise xu et al 2018a applied the genetic algorithm to identify the parameters in a modified version of the abkowitz model the zigzag manoeuvre tests of a chemical tanker ship model were carried out and the datasets were used to validate the method tran khanh et al 2013 proposed a method based on mathematical programming techniques to estimate the optimal ship hydrodynamic parameters perera et al 2015 developed a nonlinear parameter estimation method under dynamic data handling conditions by using an extended kalman filter but concluded that the estimation of the parameters of nonlinear vessel steering model can only be achieved when violent manoeuvres are performed du et al 2017 proposed the multi objective optimisation to identify the optimal hydrodynamic coefficients and the model for ship manoeuvring in a confined waterway has been considered in recent years svm has been applied in the modelling of ship manoeuvring motions svm has three advantages high generalisation performance a globally optimal solution and overcoming the curse of dimensionality luo and zou 2009 performed the studies on parameter identification of the abkowitz model by using least squares support vector machine lssvm the hyper parameter in lssvm algorithm was optimised by particle swarm optimisation pso luo et al 2016 and the artificial bee colony algorithm zhu et al 2017 xu et al 2018b developed an online version of a sequential least square support vector machine to estimate the parameters of vessel steering in real time which compared well with a lssvm run offline the sequential ls svm was trained by different zigzag manoeuvres and was shown to be able of dynamic estimation of the nonlinear parameters however a drawback of lssvm is the lack of sparsity as all the data points become support vectors svs zhang and zou 2011 applied ε svm to identify the abkowitz model using the simulation data without noise as training data ε svm can control the number of svs by parameter ε and then solves the quadratic problem to obtain the global optimal solution however there is still the problem of choosing an appropriate parameter ε which is related to the degree of disturbance in the training data in this paper ν nu svm is applied to solve this problem by constructing the cost function to adjust the parameter ε optimally controlling the number of svs ν svm can tune the insensitivity tube automatically by a constant parameter ν this makes the identification method to be robust under training data at different levels of disturbance the present study proposes a robust identification modelling method for a nonlinear model of ship manoeuvring motion where ν svm is used for the first time for identification modelling of ship manoeuvring motion multiple standard manoeuvring datasets are used as training data simultaneously to obtain more information the final aim is to get a predictive model of the manoeuvring motion at normal speed polluted training data is used to test the method and process noise is considered by using different model structures for identification and training data simulation the generalisation performance is verified by predicting manoeuvring motions not included in the training data the rest of the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the mathematical basis of the ν svm algorithm section 3 derives the regression model for identification from the mathematical model of 3dof ship manoeuvring motion where a mariner class vessel is used as the study object section 4 describes the procedure of identification modelling by using ν svm in section 5 the identification modelling results are illustrated and analysed finally section 6 summarises with conclusions 2 ν support vector machine regression support vector machines svm for regression also known as ε svm in cortes and vapnik 1995 aims to solve a quadratic programming problem based on the principle of structural risk minimisation ε svm has good generalisation performance and the ability to avoid parameter over fitting the parameter ε in ε svm controls the sparseness property which directly affects the performance of the algorithm therefore the prior determination of the desired accuracy ε is a crucial issue in order to better solve this problem a new algorithm is applied called ν nu svm which can automatically adjust ε and predetermine the fraction of training sample as support vectors schölkopf et al 2000 it is not necessary to re determine the parameter ε if the training dataset is polluted by different levels of noise which makes the algorithm more intelligent and robust suppose the training dataset are given as x 1 y 1 x i y i x n y n x k r n y k r the regression problem is to find a function f x to approximate the training dataset taking the form 1 f x w t φ x b where w is the weight vector φ is the nonlinear function b is the bias term for ε svm algorithm according to the structural risk minimisation principle the risk bound is minimised by the following optimisation problem 2 min w ξ k 1 2 w t w c 1 l i 1 l ξ i ξ i subject to 3 a w x i b y i ε ξ i 3 b y i w x i b ε ξ i 3 c ξ i 0 equation 2 is also called the ε insensitive cost function where ξ ε is called ε insensitive training error described by ξ ε max 0 ξ ε only the errors above some ε 0 will be penalised the subset of these data is also called support vectors svs the regularisation constant c determines the trade off between model complexity and ε insensitive training error l is the dimension of the corresponding variables the notation is a shorthand for variables with and without an asterisk i e ξ i and are both satisfied the inequality in υ svm algorithm the ε insensitive cost function is used but ε serves as a variable of the optimisation problem becoming an additional term in the cost function that attempts to minimize ε hence the optimisation problem becomes 4 min w ξ k 1 2 w t w c υ ε 1 l i 1 l ξ i ξ i subject to 5 a y i w t φ x i b ε ξ i 5 b w t φ x i b y i ε ξ i 5 c ξ i 0 ε 0 in the cost function ε is a variable optimised by the constant υ the lagrange formulation of this optimisation problem is 6 l w b α β ξ ε η 1 2 w t w c υ ε c l i 1 l ξ i ξ i β ε i 1 l η i ξ i η i ξ i i 1 l α i ξ i y i w t φ x i b ε i 1 l α i ξ i w t φ x i b y i ε where α i β η i are lagrange multipliers the optimal solution is given by the saddle point of the lagrangian therefore the

obtained in a quadratic programming form 8 min α i 1 2 i j 1 l α i α i α j α j φ x i t φ x j i 1 l α i α i y i subject to 9 a i 1 l α i α i 0 9 b α i 0 c l 9 c i 1 l α i α i c υ the dot product of φ x can be substituted by kernel functions which can avoid the dimensionality curse in this study the linear kernel is used 10 k x i x j φ x i t φ x j i 1 n j 1 n then the regression function eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 11 f x i 1 l α i α i φ x i φ x b where the weight vector w is formulated as i 1 l α i α i φ x i represented by svs therefore only the training data belonging to the svs will affect the regression results if the resulting ε is nonzero the hyper parameter υ is an upper bound on the relative number of training points lying outside the insensitivity tube and a lower bound on the number of svs relative to the total number of training data which belongs to 0 1 by using the υ svm algorithm the insensitivity tube width is automatically adjusted by automatically determining the hyper parameter ε the relative number of svs is determined in advance by the constant υ for the free running test of ship manoeuvring the data always contains noise such as measurement error and environmental disturbance in this case the υ svm method is more suitable for the dynamic identification of ocean vehicles which can ensure generalisation performance and stability while taking into account the modelling efficiency 3 mathematical model for identification to identify the model a regression model in eq 1 format is deduced from the 3dof model of ship manoeuvring motion the model structure of ship manoeuvring motion is assumed to be known in advance the final model is obtained by identifying the unknown parameters in the model there are different ways to express the hydrodynamic forces and moments in the mathematical model of the ship manoeuvring motion which leads to different model structures the selection of model structure is a trade off between model complexity and model capacity to improve the stability of the identified model the model structure should be simplified appropriately while ensuring meeting the requirements in the present study the 3dof abkowtiz model of a mariner class vessel is taken as a case study this model structure is modified based on the mathematical model in chislett and strom tejsen 1965 fossen 1994 which ignore the influence of port starboard asymmetry by removing three small value coefficients the hydrodynamic forces and moments are expressed as moderately complex 3rd order polynomial expressions with 10 coefficients in surge equation and 12 coefficients in sway and yaw equation respectively 3 1 dynamic model to describe the 3dof ship manoeuvring motion two right handed reference frames are adopted a an earth fixed reference frame o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and b a body fixed reference frame o x y z in the body fixed coordinate system the x axis is pointing to the bow the y axis to starboard the rigid body kinetics in surge sway and yaw motions can be expressed as 12 a m u r v x g r 2 x 12 b m v u r x g r y 12 c i z r m x g v u r n where m is the ship mass i z is the moment of inertia about the z axis x g is the position of the centre of gravity in the longitudinal direction of the body fixed coordinate system u v r are the surge speed sway speed and yaw rate x y n are hydrodynamic force moment the forces on the right hand side of eq 12 are expressed as 13 x 1 2 ρ l 2 u 2 x y 1 2 ρ l 2 u 2 y n 1 2 ρ l 3 u 2 n where x y and n are the non dimensional form of the hydrodynamic force moment ρ is the water density l is the ship length u u 0 u 2 v 2 is the instantaneous ship speed u is a small perturbation from the nominal surge speed u 0 using δ to indicate the rudder angle the non dimensional forms of hydrodynamic force moment are represented as eq 14 to better test the property of the identification algorithm it is assumed that a good model structure has been chosen as prior knowledge 14

original dimensional forms by multiplying the first two equations of eq 17 by u 2 l and multiplying the last equation by u 2 l 2 in this way the velocity terms and acceleration terms can be expressed in their dimensional forms while the other terms are still expressed in non dimensional forms then the equations are discretised by using euler s stepping method and get the multiple linear regression

eq 18 the input and output information need to be acquired in advance where the speed terms and the rudder angle can be obtained by common sensors the acceleration derivatives can be obtained by some mature calculation method such as the slender body theory 4 identification modelling via ν svm 4 1 goal definition in the actual data acquisition process the data is inevitably polluted by measurement noise and environmental disturbance in this case the estimated parameters are prone to drift from the actual values due to the collinearity between the parameters which is called parameter drift after the parameter drift occurs the identified model is still generally able to accurately predict the motion in the training data but it cannot guarantee the prediction accuracy of other motions especially when the collinearity structure of the parameters corresponding to the test datasets is different or unknown although many methods have been studied to diminish parameter drift it cannot be eliminated without adding more training data therefore if the target is to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients it will be difficult to achieve under noise interference in this study the ultimate goal is set to establish an accurate forecasting model instead of obtaining correct hydrodynamic coefficients the forecasting model is expected to be able to predict the normal manoeuvres under design speed with rudder angle range from zero to full rudder and then can be applied to simulators controller simulations and planning algorithms in the future if the identified model can meet the forecasting requirements the parameter drift within a reasonable range can be tolerated to achieve this target the training data is required to contain as many dynamics as possible 4 2 training data preparation the selection and processing of training data are critical to the generalisation performance of the identification model to improve the stability and generalisation performance of the model the most straightforward solution is to add more training data that characterises different dynamics most previous studies typically applied a single standard manoeuvring data as training data such as 20 20 zigzag manoeuvres luo and zou 2009 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 zhu et al 2017 however it has been argued that the zigzag test with varying angles of rudder contains different dynamic features wang and zou 2018 which means adding more manoeuvring datasets is reasonable in the present work multiple manoeuvring datasets are simultaneously used as training data including the standard 10 10 20 20 zigzag manoeuvres and 35 turning manoeuvre these datasets are relatively easy to obtain because they are the tests required by the standards for ship maneuverability imo 2002 these manoeuvring datasets are sequentially combined in end to end form and the length of each dataset is optimised by the d optimality criterion then the difference method is used to improve the data structure more details about the length optimisation and difference method can be found in wang and zou 2018 then the dataset is divided into a large and a small group for training and evaluation called training set and holdout set respectively according to the derived regression model eq 18 the input of training data for each time step contains surge speed sway speed yaw rate and rudder angle to avoid characteristics of the larger range of values dominating characteristics of the smaller range of values the variables in the training set are standardised and centralised suppose a linear regression model is given as eq 20 the scaling will be in the form of eq 21 each characteristic is scaled to the range 1 1 20 y β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n 21 y y σ y β 1 x 1 x 1 σ x 1 β 2 x 2 x 2 σ x 2 β n x n x n σ x n where y are the response variables x 1 x n are predictor variables and β 1 β n are the parameters to be identified y x n are the mean values of the variables and σ is the variance of the variable β 1 β n are the estimated parameter of the scaled regression model 4 3 modelling and validation the corresponding item in eq 18 is brought into the optimisation problem eq 8 to solve the quadratic programming problem the hyper parameter c is set by the method of grid search and cross validation and the hyper parameter ν is set manually considering the computing efficient and sample data structure the smaller the ν the fewer the support vectors and the faster the calculation will be after the optimal solution is obtained the identified model is derived from eq 11 the validation of the modelling method is focused on the generalisation performance which is the ability to predict other manoeuvring motion not included in the training dataset before verifying the generalisation performance the first step is to evaluate the degree of overfitting which has a significant impact on the generalisation performance comparing the prediction on the training and holdout sets if the performance on the training set is significantly better it suggests overfitting then the hyper parameter c needs to be fine tuned and to repeat the process to get the best performance in evaluating the generalisation performance of the identified model other manoeuvring motions are used including 10 5 15 5 20 5 20 10 25 5 zigzag tests predicting the above manoeuvres by the identified model the state information is compared with the actual sequence 5 verification and validation 5 1 selection of samples a mariner class vessel is taken as the object of research in order to test the adaptive ability and the generalisation performance of the algorithm the polluted data from computer simulation programs are used as the training data moreover the uncertainty of model structure during the identification process is considered a model with different hydrodynamic force moment expressions is selected as the simulator the hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained from the pmm tests and more details can be found in the literature strom tejsen 1965 the training data has a total of 2100 data points including the three standard manoeuvres namely 10 10 20 20 zigzag and 35 turning circle manoeuvres each with 700 data points with a time interval of 0 5 s the training data is polluted artificially by varying degrees of white noise to simulate the effects of disturbance such as measurement noise the method of noise generation refers to the literature sutulo and guedes soares 2014 using the formula as 22 ζ i ζ 0 i ζ max k 0 k ζ ξ i where ζ 0 i is the original clean response and ζ max k 0 k ζ ξ i is the disturbance part concretely ζ max is the maximum absolute value of the clean response k ζ is the reduction factor for the different dofs response which is set to 0 05 for the rudder angle 0 2 for the surge velocity and 1 0 for the other responses ξ i is the gaussian white noise process k 0 is the general reduction factor used to characterise the degree of noise which is selected as 1 5 10 the three cases will be referred as noise level 1 nlv1 noise level 2 nlv2 and noise level 3 nlv3 respectively these levels simulate different degrees of measurement noise which are related to the type of sensors and the way of data collection for instance noise level 1 corresponds to the data from precision sensors or pre processed noise level 2 and 3 can be the data collected by a normal navigation unit or other conventional sensors 5 2 identification results the proposed method is used to model the ship manoeuvring motion from the free running test dataset the hyper parameter υ is selected as 0 3 table 1 shows the ε values and the number of svs during the identification modelling under three noise cases as the degree of noise increases the ε value is adaptively adjusted for example the value of ε in noise level 3 is adjusted to be nearly 10 times the value of ε in noise level 1 thereby ensuring the stability of the number of svs the number of svs remains almost the same around 634 in this situation the insensitivity tube with radius ε is tuned automatically for an intuitive illustration fig 1 shows the change of insensitivity tube in the sway motion under different noise cases the black circle represents the training data point the blue triangle symbol represents the regression value and the two red lines are the boundary of the tube the insensitivity tube controls the number of the svs only they affect the regression results the above results indicate that the adaptive adjustment of the method is active so that the algorithm ensures the sparsity of the solutions under different training data this can improve the efficiency and robustness of the identification table 2 presents a comparison of the identification coefficients with the original coefficients chislett and strom tejsen 1965 these coefficients are identified under the excitation of clean dataset and three noise levels datasets for the clean datasets most coefficients can be accurately identified but some identified coefficients have a sign error one possible reason is that the training data does not have enough information for each coefficient another reason may be the process noise caused by the uncertainty of the model structure the parameter drift occurs when using datasets of three noise levels the higher the noise level the more severe the parameter drifts this problem arises when identifying under noise interference but it is actually caused by multicollinearity therefore it is difficult to eliminate parameter drift without adding more training data as described in section 4 1 the proposed identification scheme aims to establish an accurate forecasting model rather than obtaining correct hydrodynamic coefficients thereby the validation of the model will be focused on the generalisation ability 5 3 validation of the generalisation performance the primary evaluation criteria of the forecasting model are the generalisation performance in the present work the generalisation performance of the identified model is verified by forecasting the manoeuvres including 10 5 15 5 20 5 25 5 30 5 20 10 zigzag manoeuvres root mean square error rmse and symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape are used to measure the prediction accuracy of the forecasting method smape is defined by the formula 23 s m a p e 100 n t 1 n f t a t a t f t 2 where a t is the actual value and f t is the predictive value the result provides a percentage error between 0 and 200 which is smaller when the forecast is more accurate the predictions of the speeds in the 3dof motions and the heading angle are compared with the original data the cases of 10 5 15 5 20 10 and 30 5 zigzag manoeuvres are shown in figs 2 5 the forecasts results of 20 5 and 25 5 zigzag manoeuvres are similar to those of 20 10 30 5 zigzag manoeuvres respectively figs 6 and 7 show the evaluation index for manoeuvring motion prediction the effect of noise on forecast results is still somewhat noticeable the accuracy of the forecast under noise level 1 is better than that under noise level 3 especially for the surge motion prediction but overall the prediction results agree well with the actual data the time series of velocities can be well fitted under different degree of noise interference which means an accurate prediction of trajectory from the perspective of rmse index the predictions of the manoeuvres are accurate under noise disturbance there is still room for improvement in the prediction of large rudder angle manoeuvres the forecasts of sway speed and yaw rate are accurate in the first 100s but then a cumulative deviation occurs the analysis results obtained from the smape index are approximate the prediction accuracy of most cases is satisfactory that having a smape index of less than 20 except for the prediction of sway velocity and yaw rate in large rudder angle cases in the design of training data 35 turning circle manoeuvre is selected to cover the dynamic characteristics for large rudder angle motion but the results indicate that the excitation for this region may not be sufficient since turning circle motion involves much steady motion in the prediction of the 10 5 zigzag manoeuvres under noise level 3 there is a deviation in the prediction of the surge speed there may be two reasons for the deviation first the variation range of the surge speed is relatively small under small rudder angle when the large noise pollution makes it difficult to distinguish the dynamic characteristics the over fitting is generated second since the state variables in small rudder angle motion are less fluctuating relative to those in the large rudder angle motion the weighting of the regression accuracy of the large rudder angle motion becomes larger when performing the grid search of the parameters it suggests that the configuration of training data needs to be further improved in future work in summary identification modelling can meet the requirements of accurately predicting the normal manoeuvres of stable propeller revolution it is also relatively stable under noise interference the results demonstrate the effectiveness and good generalization performance of the proposed method 6 conclusion this paper proposes a ν svm based identification method to establish a predictive model of ship manoeuvring motion the advantages of ν svm are able to automatically determine parameter ε and pre determine the number of svs when the collected data is polluted ν svm can ensure the sparsity of the solution through adaptive adjustment this will reduce the time required for tuning and better leverage the advantages of the svm algorithm to maintain efficiency and accuracy the modelling purpose is set to forecasting rather than identifying parameters multiple manoeuvring motions are simultaneously used as training data to provide more dynamic features parameter drift still occurs but by acquiring more information from the training data the impact of parameter drift is minimised the effects of parameter drift can be tolerated under the premise of ensuring generalisation performance as a result the proposed method can model manoeuvring motion efficiently under different levels of noise pollution the prediction of other manoeuvres proves that the model has a good generalisation performance verifying the robustness of the algorithm acknowledgements this work is financially supported by the national natural science foundations of china grant number 51609132 and 51779140 and
