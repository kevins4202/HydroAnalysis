17635,hospital wastewater contains several micro and macro pollutants that cannot be removed efficiently by conventional treatment processes thus generally hybrid and multistage treatment methods are suggested for the treatment of hospital wastewater supercritical water oxidation scwo is a promising method for the removal of emerging organic pollutants from hospital wastewater in one step and a very short reaction time in this study supercritical water oxidation scwo process was used for the removal of pharmaceuticals in addition to conventional pollutants from real hospital wastewater as a result of a series of preliminary studies the optimum conditions were selected as 450 c 60 s and 1 1 for temperature reaction time and oxidant ratio h2o2 cod respectively for the treatment of hospital wastewater at 25 1 mpa the removal rates were determined above 90 for cod bod toc tn and ss from hospital wastewater phosphorus removal was greater than 90 while the removal rates were around 80 for phenol aox and surfactants in hospital wastewater a total of 9 pharmaceuticals were observed in the real hospital wastewater samples the highest removal rate was obtained for paracetamol as 99 9 while the lowest removal rate was obtained for warfarin as 72 after scwo treatment of hospital wastewater as a result it can be concluded that scwo process is sufficient for the treatment of hospital wastewater without the need of additional treatment steps with high removal rates in a short reaction time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords medical waste hospital wastewater pharmaceuticals supercritical water oxidation 1 introduction hospitals are a major source of infectious and hazardous waste streams to the natural environment generally the waste streams are classified in 3 categories namely i municipal waste which composed of non hazardous materials such as kitchen waste and recyclable waste including paper cardboard and plastics etc ii medical waste including hazardous and infectious waste such as body parts surgery waste and sharp materials such as needle broken glasses etc and iii liquid waste including pharmaceutical waste chemical and biological waste from laboratories and radioactive waste ekhaise et al 2008 eker et al 2010 in addition to medical waste including hazardous and infectious solid residues healthcare instutions are a major source of wastewater the quantity of hospital wastewater is closely related to the size and provided services of the hospital the amount of wastewater generated from hospitals in developed countries has been reported to be in the range of 400 1200 l day per bed whereas this amount is reported to be 200 400 l capita day for developing countries with an average of approximately 750 l day per bed emmanuel et al 2009 al aukidy et al 2017 hospital wastewater generated as a result of diagnosis equipment disinfection and laboratory activities contains considerable amount of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites chemicals radioactive and other toxic organic and inorganic chemical substances anesthetics and sterilization products various pathogenic microorganisms as well as excreta from the patients rezaee et al 2005 chong and jin 2012 casas et al 2015 kumari et al 2020 the main environmental problem caused from these pollutant loads and generated wastewater is the discharge in sewerage systems directly without any treatment the nature of the hospital wastewater differ from domestic sewage with its wide variety of toxic substances mainly drug residues and their metabolites pathogenic microorganisms chemical species such as phenols and detergents along with emerging pollutants in excess to other compounds it is reported that such micropollutants are 4 150 times higher than that of domestic sewage in hospital wastewater chonova et al 2016 khan et al 2019 the conventional treatment plants are reported to be inefficient for inactivation of the bacteria and the removal of toxic and recalcitrant compounds such as pharmaceuticals due to their low biodegrability ooi et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 moussavi et al 2019 hospital wastewater believed to have a higher concentration of pharmaceutical residues than municipal wastewater therefore separate treatment of hospital wastewater will provide the reduction of the pharmaceuticals load to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and prevent pharmaceutical discharge to the environment due to combined sewer overflows and sewer leakages auvinen et al 2017 there are many studies reporting insufficient removal efficiencies of hospital based pollutants in conventional wastewater treatment plants sacher et al 2001 zhang et al 2008 luo et al 2014 sorengard et al 2019 huerta fontela et al 2011 reported β blockers carbamazepine and hormons in the effluent of treatment plant in spain behara et al 2011 reported ineffective removal of 20 pharmaceuticals in 5 conventional wastewater treatment plants in south korea papageorgiou et al 2019 measured 138 analytes from 37 different classes of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcp in wastewater treatment plants and in the effluents of hospitals they reported that the concentrations were not negligible in the effluent of all treatment plants indicating the inefficiency of the conventional wastewater treatment plants for ppcp removal therefore new and efficient methods for onsite treatment of hospital wastewater which can be effective in the removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogenic microorganisms have been investigated during the last decade most of these studies are focused on the physico chemical treatment gautam et al 2007 alvarez torrellas et al 2017 ajo et al 2018 advanced oxidation chiang et al 2003 witte et al 2010 hansen et al 2016 garcía muñoz et al 2017 and biological treatment including membrane bioreactors wen et al 2004 rezaee et al 2005 pauwels et al 2006 radjenovic et al 2007 liu et al 2010 delgado et al 2011 serna galvis et al 2019 vo et al 2019 supercritical water technology which is based on the unique characteristics of water under supercritical conditions t 374 1 c and p 22 1 mpa has been gained much attention as an alternative treatment technology in recent years falamarzian et al 2014 physical and chemical properties of water differs from ambient water because of the decrease in hydrogen bonding content wang et al 2015 xu et al 2015 the density dielectric constant and viscosity of water desrease from 1000 kg m3 80 and 0 89 µpa s to 322 kg m3 2 and 0 03 µpa s respectively in supercritical water susanti et al 2014 therefore supercritical water becomes a very good solvent for nonpolar materials i e hydrocarbons and a poor solvent for polar materials salts and other ionic compounds contraversly from that of ambient conditions marrone 2013 despite the scwo process considered to be an efficient technology for the treatment of high strength wastewater its industrial application has been hindered by the main problems of corrosion and salt precipitation du et al 2013 numerous amount of studies have been published on the reduction of the corrosion and salt precipitation in scwo reactors these studies generally focused on the usage of corrosion resistant materials coating applications employement of transpiring wall neutralization and optimization of the operating conditions huddle et al 2017 supercritical water oxidation scwo is being used widely in industrial wastewater treatment for its high efficiency in the removal of organic matters in recent years amongst the alternative wastewater treatment techniques including physical chemical and biological treatment systems supercritical water oxidation is a promising technology to detoxify and remediate a wide range of emerging organic pollutants researhers reported the treatment of different types of wastewater such as textile wastewater landfill leachate chemical wastewater printing and dying wastewater coking wastewater etc in numerous studies especially in the last decade söğüt et al 2011a zhang et al 2013a and 2013b du et al 2013 gong et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 kazemi et al 2015 gong et al 2015 civan et al 2015 qian et al 2016 adar et al 2019 however a very limited number of studies are focused on the treatment of hospital wastewater with scwo technology rong 2015 investigated supercritical water oxidation method to improve the degradation of the complex mixture of organic compounds present in pharmaceutical wastewater dong et al 2014 set up a small supercritical water oxidation system for the treatment of laboratory wastewater and achieved more than 99 removal in the effluent at 26 mpa pressure reletatively low temperatures between 400 and 480 c 70 s residence time and 2 6 times excessive rate of oxidant falamarzian et al 2014 investigated the sub and supercritical water technology for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds such as carbamazepine metoprolol and sulfamethaxazole they used a batch reactor at temperature ranging from 200 to 500 c and residence times of 5 to 50 min the results of the study indicated the efficient removal 90 of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater streams gong et al 2016 investigated the supercritical water oxidation reaction of quinazoline in their batch reactors by varying temperatures between 400 and 600 c time between 0 and 400 s water densities between 70 79 and 166 28 kg m3 and oxidant coefficient between 0 and 4 it is concluded that toc removal significantly increased by increasing the oxidant ratio whereas this effect was limited at ratios greater than 2 stavbar et al 2017 investigated the effect of temperature 200 to 500 c and flow rate 3 and 5 ml min on sub and supercritical water oxidation of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin from synthetic hospital wastewater they reported high removal rates from hospital wastewater and concluded that sub and supercritical water oxidation are efficient methods for the complete removal of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin from synthetic hospital wastewater thakur et al 2019 investigated the thermal degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater at sub and supercritical temperatures 200 400 c with and without oxidant addition they achieved 72 conversion efficiency during gasification and nearly complete toc conversion 99 5 for oxidation experiments there are only few studies subjected to the treatment of pharmaceuticals with supercritical water oxidation process generally realized with synthetic solutions representing pharmaceutical wastewater however hospital wastewater differs from pharmaceutical wastewater with its high content of toxic and recalcitrant substances based on the literature survey there is not any research on the treatment of real hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation the aim of the present study is to investigate the treatment of hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation technology experimental studies can be classified in three sections i investigation of the effect of temperature residence time and oxidant ratio for the removal of organic matter in hospital wastewater ii removal of some pharmaceuticals paracetamol ciprofloxacin carbamazepine ampicillin and cyclophosphamide in synthetic solutions under the optimized conditions and iii treatment of real hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation and the evaluation of the removal efficiencies for all the measured parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and characterization hospital wastewater samples were collected from sisli hamidiye etfal training and research hospital which is one of the biggest research hospitals with a 780 beds capacity istanbul turkey wastewater samples were collected from the discharge point of the hospital wastewater to the sewer system wastewater samples were collected in order to make a detailed characterization of the hospital wastewater on day week and seasonal basis during two years samples were stored in amber colored sample bottles and immediately transferred to laboratory and kept at 4 c before analysis average wastewater generation rate is about 385 l d bed physico chemical characteristics of the hospital wastewater samples representing the average of more than 100 samples are summarized in table 1 2 2 experimental setup hospital wastewater treatment by scwo process was performed in a continuous flow reactor which was used in previous studies söğüt and akgün 2009 kıpçak and akgün 2012 akgün and kıpçak 2014 civan et al 2015 schematic view of the scwo system is given in fig 1 the stainless steel tubular reactor 30 ml volume is placed into a pid controlled split furnace protherm spt 11 70 750 the oxidant h2o2 feed stream was prepared by dissolving hydrogen peroxide with deionized water in a feed tank the second feed tank was loaded with hospital wastewater and both streams were pressurized in separate lines by high pressure pumps autoclave engieneers series iii the two streams were then pumped into their corresponding pre heaters and mixed at the entrence of the reactor the temperature of the reactor was adjusted automatically by a temperature controller the effluent was cooled immediately by passing through the heat exchanger before depressurizing by a back pressure regulator go regulator inc bp66 series the system pressure was maintained at 25 1 mpa by the backpressure regulator upon exiting the reactor the effluent was cooled rapidly by passing through a heat exchanger afterwards the particles which would be formed presumably were filtered out by a 0 5 mm stainless steel inline filter swagelok usa before the effluent was depressurized by a back pressure regulator bpr go regulator inc bp66 series the system pressure is kept at a constant value 1 mpa by the bpr set at the exit of the reactor and monitored through a digital pressure indicator the product stream was then separated into liquid and vapor phases and the liquid products were collected in a graduated cylinder the continuous flow reactor was operated between 400 600 c temperature and 30 150 s residence time söğüt and akgün 2009 the residence times at supercritical conditions were calculated according to eq 1 1 τ v reac tor f t ρ sc p t ρ l where vreactor is the reactor volume ρsc p t and ρl are the fluid densities in g ml under reaction conditions and at feed pump conditions respectively and ft is the total volumetric flow rate in ml s of wastewater and oxidant due to the low concentration of organic contaminants in the wastewater the feed density is assumed to be as the same of pure water the density of the fluid at the reaction conditions was taken from steam tables for pure water wagner and prub 2002 the flow rates for different reaction times 30 150 s and temperatures 400 600 c were calculated separately and the reactor was operated in the working sets using these flow rates in order to prevent the salt precipitation and corrosion the reactor was cleaned with distelled water before and after each run 2 3 analytical methods as a result of the diverse characteristics of hospital wastewater the experimental studies were realized in three steps in the first step the optimal conditions for scwo process residence time 30 150 s temperature 400 600 c and oxidant ratio 0 10 h2o2 cod were determined according to the toc measurements in hospital wastewater hydrogen peroxide is reported as more effective oxidant than oxygen and air due to the mixing and pumping advantages civan et al 2015 hydrogen peroxide 35 w w with a density of 1110 g l and molar mass of 34 01 merck germany was used as the oxidizing agent in the experiments conducted for the treatment of hospital wastewater with supercritical water oxidation croiset et al 1997 reported that h2o2 decomposes completely to h2o and o2 according to eq 2 in the temperature range of 400 and 440 c at 24 5 mpa for example h2o2 conversion was about 98 5 at 400 c and about 99 9 at 440 c for a residence time of 1 s comparatively considering our experimental conditions between 400 and 600 c at 25 mpa in the oxidant preheater section of the system used in this work the residence time varied from 13 to 77 s therefore based on literature it was assumed that h2o2 decomposed completely at the experimental conditions the hydrogen peroxide solutions used in the experiments were prepared depending on the cod value of the hospital wastewater the following equaitons were used for the calculation of the molar concentration of h2o2 the oxygen supplied by the original hydrogen peroxide solution was found to be 5 712 mol l from eq 4 the cod value of the wastewater used during the treatment studies x was calculated as mg o2 l using eq 5 the required amount of h2o2 that will oxidize 100 of the cod value was calculated by eq 6 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o 1 2 o 2 3 h 2 o 2 1110 g solu tion l 35 g h 2 o 2 100 g solu tion 1 mol h 2 o 2

2 solu tion toc analyses were realized by a toc tn analyser hach lange il 550 in the second phase treatment of the selected micropolutants in synthetic solutions was determined in optimum conditions the selected pollutants were paracetamol ciprofloxacin carbamazepine ampicillin and cyclophosphamide which can be widely measured in real hospital wastewater samples 200 µg l of stock synthetic solution of each pollutant was prepared with ultra pure water and mixed for the experimental studies pharmaceuticals were measured by lc ms ms thermo scientific ultimate 3000 lc according to epa method 1694 pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water soil sediment and biosolids by hplc ms ms after extraction conditioning and enrichment steps all wastewater samples were filtered with 0 7 µm glass fiber filters whatman uk before extraction solid phase extraction spe cartridges filled with oasis hlb material waters corporation usa used for concentrating the target analytes the cartridges were conditioned with 10 ml methanol and 10 ml ultra pure water the samples were passed through the spe cartridge with a flow rate of 5 10 ml min the extracted analytes were desorbed from the cartridges by rinsing with 10 ml methanol the eluates were evaporated with nitrogen the dry residues were reconstituted in 1 ml methanol and taken into vials for analysis lc seperations were carried out with an xterra ms c18 column waters corporation 3 5 µm 2 1 100 mm the mass spectrometer tsq quantum access mass thermo scientific operated in heated electrospray ionization mode hesi the source parameters were as follows capillary temperature and vaporizer temperature were 220 and 350 c collision gas pressure was 1 5 mtorr voltage 3500 v finally scwo reactor was used for the treatment of real hospital wastewater under optimal conditions all of the parameters measured in the characterization study were measured in the effluent of the system in order to evaluate the performance of the scwo process on hospital wastewater treatment physico chemical analyses were performed according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater eaton et al 2005 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of reaction temperature residence time and oxidant ratio the effect of reaction temperature 400 600 c and reaction time 30 150 s on the toc removal of hospital wastewater with oxidant ratios between 0 and 10 h2o2 cod are investigated the results are given in fig 2 the oxidation reaction in terms of toc degradation enhances with increasing temperature as expected zhang et al 2013b gong et al 2014 stavbar et al 2017 as can be seen from fig 2 toc concentrations decreased to below 5 mg l after 30 s of reaction time for all temperature values with removal rates 90 however the further increase in temperature results with a limited decrease in toc concentrations which can be neglected although there are numerous studies reported the efficiency of the scwo on the treatment of various industrial wastewater none of them were investigated the efficiency of the process on hospital wastewater generally the organic matter treatment efficiencies are mostly achieved in residence times between 30 s and 5 min and temperatures between 200 and 600 c in the studies reported zhang et al 2013b dong et al 2014 falamarzian et al 2014 rong 2015 gong et al 2015 xu et al 2015 ma and zou 2015 zhang et al 2013a obtained cod removal rates greater than 90 at 500 c temperature and 30 s reaction time gong et al 2016 observed toc removal rates greater than 90 at 600 c and 120 s reaction time thakur et al 2019 reported near complete conversion of 99 5 at 400 c in 5 min for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater the results of toc removal rates versus residence time for different temperatures given in fig 2 show that toc removal rates were detected between 92 95 for 30 s reaction time for all temperatures while the removal rates reached to around 96 after 150 s reaction time higher temperatures and residence times mean higher costs for the treatment thus according to the toc removal efficiencies the optimal temperature and reaction time were selected as 450 c and 60 s respectively with removal rates of around 95 for toc in hospital wastewater treatment a series of experiments were conducted for the determination of the optimum oxidant ratio which is one of the important operational parameters for supercritical water oxidation the analysis were realized under the optimal conditions of 450 c temperature and 60 s reaction time with diffenret oxidant ratio applications between 0 and 10 h2o2 cod and the results are given in fig 3 toc removal from hospital wastewater without oxidant addition was relatively low 55 when compared with 1 1 oxidant addition 90 higher oxidant ratios did not affect toc removal significantly and the removal rates were measured between 90 and 95 for all of the analysed conditions thus the optimum oxidant dose was selected as 1 1 100 in order to prevent further h2o2 consumption as a result of the preliminary studies the optimum conditions were selected as 450 c 60 s and 100 for temperature reaction time and oxidant ratio respectively for the treatment of hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation the results are also consistent with the literature where high oxidant ratios and temperature are implemented for maximum toc removal at low reaction times onwudili et al 2013 zeng et al 2016 thakur et al 2019 investigated the effect of oxidant coefficient between 1 5 and 4 on toc removal from pharmaceutical wastewater they observed that the maximum toc removal 99 5 was achieved at oxidant coefficient of 4 at reaction time of 5 min dong et al 2014 reported toc removal rates greater than 99 at 440 c and residence time of 70 s for 2 6 times of excessive rate of oxidant 3 2 removal of pharmaceuticals from synthetic solutions in order to determine the optimum operational parameters for the treatment of hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation process 5 model micropollutants paracetamol ciprofloxacin carbamazepine ampicillin and cyclophosphamide which can be widely measured in real hospital wastewater samples were selected in synthetic solutions the initial concentration of each pharmaceutical micropollutant in the mix solution was 200 µg l in addition to the optimum conditions selected by preliminary studies we decided to use two more experimental conditions near to the selected values 500 and 550 c temperature and 30 s reaction time referring to high toc removal rates in short reaction times given in fig 2 in order to determine any difference for the removal of micropollutants fig 4 gives the effluent concentrations for the selected micropollutants in synthetic solutions after treatment by supercritical water oxidation the effluent concentrations of paracetamol ciprofloxacin carbamazepine ampicillin and cyclophosphamide were determined below 1 5 µg l for all of the experimental conditions referring to removal rates higher than 99 for all conditions the increase in the removal rates at higher temperatures can be neglected thus the optimum operational conditions for the removal of the selected pharmaceutical micropollutants were 450 c 60 s and 100 for temperature reaction time and oxidant ratio respectively many studies reported that the conventional wastewater treatment plants are ineffective for the treatment of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals heberer 2002 zhang et al 2008 lin et al 2009 behera et al 2011 however several studies conducted to determine the removal of some pharmaceuticals from wastewater by supercritical water oxidation process are also reported removal rates above 90 falamarzian et al 2014 dong et al 2014 rong 2015 gong et al 2016 stavbar et al 2017 falamarzian et al 2014 obtained 90 27 99 99 and 98 84 removals for carbamazepine metoprolol and sulfamethaxazole respectively in their batch study stavbar et al 2017 reported that the concentraitons of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin decreased from 800 µg l to 20 and 45 µg l which corresponds to removal rates greater than 95 at 500 c temperature and 3 ml min flow rate similarly the results obtained from this study show that pharmaceuticals can be removed with a very short reaction time 60 s effectively by supercritical water oxidation process 3 3 treatment of real hospital wastewater samples the last step of the laboratory study was to determine the treatability of real hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation treatment of hospital wastewater was conducted under optimum conditions determined during the preliminary studies and the removal rates for all of the pollutants were measured in addition to pharmaceuticals the concentrations in the raw and the treated wastewater and the removal rates of cod bod toc tn and ss from hospital wastewater by scwo are given in fig 5 the removal rates were determined above 90 for all parameters reported data in the literature show that the removal rate of cod in various industrial wastewater such as landfill leachate chemical wastewater coking wastewater and acrylonitrile wastewater is greater than 95 wang et al 2015 söğüt et al 2011b also reported removal rates near 100 for toc for various wastewater samples textile olivemill whey by supercritical water oxidation toc removal from hospital wastewater indicates the mineralization degree of organic compound high removal efficiencies imply that most of the organic pollutants were decomposed to co2 and water according to the observed results it can be concluded that hospital wastewater can be treated in a very short time 60 s by supercritical water oxidation with removal rates greater than 90 for physico chemical parameters the concentrations in the raw and the treated wastewater and the removal rates of total phosphorus ortho phosphate phenol aox and surfactants from hospital wastewater by scwo are given in fig 6 phosphorus removal was greater than 90 while the removal rates were around 80 for phenol aox and surfactants in hospital wastewater aox can not be removed by conventional treatment processes thus the obtained removal rate of aox is very important to achieve the discharge limits to sewer system since the concentrations of special pollutants such as phenol aox and surfactants are more important than the conventional physicochemical parameters due to their high toxicity in hospital wastewater the treatment methods with high removal efficiency of these pollutants will be more suitable for the treatment of hospital wastewater a total of 9 pharmaceuticals were observed in the real hospital wastewater samples the removal rates and the concentrations of the micropollutants in the hospital wastewater streams are given in fig 7 the highest removal rate was obtained for paracetamol as 99 9 while the lowest removal rate was obtained for warfarin as 72 after scwo treatment of hospital wastewater the removal rates for the remaining micropollutants such as carbamazepine ciprofloxacin cyclophosphamide ampicillin naproxen diclofenac and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate were varied between 73 and 97 6 the obtained removal rates are quite high for pharmaceuticals which cannot be removed by conventional treatment processes it can be seen that scwo has a great potential for the treatment of hospital wastewater in a very short time most of the dissolved organic pollutants including pharmaceuticals converted to highly oxidized intermediates and finally to carbon dioxide and water dong et al 2014 stavbar et al 2017 thakur et al 2019 according to the obtained results it can be concluded that the concentrations decreased to below discharge limits depended to turkish regulations for all of the pollutants with a very short reaction time although aox concentration seems to be relatively high in the treated hospital wastewater 1 2 mg l there is no discharge limit in turkey for aox xie et al 2017 determined the aox concentrations and genotoxicity of pharmaceutical wastewater in china their results showed that aox concentrations in wastewater of four factories ranged from 4 6 to 619 4 mg l and the wastewater treatment process removed 50 0 89 9 of aox as a result they reported that it is hard to conclude aox compounds contributed to the genotoxicity without further identification reported studies about the treatment of hospital wastewater are generally focused on one kind of pollutant and realized by synthetic wastewater these studies generally concluded that a one step treatment is insufficient for the removal of pollutants from hospital wastewater thus hybrid treatment systems for hospital wastewater are suggested to achieve adequate removal rates for the direct discharge and the decrease in the toxicity of the wastewater chong and jin 2012 delgado et al 2011 gautam et al 2007 machado et al 2007 nasr and yazdanbaksh 2008 rezaee et al 2005 this study clearly show that scwo process is sufficient for the treatment of hospital wastewater without the need of additional treatment steps with high removal rates in a short reaction time 4 conclusions this study highlighted the treatment of hospital wastewater by scwo process for the complete removal of conventional pollutants and pharmaceuticals experimental studies revealed that hospital wastewater can be treated at 450 c 60 s and 1 1 for temperature reaction time and oxidant ratio respectively under supercritical conditions the removal rates of cod toc bod and phosphorus were determined above 90 and 80 for phenol aox and surfactants scwo is also an effective option for the removal of pharmaceuticals from hospital wastewater the removal rates of 9 pharmaceuticals observed in the real hospital wastewater varied between 72 and 99 9 which is a relatively high removal rate when compared with other methods scwo is a novel method which can be used for the treatment of hospital wastewater containing pharmaceuticals and other toxic chemical substances as well as various pathogenic microorganisms high removal rates can be achieved without the need of a secondary step for the discharge of the treated wastewater according to our knowledge scwo treatment of real hospital wastewater has not yet been published in the scientific literature the present research is a breakthrough in the completely treatment of hospital wastewater containing pharmaceuticals chemicals radioactive substances and pathogenic microorganisms declaration of competing interest the authors

17635,hospital wastewater contains several micro and macro pollutants that cannot be removed efficiently by conventional treatment processes thus generally hybrid and multistage treatment methods are suggested for the treatment of hospital wastewater supercritical water oxidation scwo is a promising method for the removal of emerging organic pollutants from hospital wastewater in one step and a very short reaction time in this study supercritical water oxidation scwo process was used for the removal of pharmaceuticals in addition to conventional pollutants from real hospital wastewater as a result of a series of preliminary studies the optimum conditions were selected as 450 c 60 s and 1 1 for temperature reaction time and oxidant ratio h2o2 cod respectively for the treatment of hospital wastewater at 25 1 mpa the removal rates were determined above 90 for cod bod toc tn and ss from hospital wastewater phosphorus removal was greater than 90 while the removal rates were around 80 for phenol aox and surfactants in hospital wastewater a total of 9 pharmaceuticals were observed in the real hospital wastewater samples the highest removal rate was obtained for paracetamol as 99 9 while the lowest removal rate was obtained for warfarin as 72 after scwo treatment of hospital wastewater as a result it can be concluded that scwo process is sufficient for the treatment of hospital wastewater without the need of additional treatment steps with high removal rates in a short reaction time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords medical waste hospital wastewater pharmaceuticals supercritical water oxidation 1 introduction hospitals are a major source of infectious and hazardous waste streams to the natural environment generally the waste streams are classified in 3 categories namely i municipal waste which composed of non hazardous materials such as kitchen waste and recyclable waste including paper cardboard and plastics etc ii medical waste including hazardous and infectious waste such as body parts surgery waste and sharp materials such as needle broken glasses etc and iii liquid waste including pharmaceutical waste chemical and biological waste from laboratories and radioactive waste ekhaise et al 2008 eker et al 2010 in addition to medical waste including hazardous and infectious solid residues healthcare instutions are a major source of wastewater the quantity of hospital wastewater is closely related to the size and provided services of the hospital the amount of wastewater generated from hospitals in developed countries has been reported to be in the range of 400 1200 l day per bed whereas this amount is reported to be 200 400 l capita day for developing countries with an average of approximately 750 l day per bed emmanuel et al 2009 al aukidy et al 2017 hospital wastewater generated as a result of diagnosis equipment disinfection and laboratory activities contains considerable amount of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites chemicals radioactive and other toxic organic and inorganic chemical substances anesthetics and sterilization products various pathogenic microorganisms as well as excreta from the patients rezaee et al 2005 chong and jin 2012 casas et al 2015 kumari et al 2020 the main environmental problem caused from these pollutant loads and generated wastewater is the discharge in sewerage systems directly without any treatment the nature of the hospital wastewater differ from domestic sewage with its wide variety of toxic substances mainly drug residues and their metabolites pathogenic microorganisms chemical species such as phenols and detergents along with emerging pollutants in excess to other compounds it is reported that such micropollutants are 4 150 times higher than that of domestic sewage in hospital wastewater chonova et al 2016 khan et al 2019 the conventional treatment plants are reported to be inefficient for inactivation of the bacteria and the removal of toxic and recalcitrant compounds such as pharmaceuticals due to their low biodegrability ooi et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 moussavi et al 2019 hospital wastewater believed to have a higher concentration of pharmaceutical residues than municipal wastewater therefore separate treatment of hospital wastewater will provide the reduction of the pharmaceuticals load to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and prevent pharmaceutical discharge to the environment due to combined sewer overflows and sewer leakages auvinen et al 2017 there are many studies reporting insufficient removal

they reported that the concentrations were not negligible in the effluent of all treatment plants indicating the inefficiency of the conventional wastewater treatment plants for ppcp removal therefore new and efficient methods for onsite treatment of hospital wastewater which can be effective in the removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogenic microorganisms have been investigated during the last decade most of these studies are focused on the physico chemical treatment gautam et al 2007 alvarez torrellas et al 2017 ajo et al 2018 advanced oxidation chiang et al 2003 witte et al 2010 hansen et al 2016 garcía muñoz et al 2017 and biological treatment including membrane bioreactors wen et al 2004 rezaee et al 2005 pauwels et al 2006 radjenovic et al 2007 liu et al 2010 delgado et al 2011 serna galvis et al 2019 vo et al 2019 supercritical water technology which is based on the unique characteristics of water under supercritical conditions t 374 1 c and p 22 1 mpa has been gained much attention as an alternative treatment technology in recent years falamarzian et al 2014 physical and chemical properties of water differs from ambient water because of the decrease in hydrogen bonding content wang et al 2015 xu et al 2015 the density dielectric constant and viscosity of water desrease from 1000 kg m3 80 and 0 89 µpa s to 322 kg m3 2 and 0 03 µpa s respectively in supercritical water susanti et al 2014 therefore supercritical water becomes a very good solvent for nonpolar materials i e hydrocarbons and a poor solvent for polar materials salts and other ionic compounds contraversly from that of ambient conditions marrone 2013 despite the scwo process considered to be an efficient technology for the treatment of high strength wastewater its industrial application has been hindered by the main problems of corrosion and salt precipitation du et al 2013 numerous amount of studies have been published on the reduction of the corrosion and salt precipitation in scwo reactors these studies generally focused on the usage of corrosion resistant materials coating applications employement of transpiring wall neutralization and optimization of the operating conditions huddle et al 2017 supercritical water oxidation scwo is being used widely in industrial wastewater treatment for its high efficiency in the removal of organic matters in recent years amongst the alternative wastewater treatment techniques including physical chemical and biological treatment systems supercritical water oxidation is a promising technology to detoxify and remediate a wide range of emerging organic pollutants researhers reported the treatment of different types of wastewater such as textile wastewater landfill leachate chemical wastewater printing and dying wastewater coking wastewater etc in numerous studies especially in the last decade söğüt et al 2011a zhang et al 2013a and 2013b du et al 2013 gong et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 kazemi et al 2015 gong et al 2015 civan et al 2015 qian et al 2016 adar et al 2019 however a very limited number of studies are focused on the treatment of hospital wastewater with scwo technology rong 2015 investigated supercritical water oxidation method to improve the degradation of the complex mixture of organic compounds present in pharmaceutical wastewater dong et al 2014 set up a small supercritical water oxidation system for the treatment of laboratory wastewater and achieved more than 99 removal in the effluent at 26 mpa pressure reletatively low temperatures between 400 and 480 c 70 s residence time and 2 6 times excessive rate of oxidant falamarzian et al 2014 investigated the sub and supercritical water technology for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds such as carbamazepine metoprolol and sulfamethaxazole they used a batch reactor at temperature ranging from 200 to 500 c and residence times of 5 to 50 min the results of the study indicated the efficient removal 90 of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater streams gong et al 2016 investigated the supercritical water oxidation reaction of quinazoline in their batch reactors by varying temperatures between 400 and 600 c time between 0 and 400 s water densities between 70 79 and 166 28 kg m3 and oxidant coefficient between 0 and 4 it is concluded that toc removal significantly increased by increasing the oxidant ratio whereas this effect was limited at ratios greater than 2 stavbar et al 2017 investigated the effect of temperature 200 to 500 c and flow rate 3 and 5 ml min on sub and supercritical water oxidation of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin from synthetic hospital wastewater they reported high removal rates from hospital wastewater and concluded that sub and supercritical water oxidation are efficient methods for the complete removal of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin from synthetic hospital wastewater thakur et al 2019 investigated the thermal degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater at sub and supercritical temperatures 200 400 c with and without oxidant addition they achieved 72 conversion efficiency during gasification and nearly complete toc conversion 99 5 for oxidation experiments there are only few studies subjected to the treatment of pharmaceuticals with supercritical water oxidation process generally realized with synthetic solutions representing pharmaceutical wastewater however hospital wastewater differs from pharmaceutical wastewater with its high content of toxic and recalcitrant substances based on the literature survey there is not any research on the treatment of real hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation the aim of the present study is to investigate the treatment of hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation technology experimental studies can be classified in three sections i investigation of the effect of temperature residence time and oxidant ratio for the removal of organic matter in hospital wastewater ii removal of some pharmaceuticals paracetamol ciprofloxacin carbamazepine ampicillin and cyclophosphamide in synthetic solutions under the optimized conditions and iii treatment of real hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation and the evaluation of the removal efficiencies for all the measured parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and characterization hospital wastewater samples were collected from sisli hamidiye etfal training and research hospital which is one of the biggest research hospitals with a 780 beds capacity istanbul turkey wastewater samples were collected from the discharge point of the hospital wastewater to the sewer system wastewater samples were collected in order to make a detailed characterization of the hospital wastewater on day week and seasonal basis during two years samples were stored in amber colored sample bottles and immediately transferred to laboratory and kept at 4 c before analysis average wastewater generation rate is about 385 l d bed physico chemical characteristics of the hospital wastewater samples representing the average of more than 100 samples are summarized in table 1 2 2 experimental setup hospital wastewater treatment by scwo process was performed in a continuous flow reactor which was used in previous studies söğüt and akgün 2009 kıpçak and akgün 2012 akgün and kıpçak 2014 civan et al 2015 schematic view of the scwo system is given in fig 1 the stainless steel tubular reactor 30 ml volume is placed into a pid controlled split furnace protherm spt 11 70 750 the oxidant h2o2 feed stream was prepared by dissolving hydrogen peroxide with deionized water in a feed tank the second feed tank was loaded with hospital wastewater and both streams were pressurized in separate lines by high pressure pumps autoclave engieneers series iii the two streams were then pumped into their corresponding pre heaters and mixed at the entrence of the reactor the temperature of the reactor was adjusted automatically by a temperature controller the effluent was cooled immediately by passing through the heat exchanger before depressurizing by a back pressure regulator go regulator inc bp66 series the system pressure was maintained at 25 1 mpa by the backpressure regulator upon exiting the reactor the effluent was cooled rapidly by passing through a heat exchanger afterwards the particles which would be formed presumably were filtered out by a 0 5 mm stainless steel inline filter swagelok usa before the effluent was depressurized by a back pressure regulator bpr go regulator inc bp66 series the system pressure is kept at a constant value 1 mpa by the bpr set at the exit of the reactor and monitored through a digital pressure indicator the product stream was then separated into liquid and vapor phases and the liquid products were collected in a graduated cylinder the continuous flow reactor was operated between 400 600 c temperature and 30 150 s residence time söğüt and akgün 2009 the residence times at supercritical conditions were calculated according to eq 1 1 τ v reac tor f t ρ sc p t ρ l where vreactor is the reactor volume ρsc p t and ρl are the fluid densities in g ml under reaction conditions and at feed pump conditions respectively and ft is the total volumetric flow rate in ml s of wastewater and oxidant due to the low concentration of organic contaminants in the wastewater the feed density is assumed to be as the same of pure water the density of the fluid at the reaction conditions was taken from steam tables for pure water wagner and prub 2002 the flow rates for different reaction times 30 150 s and temperatures 400 600 c were calculated separately and the reactor was operated in the working sets using these flow rates in order to prevent the salt precipitation and corrosion the reactor was cleaned with distelled water before and after each run 2 3 analytical methods as a result of the diverse characteristics of hospital wastewater the experimental studies were realized in three steps in the first step the optimal conditions for scwo process residence time 30 150 s temperature 400 600 c and oxidant ratio 0 10 h2o2 cod were determined according to the toc measurements in hospital wastewater hydrogen peroxide is reported as more effective oxidant than oxygen and air due to the mixing and pumping advantages civan et al 2015 hydrogen peroxide 35 w w with a density of 1110 g l and molar mass of 34 01 merck germany was used as the oxidizing agent in the experiments conducted for the treatment of hospital wastewater with supercritical water oxidation croiset et al 1997 reported that h2o2 decomposes completely to h2o and o2 according to eq 2 in the temperature range of 400 and 440 c at 24 5 mpa for example h2o2 conversion was about 98 5 at 400 c and about 99 9 at 440 c for a residence time of 1 s comparatively considering our experimental conditions between 400 and 600 c at 25 mpa in the oxidant preheater section of the system used in this work the residence time varied from 13 to 77 s therefore based on literature it was assumed that h2o2 decomposed completely at the experimental conditions the hydrogen peroxide solutions used in the experiments were prepared depending on the cod value of the hospital wastewater the following equaitons were used for the calculation of the molar concentration of h2o2 the oxygen supplied by the original hydrogen peroxide solution was found to be 5 712 mol l from eq 4 the cod value of the wastewater used during the treatment studies x was calculated as mg o2 l using eq 5 the required amount of h2o2 that will oxidize 100 of the cod value was calculated by eq 6 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o 1 2 o 2 3 h 2 o 2 1110 g solu tion l 35 g h 2 o 2 100 g solu tion 1 mol h 2 o 2

2 solu tion toc analyses were realized by a toc tn analyser hach lange il 550 in the second phase treatment of the selected micropolutants in synthetic solutions was determined in optimum conditions the selected pollutants were paracetamol ciprofloxacin carbamazepine ampicillin and cyclophosphamide which can be widely measured in real hospital wastewater samples 200 µg l of stock synthetic solution of each pollutant was prepared with ultra pure water and mixed for the experimental studies pharmaceuticals were measured by lc ms ms thermo scientific ultimate 3000 lc according to epa method 1694 pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water soil sediment and biosolids by hplc ms ms after extraction conditioning and enrichment steps all wastewater samples were filtered with 0 7 µm glass fiber filters whatman uk before extraction solid phase extraction spe cartridges filled with oasis hlb material waters corporation usa used for concentrating the target analytes the cartridges were conditioned with 10 ml methanol and 10 ml ultra pure water the samples were passed through the spe cartridge with a flow rate of 5 10 ml min the extracted analytes were desorbed from the cartridges by rinsing with 10 ml methanol the eluates were evaporated with nitrogen the dry residues were reconstituted in 1 ml methanol and taken into vials for analysis lc seperations were carried out with an xterra ms c18 column waters corporation 3 5 µm 2 1 100 mm the mass spectrometer tsq quantum access mass thermo scientific operated in heated electrospray ionization mode hesi the source parameters were as follows capillary temperature and vaporizer temperature were 220 and 350 c collision gas pressure was 1 5 mtorr voltage 3500 v finally scwo reactor was used for the treatment of real hospital wastewater under optimal conditions all of the parameters measured in the characterization study were measured in the effluent of the system in order to evaluate the performance of the scwo process on hospital wastewater treatment physico chemical analyses were performed according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater eaton et al 2005 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of reaction temperature residence time and oxidant ratio the effect of reaction temperature 400 600 c and reaction time 30 150 s on the toc removal of hospital wastewater with oxidant ratios between 0 and 10 h2o2 cod are investigated the results are given in fig 2 the oxidation reaction in terms of toc degradation enhances with increasing temperature as expected zhang et al 2013b gong et al 2014 stavbar et al 2017 as can be seen from fig 2 toc concentrations decreased to below 5 mg l after 30 s of reaction time for all temperature values with removal rates 90 however the further increase in temperature results with a limited decrease in toc concentrations which can be neglected although there are numerous studies reported the efficiency of the scwo on the treatment of various industrial wastewater none of them were investigated the efficiency of the process on hospital wastewater generally the organic matter treatment efficiencies are mostly achieved in residence times between 30 s and 5 min and temperatures between 200 and 600 c in the studies reported zhang et al 2013b dong et al 2014 falamarzian et al 2014 rong 2015 gong et al 2015 xu et al 2015 ma and zou 2015 zhang et al 2013a obtained cod removal rates greater than 90 at 500 c temperature and 30 s reaction time gong et al 2016 observed toc removal rates greater than 90 at 600 c and 120 s reaction time thakur et al 2019 reported near complete conversion of 99 5 at 400 c in 5 min for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater the results of toc removal rates versus residence time for different temperatures given in fig 2 show that toc removal rates were detected between 92 95 for 30 s reaction time for all temperatures while the removal rates reached to around 96 after 150 s reaction time higher temperatures and residence times mean higher costs for the treatment thus according to the toc removal efficiencies the optimal temperature and reaction time were selected as 450 c and 60 s respectively with removal rates of around 95 for toc in hospital wastewater treatment a series of experiments were conducted for the determination of the optimum oxidant ratio which is one of the important operational parameters for supercritical water oxidation the analysis were realized under the optimal conditions of 450 c temperature and 60 s reaction time with diffenret oxidant ratio applications between 0 and 10 h2o2 cod and the results are given in fig 3 toc removal from hospital wastewater without oxidant addition was relatively low 55 when compared with 1 1 oxidant addition 90 higher oxidant ratios did not affect toc removal significantly and the removal rates were measured between 90 and 95 for all of the analysed conditions thus the optimum oxidant dose was selected as 1 1 100 in order to prevent further h2o2 consumption as a result of the preliminary studies the optimum conditions were selected as 450 c 60 s and 100 for temperature reaction time and oxidant ratio respectively for the treatment of hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation the results are also consistent with the literature where high oxidant ratios and temperature are implemented for maximum toc removal at low reaction times onwudili et al 2013 zeng et al 2016 thakur et al 2019 investigated the effect of oxidant coefficient between 1 5 and 4 on toc removal from pharmaceutical wastewater they observed that the maximum toc removal 99 5 was achieved at oxidant coefficient of 4 at reaction time of 5 min dong et al 2014 reported toc removal rates greater than 99 at 440 c and residence time of 70 s for 2 6 times of excessive rate of oxidant 3 2 removal of pharmaceuticals from synthetic solutions in order to determine the optimum operational parameters for the treatment of hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation process 5 model micropollutants paracetamol ciprofloxacin carbamazepine ampicillin and cyclophosphamide which can be widely measured in real hospital wastewater samples were selected in synthetic solutions the initial concentration of each pharmaceutical micropollutant in the mix solution was 200 µg l in addition to the optimum conditions selected by preliminary studies we decided to use two more experimental conditions near to the selected values 500 and 550 c temperature and 30 s reaction time referring to high toc removal rates in short reaction times given in fig 2 in order to determine any difference for the removal of micropollutants fig 4 gives the effluent concentrations for the selected micropollutants in synthetic solutions after treatment by supercritical water oxidation the effluent concentrations of paracetamol ciprofloxacin carbamazepine ampicillin and cyclophosphamide were determined below 1 5 µg l for all of the experimental conditions referring to removal rates higher than 99 for all conditions the increase in the removal rates at higher temperatures can be neglected thus the optimum operational conditions for the removal of the selected pharmaceutical micropollutants were 450 c 60 s and 100 for temperature reaction time and oxidant ratio respectively many studies reported that the conventional wastewater treatment plants are ineffective for the treatment of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals heberer 2002 zhang et al 2008 lin et al 2009 behera et al 2011 however several studies conducted to determine the removal of some pharmaceuticals from wastewater by supercritical water oxidation process are also reported removal rates above 90 falamarzian et al 2014 dong et al 2014 rong 2015 gong et al 2016 stavbar et al 2017 falamarzian et al 2014 obtained 90 27 99 99 and 98 84 removals for carbamazepine metoprolol and sulfamethaxazole respectively in their batch study stavbar et al 2017 reported that the concentraitons of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin decreased from 800 µg l to 20 and 45 µg l which corresponds to removal rates greater than 95 at 500 c temperature and 3 ml min flow rate similarly the results obtained from this study show that pharmaceuticals can be removed with a very short reaction time 60 s effectively by supercritical water oxidation process 3 3 treatment of real hospital wastewater samples the last step of the laboratory study was to determine the treatability of real hospital wastewater by supercritical water oxidation treatment of hospital wastewater was conducted under optimum conditions determined during the preliminary studies and the removal rates for all of the pollutants were measured in addition to pharmaceuticals the concentrations in the raw and the treated wastewater and the removal rates of cod bod toc tn and ss from hospital wastewater by scwo are given in fig 5 the removal rates were determined above 90 for all parameters reported data in the literature show that the removal rate of cod in various industrial wastewater such as landfill leachate chemical wastewater coking wastewater and acrylonitrile wastewater is greater than 95 wang et al 2015 söğüt et al 2011b also reported removal rates near 100 for toc for various wastewater samples textile olivemill whey by supercritical water oxidation toc removal from hospital wastewater indicates the mineralization degree of organic compound high removal efficiencies imply that most of the organic pollutants were decomposed to co2 and water according to the observed results it can be concluded that hospital wastewater can be treated in a very short time 60 s by supercritical water oxidation with removal rates greater than 90 for physico chemical parameters the concentrations in the raw and the treated wastewater and the removal rates of total phosphorus ortho phosphate phenol aox and surfactants from hospital wastewater by scwo are given in fig 6 phosphorus removal was greater than 90 while the removal rates were around 80 for phenol aox and surfactants in hospital wastewater aox can not be removed by conventional treatment processes thus the obtained removal rate of aox is very important to achieve the discharge limits to sewer system since the concentrations of special pollutants such as phenol aox and surfactants are more important than the conventional physicochemical parameters due to their high toxicity in hospital wastewater the treatment methods with high removal efficiency of these pollutants will be more suitable for the treatment of hospital wastewater a total of 9 pharmaceuticals were observed in the real hospital wastewater samples the removal rates and the concentrations of the micropollutants in the hospital wastewater streams are given in fig 7 the highest removal rate was obtained for paracetamol as 99 9 while the lowest removal rate was obtained for warfarin as 72 after scwo treatment of hospital wastewater the removal rates for the remaining micropollutants such as carbamazepine ciprofloxacin cyclophosphamide ampicillin naproxen diclofenac and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate were varied between 73 and 97 6 the obtained removal rates are quite high for pharmaceuticals which cannot be removed by conventional treatment processes it can be seen that scwo has a great potential for the treatment of hospital wastewater in a very short time most of the dissolved organic pollutants including pharmaceuticals converted to highly oxidized intermediates and finally to carbon dioxide and water dong et al 2014 stavbar et al 2017 thakur et al 2019 according to the obtained results it can be concluded that the concentrations decreased to below discharge limits depended to turkish regulations for all of the pollutants with a very short reaction time although aox concentration seems to be relatively high in the treated hospital wastewater 1 2 mg l there is no discharge limit in turkey for aox xie et al 2017 determined the aox concentrations and genotoxicity of pharmaceutical wastewater in china their results showed that aox concentrations in wastewater of four factories ranged from 4 6 to 619 4 mg l and the wastewater treatment process removed 50 0 89 9 of aox as a result they reported that it is hard to conclude aox compounds contributed to the genotoxicity without further identification reported studies about the treatment of hospital wastewater are generally focused on one kind of pollutant and realized by synthetic wastewater these studies generally concluded that a one step treatment is insufficient for the removal of pollutants from hospital wastewater thus hybrid treatment systems for hospital wastewater are suggested to achieve adequate removal rates for the direct discharge and the decrease in the toxicity of the wastewater chong and jin 2012 delgado et al 2011 gautam et al 2007 machado et al 2007 nasr and yazdanbaksh 2008 rezaee et al 2005 this study clearly show that scwo process is sufficient for the treatment of hospital wastewater without the need of additional treatment steps with high removal rates in a short reaction time 4 conclusions this study highlighted the treatment of hospital wastewater by scwo process for the complete removal of conventional pollutants and pharmaceuticals experimental studies revealed that hospital wastewater can be treated at 450 c 60 s and 1 1 for temperature reaction time and oxidant ratio respectively under supercritical conditions the removal rates of cod toc bod and phosphorus were determined above 90 and 80 for phenol aox and surfactants scwo is also an effective option for the removal of pharmaceuticals from hospital wastewater the removal rates of 9 pharmaceuticals observed in the real hospital wastewater varied between 72 and 99 9 which is a relatively high removal rate when compared with other methods scwo is a novel method which can be used for the treatment of hospital wastewater containing pharmaceuticals and other toxic chemical substances as well as various pathogenic microorganisms high removal rates can be achieved without the need of a secondary step for the discharge of the treated wastewater according to our knowledge scwo treatment of real hospital wastewater has not yet been published in the scientific literature the present research is a

17636,increased availability and affordability of sensors especially water quality sensors is poised to improve process control and modelling in water and wastewater systems sensor measurements are often flawed by unavoidable influent complexity and sensor instability making extraction of useful signals problematic although a natural reaction is to put extra effort into sensor maintenance to achieve more reliable measurements useful signals can be extracted from those unqualified signals by appropriate usage of available data driven tools instructed by physical factors e g prior process knowledge physical constraints phenomenal observations such methodology is herein defined as hybrid approaches while the concept of coupling physical factors into data driven tools is not new in downstream applications such as process modelling and control little literature has explicitly applied it in the first and equally important step signal processing with flawed influent five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 sensor measurements as an example this paper provides a comprehensive case study demonstrating how physical factors were incorporated throughout the procedures of processing a flawed signal for its maximum value results showed that useful signals were extracted and validated via an assembly of well established machine learning tools whose performance was improved with physical factors an improved standard signal processing architecture isspa is also proposed based on the results of this research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sensors data quality pattern separation similarity machine learning automation 1 introduction continued developments in sensor and computer technology have accelerated application of sensor signals to satisfy tightening effluent quality standards and achieve increasing operation efficiency to lower costs corominas et al 2018 irizar et al 2008 olsson 2012 nearly all water and wastewater utilities have deployed primary e g flow meters ph sensors etc and advanced e g nutrient sensors analyser etc sensors sarni et al 2019 small facilities 20 000 population equivalents pe can generate up to 400 signals in number whereas large ones produce more than 30 000 corominas et al 2018 olsson et al 2014 the proliferation of sensors seems promising but being data rich does not necessarily lead to being information rich corominas et al 2018 olsson 2012 raw signals must be analysed and processed first so that measurement faults or abnormal process situations can be identified and isolated post processed signals must be subject to quality validation and transformed into actionable information to support decision making and operational control the idea of processing signals for useful information has existed for decades peddie et al 1990 showed that an oxidation reduction potential orp profile has distinctive features associating with cyclic operation of digesters independent of signal magnitude and range numerous similar studies further extended this concept with other sensors such as dissolved oxygen do ph and ammonia for control purposes plisson saune et al 1996 puig et al 2005 ruano et al 2012 spérandio et al 2004 by linking features in signal profiles with known bio chemical activities they succeeded in the application of signals with high temporal variability dynamics more recently studies explicitly explored the possibility of mining information from low quality sensor signals complicated by both dynamics and sensor instability schneider et al 2019 developed four soft sensors based on unmaintained sensors to monitor the status of sequencing batch reactors thürlimann et al 2018 used qualitative trend analysis to increase soft sensor tolerance to sensor drifts this research extends previous research to advanced water quality sensors such as organic matter concentration and composition which are of growing interest for instance identifying the influent source s can help better characterize the key inputs for dynamic modelling with the activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 accurate fractionation of chemical oxygen demand cod for various sources can yield more accurate predictions for decision making and control however extracting reliable and useful signals from online water quality sensors is more difficult due to influent complexity and sensor instability influent complexity is largely introduced by water and wastewater source variability and their dynamic nature which directly or indirectly leads to unstable sensor readings sensors themselves are also subject to faults and noise due to design limitations and unavoidable situations such as offline interference and fouling this research extends the incorporation of knowledge into signal processing rather than just signal use as described above although numerous data driven and or statistics based techniques are available for processing signals to improve their quality aggarwal 2015 gupta et al 2014b newhart et al 2019 most are derived by the mathematical features e g variance frequency etc inherent to signals their outcomes may not reflect and may even contradict real world physical factors e g mass balances observations simply borrowing data driven statistical tools from other fields is not sufficient given the presence of such systematic constraints corominas et al 2018 olsson 2012 sensor data quality can be significantly improved by incorporating prior knowledge from operators process experts physical constraints and phenomenological observations corominas et al 2018 haimi et al 2013 newhart et al 2019 olsson 2012 additional knowledge from the physical world is defined herein as physical factors and an approach incorporating physical factors with available data driven tools is referred to here as a hybrid signal processing approach fig 1 illustrates real world water quality sensor signals including typical sensor disturbances for this application a two year long raw five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 signal was divided into one day profiles and stacked together forming the grey area in all six subplots the signal fundamentally consists of a typical diurnal pattern illustrated by the regular weekend pattern but complicated by the discharge of leachate to the plant by trucks during normal working hours on weekdays illustrated by the regular weekday pattern note that the curve formed by the lower edge of the regular weekday signal resembles the weekend diurnal pattern when leachate spikes do not occur this suggests that actual diurnal patterns should if not exactly closely align with the lower edge of the weekday signals typical sensor faults red also occurred as illustrated in fig 1 c f definition provided in section 2 1 due to the similarity of the leachate to some sensor faults spike and erratic mathematical features e g variance frequency derivatives are insufficient to clearly separate them this dataset provided the basis to investigate the hypothesis that hybrid approaches as defined above can lead to improved extraction of reliable and useful signals from flawed sensor data the hybrid approach was specifically achieved using an assembled system with each section illustrating at least one aspect of hybridization implementation 2 methods 2 1 plant and data the city of grand rapids michigan us water resource recovery facility wrrf treats an average flow of 38 million gallons a day 144 000 m3 d the plant inflow not only consists of domestic and industrial wastewater but also landfill leachate landfill leachate is transported on weekdays and discharged to the plant influent during the normal working hours because truck arrival times and intervals between them are random irregular and variant spikes in the daily influent profile fig 1 a b are introduced which could be easily confused with sensor faults the plant is in its digitalization transformation journey gradually shifting its decision making and operations from traditional human driven approaches e g lab measurement operators experience to data driven digital solutions e g sensor measurement dynamic modelling and control useful signals with sufficient insights in domain knowledge are the fundamentals for its digital transformation to achieve overall energy efficiency resource recovery and cost reduction for instance in dynamic modelling it is anticipated that the characteristics e g solubility and biodegradability of landfill leachate are sufficiently different from municipal and industrial wastewater therefore it may be useful to separate these streams to better optimize the downstream treatment processes the sensor signals in this study were bod5 concentration measurements of plant influent by a liquid station unit zaps technologies llc with 720 measurements per day the dataset covered from 2016 05 05 to 2018 5 14 688 days 495 360 measurements daily flow proportioned composite bod5 samples were also collected and analysed 688 days the most common sensor fault symptoms presented in fig 1 c d follow the definitions provided by jan et al 2017 specifically missing fault sensor output is missing for a period of time all missing values in signals are replaced with zeros to ensure signal continuity erratic fault variance of the sensor output significantly increases above the usual value spike fault spikes are observed in the output of the sensor at fixed intervals stuck fault the sensor s output gets stuck at a fixed value also known as frozen signal one author manually labelled all sensor profiles into two categories and labelling was verified by another author independently before quality classification implementation it is recognized that manual labelling can lead to biases in subsequent analyses as deviations between the predicted label and the label provided by the human expert is implicitly assumed to be due to the inadequacy of the model and not due to error in the label provided by the human expert the potential for such biases must be carefully examined the labels used to train and test the classification algorithms were clean signals a one day signal profile that has no or only minor sensor faults of the above types disturbance is solely caused by landfill leachate these represent 72 505 out of 688 of the available daily profiles dirty signals a one day signal profile that has obvious presence of any of the above sensor faults disturbances appear to be mainly caused by sensor instability these represent 28 187 out of 688 of the available daily profiles 2 2 data analysis methodology the data analysis methodology summarized in fig 2 consisted of three steps 1 pattern separation 2 quality classification and 3 data validation all daily profiles were first subject to pattern separation to extract the regular diurnal pattern the daily profiles then entered the qualification classification process where similarities of diurnal patterns were calculated pairwise for instance a n day diurnal patterns has n 1 pair wise similarities dirty and clean signals displayed different features in pair wise similarities based on which the classification algorithm was trained to automatically classify them finally the identified two classes of data entered the data validation step to evaluate the success of the pattern separation and quality classification details of each step are provided in the following subsections 2 2 1 pattern separation signal pre processing consisted of reshaping the signals into daily profiles signal vectors and replacing missing values with zeros to ensure signal continuity the sensor signal vector y representing 720 measurements of sensor in one day was viewed as a combination of three parts 1 the diurnal pattern vector d 2 the leachate pattern vector ℓ and 3 the residual vector ɛ as showed in eq 1 1 y d ℓ ε the pattern separation problem was thus framed as finding the proper diurnal pattern d and leachate pattern ℓ so that the residual ɛ was minimized this is a typical least squares problem as formulated in eq 2 two physical factors were translated and embedded into the least squares problem 1 given that the diurnal pattern d has a periodical feature it was fitted with a 3rd order fourier series d γ x where x is the fourier coefficients vector and γ is the matrix with sin cosine elements and 2 the non negative constraint for the leachate component although no obvious pattern exists in leachate it should be non negative by nature to this end regularization was applied using the shifted huber hinger error function h ℓ groenen et al 2008 which penalized the negative elements in ℓ and forced them to be non negative 2 d ℓ arg mi n d ℓ ε 2 2 arg mi n d ℓ y d ℓ 2 2 with these specifications this problem was transformed into a regularized least squares problem as in eq 3 where λ is a hyperparameter and is tuned to 0 5 for better performance in this case solving eq 3 required mathematical techniques which have been provided in the supplementary materials finally these patterns were identified based on the daily profiles provided 3 d s arg mi n d ℓ ε 2 2 arg mi n x ℓ y γ x ℓ 2 2 λ h ℓ 2 2 2 quality classification the recurring pattern typical for water and wastewater systems was the physical factor used for this purpose although daily patterns vary somewhat the influent daily pattern should be similar in shape if sensor faults are absent pearson correlation as in eq 4 was used here to quantify similarity the yi s and yj s are the diurnal pattern vectors for two different days day i and day j and n is the length of y the is the mean value of that day the closer the correlation to 1 the higher the similarity an additional benefit of eq 4 is that the correlation has been normalized by the standard deviations of the two individual days 4 ρ y i y j k 1 n y i k y i y j k y j k 1 n y i k y i 2 k 1 n y j k y j 2 similarity was analysed pairwise between every two days and the distributions of pairwise similarity were used as predictors for clean dirty classification each day s similarity distribution was plotted into ten bin histograms and the frequencies of each bin were fed into a logistic regression model as inputs an additional variable stuck index see supplementary materials sec 2 quantifying the severity of the stuck fault was used to improve classification accuracy the classification model was trained based on 5 fold cross validation results were examined by standard classification evaluation methods including confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve roc curve hossin et al 2015 specifically the notations for the confusion matrix were true positive dirty signals are predicted as dirty true negative clean signals are predicted as clean false positive clean signals are predicted as dirty true positive dirty signals are predicted as clean 2 2 3 data validation the results of conventional water quality analyses american public health association apha 2005 were used to further validate the processing steps and increase confidence in extracted signal quality the grand rapids wrrf routinely collected and analysed flow proportioned composite influent wastewater samples for bod5 in laboratory two approaches were used to convert sensor data into estimated 24 hour composite bod5 values 1 direct calculation using available flow data defined here as the flow weighted model and 2 an artificial neural network model details for the neural network model are provided in the supplementary materials both models estimated the 24 hour composite data and their performance was used to evaluate data quality for both the clean and dirty data sets model performance was evaluated by standard regression evaluation metrics such as root mean square error finally the problematic portion of the dirty signals was remedied and then fed into the developed neural network model algorithms achieving data remediation which the authors refer to as the future therapy showed in fig 2 in this paper preliminary results of data remediation were achieved and displayed but a holistic data remediation system is still under development by the authors 2 2 4 implementation the entire solution developed in this paper including the full source code and implementation details are available on an open source public web repo http github com chengyangumich wrsubmission while the authors are not at liberty to share all of the raw sensor data an anonymized example data set is included in the web repository to allow others to evaluate our approach and implementation users should also be able to apply the solutions with necessary modification for their own sensor measurements all analyses were carried out on a windows os laptop and the code was written in matlab 2019b edition the code for regularized least squares used for pattern separation was written by the authors and the classification and the neural network regression were implemented with statistics and machine learning toolbox and deep learning toolbox respectively in matlab most of the results are availabe in the repo under the file 688results 3 results 3 1 pattern separation several traditional purely data driven algorithms including but not limited to ordinary least squares ols lowpass filter and principle component analysis pca were used to extract the diurnal pattern as illustrated by the typical example presented in fig 3 the diurnal patterns extracted using these algorithms were not satisfactory specifically the diurnal pattern extracted by ols orange consistently overestimated whereas the lowpass filter green produced overestimated portions after 2 a m and in the daytime when leachate dumping occurred the diurnal pattern extracted by pca purple was even worse with large bumps at 7 a m and deviations during 10 a m to 6 p m theoretically after processing the residual signals should mainly be the leachate component however it is obvious that the residuals have significant negative values which contradicts the physical conditions that leachate mass should be positive in other words the separated diurnal pattern is a biased estimate this occurred because these algorithms fitted the data based purely on mathematical features e g frequency variances neglecting physical constraints the hybrid algorithm regularized least squares extracted a more reliable diurnal pattern blue which was free from the impacts of the leachate pattern while fig 3 illustrates the performance of a variety of standard data driven signal process algorithms several others were also evaluated with similar poor performance data not shown the performance of the hybrid algorithm is further demonstrated for clean data in fig 4 a the diurnal pattern blue aligns well with the bottom of the original signal red as for the separated leachate pattern black it occurred mostly in the daytime when leachate dumping happens and the positive nature of leachate is well preserved although occasional negative values appeared their magnitude was quite small and acceptable the separate leachate patterns were further validated by plant personnel by comparing the timing of spikes and trunk entry recordings diurnal patterns were also extracted for dirty data as illustrated in fig 4 b distortions were mainly caused by sensor faults with the algorithm appearing to track the diurnal pattern reasonably well except in proximity to the onset of the fault it returned to good correspondence when the fault ended 3 2 quality classification with removal of the influence of leachate spikes on diurnal patterns following pattern separation the remaining diurnal patterns with large dissimilarity to others likely suffer from major sensor faults and should be labelled as dirty days each day had 687 pairwise similarities forming a population of similarities traditionally in statistics mathematical features of the population such as minimum maximum and mean are used for classification for instance if one day has a population mean much smaller than others it is classified as an outlier abnormal therefore the next step was to determine 1 which mathematical feature should be chosen and 2 which value of that feature is used for classification typical statistics are displayed in fig 5 the blue lines are the minimum and maximum of pairwise similarities whereas the yellow intervals are the 1st quantile to 3rd quantile the red stars and green crosses are the mean similarity for dirty and clean signals respectively the extrema were not robust choices because if the same sensor fault was repeated for several days for instance because sensors are repeatedly offline for maintenance at certain times those days would have similarity maxima as high as regular days this occurred frequently as many days with red stars had no significant difference in extrema with others e g days in the interval of 200 300 in fig 5 means were then investigated clean and dirty signals tended to behave differently the former had a mean at around 0 8 and in contrast the latter had random values due to different sensor faults the threshold between clean and dirty signals was trivial however as some dirty signals invaded into regions of clean signals e g around day 80 100 and vice versa distributed throughout evaluation of quantiles suggested using the whole distribution as the data feature as indicated in fig 5 days with dirty signals tended to have spiky 1st quantile values along with deviations in 3rd quantiles means were also not lying in the middle of the yellow intervals indicating highly skewed distributions two example distributions are plotted as histograms in fig 4 c d the rest have been included in the public web repo http github com chengyangumich wrsubmission distributions for clean signals were exponential like with thin tails at the correlation interval of 1 to 0 6 whereas dirty signals had different shapes due to various faults not all similarities were concentrated in the last bin because of the existence of minor variations in the daily profiles thus the density of the distribution which is quantified by the frequencies in the histogram was used as the classification input and the decision threshold for the logistic regression was selected based on the roc curve with the frequencies of each bin as input along with the stuck index explained in discussion the classification algorithms yielded an accuracy of 95 2 false positive rate and false negative rate were low 1 5 10 out of 688 and 3 3 23 out of 688 respectively 3 3 data validation the daily flow composite bod5 data estimated from the sensor data by both the flow weighted average model and the neural network model are compared to actual values in fig 6 data are compared separately for clean and dirty data comparison indicates better performance for the neural network model red for training and green for testing as defined in supplementary material than the flow weighed model as they were closer to the 1 1 line the dotted lines are the actual value within the range of one standard deviation of measured composite values in the flow weighed model a great number of points were overestimated as they exceed the range of one standard deviation of actual values in contrast most points fall within the range for ann the root mean square error rmse was improved from 52 mg l to 40 mg l for the training set and 36 mg l for the testing set composite bod5 actual values had a range of 182 43 54 to 391 mg l whereas the neural network estimates were 179 24 82 to 242 mg l in contrast dirty data showed little correlation with measured values these results further supported the unreliability of the dirty signals and the validity of the pattern separation and the classification algorithm points deviating from the 1 1 line in fig 6 b were found to be signals with major sensor faults a typical example was provided in fig 7 a a further test illustrated that the unreliability in dirty signals was due to sensor faults the unreliable part missing fault was remediated based on the information extracted from clean signals and the reliable part of the dirty signals the remediated signals went through the first two sections in the analytical methodology and were then fed into the neural network as illustrated in the typical example presented in fig 7 a the resulting signals appeared to be more reasonable and the prediction was improved as showed in fig 7 b 4 discussion 4 1 hybrid approaches in signal processing while conventional signal processing techniques are usually sufficient to prepare signals for use they failed in our case due to the unique characteristics of the signals as follows 1 the diurnal and leachate patterns both recur on a daily basis from the frequency domain view this indicates their principal frequencies overlap and are hard to separate signal filtering is only feasible when distinguishable frequency differences exist between the two patterns 2 matrix factorization based on principal component analysis and independent component analysis are two popular pattern recognition and source separation methods corominas et al 2018 soonthornnonda and christensen 2008 yuan et al 2004 they extract patterns that could explain most mathematical features including variance and high order cumulants respectively however the results usually do not assure the inference power for the separated patterns as showed in fig 3 the bump at the beginning of the diurnal pattern has no physical meaning 3 smoothing methods such as weighted least squares and moving average are not favourable in this case because it is predictable that when leachate spikes happen the separated diurnal patterns will unavoidably be overestimated this result contradicts the observation in fig 1 that the actual diurnal pattern should align with the lower edge of the signal profiles the failure of these conventional techniques led to the exploration of hybrid approaches inspired by the concept of coupling prior knowledge hybrid approaches have been practiced in the water and wastewater engineering field for a long time such as hybrid grey box modelling soft sensor design and advanced control but rarely for signal processing corominas et al 2018 schneider et al 2019 spérandio et al 2004 svardal et al 2003 thürlimann et al 2018 villez 2015 von stosch et al 2014 the hybrid approach was successful and the following sections will discuss reasons and implications 4 1 1 pattern separation customizing algorithms with physical factors the success of the pattern separation algorithms relies heavily on hybridizing two physical factors 1 periodicity of diurnal pattern and 2 non negative nature of leachate pattern using a regularized least squares algorithm the former was abstracted into a fourier series a combination of sinusoids with flexible amplitudes and phases but fixed frequencies while the latter was achieved by applying constraints on the leachate pattern the implementing algorithm was regularized least squares while regularized least squares is widely used in other disciplines to introduce restrictions aster et al 2018 james et al 2013 it has not been used extensively in the water and wastewater field instead other members of the least squares family such as partial least squares and generalized least squares are used more frequently corominas et al 2018 haimi et al 2013 newhart et al 2019 villez 2015 meanwhile the theory of fourier series is well developed and the non negative constraints methods are also available lin 2007 and sutherland stacey et al 2011 applied non negative matrix factorization to extract basis spectra from signals from uv vis sensors assembling these separate ideas together is innovative and achieved satisfactory pattern separation which demonstrates the power of coupling physical factors in signal processing in fact regularized least squares could be a good beginner algorithm to couple physical factors thanks to its flexibility flexibility arises from the least squares term the diurnal term and regularization the least squares terms can be adjusted with kernel methods or other shapes to embed more assumptions hainmueller and hazlett 2014 villez 2015 villez et al 2013 for instance a low order polynomial shape could be used rather than a fourier series to capture gradually changing trends various standard regularizations are available for different purposes for instance ridge and lasso for screening more important signals and tikhonov regularization for smoothing aster et al 2018 groenen et al 2008 james et al 2013 regularization can also be customized as needed via appropriate error functions as demonstrated in this study 4 1 2 quality classification choosing data features that better reflect observations numerous similarity measures exist where two large groups are kernel based and distance based aggarwal 2015 gupta et al 2014a similarity based models have been extensively used in literature for instance troutman et al 2017 used gaussian processes with a combination of periodic kernel and gaussian kernel to predict the diurnal pattern of missing days woo et al 2009 used kernel partial least square to overcome collinearity of multivariate features in influent wastewater to better predict effluent water quality villez 2015 used weighted polynomial regression to smooth signals and obtain the probability distributions of derivatives signs for later qualitative trend analysis it is usually sufficient to directly implement classification based on the values of these similarity measures however as shown in table 1 the accuracy based on mean of similarities is lower reasoned in section 3 2 this is not a good approach in our case the underlying reasons are 1 some similar sensor faults repeated for several days introducing extreme high values that bias the mean and 2 though close the similarity of clean diurnal patterns fluctuated within a certain range density based features aggarwal 2015 for instance the number of points within a certain range better incorporates the above factors and the improvements are shown in table 1 different state of art classification algorithms were tested but they yielded similar performance area under receiver operating characteristics curve auc is a standard metric to reveal how well the classifier is able to distinguish between classes hossin and sulaiman 2015 this metric was similar regardless of the algorithm used the observable performance gain occurred when the stuck index was introduced which was also instructed by a physical phenomenon while reviewing misclassified cases it was found that if stuck faults coincidently did not distort the diurnal pattern they would be falsely identified as clean as demonstrated in supplementary material figure s4 introduction of the stuck index reduced the cases where dirty signals with stuck faults were diagnosed as clean the implication of this section is that appropriate data features are sometimes more important than algorithms data features that better incorporate consider physical factors improve classification performance 4 1 3 data validation choosing appropriate models that users understand this topic could be framed as a regression problem in which 720 points are weighted and combined into one value systematic biases were discovered in the sensor as it tended to overestimate concentrations when leachate spikes occurred for details see supplementary material therefore the flow weighted model which places equal weight on every measurement yielded overestimations a natural reaction is to lower weights on those overestimated readings however it is hard to manually tune weights and therefore machine learning tools which can automatically select weights by themselves were used neural network models are not critical for this purpose as other models could equivalently accomplish the auto tuning function the authors decided to adopted ann simply because they understand how ann works and they are confident that the back propagating feature of ann will achieve the goal 4 2 physical factors the broad definition of physical factors includes but is not limited to prior process knowledge physical constraints and phenomenological observations while their contents could be case specific typical physical factors include periodicity similarity and mass balance constraints table 2 summaries the physical factors used in this study and their corresponding actions and improvements sources for physical factors include 1 data mining over raw signals 2 information from plant operators and professionals 3 sufficient understanding of systems 4 input from experts in other disciplines such as statistics and computer engineering and 5 experimentation limited guidance exists on how to couple physical factor with data driven tools corominas et al 2018 based on the experience of this case study the authors propose three general aspects 1 customizing algorithms with physical factors 2 choosing data features that better reflect observations and 3 choosing appropriate models that users understand the process of coupling is usually not straightforward and requires experimentation 4 3 improved standard signal processing architecture isspa irizar et al 2008 proposed a standard signal processing architecture sspa for online wastewater signals which has three modules 1 pre processing 2 storage and 3 dedicated post processing raw signals are first sampled and filtered to attenuate the signal noise level in the pre processing module the storage module collects data generated in the previous module and analyses it for enriched information such as time derivative average and variance both filtered signals and enriched information are then stored in data repositories for advanced post processing tools such as monitoring and control based on this work and as further envisioned by olsson 2012 an improved architecture is proposed in fig 8 raw signals from probes and analysers are sampled and delivered to the raw data repository for permanent storage historical data sampled signals then go through designed signal processing procedures where target noise free signals are generated both mathematically and physically enriched information is calculated the former includes standard statistics as listed in sspa irizar et al 2008 such as average and variance the latter correspond to physical phenomena such as the aforementioned similarity non negative parameters and stuck index quality classification is implemented on the enriched information to differentiate clean and dirty signals as well as to increase confidence of the processed signal clean signals go through the validation procedure to be stored in the post processing repository while dirty signals could either be discarded or repaired via therapy algorithms for reconstruction once past the validation test they are also sent to the post processing repository finally signals for application are directly extracted from the post processing repository throughout the whole process the expert knowledge support module is highly involved including but not limited to determining the sampling frequency designing relevant algorithms and enriched information extraction comparing with the sspa irizar et al 2008 this architecture introduces two new modules as highlighted in blue the left added module is to better address the requirements proposed by olsson 2012 an ideal monitoring system should be able to detect and isolate measurement faults or process abnormal situations quality classification and simulate the consequences of operational adjustments validation it also provides an alternative solution for dirty signals instead of burying them in the graveyard their residual value is maximized the added module on the right emphasizes the importance of expert knowledge involving it in signal processing to maximize the quality of extracted signals for example sampling frequency is critical for control purposes olsson 2012 and a realistic sampling frequency should be chosen based on sufficient understanding of wastewater dynamics 5 conclusions a hybrid approach coupling physical factors with state of the art data driven tools demonstrated improved ability to extract useful signals from a flawed water quality signal regularized least squares customized according to physical factors proved successful in separating diurnal patterns and leachate discharge profiles from sensor signals in the following quality classification standard classification metrics e g mean and extrema of similarities proved insufficient to identify the profiles with quality deteriorated by sensor faults e g missing stuck erratic and spike classification performance improved using more appropriate data features the distribution of pairwise similarities and the stuck index separated signals were further validated by mapping daily sensor profiles into daily values of 24 hour composite samples which were measured with conventional water quality analyses the results indicated that mapping by a neural network model was superior to a direct flow weighted average model to overcome systematic errors caused by sensor non linearity the comprehensive case study demonstrated the ability of a hybrid approach to extract useful signals that comply with validation requirements from flawed sensor data the success of the hybrid approach provided insights which led to formulation of an improved standard signal processing

17636,increased availability and affordability of sensors especially water quality sensors is poised to improve process control and modelling in water and wastewater systems sensor measurements are often flawed by unavoidable influent complexity and sensor instability making extraction of useful signals problematic although a natural reaction is to put extra effort into sensor maintenance to achieve more reliable measurements useful signals can be extracted from those unqualified signals by appropriate usage of available data driven tools instructed by physical factors e g prior process knowledge physical constraints phenomenal observations such methodology is herein defined as hybrid approaches while the concept of coupling physical factors into data driven tools is not new in downstream applications such as process modelling and control little literature has explicitly applied it in the first and equally important step signal processing with flawed influent five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 sensor measurements as an example this paper provides a comprehensive case study demonstrating how physical factors were incorporated throughout the procedures of processing a flawed signal for its maximum value results showed that useful signals were extracted and validated via an assembly of well established machine learning tools whose performance was improved with physical factors an improved standard signal processing architecture isspa is also proposed based on the results of this research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sensors data quality pattern separation similarity machine learning automation 1 introduction continued developments in sensor and computer technology have accelerated application of sensor signals to satisfy tightening effluent quality standards and achieve increasing operation efficiency to lower costs corominas et al 2018 irizar et al 2008 olsson 2012 nearly all water and wastewater utilities have deployed primary e g flow meters ph sensors etc and advanced e g nutrient sensors analyser etc sensors sarni et al 2019 small facilities 20 000 population equivalents pe can generate up to 400 signals in number whereas large ones produce more than 30 000 corominas et al 2018 olsson et al 2014 the proliferation of sensors seems promising but being data rich does not necessarily lead to being information rich corominas et al 2018 olsson 2012 raw signals must be analysed and processed first so that measurement faults or abnormal process situations can be identified and isolated post processed signals must be subject to quality validation and transformed into actionable information to support decision making and operational control the idea of processing signals for useful information has existed for decades peddie et al 1990 showed that an oxidation reduction potential orp profile has distinctive features associating with cyclic operation of digesters independent of signal magnitude and range numerous similar studies further extended this concept with other sensors such as dissolved oxygen do ph and ammonia for control purposes plisson saune et al 1996 puig et al 2005 ruano et al 2012 spérandio et al 2004 by linking features in signal profiles with known bio chemical activities they succeeded in the application of signals with high temporal variability dynamics more recently studies explicitly explored the possibility of mining information from low quality sensor signals complicated by both dynamics and sensor instability schneider et al 2019 developed four soft sensors based on unmaintained sensors to monitor the status of sequencing batch reactors thürlimann et al 2018 used qualitative trend analysis to increase soft sensor tolerance to sensor drifts this research extends previous research to advanced water quality sensors such as organic matter concentration and composition which are of growing interest for instance identifying the influent source s can help better characterize the key inputs for dynamic modelling with the activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 accurate fractionation of chemical oxygen demand cod for various sources can yield more accurate predictions for decision making and control however extracting reliable and useful signals from online water quality sensors is more difficult due to influent complexity and sensor instability influent complexity is largely introduced by water and wastewater source variability and their dynamic nature which directly or indirectly leads to unstable sensor readings sensors themselves are also subject to faults and noise due to design limitations and unavoidable situations such as offline interference and fouling this research extends the incorporation of knowledge into signal processing rather than just signal use as described above although numerous data driven and or statistics based techniques are available for processing signals to improve their quality aggarwal 2015 gupta et al 2014b newhart et al 2019 most are derived by the mathematical features e g variance frequency etc inherent to signals their outcomes may not reflect and may even contradict real world physical factors e g mass balances observations simply borrowing data driven statistical tools from other fields is not sufficient given the presence of such systematic constraints corominas et al 2018 olsson 2012 sensor data quality can be significantly improved by incorporating prior knowledge from operators process experts physical constraints and phenomenological observations corominas et al 2018 haimi et al 2013 newhart et al 2019 olsson 2012 additional knowledge from the physical world is defined herein as physical factors and an approach incorporating physical factors with available data driven tools is referred to here as a hybrid signal processing approach fig 1 illustrates real world water quality sensor signals including typical sensor disturbances for this application a two year long raw five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 signal was divided into one day profiles and stacked together forming the grey area in all six subplots the signal fundamentally consists of a typical diurnal pattern illustrated by the regular weekend pattern but complicated by the discharge of leachate to the plant by trucks during normal working hours on weekdays illustrated by the regular weekday pattern note that the curve formed by the lower edge of the regular weekday signal resembles the weekend diurnal pattern when leachate spikes do not occur this suggests that actual diurnal patterns should if not exactly closely align with the lower edge of the weekday signals typical sensor faults red also occurred as illustrated in fig 1 c f definition provided in section 2 1 due to the similarity of the leachate to some sensor faults spike and erratic mathematical features e g variance frequency derivatives are insufficient to clearly separate them this dataset provided the basis to investigate the hypothesis that hybrid approaches as defined above can lead to improved extraction of reliable and useful signals from flawed sensor data the hybrid approach was specifically achieved using an assembled system with each section illustrating at least one aspect of hybridization implementation 2 methods 2 1 plant and data the city of grand rapids michigan us water resource recovery facility wrrf treats an average flow of 38 million gallons a day 144 000 m3 d the plant inflow not only consists of domestic and industrial wastewater but also landfill leachate landfill leachate is transported on weekdays and discharged to the plant influent during the normal working hours because truck arrival times and intervals between them are random irregular and variant spikes in the daily influent profile fig 1 a b are introduced which could be easily confused with sensor faults the plant is in its digitalization transformation journey gradually shifting its decision making and operations from traditional human driven approaches e g lab measurement operators experience to data driven digital solutions e g sensor measurement dynamic modelling and control useful signals with sufficient insights in domain knowledge are the fundamentals for its digital transformation to achieve overall energy efficiency resource recovery and cost reduction for instance in dynamic modelling it is anticipated that the characteristics e g solubility and biodegradability of landfill leachate are sufficiently different from municipal and industrial wastewater therefore it may be useful to separate these streams to better optimize the downstream treatment processes the sensor signals in this study were bod5 concentration measurements of plant influent by a liquid station unit zaps technologies llc with 720 measurements per day the dataset covered from 2016 05 05 to 2018 5 14 688 days 495 360 measurements daily flow proportioned composite bod5 samples were also collected and analysed 688 days the most common sensor fault symptoms presented in fig 1 c d follow the definitions provided by jan et al 2017 specifically missing fault sensor output is missing for a period of time all missing values in signals are replaced with zeros to ensure signal continuity erratic fault variance of the sensor output significantly increases above the usual value spike fault spikes are observed in the output of the sensor at fixed intervals stuck fault the sensor s output gets stuck at a fixed value also known as frozen signal one author manually labelled all sensor profiles into two categories and labelling was verified by another author independently before quality classification implementation it is recognized that manual labelling can lead to biases in subsequent analyses as deviations between the predicted label and the label provided by the human expert is implicitly assumed to be due to the inadequacy of the model and not due to error in the label provided by the human expert the potential for such biases must be carefully examined the labels used to train and test the classification algorithms were clean signals a one day signal profile that has no or only minor sensor faults of the above types disturbance is solely caused by landfill leachate these represent 72 505 out of 688 of the available daily profiles dirty signals a one day signal profile that has obvious presence of any of the above sensor faults disturbances appear to be mainly caused by sensor instability these represent 28 187 out of 688 of the available daily profiles 2 2 data analysis methodology the data analysis methodology summarized in fig 2 consisted of three steps 1 pattern separation 2 quality classification and 3 data validation all daily profiles were first subject to pattern separation to extract the regular diurnal pattern the daily profiles then entered the qualification classification process where similarities of diurnal patterns were calculated pairwise for instance a n day diurnal patterns has n 1 pair wise similarities dirty and clean signals displayed different features in pair wise similarities based on which the classification algorithm was trained to automatically classify them finally the identified two classes of data entered the data validation step to evaluate the success of the pattern separation and quality classification details of each step are provided in the following subsections 2 2 1 pattern separation signal pre processing consisted of reshaping the signals into daily profiles signal vectors and replacing missing values with zeros to ensure signal continuity the sensor signal vector y representing 720 measurements of sensor in one day was viewed as a combination of three parts 1 the diurnal pattern vector d 2 the leachate pattern vector ℓ and 3 the residual vector ɛ as showed in eq 1 1 y d ℓ ε the pattern separation problem was thus framed as finding the proper diurnal pattern d and leachate pattern ℓ so that the residual ɛ was minimized this is a typical least squares problem as formulated in eq 2 two physical factors were translated and embedded into the least squares problem 1 given that the diurnal pattern d has a periodical feature it was fitted with a 3rd order fourier series d γ x where x is the fourier coefficients vector and γ is the matrix with sin cosine elements and 2 the non negative constraint for the leachate component although no obvious pattern exists in leachate it should be non negative by nature to this end regularization was applied using the shifted huber hinger error function h ℓ groenen et al 2008 which penalized the negative elements in ℓ and forced them to be non negative 2 d ℓ arg mi n d ℓ ε 2 2 arg mi n d ℓ y d ℓ 2 2 with these specifications this problem was transformed into a regularized least squares problem as in eq 3 where λ is a hyperparameter and is tuned to 0 5 for better performance in this case solving eq 3 required mathematical techniques which have been provided in the supplementary materials finally these patterns were identified based on the daily profiles provided 3 d s arg mi n d ℓ ε 2 2 arg mi n x ℓ y γ x ℓ 2 2 λ h ℓ 2 2 2 quality classification the recurring pattern typical for water and wastewater systems was the physical factor used for this purpose although daily patterns vary somewhat the influent daily pattern should be similar in shape if sensor faults are absent pearson correlation as in eq 4 was used here to quantify similarity the yi s and yj s are the diurnal pattern vectors for two different days day i and day j and n is the length of y the is the mean value of that day the closer the correlation to 1 the higher the similarity an additional benefit of eq 4 is that the correlation has been normalized by the standard deviations of the two individual days 4 ρ y i y j k 1 n y i k y i y j k y j k 1 n y i k y i 2 k 1 n y j k y j 2 similarity was analysed pairwise between every two days and the distributions of pairwise similarity were used as predictors for clean dirty classification each day s similarity distribution was plotted into ten bin histograms and the frequencies of each bin were fed into a logistic regression model as inputs an additional variable stuck index see supplementary materials sec 2 quantifying the severity of the stuck fault was used to improve classification accuracy the classification model was trained based on 5 fold cross validation results were examined by standard classification evaluation methods including confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve roc curve hossin et al 2015 specifically the notations for the confusion matrix were true positive dirty signals are predicted as dirty true negative clean signals are predicted as clean false positive clean signals are predicted as dirty true positive dirty signals are predicted as clean 2 2 3 data validation the results of conventional water quality analyses american public health association apha 2005 were used to further validate the processing steps and increase confidence in extracted signal quality the grand rapids wrrf routinely collected and analysed flow proportioned composite influent wastewater samples for bod5 in laboratory two approaches were used to convert sensor data into estimated 24 hour composite bod5 values 1 direct calculation using available flow data defined here as the flow weighted model and 2 an artificial neural network model details for the neural network model are provided in the supplementary materials both models estimated the 24 hour composite data and their performance was used to evaluate data quality for both the clean and dirty data sets model performance was evaluated by standard regression evaluation metrics such as root mean square error finally the problematic portion of the dirty signals was remedied and then fed into the developed neural network model algorithms achieving data remediation which the authors refer to as the future therapy showed in fig 2 in this paper preliminary results of data remediation were achieved and displayed but a holistic data remediation system is still under development by the authors 2 2 4 implementation the entire solution developed in this paper including the full source code and implementation details are available on an open source public web repo http github com chengyangumich wrsubmission while the authors are not at liberty to share all of the raw sensor data an anonymized example data set is included in the web repository to allow others to evaluate our approach and implementation users should also be able to apply the solutions with necessary modification for their own sensor measurements all analyses were carried out on a windows os laptop and the code was written in matlab 2019b edition the code for regularized least squares used for pattern separation was written by the authors and the classification and the neural network regression were implemented with statistics and machine learning toolbox and deep learning toolbox respectively in matlab most of the results are availabe in the repo under the file 688results 3 results 3 1 pattern separation several traditional purely data driven algorithms including but not limited to ordinary least squares ols lowpass filter and principle component analysis pca were used to extract the diurnal pattern as illustrated by the typical example presented in fig 3 the diurnal patterns extracted using these algorithms were not satisfactory specifically the diurnal pattern extracted by ols orange consistently overestimated whereas the lowpass filter green produced overestimated portions after 2 a m and in the daytime when leachate dumping occurred the diurnal pattern extracted by pca purple was even worse with large bumps at 7 a m and deviations during 10 a m to 6 p m theoretically after processing the residual signals should mainly be the leachate component however it is obvious that the residuals have significant negative values which contradicts the physical conditions that leachate mass should be positive in other words the separated diurnal pattern is a biased estimate this occurred because these algorithms fitted the data based purely on mathematical features e g frequency variances neglecting physical constraints the hybrid algorithm regularized least squares extracted a more reliable diurnal pattern blue which was free from the impacts of the leachate pattern while fig 3 illustrates the performance of a variety of standard data driven signal process algorithms several others were also evaluated with similar poor performance data not shown the performance of the hybrid algorithm is further demonstrated for clean data in fig 4 a the diurnal pattern blue aligns well with the bottom of the original signal red as for the separated leachate pattern black it occurred mostly in the daytime when leachate dumping happens and the positive nature of leachate is well preserved although occasional negative values appeared their magnitude was quite small and acceptable the separate leachate patterns were further validated by plant personnel by comparing the timing of spikes and trunk entry recordings diurnal patterns were also extracted for dirty data as illustrated in fig 4 b distortions were mainly caused by sensor faults with the algorithm appearing to track the diurnal pattern reasonably well except in proximity to the onset of the fault it returned to good correspondence when the fault ended 3 2 quality classification with removal of the influence of leachate spikes on diurnal patterns following pattern separation the remaining diurnal patterns with large dissimilarity to others likely suffer from major sensor faults and should be labelled as dirty days each day had 687 pairwise similarities forming a population of similarities traditionally in statistics mathematical features of the population such as minimum maximum and mean are used for classification for instance if one day has a population mean much smaller than others it is classified as an outlier abnormal therefore the next step was to determine 1 which mathematical feature should be chosen and 2 which value of that feature is used for classification typical statistics are displayed in fig 5 the blue lines are the minimum and maximum of pairwise similarities whereas the yellow intervals are the 1st quantile to 3rd quantile the red stars and green crosses are the mean similarity for dirty and clean signals respectively the extrema were not robust choices because if the same sensor fault was repeated for several days for instance because sensors are repeatedly offline for maintenance at certain times those days would have similarity maxima as high as regular days this occurred frequently as many days with red stars had no significant difference in extrema with others e g days in the interval of 200 300 in fig 5 means were then investigated clean and dirty signals tended to behave differently the former had a mean at around 0 8 and in contrast the latter had random values due to different sensor faults the threshold between clean and dirty signals was trivial however as some dirty signals invaded into regions of clean signals e g around day 80 100 and vice versa distributed throughout evaluation of quantiles suggested using the whole distribution as the data feature as indicated in fig 5 days with dirty signals tended to have spiky 1st quantile values along with deviations in 3rd quantiles means were also not lying in the middle of the yellow intervals indicating highly skewed distributions two example distributions are plotted as histograms in fig 4 c d the rest have been included in the public web repo http github com chengyangumich wrsubmission distributions for clean signals were exponential like with thin tails at the correlation interval of 1 to 0 6 whereas dirty signals had different shapes due to various faults not all similarities were concentrated in the last bin because of the existence of minor variations in the daily profiles thus the density of the distribution which is quantified by the frequencies in the histogram was used as the classification input and the decision threshold for the logistic regression was selected based on the roc curve with the frequencies of each bin as input along with the stuck index explained in discussion the classification algorithms yielded an accuracy of 95 2 false positive rate and false negative rate were low 1 5 10 out of 688 and 3 3 23 out of 688 respectively 3 3 data validation the daily flow composite bod5 data estimated from the sensor data by both the flow weighted average model and the neural network model are compared to actual values in fig 6 data are compared separately for clean and dirty data comparison indicates better performance for the neural network model red for training and green for testing as defined in supplementary material than the flow weighed model as they were closer to the 1 1 line the dotted lines are the actual value within the range of one standard deviation of measured composite values in the flow weighed model a great number of points were overestimated as they exceed the range of one standard deviation of actual values in contrast most points fall within the range for ann the root mean square error rmse was improved from 52 mg l to 40 mg l for the training set and 36 mg l for the testing set composite bod5 actual values had a range of 182 43 54 to 391 mg l whereas the neural network estimates were 179 24 82 to 242 mg l in contrast dirty data showed little correlation with measured values these results further supported the unreliability of the dirty signals and the validity of the pattern separation and the classification algorithm points deviating from the 1 1 line in fig 6 b were found to be signals with major sensor faults a typical example was provided in fig 7 a a further test illustrated that the unreliability in dirty signals was due to sensor faults the unreliable part missing fault was remediated based on the information extracted from clean signals and the reliable part of the dirty signals the remediated signals went through the first two sections in the analytical methodology and were then fed into the neural network as illustrated in the typical example presented in fig 7 a the resulting signals appeared to be more reasonable and the prediction was improved as showed in fig 7 b 4 discussion 4 1 hybrid approaches in signal processing while conventional signal processing techniques are usually sufficient to prepare signals for use they failed in our case due to the unique characteristics of the signals as follows 1 the diurnal and leachate patterns both recur on a daily basis from the frequency domain view this indicates their principal frequencies overlap and are hard to separate signal filtering is only feasible when distinguishable frequency differences exist between the two patterns 2 matrix factorization based on principal component analysis and independent component analysis are two popular pattern recognition and source separation methods corominas et al 2018 soonthornnonda and christensen 2008 yuan et al 2004 they extract patterns that could explain most mathematical features including variance and high order cumulants respectively however the results usually do not assure the inference power for the separated patterns as showed in fig 3 the bump at the beginning of the diurnal pattern has no physical meaning 3 smoothing methods such as weighted least squares and moving average are not favourable in this case because it is predictable that when leachate spikes happen the separated diurnal patterns will unavoidably be overestimated this result contradicts the observation in fig 1 that the actual diurnal pattern should align with the lower edge of the signal profiles the failure of these conventional techniques led to the exploration of hybrid approaches inspired by the concept of coupling prior knowledge hybrid approaches have been practiced in the water and wastewater engineering field for a long time such as hybrid grey box modelling soft sensor design and advanced control but rarely for signal processing corominas et al 2018 schneider et al 2019 spérandio et al 2004 svardal et al 2003 thürlimann et al 2018 villez 2015 von stosch et al 2014 the hybrid approach was successful and the following sections will discuss reasons and implications 4 1 1 pattern separation customizing algorithms with physical factors the success of the pattern separation algorithms relies heavily on hybridizing two physical factors 1 periodicity of diurnal pattern and 2 non negative nature of leachate pattern using a regularized least squares algorithm the former was abstracted into a fourier series a combination of sinusoids with flexible amplitudes and phases but fixed frequencies while the latter was achieved by applying constraints on the leachate pattern the implementing algorithm was regularized least squares while regularized least squares is widely used in other disciplines to introduce restrictions aster et al 2018 james et al 2013 it has not been used extensively in the water and wastewater field instead other members of the least squares family such as partial least squares and generalized least squares are used more frequently corominas et al 2018 haimi et al 2013 newhart et al 2019 villez 2015 meanwhile the theory of fourier series is well developed and the non negative constraints methods are also available lin 2007 and sutherland stacey et al 2011 applied non negative matrix factorization to extract basis spectra from signals from uv vis sensors assembling these separate ideas together is innovative and achieved satisfactory pattern separation which demonstrates the power of coupling physical factors in signal processing in fact regularized least squares could be a good beginner algorithm to couple physical factors thanks to its flexibility flexibility arises from the least squares term the diurnal term and regularization the least squares terms can be adjusted with kernel methods or other shapes to embed more assumptions hainmueller and hazlett 2014 villez 2015 villez et al 2013 for instance a low order polynomial shape could be used rather than a fourier series to capture gradually changing trends various standard regularizations are available for different purposes for instance ridge and lasso for screening more important signals and tikhonov regularization for smoothing aster et al 2018 groenen et al 2008 james et al 2013 regularization can also be customized as needed via appropriate error functions as demonstrated in this study 4 1 2 quality classification choosing data features that better reflect observations numerous similarity measures exist where two large groups are kernel based and distance based aggarwal 2015 gupta et al 2014a similarity based models have been extensively used in literature for instance troutman et al 2017 used gaussian processes with a combination of periodic kernel and gaussian kernel to predict the diurnal pattern of missing days woo et al 2009 used kernel partial least square to overcome collinearity of multivariate features in influent wastewater to better predict effluent water quality villez 2015 used weighted polynomial regression to smooth signals and obtain the probability distributions of derivatives signs for later qualitative trend analysis it is usually sufficient to directly implement classification based on the values of these similarity measures however as shown in table 1 the accuracy based on mean of similarities is lower reasoned in section 3 2 this is not a good approach in our case the underlying reasons are 1 some similar sensor faults repeated for several days introducing extreme high values that bias the mean and 2 though close the similarity of clean diurnal patterns fluctuated within a certain range density based features aggarwal 2015 for instance the number of points within a certain range better incorporates the above factors and the improvements are shown in table 1 different state of art classification algorithms were tested but they yielded similar performance area under receiver operating characteristics curve auc is a standard metric to reveal how well the classifier is able to distinguish between classes hossin and sulaiman 2015 this metric was similar regardless of the algorithm used the observable performance gain occurred when the stuck index was introduced which was also instructed by a physical phenomenon while reviewing misclassified cases it was found that if stuck faults coincidently did not distort the diurnal pattern they would be falsely identified as clean as demonstrated in supplementary material figure s4 introduction of the stuck index reduced the cases where dirty signals with stuck faults were diagnosed as clean the implication of this section is that appropriate data features are sometimes more important than algorithms data features that better incorporate consider physical factors improve classification performance 4 1 3 data validation choosing appropriate models that users understand this topic could be framed as a regression problem in which 720 points are weighted and combined into one value systematic biases were discovered in the sensor as it tended to overestimate concentrations when leachate spikes occurred for details see supplementary material therefore the flow weighted model which places equal weight on every measurement yielded overestimations a natural reaction is to lower weights on those overestimated readings however it is hard to manually tune weights and therefore machine learning tools which can automatically select weights by themselves were used neural network models are not critical for this purpose as other models could equivalently accomplish the auto tuning function the authors decided to adopted ann simply because they understand how ann works and they are confident that the back propagating feature of ann will achieve the goal 4 2 physical factors the broad definition of physical factors includes but is not limited to prior process knowledge physical constraints and phenomenological observations while their contents could be case specific typical physical factors include periodicity similarity and mass balance constraints table 2 summaries the physical factors used in this study and their corresponding actions and improvements sources for physical factors include 1 data mining over raw signals 2 information from plant operators and professionals 3 sufficient understanding of systems 4 input from experts in other disciplines such as statistics and computer engineering and 5 experimentation limited guidance exists on how to couple physical factor with data driven tools corominas et al 2018 based on the experience of this case study the authors propose three general aspects 1 customizing algorithms with physical factors 2 choosing data features that better reflect observations and 3 choosing appropriate models that users understand the process of coupling is usually not straightforward and requires experimentation 4 3 improved standard signal processing architecture isspa irizar et al 2008 proposed a standard signal processing architecture sspa for online wastewater signals which has three modules 1 pre processing 2 storage and 3 dedicated post processing raw signals are first sampled and filtered to attenuate the signal noise level in the pre processing module the storage module collects data generated in the previous module and analyses it for enriched information such as time derivative average and variance both filtered signals and enriched information are then stored in data repositories for advanced post processing tools such as monitoring and control based on this work and as further envisioned by olsson 2012 an improved architecture is proposed in fig 8 raw signals from probes and analysers are sampled and delivered to the raw data repository for permanent storage historical data sampled signals then go through designed signal processing procedures where target noise free signals are generated both mathematically and physically enriched information is calculated the former includes standard statistics as listed in sspa irizar et al 2008 such as average and variance the latter correspond to physical phenomena such as the aforementioned similarity non negative parameters and stuck index quality classification is implemented on the enriched information to differentiate clean and dirty signals as well as to increase confidence of the processed signal clean signals go through the validation procedure to be stored in the post processing repository while dirty signals could either be discarded or repaired via therapy algorithms for reconstruction once past the validation test they are also sent to the post processing repository finally signals for application are directly extracted from the post processing repository throughout the whole process the expert knowledge support module is highly involved including but not limited to determining the sampling frequency designing relevant algorithms and enriched information extraction comparing with the sspa irizar et al 2008 this architecture introduces two new modules as highlighted in blue the left added module is to better address the requirements proposed by olsson 2012 an ideal monitoring system should be able to detect and isolate measurement faults or process abnormal situations quality classification and simulate the consequences of operational adjustments validation it also provides an alternative solution for dirty signals instead of burying them in the graveyard their residual value is maximized the added module on the right emphasizes the importance of expert knowledge involving it in signal processing to maximize the quality of extracted signals for example sampling frequency is critical for control purposes olsson 2012 and a realistic sampling frequency should be chosen based on sufficient understanding of wastewater dynamics 5 conclusions a hybrid approach coupling physical factors with state of the art data driven tools demonstrated improved ability to extract useful signals from a flawed water quality signal regularized least squares customized according to physical factors proved successful in separating diurnal patterns and leachate discharge profiles from sensor signals in the following quality classification standard classification metrics e g mean and extrema of similarities proved insufficient to identify the profiles with quality deteriorated by sensor faults e g missing stuck erratic and spike classification performance improved using more appropriate data features the distribution of pairwise similarities and the stuck index separated signals were further validated by mapping daily sensor profiles into daily values of 24 hour composite samples which were measured with conventional water quality analyses the results indicated that mapping by a neural network model was superior to a direct flow weighted average model to overcome systematic errors caused by sensor non linearity the comprehensive case study demonstrated the ability of a hybrid approach to extract useful signals that comply with validation requirements from flawed sensor data the success of the hybrid approach provided insights which led to formulation of an improved standard signal processing

17637,antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args were investigated from effluent of two hospital and two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps before and after disinfection the results of network analysis showed that 8 genera were identified to be the main potential hosts of args including mycobacterium ferruginibacter thermomonas morganella enterococcus bacteroides myroides and romboutsia the removal of args and their possible bacterialhosts were synchronous and consistent by chlorine or ultraviolet uv disinfection in wwtps the mechanisms of arb and args removal and conjugation transfer of rp4 plasmids by uv chlorine and synergistic uv chlorine disinfection was revealed compared to uv alone arb inactivation was improved 1 4 log and photoreactivation was overcomeeffectively by uv chlorine combination 8 mj cm2 chlorine 2 mg l however args degradation was more difficult than arb inactivation until uv dosage enhanced to 320 mj cm2 args achieved 0 58 1 60 log removal meanwhile when 2 mg l of chlorine was combined with uv combination args removal enhanced 1 1 5 log the synergistic effect of adding low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l during uv radiation effectively improved arb and args removal simultaneously the same synergistic effect also occurred in the horizontal gene transfer hgt non lethal dose chlorine 0 5 mg l increased the conjugation transfer frequency which confirmed that the mrna expression levels of type iv secretion system t4ss proteins vir4d vir5b and vir10b were significantly enhanced the risk of rp4 plasmid

args cacace et al 2019 lorenzo et al 2018 pazda et al 2019 sabri et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the composition of args was related to the phylogeny and taxonomic structure of bacteria within the environment which bacterial community was the main determinant of arg abundance forsberg et al 2014 li et al 2015 an understanding of the co occurrence pattern of arb and args in environmental samples e g wwtps is useful toidentify indicatorsof antibiotic microbial resistance li et al 2015 uv and chlorine have been widely used in drinking water and wastewater disinfection rizzo et al 2013 stange et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b uv had a high disinfection ability which acted on nucleic acid forming pyrimidine dimer to destroy dna structure of bacteria childress et al 2013 however it cannot maintain a residual for continuous inactivation of microorganisms and resurrection of inactivated bacteria was observed li et al 2017 chlorine is the most common disinfectant due to its low cost and durability chlorine enters cells primarily through diffusion and transport and react with cellular components causing microbial death liu et al 2018 the combination of uv and chlorineis a synergistic disinfection process that can increase disinfection efficiency and has attracted increasing attention liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a but the research on the removal of arb and args by uv chlorine disinfection is rare under normal conditions the disinfection process can significantly reduce the overall arb level but the effect of args reduction was not obvious stange et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 in this case advanced disinfection methods are required to inactivate arb and to break args efficiently some studies have shown the bacteria tolerant to disinfectants can survive and spread resistance to other bacteria guo and kong 2019 li and gu 2019 in addition intact dna residues can be transferred to the surrounding bacterial population by horizontal gene transfer hgt ben et al 2019 even after disinfection of effluent the horizontal transfer of args among bacteria still causes public concern jutkina et al 2018 the dual roles of disinfection may depend on the contact time and dosage of disinfectant suggesting a complicated relationship between hgt and disinfection mechanism stange et al 2019 the main mechanisms of hgt in bacteria are plasmid conjugation transfer viral transduction transfer and free dna transformation bañuelos vazquez et al 2017 toussaint and rice 2017 the type iv secretion system t4ss is one of the important secretion systems and t4ss plays an important role in the conjugation transfer of dna which results in the spread of antibiotic resistance in various bacteria vird4 is a component of the atpase of the t4ss virb5 is a component of the membrane surface protein and pilus of t4ss and virb10 is a component of inner membrane protein of t4ss christie 2016 gordon et al 2017 these structures provide an understanding of the dynamics of bacterial conjugation transfer on molecular level the purpose of this study was to 1 determine the specific bacterial and arg subtypes as indicators of arb and args contamination respectively based on the coexistence patterns of args and bacterial communities obtained through network analysis 2 establish different disinfection models and explore the mechanisms for the reduction of resistant bacteria and args by uv and chlorine at various doses 3 clarify the effects of uv and chlorine disinfection on hgt at low dose by conjugation experiments and explore synergistic

and arb reduction by disinfection in wwtps secondary treatment effluent before disinfection and final effluent samples after disinfection were collected from two hospital and two municipal wwtps fig 1 a showed the args relative abundance to 16s rrna gene in which aminoglycoside resistance genes aac 6 ib 01 aac 6 ib 02 aada 01 aada1 aada2 01 aada5 01 and strb sulphonamide sul2 and tetracycline resistance genes tetm and tetx had high abundance the relative abundance to 16s rrna 10 3 for all samples generally the hospital wastewater had more types of resistance and higher abundance than those in municipal wwtps p 0 05 fortwo hospital the relative abundance of several resistance genes increased after disinfecting with sodium hypochlorite for example aac 6 ii in hosp1 enhanced 0 69 log and aacc2 aada 01 tetr and tetx in hosp2 increased from 0 22 log to 2 23 log for two municipal wwtps adopted uv disinfection most of the resistance genes abundance was decreased while some args increased but not significantly e g sul1 tet 34 tete and tets at the same time the relative abundance of bacterial community on genera level was also determined as shown in fig 1 b and fig s3 the bacterial community of two hospitals was far from each other and canonical correlation analysis cca suggested electrical conductivity ec and total organic carbon toc caused high abundance of thiothrix in hwtp1 whereas enterococcus pseudomonas and morganella in hwtp2 meanwhile the bacterial community composition of two municipalsewage treatment plants was similar and mainly affected by dissolved oxygen do wilcoxon rank sum test showed that hospital contained more bacteroides and morganella 0 01 p 0 05 and municipal wwtps contained more strains such as candidatus microthrix enterococcus and unclassified f blastocatellaceae 0 01 p 0 05 fig s4 furtherly the relative abundance of bacterial community on level of phylum was investigated fig s5 both disinfection processes caused a reduction in firmicutes however hypochlorite caused the relative abundance of proteobacteria increase while uv reduced it the above results showed disinfection did not cause drastic changes in the microbial community but adjusted the relative abundance of the genus the correlation analysis was constructed based on the relative abundance variables of args and arb of all samples before and after disinfection in wwtps the results showed that the abundance of args was high correlated with the number of arb in most cases during disinfection fig s6 further the co occurrence patterns between args and arb were investigated using network analysis r2 0 8 p 0 01 as shown in fig 1 c the network consisted of 62 nodes and 231 edges the modularity index was 0 611 indicating that it had a modular structure according to the modular category the entire network could be resolved into 7 main modules the modular category indicated that the decrease of args were associated with arb reduction upon disinfection in wastewater by the co occurrence analysis it showed that six bacterial genera might be the host of args for example bacteroides might be the host of the aminoglycoside resistance gene aacc2 and the tetracycline resistance genes tett tetr and tetx enterococcus carries an aminoglycoside resistance gene strb and a tetracycline resistance gene teta and tetb compared to the above genus morganella carries more args including aminoglycoside resistance genes aacc2 apha1 aka kanr and aade tetracycline tett tetr and tetb and sulfonamide resistance genes sul2 the results showed that the reduction of args and the removal of bacterial hosts were synchronous and consistent in the disinfection process of wwtps 3 2 low dose chlorine enhanced uv sterilization of arb and prevented photoreactivation to explore the effect of disinfection dosage and methods on arb abundance we investigated the inactivation of arb with uv and or chlorine disinfection as shown in fig 2 a the survival rate of bacteria was reduced with uv dose increasing when uv dose increased to 32 mj cm2 the bacterial survival was hardly to be detected compared to uv alone uv combined with low chlorine 1 mg l or 2 mg l disinfection achieved higher efficiency of bacterial inactivationsignificantly and the tolerance of morganella morganii was more than enterococcus faecalis with uv disinfection furthermore the inactivation effect of arb was analyzed underdifferent uv dosecombined with low dose chlorine as shown in fig s7 the cfu of arb was reduced in a dose and time dependent manner when uv combined with low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l contact time 20 to 80 s can significantly improve the inactivation rate of arb 0 8 1 4 log however when uv dose increased to 32 mj cm2 there was no difference in each group all of which achieved the lethal effect of bacteria fig s8 showed that more chlorine was consumed for uv chlorine under uv irradiation by measuring residual chlorine concentration these results indicated that the inactivation effect of uv combinated with a low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l resulted in synergistic inhibition on cell growth as shown in fig 2 b the survival rate of bacteria was reduced upon chlorine disinfection in a dose dependent manner the cfu of morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis were reduced by 3 72 and 4 89 log values at a chlorine dose of 60 mg min l respectively to observe the visible damage of the bacteria surface with uv and chlorine disinfection scanning electron microscopy performed in enterococcus faecalis and morganella morganii showed that the untreated arb had intact cell morphology and the cell surface was smooth and flat figs 2 c and f the surface structure of most bacteria was hardly damaged with uv treatment at a dosage of 32 mj cm2 suggesting uv was difficult to destroy the surface structure of bacteria and irreversible membrane damage requires a relatively high uv dose figs 2 d and g figs 2 e and h showed some holes and wrinkles appeared on the surface of the bacteria with chlorine treatment at a dosage of 100 mg min l indicating the main reason of microbial inactivation might be the irreversible destruction of bacterial surface structures uv disinfection couldn t kill bacteria completely some of them were resurrected by fluorescent light the resurrection of arb was increased upon fluorescent light in a time dependent manner with uv disinfection alone fig 2 i and table s4 however uv combined with chlorine disinfection showed that it is almost no light resurrection particularly under adding 2 mg l chlorine suggesting the synergisticeffect significantly inhibited the photoactivation of arb figs 2 j and k 3 3 low dose chlorine enhanced uv removal of args since uv chlorine combination disinfection has been shown to reduce arb synergistically the effect on args was worth examining as shown in fig 3 the copy number of args was reduced in a dose dependent manner but it was affected by the mode of disinfection and the type of args under uv disinfection alone at the dose of 320 mj cm2 the copy number of 16s rrna gene in morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis was decreased 0 40 log and 1 35 log respectively fig s9 and table s5 the copy number reduction of args was 0 58 1 60 log showing uv disinfection affected by the resistance type under chlorine disinfection alone at the dose of 320 mg min l the copy number of 16s rrna gene in morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis decreased 4 19 log and 3 99 log respectively fig s9 the copy number reduction of the args was 4 30 5 18 log fig 3 chlorine disinfection had a strong effect on removing args in comparison with uv meanwhile under uv disinfection combined with 2 mg l chlorine the reduction of the copy number of five genes improved 1 1 5 log with uv dose increasing significantly in particular at high uv dose 320 mj cm2 fig s10 moreover it worth noting the degradation degree of tetb gene in enterococcus faecalis was higher than that in morganella morganiiunder the same disinfectant and dose shown as figs 3 c and f p 0 05 thus the disinfection effect was related to the type of resistance and the characteristics of bacteria in addition the residual chlorine concentration measurements showed thatthe rate of chlorine consumption slowed down when the uv dose increased the decay rate of chlorine was also increased with uv irradiation fig s11 uv combined with low dose chlorine could enhance the degradation of args greatly by synergistic effect furthermore the correlation between args and 16s rrna gene revealed the potential mechanism in the process of args reduction table 1 the abundance of the 16s rrna gene reflected the number of microorganisms in water sample the analysis showed that args were positively correlated with 16s rrna gene r2 0 8 p 0 05 suggesting args were associated with reduced microbial populations however the removal rates of different genes varied greatly indicating the reduction of args was not only related to the decreasing of the number of strains but that uv or chlorine disinfection might destroy the structure of these genes and thus reduce their abundance zheng et al 2017 3 4 effect of uv and chlorine disinfection on horizontal gene transfer arb disinfection experiment showed that the disinfection process can significantly reduce copy numbers of arb however disinfection effluent from wwtps detected that some arb and args were tolerant to disinfectants these bacteria that were tolerant to disinfectants can survive and spread their resistance to other bacteria so it is necessary to investigate the effects of uv and chlorine disinfection upon hgt at non lethal doses using e coli containing rp4 plasmid as a donor and pseudomonas sp screened in wastewater as a receptor we constructed a hgt model and evaluated the frequency of conjugation transfer by low dosage of uv and chlorine through antibiotic screened plates as shown in fig 4 a the cfu of donor and recipient cells and the frequency of conjugate transfer was reduced upon uv treatment alone in a dose dependent manner when the uv dose was greater than 4 mj cm2 the conjugation transfer could not be observed by colony counting however a different phenomenon was appeared with chloride disinfection alone fig 4 b the frequency of conjugate transfer reached the maximum upon chloride treatment alone at dose of 0 5 mg l and then the cfu of donor and recipient cells was decreased in a dose dependent manner whereas the conjugation transfer phenomenon was not observed any more at the dose of 4 mg l and above moreover the conjugative transfer frequency was further decreased with the uv combination with low dose chloride disinfection figs 4 c and d these results showed that the advanced oxidation of uv combined with low dose chlorine effectively inhibited the horizontal transfer of rp4 plasmid than uv and chlorine disinfection alone to explore the potential mechanism of conjugation transfer frequency declination with disinfection the bacterial conjugation transfer experiments were carried out in proportion to the number of donors and recipients when the number of donors and recipients was 105 the frequency of conjugation remained around 10 4 however the frequency of conjugation rapidly decreased and the conjugation was hardly observed when the number of cells was 104 fig s12 the frequency of conjugation was related to the concentration of bacteria in the conjugation system these data suggesting that the increase in disinfection dose leads to an increase in the death of bacteria thus reducing the frequency of conjugation furtherly the cell morphology of pseudomonas sp was observed by sem scanning electron microscope with 0 5 mg l chlorine for 30 min then overnight culture for 24 h in order to investigate the effect of low dose chlorine disinfection on the recipient bacteria the results showed that the extracellular secretion of pseudomonas sp was significantly increased compared to the untreated group which may be related to an increased frequency of conjugative transfer figs 4 e g the effect of 0 5 mg l chlorine treatment on vird4 virb5 and virb10 expression in pseudomonas sp was examined as shown in fig 4 h pseudomonas sp cells stimulated by 0 5 mg l chlorineincreased the expression of vird4 virb5 and virb10 at mrna levels indicating its ability to mediate plasmid dna conjugation enhanced p 0 05 whereas the mrna levels of these genes significantly decreased at dose of 4 mg l p 0 01 the mrna expression of vird4 virb5 and virb10 were gradually downregulated with the increase of uv dose fig 4 i this might be related to the direct action of uv disinfection on dna molecules and the inhibition of gene transcription 4 discussion disinfection plays an important role in removal of args and may serve as a barrier to limit the spread of arb and args yoon et al 2017 the results of this study showed that the type of args by chlorine disinfection was basically unchanged for hospital wastewater whereas the abundance was significantly decreased however some individual genes such as aac 6 ib aada 01 aada2 01 and aada5 01 etc still had a high relative abundance in the final effluent these result was consistent with that of chlorination in the treatment of drinking water of hu s study chlorine treatment showed no significant effect on the reduction of args with a 0 4 log increased in the total args but promoted the propagation of several arg subtypes by large amounts sul1 ermc 1 1 log hu et al 2019 although uv disinfection showed a good removal effect in municipal wwtps many resistance genes were still detected in the final effluent it was observed by zhang s study that uv disinfection dramatically changes the bacterial community structure and antibiotic resistance in wastewater the proportion of gram positive bacteria gradually increases as the uv dosage increases zhang et al 2019b however our results showed that the bacterial community hardly changed with uv disinfection since certain specific microbial populations carry certain specific args the corresponding arg and coexisting microbial taxa have a significantly similar abundance trend in different environments li et al 2015 according to our network analysis 8 genera were thought to be the main potential hosts of args including mycobacterium ferruginibacter thermomonas morganella enterococcus bacteroides myroides and romboutsia morganella morganii belong to the classification of enterobacteriaceae which usually carries sul2 and aada pu et al 2018 trobos et al 2009 which were similar to our findings in order to further determine the coexistence between args and bacterial communities this study isolated and identified morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis and identified their arg subtypes morganella morganii was the host of tetracycline resistance genes tetb sulfonamide resistance gene sul2 and aminoglycoside resistance gene aacc2 like morganella morganii enterococcus faecalis also took along tetracycline resistance genes teta and tetb and aminoglycoside resistance gene strb high consistency of the result suggested that network analysis was a new insight that can provide us information about arg and its possible hosts many disinfection studies focus on setting disinfectant concentration and exposure time up to microbiological standard for wastewater and drinking water treatment wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b however disinfection may induce microorganisms to enter a state of survival that can t be cultured which still retains metabolic activity and physiological toxicity guo and kong 2019 therefore most current studies may underestimate the tolerance of microorganisms to disinfectants and the risk of pathogens in water our study found that uv disinfection did not completely kill morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis at dose of 32mj cm2 in particular the reactivation rate of morganella reached 2 55 after 24 h and even reached 10 39 after 72 h the resurrection rate means the number of morganella morganii reached 108 cfu ml uv was directly absorbed by nucleic acids thereby destroying the dna of microorganisms lee et al 2015 that was to say uv light can penetrate a relatively transparent structure as a cell wall and directly destroy the dna of the microorganism thereby causing the formation of a pyrimidine dimer mckinney and pruden 2012 however dna photolyase can specifically bind to dna containing pyrimidine dimer generate electron transfer under illumination cleave pyrimidine dimer restore dna double helix structure and make sublethal bacteria resuscitation after uv disinfection lee et al 2015 xu et al 2018 in this study uv combine with chlorine 2 mg l disinfection significantly inhibited the photoactivation of arb chlorine and free radicals first react with the cell wall of the bacteria causing perforation or rupture of the cell wall before entering the cytoplasm and reacting with dna dodd 2012 ersoy et al 2019 sharma et al 2016 therefore chlorine and uv chlorine disinfection were not reversible a large number of studies had shown that sewage treatment plants discharge was rich in resistance genes and the common uv or chlorine disinfection dosage failed to remove args liu et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in this study gram positive bacteria enterococcus faecalis and gram negative bacteria morganella morganii were treated with uv alone or uv combined chlorine 1 2 mg l respectively the results showed that the removal effect of chlorine was significantly increased in dose dependent manner compared to uv disinfection and the removal effect of uv chlorine was further enhanced than uv alone for chlorine or uv it can be observed that the dosage of bacterial cell inactivation was lower than the dosage required to reduce the arg copy number stange et al stange et al 2019 found that uv exposure dosage of 60 mj cm2 resulted in a 4 8 5 5 log reduction in the number of bacteria but a decrease in args 0 1 0 log was negligible our results were consistent with their research when uv dosage alone was 40 mj cm2 the args were reduced by 0 15 0 38 log at a same dose of uv 40 mj cm2 adding 2 mg l chlorine into the reaction system the args were decreased by 0 41 0 94 log uv chlorine can effectively improve the removal of arg meanwhile effectively killing bacteria on one hand hypochlorous acid hocl was formed when sodium hypochlorite was added to water proteins and peptidoglycans bound to the cell wall and cell membrane were the initial point of attack for chlorine disinfection dodd 2012 after cell membrane damage hocl can penetrate the cell wall and reach the cytoplasm and then react with the base where thymidine deoxyguanosine and uridine monophosphate were the first targets on the other hand uv light easily penetrates the bacterial cell membrane and the relatively transparent structure in the cytoplasm and can directly act on dna causing adjacent pyrimidine molecules in the dna to form pyrimidine dimers causing dna double strand breaks to cause bacterial inactivation zheng et al 2017 through the detection of residual chlorine we found that the consumption of chlorine was accelerated in the uv chlorine disinfection process according to dong and zhang et al s studies dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a oh and rcs cl clo cl2 etc radicals were produced during the uv chlorine process therefore rcs free radicals might play an important role in target gene removal this study showed that rcs as a selective oxidizing free radical had more opportunities to react with target genes than to be consumed by other components of arb cells instead the oh free radical was consumed preferentially by other cell components rattanakul and oguma 2017 zhang et al 2019a thus these two methods support each other when attacking dna yoon yoon et al 2017 reported considerably higher dosages of uv 100 130 mj cm2 achieved significant arg removal 4 log the args reduction in this experiment did not reach 2 log at the maximum dosage the most likely reason was that unlike the disinfection of e coli the bacteria isolated in the environment were more tolerant to uv few people pay attention to the effects of low dose disinfectants on bacteria liu s study liu et al 2019 mentioned that bacteria exposed to uv at low dose can regain their metastatic ability after reactivation either by dark repair or photoactivation in fact the effects of low dose disinfectants were not limited to these by changing the permeability of cell membranes and increasing the ability of bacteria to take up dna or plasmids in vitro arg was involved in horizontal gene transfer between microbial populations guo s study found that low uv dosages 8 mj cm2 had little effect on the frequency of conjugate transfer and uv exposure only reduced the number of bacteria without altering cell permeability guo et al 2015 our study found that uv reduced conjugation transfer of rp4 at low dose 0 5 4 mj cm2 when uv was higher than 8 mj cm2 conjugation transfer does not occur the possible reason for the different results was that in our study the recipient cells were not e coli but pseudomonas isolated in the environment in addition we have found that low dose chlorine enhance the conjugation transfer frequency scanning electron microscopy showed that low dose chlorine 0 5 mg l could stimulate the increase of extracellular proteins of pseudomonas and qpcr confirmed that the mrna expression of t4ss proteins vir4d vir5b and vir10b were significantly increased lin s study lin et al 2016 found that uv irradiation 5 20 mj cm2 and low dose chlorine 0 3 0 5 mg l treatment 6h 48 h reduced the frequency of conjugate transfer however it was found that after the treatment of 0 1 0 25 mg l chlorine for 24 h the conjugation transfer frequency increased was also observed in our study uv inhibited rp4 plasmid conjugation transfer while low levels of chlorine have the risk of increasing horizontal gene transfer when uv dosage was higher than 4 mj cm2 combined with 1 2 mg l chlorine treatment of bacteria no transconjugants was detected therefore uv chlorine can significantly control the risk of hgt showing more advantages than direct uv or chlorine alone 5 conclusion in this study the removal of args and their possible hosts were synchronous and consistent in wwtps enterococcus faecalis strb teta and tetb and morganella morganii aacc2 sul2 and tetb were isolated from wwtps effluent offering strain models to understand themechanism of args and arb removal during uv chlorine and uv chlorine processes photoreactivation of bacteria was occurred frequently after disinfection by uv alone while it was bare occurred after uv chlorine inactivation although the arb were easily inactivated by these three disinfection processes the args were relatively difficult to remove uv dosage at 320 mj cm2 args achieved 0 58 1 60 log removal and uv chlorine 2 mg l enhanced 1 1 5 log removal the synergistic effect of low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l combined with uv disinfection effectively improved arb and args removal besides the advantage of uv chlorine on inhibiting horizontal gene transfer was also verified in this work these findings may serve as valuable implications for assessing and controlling the

17637,antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args were investigated from effluent of two hospital and two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps before and after disinfection the results of network analysis showed that 8 genera were identified to be the main potential hosts of args including mycobacterium ferruginibacter thermomonas morganella enterococcus bacteroides myroides and romboutsia the removal of args and their possible bacterialhosts were synchronous and consistent by chlorine or ultraviolet uv disinfection in wwtps the mechanisms of arb and args removal and conjugation transfer of rp4 plasmids by uv chlorine and synergistic uv chlorine disinfection was revealed compared to uv alone arb inactivation was improved 1 4 log and photoreactivation was overcomeeffectively by uv chlorine combination 8 mj cm2 chlorine 2 mg l however args degradation was more difficult than arb inactivation until uv dosage enhanced to 320 mj cm2 args achieved 0 58 1 60 log removal meanwhile when 2 mg l of chlorine was combined with uv combination args removal enhanced 1 1 5 log the synergistic effect of adding low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l during uv radiation effectively improved arb and args removal simultaneously the same synergistic effect also occurred in the horizontal gene transfer hgt non lethal dose chlorine 0 5 mg l increased the conjugation transfer frequency which confirmed that the mrna expression levels of type iv secretion system t4ss proteins vir4d vir5b and vir10b were significantly enhanced the risk of rp4 plasmid conjugation transfer was significantly reduced with uv chlorine uv 4 mj cm2 chlorine 1 mg l these findings may serve as valuable implications for assessing and controlling the risk of args transfer

resistance is a global health issue municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as reservoirs for antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args cacace et al 2019 lorenzo et al 2018 pazda et al 2019 sabri et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the composition of args was related to the phylogeny and taxonomic structure of bacteria within the environment which bacterial community was the main determinant of arg abundance forsberg et al 2014 li et al 2015 an understanding of the co occurrence pattern of arb and args in environmental samples e g wwtps is useful toidentify indicatorsof antibiotic microbial resistance li et al 2015 uv and chlorine have been widely used in drinking water and wastewater disinfection rizzo et al 2013 stange et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b uv had a high disinfection ability which acted on nucleic acid forming pyrimidine dimer to destroy dna structure of bacteria childress et al 2013 however it cannot maintain a residual for continuous inactivation of microorganisms and resurrection of inactivated bacteria was observed li et al 2017 chlorine is the most common disinfectant due to its low cost and durability chlorine enters cells primarily through diffusion and transport and react with cellular components causing microbial death liu et al 2018 the combination of uv and chlorineis a synergistic disinfection process that can increase disinfection efficiency and has attracted increasing attention liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a but the research on the removal of arb and args by uv chlorine disinfection is rare under normal conditions the disinfection process can significantly reduce the overall arb level but the effect of args reduction was not obvious stange et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 in this case advanced disinfection methods are required to inactivate arb and to break args efficiently some studies have shown the bacteria tolerant to disinfectants can survive and spread resistance to other bacteria guo and kong 2019 li and gu 2019 in addition intact dna residues can be transferred to the surrounding bacterial population by horizontal gene transfer hgt ben et al 2019 even after disinfection of effluent the horizontal transfer of args among bacteria still causes public concern jutkina et al 2018 the dual roles of disinfection may depend on the contact time and dosage of disinfectant suggesting a complicated relationship between hgt and disinfection mechanism stange et al 2019 the main mechanisms of hgt in bacteria are plasmid conjugation transfer viral transduction transfer and free dna transformation bañuelos vazquez et al 2017 toussaint and rice 2017 the type iv secretion system t4ss is one of the important secretion systems and t4ss plays an important role in the conjugation transfer of dna which results in the spread of antibiotic resistance in various bacteria vird4 is a component of the atpase of the t4ss virb5 is a component of the membrane surface protein and pilus of t4ss and virb10 is a component of inner membrane protein of t4ss christie 2016 gordon et al 2017 these structures provide an understanding of the dynamics of bacterial conjugation transfer on molecular level the purpose of this study was to 1 determine the specific bacterial and arg subtypes as indicators of arb and args contamination respectively based on the coexistence patterns of args and bacterial communities obtained through network analysis 2 establish different disinfection models and explore the mechanisms for the reduction of resistant bacteria and args by uv and chlorine at various doses 3 clarify the effects of uv and chlorine disinfection on hgt at low dose by conjugation experiments and explore synergistic

performed using a parallel uv light source system cel hxuv300 beijing zhongjiao jinyuan technology co ltd beijing china the uv lamp is a low pressure mercury vapor monochromatic lamp the device consists of a uv reflector uvref beijing zhongjiao jinyuan technology co ltd beijing china that allows parallel sources to be emitted vertically a petri dish diameter 60 mm containing 10 ml of microorganisms suspension were placed with stirring under the collimated beam in order to assure equal uv dose for all bacterial in the suspension carefully control the speed of rotation and cannot cause vortex conditions the disinfection device is properly ventilated to maintain temperature stability throughout the irradiation the irradiance at 254 nm of the position of the liquid surface measured by a uvc radiometer beijing normal university optical instrument factory was 100 μw cm2 uv dose of 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 mj cm2 were achieved by change the exposure time the uv dose was calculated as described by bolton bolton and linden 2003 all steps were performed in a dark room to prevent photoreactivation for chlorination experiments sodium hypochlorite was added to each 10 ml of bacterial solution to establish different initial free chlorine concentrations 1 2 4 8 and 10 mg l chlorine for a reaction time of 10 min for chlorine reduction arg experiments the free chlorine concentration was kept 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 mg l respectively and the reaction time was 10 min the concentrations of free and total chlorine were measured by adding dpd free chlorine reagent powder hach germany and detected by a rd 890 colorimeter hach germany whenthe contact time was due sodium thiosulfate solution 1 5 was added to terminate the chlorination process for uv chlorine disinfection experiments under the same condition of uv one was added with 1 mg l chlorine the other with 2 mg l chlorine and still using 1 5 sodium thiosulfate solution terminates the chlorine reaction during the process of chlorinate and uv chlorine disinfection residual chlorine concentrations were detected by dpd colorimetric method simultaneously all steps were performed in a dark room to prevent photoactivation 2 7 bacterium photoreactivation experiment bacterium photoreactivation experiment was carried out after uv and uv chlorine disinfection with the maximum dosage 32 mj cm2 100 μl disinfected samples were taken out for bacterial count and the rest was carried out for photoactivation experiments each photoactivation has a control group of dark repair in quartz glass tube coveryed with aluminum foil to keep dark condition reactivation was carried out in a 25 c thermostat a fluorescent lamp 11 w nvc t5 was placed 30 cm from the liquid level the irradiance of the liquid surface at 420 nm was 120 μw cm2 measured by a uva radiometer beijing normal university optical instrument factory the cells were activated for 24 48 and 72 h respectively and the bacterial liquid was collected at the set time intervals the photoreactivation rate was defined as follows 1 photoreactivation rate np n n 0 n here np number of photoreactivated bacterial cfu ml n immediate survival after uv disinfection cfu ml n0 bacterial number before uv disinfection cfu ml this concept illustrates the rate of photoreactivated bacteria among the uv injured bacteria 2 8 conjugation transfer experiment the donor strain in the conjugation transfer assay was e coli chs56 contained plasmid rp4 encoding a high level of resistance to ampicillin 100 mg l and gentamicin 50 mg l which was michael hynes gift http n2t net addgene 79813 the recipient strain is pseudomonas sp isolated from wwtp had high levels of kanamycin resistance 50 mg l and tetracycline resistance 25 mg l furthermore the bacteria of the recipient strain was unable to grow on the plate containing ampicillin 100 mg l and gentamicin 50 mg l by drug sensitivity test the donor cells were mixed with the recipient cells in a

and arb reduction by disinfection in wwtps secondary treatment effluent before disinfection and final effluent samples after disinfection were collected from two hospital and two municipal wwtps fig 1 a showed the args relative abundance to 16s rrna gene in which aminoglycoside resistance genes aac 6 ib 01 aac 6 ib 02 aada 01 aada1 aada2 01 aada5 01 and strb sulphonamide sul2 and tetracycline resistance genes tetm and tetx had high abundance the relative abundance to 16s rrna 10 3 for all samples generally the hospital wastewater had more types of resistance and higher abundance than those in municipal wwtps p 0 05 fortwo hospital the relative abundance of several resistance genes increased after disinfecting with sodium hypochlorite for example aac 6 ii in hosp1 enhanced 0 69 log and aacc2 aada 01 tetr and tetx in hosp2 increased from 0 22 log to 2 23 log for two municipal wwtps adopted uv disinfection most of the resistance genes abundance was decreased while some args increased but not significantly e g sul1 tet 34 tete and tets at the same time the relative abundance of bacterial community on genera level was also determined as shown in fig 1 b and fig s3 the bacterial community of two hospitals was far from each other and canonical correlation analysis cca suggested electrical conductivity ec and total organic carbon toc caused high abundance of thiothrix in hwtp1 whereas enterococcus pseudomonas and morganella in hwtp2 meanwhile the bacterial community composition of two municipalsewage treatment plants was similar and mainly affected by dissolved oxygen do wilcoxon rank sum test showed that hospital contained more bacteroides and morganella 0 01 p 0 05 and municipal wwtps contained more strains such as candidatus microthrix enterococcus and unclassified f blastocatellaceae 0 01 p 0 05 fig s4 furtherly the relative abundance of bacterial community on level of phylum was investigated fig s5 both disinfection processes caused a reduction in firmicutes however hypochlorite caused the relative abundance of proteobacteria increase while uv reduced it the above results showed disinfection did not cause drastic changes in the microbial community but adjusted the relative abundance of the genus the correlation analysis was constructed based on the relative abundance variables of args and arb of all samples before and after disinfection in wwtps the results showed that the abundance of args was high correlated with the number of arb in most cases during disinfection fig s6 further the co occurrence patterns between args and arb were investigated using network analysis r2 0 8 p 0 01 as shown in fig 1 c the network consisted of 62 nodes and 231 edges the modularity index was 0 611 indicating that it had a modular structure according to the modular category the entire network could be resolved into 7 main modules the modular category indicated that the decrease of args were associated with arb reduction upon disinfection in wastewater by the co occurrence analysis it showed that six bacterial genera might be the host of args for example bacteroides might be the host of the aminoglycoside resistance gene aacc2 and the tetracycline resistance genes tett tetr and tetx enterococcus carries an aminoglycoside resistance gene strb and a tetracycline resistance gene teta and tetb compared to the above genus morganella carries more args including aminoglycoside resistance genes aacc2 apha1 aka kanr and aade tetracycline tett tetr and tetb and sulfonamide resistance genes sul2 the results showed that the reduction of args and the removal of bacterial hosts were synchronous and consistent in the disinfection process of wwtps 3 2 low dose chlorine enhanced uv sterilization of arb and prevented photoreactivation to explore the effect of disinfection dosage and methods on arb abundance we investigated the inactivation of arb with uv and or chlorine disinfection as shown in fig 2 a the survival rate of bacteria was reduced with uv dose increasing when uv dose increased to 32 mj cm2 the bacterial survival was hardly to be detected compared to uv alone uv combined with low chlorine 1 mg l or 2 mg l disinfection achieved higher efficiency of bacterial inactivationsignificantly and the tolerance of morganella morganii was more than enterococcus faecalis with uv disinfection furthermore the inactivation effect of arb was analyzed underdifferent uv dosecombined with low dose chlorine as shown in fig s7 the cfu of arb was reduced in a dose and time dependent manner when uv combined with low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l contact time 20 to 80 s can significantly improve the inactivation rate of arb 0 8 1 4 log however when uv dose increased to 32 mj cm2 there was no difference in each group all of which achieved the lethal effect of bacteria fig s8 showed that more chlorine was consumed for uv chlorine under uv irradiation by measuring residual chlorine concentration these results indicated that the inactivation effect of uv combinated with a low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l resulted in synergistic inhibition on cell growth as shown in fig 2 b the survival rate of bacteria was reduced upon chlorine disinfection in a dose dependent manner the cfu of morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis were reduced by 3 72 and 4 89 log values at a chlorine dose of 60 mg min l respectively to observe the visible damage of the bacteria surface with uv and chlorine disinfection scanning electron microscopy performed in enterococcus faecalis and morganella morganii showed that the untreated arb had intact cell morphology and the cell surface was smooth and flat figs 2 c and f the surface structure of most bacteria was hardly damaged with uv treatment at a dosage of 32 mj cm2 suggesting uv was difficult to destroy the surface structure of bacteria and irreversible membrane damage requires a relatively high uv dose figs 2 d and g figs 2 e and h showed some holes and wrinkles appeared on the surface of the bacteria with chlorine treatment at a dosage of 100 mg min l indicating the main reason of microbial inactivation might be the irreversible destruction of bacterial surface structures uv disinfection couldn t kill bacteria completely some of them were resurrected by fluorescent light the resurrection of arb was increased upon fluorescent light in a time dependent manner with uv disinfection alone fig 2 i and table s4 however uv combined with chlorine disinfection showed that it is almost no light resurrection particularly under adding 2 mg l chlorine suggesting the synergisticeffect significantly inhibited the photoactivation of arb figs 2 j and k 3 3 low dose chlorine enhanced uv removal of args since uv chlorine combination disinfection has been shown to reduce arb synergistically the effect on args was worth examining as shown in fig 3 the copy number of args was reduced in a dose dependent manner but it was affected by the mode of disinfection and the type of args under uv disinfection alone at the dose of 320 mj cm2 the copy number of 16s rrna gene in morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis was decreased 0 40 log and 1 35 log respectively fig s9 and table s5 the copy number reduction of args was 0 58 1 60 log showing uv disinfection affected by the resistance type under chlorine disinfection alone at the dose of 320 mg min l the copy number of 16s rrna gene in morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis decreased 4 19 log and 3 99 log respectively fig s9 the copy number reduction of the args was 4 30 5 18 log fig 3 chlorine disinfection had a strong effect on removing args in comparison with uv meanwhile under uv disinfection combined with 2 mg l chlorine the reduction of the copy number of five genes improved 1 1 5 log with uv dose increasing significantly in particular at high uv dose 320 mj cm2 fig s10 moreover it worth noting the degradation degree of tetb gene in enterococcus faecalis was higher than that in morganella morganiiunder the same disinfectant and dose shown as figs 3 c and f p 0 05 thus the disinfection effect was related to the type of resistance and the characteristics of bacteria in addition the residual chlorine concentration measurements showed thatthe rate of chlorine consumption slowed down when the uv dose increased the decay rate of chlorine was also increased with uv irradiation fig s11 uv combined with low dose chlorine could enhance the degradation of args greatly by synergistic effect furthermore the correlation between args and 16s rrna gene revealed the potential mechanism in the process of args reduction table 1 the abundance of the 16s rrna gene reflected the number of microorganisms in water sample the analysis showed that args were positively correlated with 16s rrna gene r2 0 8 p 0 05 suggesting args were associated with reduced microbial populations however the removal rates of different genes varied greatly indicating the reduction of args was not only related to the decreasing of the number of strains but that uv or chlorine disinfection might destroy the structure of these genes and thus reduce their abundance zheng et al 2017 3 4 effect of uv and chlorine disinfection on horizontal gene transfer arb disinfection experiment showed that the disinfection process can significantly reduce copy numbers of arb however disinfection effluent from wwtps detected that some arb and args were tolerant to disinfectants these bacteria that were tolerant to disinfectants can survive and spread their resistance to other bacteria so it is necessary to investigate the effects of uv and chlorine disinfection upon hgt at non lethal doses using e coli containing rp4 plasmid as a donor and pseudomonas sp screened in wastewater as a receptor we constructed a hgt model and evaluated the frequency of conjugation transfer by low dosage of uv and chlorine through antibiotic screened plates as shown in fig 4 a the cfu of donor and recipient cells and the frequency of conjugate transfer was reduced upon uv treatment alone in a dose dependent manner when the uv dose was greater than 4 mj cm2 the conjugation transfer could not be observed by colony counting however a different phenomenon was appeared with chloride disinfection alone fig 4 b the frequency of conjugate transfer reached the maximum upon chloride treatment alone at dose of 0 5 mg l and then the cfu of donor and recipient cells was decreased in a dose dependent manner whereas the conjugation transfer phenomenon was not observed any more at the dose of 4 mg l and above moreover the conjugative transfer frequency was further decreased with the uv combination with low dose chloride disinfection figs 4 c and d these results showed that the advanced oxidation of uv combined with low dose chlorine effectively inhibited the horizontal transfer of rp4 plasmid than uv and chlorine disinfection alone to explore the potential mechanism of conjugation transfer frequency declination with disinfection the bacterial conjugation transfer experiments were carried out in proportion to the number of donors and recipients when the number of donors and recipients was 105 the frequency of conjugation remained around 10 4 however the frequency of conjugation rapidly decreased and the conjugation was hardly observed when the number of cells was 104 fig s12 the frequency of conjugation was related to the concentration of bacteria in the conjugation system these data suggesting that the increase in disinfection dose leads to an increase in the death of bacteria thus reducing the frequency of conjugation furtherly the cell morphology of pseudomonas sp was observed by sem scanning electron microscope with 0 5 mg l chlorine for 30 min then overnight culture for 24 h in order to investigate the effect of low dose chlorine disinfection on the recipient bacteria the results showed that the extracellular secretion of pseudomonas sp was significantly increased compared to the untreated group which may be related to an increased frequency of conjugative transfer figs 4 e g the effect of 0 5 mg l chlorine treatment on vird4 virb5 and virb10 expression in pseudomonas sp was examined as shown in fig 4 h pseudomonas sp cells stimulated by 0 5 mg l chlorineincreased the expression of vird4 virb5 and virb10 at mrna levels indicating its ability to mediate plasmid dna conjugation enhanced p 0 05 whereas the mrna levels of these genes significantly decreased at dose of 4 mg l p 0 01 the mrna expression of vird4 virb5 and virb10 were gradually downregulated with the increase of uv dose fig 4 i this might be related to the direct action of uv disinfection on dna molecules and the inhibition of gene transcription 4 discussion disinfection plays an important role in removal of args and may serve as a barrier to limit the spread of arb and args yoon et al 2017 the results of this study showed that the type of args by chlorine disinfection was basically unchanged for hospital wastewater whereas the abundance was significantly decreased however some individual genes such as aac 6 ib aada 01 aada2 01 and aada5 01 etc still had a high relative abundance in the final effluent these result was consistent with that of chlorination in the treatment of drinking water of hu s study chlorine treatment showed no significant effect on the reduction of args with a 0 4 log increased in the total args but promoted the propagation of several arg subtypes by large amounts sul1 ermc 1 1 log hu et al 2019 although uv disinfection showed a good removal effect in municipal wwtps many resistance genes were still detected in the final effluent it was observed by zhang s study that uv disinfection dramatically changes the bacterial community structure and antibiotic resistance in wastewater the proportion of gram positive bacteria gradually increases as the uv dosage increases zhang et al 2019b however our results showed that the bacterial community hardly changed with uv disinfection since certain specific microbial populations carry certain specific args the corresponding arg and coexisting microbial taxa have a significantly similar abundance trend in different environments li et al 2015 according to our network analysis 8 genera were thought to be the main potential hosts of args including mycobacterium ferruginibacter thermomonas morganella enterococcus bacteroides myroides and romboutsia morganella morganii belong to the classification of enterobacteriaceae which usually carries sul2 and aada pu et al 2018 trobos et al 2009 which were similar to our findings in order to further determine the coexistence between args and bacterial communities this study isolated and identified morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis and identified their arg subtypes morganella morganii was the host of tetracycline resistance genes tetb sulfonamide resistance gene sul2 and aminoglycoside resistance gene aacc2 like morganella morganii enterococcus faecalis also took along tetracycline resistance genes teta and tetb and aminoglycoside resistance gene strb high consistency of the result suggested that network analysis was a new insight that can provide us information about arg and its possible hosts many disinfection studies focus on setting disinfectant concentration and exposure time up to microbiological standard for wastewater and drinking water treatment wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b however disinfection may induce microorganisms to enter a state of survival that can t be cultured which still retains metabolic activity and physiological toxicity guo and kong 2019 therefore most current studies may underestimate the tolerance of microorganisms to disinfectants and the risk of pathogens in water our study found that uv disinfection did not completely kill morganella morganii and enterococcus faecalis at dose of 32mj cm2 in particular the reactivation rate of morganella reached 2 55 after 24 h and even reached 10 39 after 72 h the resurrection rate means the number of morganella morganii reached 108 cfu ml uv was directly absorbed by nucleic acids thereby destroying the dna of microorganisms lee et al 2015 that was to say uv light can penetrate a relatively transparent structure as a cell wall and directly destroy the dna of the microorganism thereby causing the formation of a pyrimidine dimer mckinney and pruden 2012 however dna photolyase can specifically bind to dna containing pyrimidine dimer generate electron transfer under illumination cleave pyrimidine dimer restore dna double helix structure and make sublethal bacteria resuscitation after uv disinfection lee et al 2015 xu et al 2018 in this study uv combine with chlorine 2 mg l disinfection significantly inhibited the photoactivation of arb chlorine and free radicals first react with the cell wall of the bacteria causing perforation or rupture of the cell wall before entering the cytoplasm and reacting with dna dodd 2012 ersoy et al 2019 sharma et al 2016 therefore chlorine and uv chlorine disinfection were not reversible a large number of studies had shown that sewage treatment plants discharge was rich in resistance genes and the common uv or chlorine disinfection dosage failed to remove args liu et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in this study gram positive bacteria enterococcus faecalis and gram negative bacteria morganella morganii were treated with uv alone or uv combined chlorine 1 2 mg l respectively the results showed that the removal effect of chlorine was significantly increased in dose dependent manner compared to uv disinfection and the removal effect of uv chlorine was further enhanced than uv alone for chlorine or uv it can be observed that the dosage of bacterial cell inactivation was lower than the dosage required to reduce the arg copy number stange et al stange et al 2019 found that uv exposure dosage of 60 mj cm2 resulted in a 4 8 5 5 log reduction in the number of bacteria but a decrease in args 0 1 0 log was negligible our results were consistent with their research when uv dosage alone was 40 mj cm2 the args were reduced by 0 15 0 38 log at a same dose of uv 40 mj cm2 adding 2 mg l chlorine into the reaction system the args were decreased by 0 41 0 94 log uv chlorine can effectively improve the removal of arg meanwhile effectively killing bacteria on one hand hypochlorous acid hocl was formed when sodium hypochlorite was added to water proteins and peptidoglycans bound to the cell wall and cell membrane were the initial point of attack for chlorine disinfection dodd 2012 after cell membrane damage hocl can penetrate the cell wall and reach the cytoplasm and then react with the base where thymidine deoxyguanosine and uridine monophosphate were the first targets on the other hand uv light easily penetrates the bacterial cell membrane and the relatively transparent structure in the cytoplasm and can directly act on dna causing adjacent pyrimidine molecules in the dna to form pyrimidine dimers causing dna double strand breaks to cause bacterial inactivation zheng et al 2017 through the detection of residual chlorine we found that the consumption of chlorine was accelerated in the uv chlorine disinfection process according to dong and zhang et al s studies dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a oh and rcs cl clo cl2 etc radicals were produced during the uv chlorine process therefore rcs free radicals might play an important role in target gene removal this study showed that rcs as a selective oxidizing free radical had more opportunities to react with target genes than to be consumed by other components of arb cells instead the oh free radical was consumed preferentially by other cell components rattanakul and oguma 2017 zhang et al 2019a thus these two methods support each other when attacking dna yoon yoon et al 2017 reported considerably higher dosages of uv 100 130 mj cm2 achieved significant arg removal 4 log the args reduction in this experiment did not reach 2 log at the maximum dosage the most likely reason was that unlike the disinfection of e coli the bacteria isolated in the environment were more tolerant to uv few people pay attention to the effects of low dose disinfectants on bacteria liu s study liu et al 2019 mentioned that bacteria exposed to uv at low dose can regain their metastatic ability after reactivation either by dark repair or photoactivation in fact the effects of low dose disinfectants were not limited to these by changing the permeability of cell membranes and increasing the ability of bacteria to take up dna or plasmids in vitro arg was involved in horizontal gene transfer between microbial populations guo s study found that low uv dosages 8 mj cm2 had little effect on the frequency of conjugate transfer and uv exposure only reduced the number of bacteria without altering cell permeability guo et al 2015 our study found that uv reduced conjugation transfer of rp4 at low dose 0 5 4 mj cm2 when uv was higher than 8 mj cm2 conjugation transfer does not occur the possible reason for the different results was that in our study the recipient cells were not e coli but pseudomonas isolated in the environment in addition we have found that low dose chlorine enhance the conjugation transfer frequency scanning electron microscopy showed that low dose chlorine 0 5 mg l could stimulate the increase of extracellular proteins of pseudomonas and qpcr confirmed that the mrna expression of t4ss proteins vir4d vir5b and vir10b were significantly increased lin s study lin et al 2016 found that uv irradiation 5 20 mj cm2 and low dose chlorine 0 3 0 5 mg l treatment 6h 48 h reduced the frequency of conjugate transfer however it was found that after the treatment of 0 1 0 25 mg l chlorine for 24 h the conjugation transfer frequency increased was also observed in our study uv inhibited rp4 plasmid conjugation transfer while low levels of chlorine have the risk of increasing horizontal gene transfer when uv dosage was higher than 4 mj cm2 combined with 1 2 mg l chlorine treatment of bacteria no transconjugants was detected therefore uv chlorine can significantly control the risk of hgt showing more advantages than direct uv or chlorine alone 5 conclusion in this study the removal of args and their possible hosts were synchronous and consistent in wwtps enterococcus faecalis strb teta and tetb and morganella morganii aacc2 sul2 and tetb were isolated from wwtps effluent offering strain models to understand themechanism of args and arb removal during uv chlorine and uv chlorine processes photoreactivation of bacteria was occurred frequently after disinfection by uv alone while it was bare occurred after uv chlorine inactivation although the arb were easily inactivated by these three disinfection processes the args were relatively difficult to remove uv dosage at 320 mj cm2 args achieved 0 58 1 60 log removal and uv chlorine 2 mg l enhanced 1 1 5 log removal the synergistic effect of low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l combined with uv disinfection effectively improved arb and args removal besides the advantage of uv chlorine on inhibiting horizontal gene transfer was also verified in this work these findings may serve as valuable implications for assessing and controlling the

17638,ozonation of secondary wastewater treatment plant effluent for the abatement of organic micropollutants requires an accurate process control which can be based on monitoring ozone induced changes in dissolved organic matter dom this study presents a novel automated analytical system for monitoring changes in the electron donating capacity edc and uv absorbance of dom during ozonation in a first step a quantitative photometric edc assay was developed based on electron transfer reactions from phenolic moieties in dom to an added chemical oxidant the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts the assay is highly sensitive limit of quantification 0 5 mgdoc l 1 and edc values of model dom isolates determined by this assay were in good agreement with values determined previously by mediated electrochemical oxidation slope 1 01 0 07 r 2 0 98 in a second step the photometric edc measurement method was transferred onto an automated fluidic system coupled to a photometer edc analyzer the edc analyzer was then used to monitor changes in edc and uv absorbance of secondary wastewater effluent treated with ozone while both parameters exhibited a dose dependent decrease a more pronounced decrease in edc as compared to uv absorbance was observed at specific ozone doses up to 0 4 mgo 3 gdoc 1 the concentration of 17α ethinylestradiol a phenolic micropollutant with a high ozone reactivity decreased proportionally to the edc decrease in contrast abatement of less ozone reactive micropollutants and bromate formation started only after a pronounced initial decrease in edc the on line edc analyzer presented herein will enable a comprehensive assessment of the combination of edc and uv absorbance as control parameters for full scale ozonation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords secondary treated wastewater ozonation micropollutant abatement electron donating capacity uv absorbance abbreviations a λ absorption

oxidation suvaλ specific uv absorbance at the wavelength λ wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction ozonation of secondary wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents combined with biological post treatment is a widely recognized strategy for abating a broad range of organic micropollutants of environmental concern eggen et al 2014 oulton et al 2010 patel et al 2019 prasse et al 2015 von gunten 2018 a number of comprehensive tests in pilot gerrity et al 2011 huber et al 2005 knopp et al 2016 snyder et al 2006 ternes et al 2003 and full scale treatment systems bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 have demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of ozonation for decreasing the load of organic micropollutants discharged into surface waters numerous wastewater treatment plants wwtps in europe are therefore upgrading their treatment trains to include full scale ozonation systems vsa 2020 however a key challenge for the operation of these systems remains the real time control of the ozone dosage to simultaneously meet the treatment objectives and water quality requirements treatment objectives of ozonation are the abatement of selected indicator substances for example regulatory frameworks of authorities in switzerland federal office for the environment 2018 and california california environmental protection agency 2018 define abatement targets for specific indicator substances the treatment objectives specified by the swiss federal office for the environment demand an average abatement of 80 for a suite of indicator substances from raw wastewater to wwtp effluent which requires the application of minimum specific ozone doses bourgin et al 2018 at the same time water quality requirements limit the upper value for ozone exposures i e co3 dt due to the formation of undesired oxidation by products which are not degraded during biological post treatment hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 in particular high ozone exposures in bromide containing waters lead to the undesired formation of bromate a regulated potentially carcinogenic compound soltermann et al 2016 soltermann et al 2017 von gunten and hoigné 1994 furthermore energy demand for ozone production also incentivizes lower ozone doses katsoyiannis et al 2011 to balance these treatment objectives and water quality requirements an accurate real time determination of the optimal ozone dose based on robust control parameters is critical in drinking water treatment oxidant exposures have been applied successfully as control parameters kaiser et al 2013 during ozonation organic micropollutants may either be transformed by ozone or hydroxyl radicals which are transiently formed by reactions of ozone with the water matrix buffle et al 2006a the rate at which individual organic micropollutants are transformed is therefore a function of i the second order rate constants of the reactions of the micropollutants with ozone and hydroxyl radical and ii the ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures i e co3 dt and c oh dt buffle et al 2006b while ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures can be determined on line during drinking water ozonation kaiser et al 2013 technical limitations of current analytical instrumentation prohibits quantifying the same parameters during ozonation of secondary wwtp effluents due to fast ozone depletion buffle et al 2006b to circumvent this obstacle in wastewater treatment surrogate parameters associated with readily observable changes in the properties of dissolved organic matter dom have been suggested as control parameters for ozonation in this context ozone induced transformations of chromophoric moieties in dom buffle et al 2006a wenk et al 2013 have received a lot of attention ozone induced decreases in absorbance at 254 nm were found to correlate with the abatement of different classes of organic micropollutants bahr et al 2007 nanaboina and korshin 2010 wert et al 2009 wittmer et al 2015 and viruses wolf et al 2019 therefore the relative decrease in uv absorbance allows to assess micropollutant abatement on line and is considered a suitable control parameter for full scale ozonation gerrity et al 2012 park et al 2017 pisarenko et al 2012 stapf et al 2016 wittmer et al 2015 recently empirical models were proposed that additionally incorporate changes in total dom fluorescence to improve previous process control systems chys et al 2017 gamage et al 2013 park et al 2017 however absorbance values measured at 254 nm primarily predict the content of aromatic carbon in dom weishaar et al 2003 and thus only provide limited information on the ozone reactivity of dom therefore the application of an additional complementary control parameter based on decreases in the content of ozone reactive dom moieties would provide a more robust process control system based on two independent parameters a promising complementary approach is the quantification of the electron donating capacity edc of dom which provides a measure for the phenol content of dom aeschbacher et al 2010 the edc is operationally defined as the number of electrons transferred from electron donating moieties in dom to a chemical oxidant at a defined reduction potential e h and ph within a certain reaction time previous studies used the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulphonate abts as chemical oxidant aeschbacher et al 2012 chon et al 2015 walpen et al 2016 because i abts is reversibly reduced in a ph independent one electron transfer and ii the standard reduction potential of the redox couple abts abts e h 0 0 68 v scott et al 1993 is sufficiently high to allow for the oxidation of phenolic moieties in dom ozonation of dom samples including model dom isolates surface water and wwtp effluents resulted in decreasing edc values with increasing specific ozone doses önnby et al 2018b wenk et al 2013 consistent with the ozone induced transformation of phenolic dom moieties forming e g quinones and ring cleavage products via the criegee mechanism ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 recently the potential application of changes in edc as control parameter for ozonation was demonstrated in laboratory experiments chon et al 2015 wastewater effluent samples which were exposed to increasing ozone doses exhibited pronounced dose dependent decreases in edc which correlated with the abatement of selected organic micropollutants with different ozone reactivities taken together these findings warrant further investigations on the applicability of edc as control parameter for ozonation however these existing methods are not suited for such an application edc values have previously been determined by mediated electrochemical oxidation meo aeschbacher et al 2010 subsequent development of analytical methods based on size exclusion chromatography coupled to a post column reaction with abts chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018b and flow injection analysis önnby et al 2018b walpen et al 2016 significantly enhanced the sensitivity for edc quantification a requirement for analyzing solutions with low dom contents while these analytical methods already introduced some degree of automation i e automatic sample injection they were not designed for a continual long term process monitoring the primary reasons prohibiting the application of these methods for long term monitoring are i the long delay times from sampling to obtaining edc values ii the requirement of advanced chromatographic or electrochemical instrumentation resulting in high investment costs and frequent maintenance and iii high reagent consumption rates recently a simple field deployable photometric edc method was presented yuan et al 2019 even though the method was not automated the study demonstrated the potential for on site photometric edc measurements of dom in natural and engineered systems the objective of this study was to develop an automated edc analyzer for monitoring relative changes in edc and the uv absorbance of dom during ozonation of secondary wwtp effluents to this end a photometric edc assay was developed by adapting existing edc methods and comprehensively validated in a subsequent step this method was implemented on an automated fluidic system the edc analyzer in a third step the performance of the edc analyzer was assessed by measuring changes in edc of a secondary wwtp effluent during ozonation and the resulting decreases in edc were compared to changes in uv absorbance and the abatement of selected organic micropollutants in a fourth and final step the applicability of the combination of edc and uv absorbance as control parameters for ozonation was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

details on the treatment processes are provided in section s1 2 and fig s1 si the wastewater samples were collected from three different points in the treatment process i the ozonation reactor influent ii the ozonation reactor effluent and iii the sand filter effluent to approximately collect the same wastewater parcel in all three locations the sampling times for sample ii and iii

continuously sparging the ozone containing gas through water cooled on ice bader and hoigné 1981 the dissolved ozone concentration in the ozone stock solution was determined photometrically from 5 fold diluted acidified aliquots 40 mm phosphoric acid using a molar absorption coefficient of ε 260 nm 3 200 m 1cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 chap 2 5 2 5 ozonation of secondary wwtp effluent containing micropollutants increasing doses of ozone were added to the ozonation reactor influent sample to i demonstrate the analytical performance of the edc analyzer with a real secondary wwtp effluent and ii to assess the predictive power of relative changes in edc and uv for micropollutant abetment for this purpose three micropollutants 17α ethinylestradiol bezafibrate and atrazine were each added to a separate aliquot of the filtered secondary wwtp effluent the starting concentration of each micropollutant was 1 0 05 µm while this concentration is higher than the concentrations typically observed for these compounds in secondary wwtp effluents the relative abatement of these compounds was shown to be independent of the initial micropollutant concentration as long as the added micropollutants do not significantly affect the ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures zimmermann et al 2011 at this starting concentration each micropollutant only contributed slightly to the scavenging of ozone 3 or hydroxyl radicals 6 by the sample matrix see section s1 5 si for the estimation of the scavenging contribution these micropollutants were selected to span a wide range of reactivities towards ozone table s2 si a fourth aliquot was prepared to which no micropollutants were added subsequently ozone stock solution was added to the four aliquots of the secondary wwtp effluent at increasing specific ozone doses 0 0 9 mgo3 mgdoc 1 at a temperature of 23 1 c under stirring these ozonated samples were then stored at room temperature for 24 h to guarantee full ozone depletion before analysis edc uv absorbance as well as bromide and bromate concentrations were quantified in the micropollutant free aliquot to avoid potential interferences from the presence of added micropollutants accounting for the volume of the added micropollutant and ozone containing solutions the doc concentration of this secondary wwtp effluent was diluted to 5 5 mgdoc l 1 for these laboratory ozonation experiments and was assumed to remain constant during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 2 6 quantification of edc values of dom samples to quantify the edc of dom sample solutions we developed and validated a photometric edc assay and subsequently implemented this assay on an automated fluidic system the edc analyzer the reagent and buffer solutions as well as the detailed experimental procedure for the edc assay and edc analyzer are described in the following paragraphs 2 6 1 reagent and ph buffer solutions for the edc assay and analyzer for both the edc assay and edc analyzer an abts and a chlorine containing solution and a ph buffer solution were prepared weekly and stored at room temperature protected from light the abts containing solution was made by dissolving abts 1 mm final concentration in dilute sulfuric acid 7 5 mm ph 2 0 the chlorine containing solution 1 mm final concentration was prepared by diluting a concentrated hypochlorite stock solution in water chlorine concentrations were determined photometrically from alkaline aliquots ph 11 using the molar absorption coefficient of hypochlorite ε 292 nm 359 m 1cm 1 wang et al 2012 the stability of the chlorine and abts stock solutions was confirmed photometrically data not shown the ph buffer solution contained 500 mm of phosphate and resulted in a ph of 7 0 in the final reaction mixture of the edc assay and analyzer 2 6 2 experimental procedure of the edc assay the edc assay was adapted from existing photometric methods for quantifying edc values of dom walpen et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 for the edc assay presented in this study fig 1 a the abts reagent solution was first prepared in bulk by adding 350 µl of chlorine solution 1 mm per milliliter of abts solution 1 mm which oxidized nominally 70 of the abts to abts i e c abt s c abt s c abts 70 second the uv absorbance of an undiluted dom sample was measured at 254 nm as described above third 2500 µl of a dom sample see section 3 1 5 for the final doc concentration or dom free blank solution and 160 µl of ph buffer solution were added to a disposable cuvette with a 10 mm pathlength 4 5 ml poly methyl methacrylate brand germany subsequently 540 µl of abts reagent solution was added to the buffered sample solution fourth the resulting absorbance at 728 nm was measured on a spectrophotometer after a reaction time of 15 min unless stated otherwise see section 3 1 2 for a discussion on the reaction time 2 6 3 edc analyzer to automate liquid handling and absorbance measurements of the edc assay we developed a fluidic system coupled to a photometer fig 1 b the fluidic system consisted of a syringe pump level 3 cadent 3 imi precision switzerland equipped with a single 2 5 ml zero dead volume syringe and a 12 way rotary selection valve imi precision switzerland as well as two mixing chambers which were connected to the selection valve both mixing chambers were built from vertically aligned 2 5 ml pipette tips amornthammarong et al 2010 the detector was a double wavelength led photometer mikron 31 runge germany with a 10 mm pathlength and two led light source modules that emitted at wavelengths of 255 and 730 nm respectively the fixed wavelength of the led modules led to a minor shift in the detection wavelength compared to the edc assay and no correction was made for the molar absorption coefficient the edc analyzer was programmed to replicate the four experimental steps of the edc assay in a measurement cycle fig 1 b during which one dom free blank and two dom containing samples were analyzed this allows to determine the relative change in edc and uv absorbance during ozonation i e analysis of a dom sample from i the ozonation reactor influent and ii from the ozonation reactor effluent a measurement cycle consisted of the following steps first the abts reagent solution was prepared by sequentially aspirating chlorine and abts containing solutions into the syringe the resulting solution was then cycled five times from the syringe to the first mixing chamber and back the mixing chamber was filled from the top and emptied from the bottom resulting in an inversion of the syringe content allowing for an efficient mixing amornthammarong et al 2010 after a total of five mixing cycles the entire abts reagent solution was dispensed again to the mixing chamber for temporary storage second the dom free blank solution was aspirated into the syringe and a fraction of this blank solution was dispensed to the photometer to zero the absorbance signals at both wavelengths third buffer solution and an aliquot of the abts reagent solution stored in the first mixing chamber were additionally aspirated into the syringe which still contained dom free blank solution the syringe content was then cycled to and from the second mixing chamber fourth the resulting mixture was passed through the photometer to measure the absorbance at 730 nm after a reaction time of 15 min subsequently the steps two to four were repeated for the two dom containing samples to complete one measurement cycle however instead of zeroing the absorbance signal during the second step the absorbance of the dom samples was measured at 255 nm the edc analyzer was controlled with a computer through an rs 232 communication line serial commands and system status were automatically sent and received respectively using a script written in python version 3 7 van rossum and drake 1995 an additional python script was used for data acquisition from the photometer both python scripts are available at https github com walpen edc analyzer 2 6 4 calculation of edc from absorbance values the edc of a dom sample i e the number of electrons transferred from dom to abts was calculated based on the reductive loss of abts in the reaction mixtures we confirmed that abts was primarily lost through reduction to abts by dom in one electron transfer reactions using srfa as model dom see section s1 6 si abts concentrations were quantified based on measured absorbances at 728 or 730 nm using the molar absorption coefficient ε 728 nm ph 7 14 000 m 1cm 1 walpen et al 2016 to calculate the edc the residual abts concentration in the reaction mixture containing dom was compared to that of a reaction mixture containing only the dom free blank i e ultrapure water and normalized to the doc concentration of the sample in the reaction mixture eq 1 1 edc a blank a samp le l ε abts 1 c doc where ablank and asample are the resulting absorbance values λ 728 or 730 nm of the reaction

concentration in the final reaction mixture for samples analyzed in replicates at increasing doc concentrations linear regression models were fitted to the measured residual abts concentration versus the corresponding doc concentration the absolute value of slopes of the fitted models represented the edc values eq 2 2 c abts samp le edc c doc c abts blank 2 7 quantification of micropollutants

bromate in secondary wwtp effluent samples were measured on an ion chromatograph ics 3000 dionex usa equipped with an ion exchange column as9 hc dionex usa with an isocratic eluent containing sodium

quantified via a post column reaction with iodide forming triiodide which was detected by a second absorbance measurement at 352 nm loq 2 µg l 1 rsd 10 salhi and von gunten 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 development and validation of the edc assay 3 1 1 effect of ph on the oxidation of abts by chlorine the rate of oxidation of abts to abts by chlorine decreases with increasing ph pinkernell et al 2000 because a fast complete and reproducible preparation of abts is critical for both methods presented herein the edc assay and the edc analyzer the kinetics and the stoichiometry of the formation of abts was assessed photometrically in the ph range from 1 to 4 at a ph of 1 5 and 2 0 the reaction was completed within one minute fig s4 si and the formed abts subsequently remained stable for at least one hour fig s5 si at ph values 2 0 the reaction was slower and incomplete fig s4 si at ph 1 0 the reaction was fast but incomplete presumably due a side reaction involving cl2 deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore abts reagent solutions for all subsequent analyses were prepared by adding chlorine solution to an abts solution acidified with sulfuric acid resulting in a ph of 2 0 in the abts reagent solution 3 1 2 reaction time of the edc assay to determine a suitable reaction time for the edc assay the evolution of the abts concentration in edc assay reaction mixtures with srfa as a model dom was assessed for this purpose the same volume of abts reagent solution was added to a set of srfa containing solutions with increasing doc concentrations and subsequently the resulting change in absorbance at 728 nm was measured over the course of 30 min the absorption coefficient and hence the abts concentration of the dom free reaction mixture i e cdoc 0 mgdoc l 1 decreased slightly by 2 7 during the experiment fig 2 a consistent with the previously observed instability of abts at neutral ph conditions e g cano et al 1998 compared to this dom free reaction mixture the decrease in abts concentration of the reaction mixture containing srfa was more pronounced and bi phasic the abts concentration first decreased in an exponential and subsequently after approximately 15 min in a more linear fashion for every time point the abts concentration correlated linearly with the doc concentration shown for t 15 min inset of fig 2 b according to eq 2 the absolute values of the slopes of these linear regression models represent the loss in abts concentration per doc concentration and therefore the edc the edc increased rapidly up to approximately 15 min and subsequently continued to increase at a lower rate fig 2 b however no plateau was reached even for longer reaction times of up to 120 min data not shown this finding may be attributed to a presumably wide range of reactivities of electron donating moieties in dom towards abts in addition oxidation of phenolic moieties forms phenoxyl radicals these radical species can form coupling products which may also donate electrons to abts hotta et al 2002 hotta et al 2001 as a consequence a constant value may only be reached after much longer reaction times because of this lack of an obvious end point an arbitrary time point of t 15 min was selected for the quantification of edc values for all subsequent analyses this operationally defined reaction time of 15 min encompasses the rapid changes in abts concentration during the first phase mentioned above in addition edc values obtained for a set of model dom isolate using the edc assay with a 15 minute reaction time were in good quantitative agreement see section 3 1 6 to previously published edc values quantified by meo where an electrochemical equilibrium was reached within approximately 60 min aeschbacher et al 2012 3 1 3 interferences from selected dissolved inorganic species potential interferences of four inorganic species at concentrations relevant for wastewater on the resulting abts concentration in the edc assay were tested manganese ii 0 110 µg l 1 iodide 0 125 µg l 1 bromide 0 800 µg l 1 and nitrite 0 4 6 mg l 1 i e 0 1 4 mg n l 1 among these inorganic species and in the absence of dom only iodide affected the abts concentration fig s6 si iodide had an edc value of 0 5 0 2 mol moliodide 1 after a reaction time of 15 min suggesting a reduction of abts by iodide however for dom samples with doc concentrations expected in the context of ozonation of secondary wwtp effluents i e 3 10 mgdoc l 1 the contribution of iodide to the measured total edc would be negligible compared to the contribution of dom for example for an srfa solution of 3 mgdoc l 1 edcsrfa 5 14 mmole gc 1 a concentration of 125 µg l 1 iodide would increase the edc of this srfa solution by only 4 in contrast manganese ii and nitrite did not react with abts in the absence of srfa fig s6 si however in the presence of srfa increasing manganese ii and nitrite concentrations resulted in increasing edc values of srfa fig s7 si at the highest concentrations tested i e at 110 µg l 1 manganese ii and 4 6 mg l 1 nitrite the measured edc values of srfa in the presence of these ions were elevated by 6 and 3 respectively as compared to the edc measured for srfa without these ions iodide and bromide did not exhibit such effects taken together these four investigated inorganic species will have a negligible effect on the edc quantification if present below the tested concentrations we note that iron ii associated with organic matter is oxidized in a one electron transfer by abts and therefore contributes to the measured edc by 1 mole moliron ii lau et al 2015 in cases where iron ii is expected to be present in significant amounts e g dom sampled from anoxic environments the contribution of iron ii to the edc may be accounted for by separately quantifying the iron ii concentrations in sample aliquots in secondary wwtp effluents iron ii is not expected to reach significant concentrations due to preceding oxic treatments 3 1 4 effects of the reduction potential eh and initial abts concentration on the measured edc the effects of the apparent reduction potential e h and the initial abts concentration on the measured edc were systematically assessed in a series of edc assays using srfa as a model dom the e h in the reaction mixtures is governed by the abts abts concentration ratio according to the nernst equation e g schwarzenbach et al 2003 chap 14 to assess the dependency of the measured edc on the initial e h a series of edc assays of srfa with identical concentrations of abts but increasing concentrations of abts were conducted the calculated initial e h values of these solutions ranged from 643 mv to 730 mv see table s3 si all reaction mixtures containing dom free blanks had similar residual abts concentrations after a reaction time of 15 min 78 2 1 2 µm n 8 mean standard deviation fig s8a si however the edc of srfa determined in these reaction mixtures increased from 3 15 mmole gc 1 at an initial e h of 643 mv to 5 48 mmole gc 1 at an initial e h of 730 mv fig s8b si we attribute this effect to the broad distribution of apparent standard reduction potentials of phenolic or other electron donating moieties present in dom aeschbacher et al 2012 and the resulting increasing thermodynamic feasibility or faster kinetics of the oxidation of these moieties by abts with increasing e h these findings are consistent with a previous study in which the edc of dom quantified by mediated electrochemical oxidation increased with increasing e h applied to the working electrode of the electrochemical analysis cell aeschbacher et al 2012 to test the effect of the initial abts concentration edc assay reaction mixtures containing srfa cdoc 0 4 mgdoc l 1 and increasing initial abts concentrations 35 140 µm were prepared the abts abts concentration ratio was kept constant to maintain the same e h in these reaction mixtures the residual abts concentration of the reaction mixtures containing dom free blanks ranged from 33 µm to 126 µm after a reaction time of 15 min fig s9a si the edc of srfa significantly increased with increasing initial abts concentration from 4 1 0 25 mmole gc 1 initial abts concentration 33 µm to 5 41 0 03 mmole gc 1 initial abts concentration 126 µm fig s9b si highlighting the importance of an accurate preparation of the abts reagent solution overall these findings suggest that the initial e h and abts concentration of the reagent solution have strong effects on the reaction kinetics or thermodynamics of the reduction of abts by electron donating moieties in dom to obtain reproducible edc values initial abts concentrations have to be controlled accurately and changes in e h over the course of the reaction should be minimized similar to a previous study walpen et al 2016 we selected an initial e h of 0 71 v for the edc assay because this e h is slightly above the standard reduction potential e h 0 of the redox couple abts abts i e e h 0 0 68 v scott et al 1993 thereby ensuring only small decreases in e h over the course of the reaction i e decreases in the abts abts concentration ratio lead to smallest e h decreases around the e h 0 a concentration of 87 5 µm was selected as initial abts concentration which yielded an absorption coefficient of 1 23 cm 1 at 728 nm 3 1 5 working range of the edc assay to assess the doc concentration range that can be applied in the edc assay the upper limit of the working range and the limit of quantification loq were determined for two model dom isolates nlfa and plfa these isolates were selected because their edc values were previously found to be high and low respectively compared to edc values of other isolates as expected increasing doc concentrations of both nlfa and plfa resulted in decreasing absorption coefficients at 728 nm and thus decreasing abts concentrations fig 3 a the measured decreases followed linear trends at low doc concentrations but deviated from linearity at higher doc concentrations towards higher abts concentrations this deviation likely resulted from decreases in e h over the course of the reactions which become more pronounced as the reacting doc concentrations increased see discussion above to determine the upper limit of the linear range for nlfa and plfa we fitted linear regression models to the corresponding abts concentrations fig 3 a and sequentially removed data points with the highest doc concentration until the r 2 value of the model rose above a predefined threshold of 0 995 the upper limits of the linear ranges i e the largest doc concentrations of the models to first fulfill this condition solid lines in fig 3 a were 3 1 and 7 8 mgdoc l 1 for nlfa or plfa respectively the limit of quantification loq a blank 10 σ a blank currie 1999 corresponded to a doc concentration of 0 11 and 0 44 mgdoc l 1 for nlfa and plfa respectively loq values are similar to those determined for the recently published methods for edc quantification based on size exclusion chromatography and flow injection analysis önnby et al 2018b walpen et al 2016 both of these methods were previously used to quantify the change in edc of real wastewater samples upon chemical oxidation with chlorine and ozone taken together we recommend diluting dom sample solutions to doc concentrations between 0 5 and 3 0 mgdoc l 1 in the final reaction mixtures for routine analysis with the edc assay 3 1 6 comparison of the edc assay and meo to compare results obtained by the edc assay to previously published values determined by meo aeschbacher et al 2012 six model dom isolates were analyzed for every isolate a series of reaction mixtures containing increasing doc concentrations n 3 was prepared and linear regression models were fitted to the residual abts concentrations versus doc concentration fig s10 si overall the resulting edc values fig 3 b closely matched the edc values obtained for the same isolates determined by meo slope 1 01 0 07 intercept 0 1 0 4 r 2 0 98 3 2 development and validation of the edc analyzer 3 2 1 edc quantification of a srfa solution an edc analyzer was developed to automate liquid handling and absorbance measurements using a combined valve and syringe pump system exemplary absorbance traces λ1 255 nm λ2 730 nm over the course of one measurement cycle for the analysis of srfa are shown in fig s11 si the uv absorption coefficient a 255nm of the tested srfa solution was 0 181 0 001 cm 1 n 2 normalizing this value by the doc concentration yielded a specific uv absorbance suva255 of 4 63 0 02 l mgdoc m 1 which is in good agreement with a previously determined value of 4 4 l mgdoc m 1 walpen et al 2016 as expected from the edc assay the addition of the abts reagent to the srfa solution resulted in a lower absorbance at 730 nm after a reaction time of 15 min compared to the dom free blank sample this is caused by the electron transfer reactions from dom to abts the decrease in the absorption coefficient of 0 1686 0 0005 cm 1 n 2 corresponded to a loss of 12 05 0 04 µm abts normalizing this loss in abts concentration by the doc concentration yielded an edc value of 4 8 0 2 mmole gc 1 which is only slightly smaller than the value obtained from the edc assay i e 5 1 0 1 mmole gc 1 a possible explanation for this small deviation as well as a systematic comparison of this value to previously published values to validate the edc analyzer is provided in section 3 2 2 the total duration of the measurement cycle was 74 min during which the uv absorbance and the edc values of two dom samples were determined we note that by optimizing the analysis sequence e g by reducing the number of mixing cycles and rinsing steps or by shortening of the reaction time the analysis time for two samples may be shortened however since we considered the current analysis rate to be sufficient for detecting changes in sluggish systems such as wwtps we did not work towards shortening the duration of the measurement cycles 3 2 2 performance assessment of the edc analyzer the performance of the edc analyzer was assessed by testing the repeatability of edc and uv absorbance measurements of a single srfa solution over a total of seven measurement cycles the relative standard deviations of the edc and uv absorption coefficients were both small with 1 9 n 14 fig 4 a and 0 003 n 14 fig s12a si respectively similar to the edc assay edc values of six model dom isolates were quantified using the edc analyzer and compared to previously published edc values of the same isolates obtained by meo aeschbacher et al 2012 the edc values obtained using the edc analyzer correlated linearly with the edc values obtained by meo r 2 0 98 fig 4 b with a negative intercept of 0 4 0 3 and a slope of 0 95 0 06 these overall slightly lower edc values obtained by the analyzer compared to those obtained by meo and the edc assay see fig 3 b presumably reflect a slower mixing of the dom sample and abts reagent solution in the automated system resulting in a shorter reaction time in the edc analyzer compared to the edc assay in the analyzer solutions are sequentially aspirated into the syringe and subsequently delivered to a mixing chamber therefore the solutions did not mix immediately due to differences in their densities in contrast solutions in the edc assay are added to a cuvette and immediately mixed manually the slight offset in the edc values between the measurements may be eliminated by increasing the reaction time on the edc analyzer however since the subsequent discussion is based on relative changes in edc during ozonation small offsets in absolute values are not expected to affect the data interpretation the accuracy of the uv measurements was tested by comparing the results obtained using the edc analyzer to uv absorption coefficients obtained using a spectrophotometer fig s12b si the linear regression model fitted to the data had a slope of 1 05 0 01 and an intercept which was not significantly different from zero this small systematic bias was considered negligible and is not expected to affect relative changes in the uv absorbance 3 3 characterization of in and effluent of an ozonation reactor by the edc analyzer to demonstrate the performance of the edc analyzer with samples containing real dom filtered samples collected from the wwtp werdhölzli in zurich switzerland were analyzed the edc of dom from the ozonation reactor influent was 3 68 0 08 mmole gc 1 see table 1 and decreased by 62 to 1 39 0 03 mmole gc 1 after passing the ozonation reactor with an estimated specific ozone dose of 0 6 0 06 mgo3 mgdoc 1 based on the measured doc concentration and plant process data fig s3 si this pronounced decrease in edc reflects the oxidation of electron donating moieties in dom primarily phenols and is in good agreement with previous findings chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018b wenk et al 2013 the sand filter only had a minor effect on the edc which decreased by an additional 3 to 1 29 0 03 mmole gc 1 the uv absorption coefficient a 255nm of the ozonation reactor influent sample was 0 115 0 001 cm 1 and decreased by 44 to a value of 0 062 0 001 cm 1 after passing the ozonation reactor and further decreased by 2 by passing the sand filter to 0 060 0 001 cm 1 table 1 for full uv spectra see fig s13 si these findings clearly demonstrate that the high sensitivity of the edc analyzer allows to detect the relative decrease in edc and uv absorbance of real secondary treated wastewater dom 3 4 laboratory ozonation of secondary wwtp effluent 3 4 1 effect on edc and uv absorbance increasing specific ozone doses 0 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 were added to dom collected from the ozonation reactor influent werdhölzli wwtp zurich switzerland and the edc analyzer was subsequently used to monitor the relative changes in edc and uv absorbance compared to the untreated sample both parameters decreased with increasing specific ozone doses figs 5 a consistent with the ozone induced oxidation of electron donating and chromophoric moieties in dom wenk et al 2013 the relative edc showed a pronounced decrease at low specific ozone doses 0 35 mgo3 gc 1 fig 5 a at a specific ozone dose of 0 35 mgo3 gc 1 the relative edc decreased to 40 further increases in the specific ozone doses up to 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 resulted only in smaller additional decreases in the relative edc down to 31 the relative uv absorbance decreased to 60 and 42 at specific ozone doses of 0 35 and 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 respectively fig 5 a overall the relative decrease in edc was more pronounced compared to that in uv absorbance at low specific ozone doses fig 5 b in contrast the relative uv absorbance continued to decrease at higher doses and approximately matched the relative decrease in edc at the highest applied specific ozone dose of 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 this observation is consistent with previous findings and has been attributed

concentrations of the selected micropollutants i e 17α ethinylestradiol bezafibrate and atrazine as function of specific ozone doses 0 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 as expected the relative residual concentrations decreased with increasing specific ozone doses as a result of ozone induced oxidation lee et al 2014 2013 overall micropollutant abatement was proportional to the apparent second order rate constants k o3 of the reaction of these micropollutants with ozone at ph 7 9 table s2 si the relative residual concentration of 17α ethinylestradiol k o3 1 2 107 m 1 s 1 decreased to 9 at a specific ozone dose of 0 25 mgo3 gc 1 in contrast bezafibrate k o3 590 m 1 s 1 required a higher specific ozone dose of 0 6 mgo3 gc 1 to reach a relative residual concentration of 16 and the concentration of atrazine k o3 6 0 m 1 s 1 only decreased to 36 at the highest tested specific ozone dose of 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 since ozone and secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals are the predominant oxidants buffle et al 2006a and because the second order rate constants for the reactions of these micropollutants with hydroxyl radicals vary less than an order of magnitude 9 8 109 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 table s2 si variations in abatement efficiencies are largely explained by the variations in k o3 of these micropollutants finally bromate formation was observed at specific ozone doses 0 4 mgo3 gc 1 and increased abruptly from

gunten and hoigné 1994 to assess the suitability of the relative decrease in edc and uv absorbance as control parameters for ozonation the relative micropollutant concentrations were replotted against the relative edc fig 6 a and relative uv absorbance fig 6 b the relative concentration of 17α ethinylestradiol decreased approximately linearly with decreasing relative edc and reached a relative concentration of 9 while the relative edc decreased to 52 in contrast concentrations of the less ozone reactive micropollutants bezafibrate and atrazine showed smaller decreases to only about 78 for the same decrease in edc at higher specific ozone doses bezafibrate and atrazine concentrations continued to decrease while additional decreases in edc were small in comparison relative decreases in micropollutant concentrations were steeper and more linear when plotted against the relative decrease in uv absorbance similar to previous findings chon et al 2015 bromate concentrations sharply increased to 10 µg l 1 for relative decreases in edc and uv absorbance down to 34 and 44 respectively fig s14 si overall these results demonstrate that the edc analyzer which was designed for continual long term process monitoring achieves a similar analytical performance and predictive power for micropollutant abatement as a previously presented laboratory method based on size exclusion chromatography chon et al 2015 since the edc of dom was particularly sensitive to low ozone doses up to 0 4 mgo3 gc 1 monitoring changes in edc absorbance may be specifically suited as control parameter for treatment processes requiring low ozone doses applied for example in combined ozonation and adsorption systems 4 conclusions we developed and comprehensively validated i a photometric assay and ii an automated analyzer for the quantification of changes in edc and uv absorbance of dom during ozonation of secondary wwtp effluents for this particular application the two methods offer the following advantages over previous analytical systems in the photometric edc assay the reagents buffer and dom sample solution are mixed directly in disposable cuvettes which minimizes solution handling and residual abts reagent concentrations are directly quantified using a photometer enabling fast and scalable edc measurements the design of the fluidic system of the edc analyzer allows to perform continual on line edc and uv analyses at a frequency of approximately two samples per hour compared to existing continuous flow methods this fluidic system uses lower reagent volumes and is fully automated furthermore the use of only a single rotary valve and a single syringe pump in the edc analyzer minimizes maintenance and costs analysis of model dom isolates obtained with the edc assay and the edc analyzer are highly repeatable and closely match edc values determined using established laboratory analysis methods such as meo the edc analyzer will enable a continual monitoring

17638,ozonation of secondary wastewater treatment plant effluent for the abatement of organic micropollutants requires an accurate process control which can be based on monitoring ozone induced changes in dissolved organic matter dom this study presents a novel automated analytical system for monitoring changes in the electron donating capacity edc and uv absorbance of dom during ozonation in a first step a quantitative photometric edc assay was developed based on electron transfer reactions from phenolic moieties in dom to an added chemical oxidant the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts the assay is highly sensitive limit of quantification 0 5 mgdoc l 1 and edc values of model dom isolates determined by this assay were in good agreement with values determined previously by mediated electrochemical oxidation slope 1 01 0 07 r 2 0 98 in a second step the photometric edc measurement method was transferred onto an automated fluidic system coupled to a photometer edc analyzer the edc analyzer was then used to monitor changes in edc and uv absorbance of secondary wastewater effluent treated with ozone while both parameters exhibited a dose dependent decrease a more pronounced decrease in edc as compared to uv absorbance was observed at specific ozone doses up to 0 4 mgo 3 gdoc 1 the concentration of 17α ethinylestradiol a phenolic micropollutant with a high ozone reactivity decreased proportionally to the edc decrease in contrast abatement of less ozone reactive micropollutants and bromate formation started only after a pronounced initial decrease in edc the on line edc analyzer presented herein will enable a comprehensive assessment of the combination of edc and uv absorbance as control parameters for full scale

treatment is a widely recognized strategy for abating a broad range of organic micropollutants of environmental concern eggen et al 2014 oulton et al 2010 patel et al 2019 prasse et al 2015 von gunten 2018 a number of comprehensive tests in pilot gerrity et al 2011 huber et al 2005 knopp et al 2016 snyder et al 2006 ternes et al 2003 and full scale treatment systems bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 have demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of ozonation for decreasing the load of organic micropollutants discharged into surface waters numerous wastewater treatment plants wwtps in europe are therefore upgrading their treatment trains to include full scale ozonation systems vsa 2020 however a key challenge for the operation of these systems remains the real time control of the ozone dosage to simultaneously meet the treatment objectives and water quality requirements treatment objectives of ozonation are the abatement of selected indicator substances for example regulatory frameworks of authorities in switzerland federal office for the environment 2018 and california california environmental protection agency 2018 define abatement targets for specific indicator substances the treatment objectives specified by the swiss federal office for the environment demand an average abatement of 80 for a suite of indicator substances from raw wastewater to wwtp effluent which requires the application of minimum specific ozone doses bourgin et al 2018 at the same time water quality requirements limit the upper value for ozone exposures i e co3 dt due to the formation of undesired oxidation by products which are not degraded during biological post treatment hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 in particular high ozone exposures in bromide containing waters lead to the undesired formation of bromate a regulated potentially carcinogenic compound soltermann et al 2016 soltermann et al 2017 von gunten and hoigné 1994 furthermore energy demand for ozone production also incentivizes lower ozone doses katsoyiannis et al 2011 to balance these treatment objectives and water quality requirements an accurate real time determination of the optimal ozone dose based on robust control parameters is critical in drinking water treatment oxidant exposures have been applied successfully as control parameters kaiser et al 2013 during ozonation organic micropollutants may either be transformed by ozone or hydroxyl radicals which are transiently formed by reactions of ozone with the water matrix buffle et al 2006a the rate at which individual organic micropollutants are transformed is therefore a function of i the second order rate constants of the reactions of the micropollutants with ozone and hydroxyl radical and ii the ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures i e co3 dt and c oh dt buffle et al 2006b while ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures can be determined on line during drinking water ozonation kaiser et al 2013 technical limitations of current analytical instrumentation prohibits quantifying the same parameters during ozonation of secondary wwtp effluents due to fast ozone depletion buffle et al 2006b to circumvent this obstacle in wastewater treatment surrogate parameters associated with readily observable changes in the properties of dissolved organic matter dom have been suggested as control parameters for ozonation in this context ozone induced transformations of chromophoric moieties in dom buffle et al 2006a wenk et al 2013 have received a lot of attention ozone induced decreases in absorbance at 254 nm were found to correlate with the abatement of different classes of organic micropollutants bahr et al 2007 nanaboina and korshin 2010 wert et al 2009 wittmer et al 2015 and viruses wolf et al 2019 therefore the relative decrease in uv absorbance allows to assess micropollutant abatement on line and is considered a suitable control parameter for full scale ozonation gerrity et al 2012 park et al 2017 pisarenko et al 2012 stapf et al 2016 wittmer et al 2015 recently empirical models were proposed that additionally incorporate changes in total dom fluorescence to improve previous process control systems chys et al 2017 gamage et al 2013 park et al 2017 however absorbance values measured at 254 nm primarily predict the content of aromatic carbon in dom weishaar et al 2003 and thus only provide limited information on the ozone reactivity of dom therefore the application of an additional complementary control parameter based on decreases in the content of ozone reactive dom moieties would provide a more robust process control system based on two independent parameters a promising complementary approach is the quantification of the electron donating capacity edc of dom which provides a measure for the phenol content of dom aeschbacher et al 2010 the edc is operationally defined as the number of electrons transferred from electron donating moieties in dom to a chemical oxidant at a defined reduction potential e h and ph within a certain reaction time previous studies used the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulphonate abts as chemical oxidant aeschbacher et al 2012 chon et al 2015 walpen et al 2016 because i abts is reversibly reduced in a ph independent one electron transfer and ii the standard reduction potential of the redox couple abts abts e h 0 0 68 v scott et al 1993 is sufficiently high to allow for the oxidation of phenolic moieties in dom ozonation of dom samples including model dom isolates surface water and wwtp effluents resulted in decreasing edc values with increasing specific ozone doses önnby et al 2018b wenk et al 2013 consistent with the ozone induced transformation of phenolic dom moieties forming e g quinones and ring cleavage products via the criegee mechanism ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 recently the potential application of changes in edc as control parameter for ozonation was demonstrated in laboratory experiments chon et al 2015 wastewater effluent samples which were exposed to increasing ozone doses exhibited pronounced dose dependent decreases in edc which correlated with the abatement of selected organic micropollutants with different ozone reactivities taken together these findings warrant further investigations on the applicability of edc as control parameter for ozonation however these existing methods are not suited for such an application edc values have previously been determined by mediated electrochemical oxidation meo aeschbacher et al 2010 subsequent development of analytical methods based on size exclusion chromatography coupled to a post column reaction with abts chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018b and flow injection analysis önnby et al 2018b walpen et al 2016 significantly enhanced the sensitivity for edc quantification a requirement for analyzing solutions with low dom contents while these analytical methods already introduced some degree of automation i e automatic sample injection they were not designed for a continual long term process monitoring the primary reasons prohibiting the application of these methods for long term monitoring are i the long delay times from sampling to obtaining edc values ii the requirement of advanced chromatographic or electrochemical instrumentation resulting in high investment costs and frequent maintenance and iii high reagent consumption rates recently a simple field deployable photometric edc method was presented yuan et al 2019 even though the method was not automated the study demonstrated the potential for on site photometric edc measurements of dom in natural and engineered systems the objective of this study was to develop an automated edc analyzer for monitoring relative changes in edc and the uv absorbance of dom during ozonation of secondary wwtp effluents to this end a photometric edc assay was developed by adapting existing edc methods and comprehensively validated in a subsequent step this method was implemented on an automated fluidic system the edc analyzer in a third step the performance of the edc analyzer was assessed by measuring changes in edc of a secondary wwtp effluent during ozonation and the resulting decreases in edc were compared to changes in uv absorbance and the abatement of selected organic micropollutants in a fourth and final step the applicability of the combination of edc and uv absorbance as control parameters for ozonation was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

grab samples were collected at the municipal wwtp werdhölzli in zurich switzerland where conventional secondary clarification is followed by ozonation and sand filtration for biological post treatment details on the treatment processes are provided in section s1 2 and fig s1 si the wastewater samples were collected from three different points in the treatment process i the ozonation reactor influent ii the ozonation reactor effluent and iii the sand filter effluent to approximately collect the same wastewater parcel in all three locations the sampling times for sample ii and iii accounted for the hydraulic retention time of 28 and 15 min in the ozonation reactor and sand filter respectively calculated based on reactor volumes and flow rates relevant ozonation process

continuously sparging the ozone containing gas through water cooled on ice bader and hoigné 1981 the dissolved ozone concentration in the ozone stock solution was determined photometrically from 5 fold diluted acidified aliquots 40 mm phosphoric acid using a molar absorption coefficient of ε 260 nm 3 200 m 1cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 chap 2 5 2 5 ozonation of secondary wwtp effluent containing micropollutants increasing doses of ozone were added to the ozonation reactor influent sample to i demonstrate the analytical performance of the edc analyzer with a real secondary wwtp effluent and ii to assess the predictive power of relative changes in edc and uv for micropollutant abetment for this purpose three micropollutants 17α ethinylestradiol bezafibrate and atrazine were each added to a separate aliquot of the filtered secondary wwtp effluent the starting concentration of each micropollutant was 1 0 05 µm while this concentration is higher than the concentrations typically observed for these compounds in secondary wwtp effluents the relative abatement of these compounds was shown to be independent of the initial micropollutant concentration as long as the added micropollutants do not significantly affect the ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures zimmermann et al 2011 at this starting concentration each micropollutant only contributed slightly to the scavenging of ozone 3 or hydroxyl radicals 6 by the sample matrix see section s1 5 si for the estimation of the scavenging contribution these micropollutants were selected to span a wide range of reactivities towards ozone table s2 si a fourth aliquot was prepared to which no micropollutants were added subsequently ozone stock solution was added to the four aliquots of the secondary wwtp effluent at increasing specific ozone doses 0 0 9 mgo3 mgdoc 1 at a temperature of 23 1 c under stirring these ozonated samples were then stored at room temperature for 24 h to guarantee full ozone depletion before analysis edc uv absorbance as well as bromide and bromate concentrations were quantified in the micropollutant free aliquot to avoid potential interferences from the presence of added micropollutants accounting for the volume of the added micropollutant and ozone containing solutions the doc concentration of this secondary wwtp effluent was diluted to 5 5 mgdoc l 1 for these laboratory ozonation experiments and was assumed to remain constant during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 2 6 quantification of edc values of dom samples to quantify the edc of dom sample solutions we developed and validated a photometric edc assay and subsequently implemented this assay on an automated fluidic system the edc analyzer the reagent and buffer solutions as well as the detailed experimental procedure for the edc assay and edc analyzer are described in the following paragraphs 2 6 1 reagent and ph buffer solutions for the edc assay and analyzer for both the edc assay and edc analyzer an abts and a chlorine containing solution and a ph buffer solution were prepared weekly and stored at room temperature protected from light the abts containing solution was made by dissolving abts 1 mm final concentration in dilute sulfuric acid 7 5 mm ph 2 0 the chlorine containing solution 1 mm final concentration was prepared by diluting a concentrated hypochlorite stock solution in water chlorine concentrations were determined photometrically from alkaline aliquots ph 11 using the molar absorption coefficient of hypochlorite ε 292 nm 359 m 1cm 1 wang et al 2012 the stability of the chlorine and abts stock solutions was confirmed photometrically data not shown the ph buffer solution contained 500 mm of phosphate and resulted in a ph of 7 0 in the final reaction mixture of the edc assay and analyzer 2 6 2 experimental procedure of the edc assay the edc assay was adapted from existing photometric methods for quantifying edc values of dom walpen et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 for the edc assay presented in this study fig 1 a the abts reagent solution was first prepared in bulk by adding 350 µl of chlorine solution 1 mm per milliliter of abts solution 1 mm which oxidized nominally 70 of the abts to abts i e c abt s c abt s c abts 70 second the uv absorbance of an undiluted dom sample was measured at 254 nm as described above third 2500 µl of a dom sample see section 3 1 5 for the final doc concentration or dom free blank solution and 160 µl of ph buffer solution were added to a disposable cuvette with a 10 mm pathlength 4 5 ml poly methyl methacrylate brand germany subsequently 540 µl of abts reagent solution was added to the buffered sample solution fourth the resulting absorbance at 728 nm was measured on a spectrophotometer after a reaction time of 15 min unless stated otherwise see section 3 1 2 for a discussion on the reaction time 2 6 3 edc analyzer to automate liquid handling and absorbance measurements of the edc assay we developed a fluidic system coupled to a photometer fig 1 b the fluidic system consisted of a syringe pump level 3 cadent 3 imi precision switzerland equipped with a single 2 5 ml zero dead volume syringe and a 12 way rotary selection valve imi precision switzerland as well as two mixing chambers which were connected to the selection valve both mixing chambers were built from vertically aligned 2 5 ml pipette tips amornthammarong et al 2010 the detector was a double wavelength led photometer mikron 31 runge germany with a 10 mm pathlength and two led light source modules that emitted at wavelengths of 255 and 730 nm respectively the fixed wavelength of the led modules led to a minor shift in the detection wavelength compared to the edc assay and no correction was made for the molar absorption coefficient the edc analyzer was programmed to replicate the four experimental steps of the edc assay in a measurement cycle fig 1 b during which one dom free blank and two dom containing samples were analyzed this allows to determine the relative change in edc and uv absorbance during ozonation i e analysis of a dom sample from i the ozonation reactor influent and ii from the ozonation reactor effluent a measurement cycle consisted of the following steps first the abts reagent solution was prepared by sequentially aspirating chlorine and abts containing solutions into the syringe the resulting solution was then cycled five times from the syringe to the first mixing chamber and back the mixing chamber was filled from the top and emptied from the bottom resulting in an inversion of the syringe content allowing for an efficient mixing amornthammarong et al 2010 after a total of five mixing cycles the entire abts reagent solution was dispensed again to the mixing chamber for temporary storage second the dom free blank solution was aspirated into the syringe and a fraction of this blank solution was dispensed to the photometer to zero the absorbance signals at both wavelengths third buffer solution and an aliquot of the abts reagent solution stored in the first mixing chamber were additionally aspirated into the syringe which still contained dom free blank solution the syringe content was then cycled to and from the second mixing chamber fourth the resulting mixture was passed through the photometer to measure the absorbance at 730 nm after a reaction time of 15 min subsequently the steps two to four were repeated for the two dom containing samples to complete one measurement cycle however instead of zeroing the absorbance signal during the second step the absorbance of the dom samples was measured at 255 nm the edc analyzer was controlled with a computer through an rs 232 communication line serial commands and system status were automatically sent and received respectively using a script written in python version 3 7 van rossum and drake 1995 an additional python script was used for data acquisition from the photometer both python scripts are available at https github com walpen edc analyzer 2 6 4 calculation of edc from absorbance values the edc of a dom sample i e the number of electrons transferred from dom to abts was calculated based on the reductive loss of abts in the reaction mixtures we confirmed that abts was primarily lost through reduction to abts by dom in one electron transfer reactions using srfa as model dom see section s1 6 si abts concentrations were quantified based on measured absorbances at 728 or 730 nm using the molar absorption coefficient ε 728 nm ph 7 14 000 m 1cm 1 walpen et al 2016 to calculate the edc the residual abts concentration in the reaction mixture containing dom was compared to that of a reaction mixture containing only the dom free blank i e ultrapure water and normalized to the doc concentration of the sample in the reaction mixture eq 1 1 edc a blank a samp le l ε abts 1 c doc where ablank and asample are the resulting absorbance values λ 728 or 730 nm of the reaction

discussion 3 1 development and validation of the edc assay 3 1 1 effect of ph on the oxidation of abts by chlorine the rate of oxidation of abts to abts by chlorine decreases with increasing ph pinkernell et al 2000 because a fast complete and reproducible preparation of abts is critical for both methods presented herein the edc assay and the edc analyzer the kinetics and the stoichiometry of the formation of abts was assessed photometrically in the ph range from 1 to 4 at a ph of 1 5 and 2 0 the reaction was completed within one minute fig s4 si and the formed abts subsequently remained stable for at least one hour fig s5 si at ph values 2 0 the reaction was slower and incomplete fig s4 si at ph 1 0 the reaction was fast but incomplete presumably due a side reaction involving cl2 deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore abts reagent solutions for all subsequent analyses were prepared by adding chlorine solution to an abts solution acidified with sulfuric acid resulting in a ph of 2 0 in the abts reagent solution 3 1 2 reaction time of the edc assay to determine a suitable reaction time for the edc assay the evolution of the abts concentration in edc assay reaction mixtures with srfa as a model dom was assessed for this purpose the same volume of abts reagent solution was added to a set of srfa containing solutions with increasing doc concentrations and subsequently the resulting change in absorbance at 728 nm was measured over the course of 30 min the absorption coefficient and hence the abts concentration of the dom free reaction mixture i e cdoc 0 mgdoc l 1 decreased slightly by 2 7 during the experiment fig 2 a consistent with the previously observed instability of abts at neutral ph conditions e g cano et al 1998 compared to this dom free reaction mixture the decrease in abts concentration of the reaction mixture containing srfa was more pronounced and bi phasic the abts concentration first decreased in an exponential and subsequently after approximately 15 min in a more linear fashion for every time point the abts concentration correlated linearly with the doc concentration shown for t 15 min inset of fig 2 b according to eq 2 the absolute values of the slopes of these linear regression models represent the loss in abts concentration per doc concentration and therefore the edc the edc increased rapidly up to approximately 15 min and subsequently continued to increase at a lower rate fig 2 b however no plateau was reached even for longer reaction times of up to 120 min data not shown this finding may be attributed to a presumably wide range of reactivities of electron donating moieties in dom towards abts in addition oxidation of phenolic moieties forms phenoxyl radicals these radical species can form coupling products which may also donate electrons to abts hotta et al 2002 hotta et al 2001 as a consequence a constant value may only be reached after much longer reaction times because of this lack of an obvious end point an arbitrary time point of t 15 min was selected for the quantification of edc values for all subsequent analyses this operationally defined reaction time of 15 min encompasses the rapid changes in abts concentration during the first phase mentioned above in addition edc values obtained for a set of model dom isolate using the edc assay with a 15 minute reaction time were in good quantitative agreement see section 3 1 6 to previously published edc values quantified by meo where an electrochemical equilibrium was reached within approximately 60 min aeschbacher et al 2012 3 1 3 interferences from selected dissolved inorganic species potential interferences of four inorganic species at concentrations relevant for wastewater on the resulting abts concentration in the edc assay were tested manganese ii 0 110 µg l 1 iodide 0 125 µg l 1 bromide 0 800 µg l 1 and nitrite 0 4 6 mg l 1 i e 0 1 4 mg n l 1 among these inorganic species and in the absence of dom only iodide affected the abts concentration fig s6 si iodide had an edc value of 0 5 0 2 mol moliodide 1 after a reaction time of 15 min suggesting a reduction of abts by iodide however for dom samples with doc concentrations expected in the context of ozonation of secondary wwtp effluents i e 3 10 mgdoc l 1 the contribution of iodide to the measured total edc would be negligible compared to the contribution of dom for example for an srfa solution of 3 mgdoc l 1 edcsrfa 5 14 mmole gc 1 a concentration of 125 µg l 1 iodide would increase the edc of this srfa solution by only 4 in contrast manganese ii and nitrite did not react with abts in the absence of srfa fig s6 si however in the presence of srfa increasing manganese ii and nitrite concentrations resulted in increasing edc values of srfa fig s7 si at the highest concentrations tested i e at 110 µg l 1 manganese ii and 4 6 mg l 1 nitrite the measured edc values of srfa in the presence of these ions were elevated by 6 and 3 respectively as compared to the edc measured for srfa without these ions iodide and bromide did not exhibit such effects taken together these four investigated inorganic species will have a negligible effect on the edc quantification if present below the tested concentrations we note that iron ii associated with organic matter is oxidized in a one electron transfer by abts and therefore contributes to the measured edc by 1 mole moliron ii lau et al 2015 in cases where iron ii is expected to be present in significant amounts e g dom sampled from anoxic environments the contribution of iron ii to the edc may be accounted for by separately quantifying the iron ii concentrations in sample aliquots in secondary wwtp effluents iron ii is not expected to reach significant concentrations due to preceding oxic treatments 3 1 4 effects of the reduction potential eh and initial abts concentration on the measured edc the effects of the apparent reduction potential e h and the initial abts concentration on the measured edc were systematically assessed in a series of edc assays using srfa as a model dom the e h in the reaction mixtures is governed by the abts abts concentration ratio according to the nernst equation e g schwarzenbach et al 2003 chap 14 to assess the dependency of the measured edc on the initial e h a series of edc assays of srfa with identical concentrations of abts but increasing concentrations of abts were conducted the calculated initial e h values of these solutions ranged from 643 mv to 730 mv see table s3 si all reaction mixtures containing dom free blanks had similar residual abts concentrations after a reaction time of 15 min 78 2 1 2 µm n 8 mean standard deviation fig s8a si however the edc of srfa determined in these reaction mixtures increased from 3 15 mmole gc 1 at an initial e h of 643 mv to 5 48 mmole gc 1 at an initial e h of 730 mv fig s8b si we attribute this effect to the broad distribution of apparent standard reduction potentials of phenolic or other electron donating moieties present in dom aeschbacher et al 2012 and the resulting increasing thermodynamic feasibility or faster kinetics of the oxidation of these moieties by abts with increasing e h these findings are consistent with a previous study in which the edc of dom quantified by mediated electrochemical oxidation increased with increasing e h applied to the working electrode of the electrochemical analysis cell aeschbacher et al 2012 to test the effect of the initial abts concentration edc assay reaction mixtures containing srfa cdoc 0 4 mgdoc l 1 and increasing initial abts concentrations 35 140 µm were prepared the abts abts concentration ratio was kept constant to maintain the same e h in these reaction mixtures the residual abts concentration of the reaction mixtures containing dom free blanks ranged from 33 µm to 126 µm after a reaction time of 15 min fig s9a si the edc of srfa significantly increased with increasing initial abts concentration from 4 1 0 25 mmole gc 1 initial abts concentration 33 µm to 5 41 0 03 mmole gc 1 initial abts concentration 126 µm fig s9b si highlighting the importance of an accurate preparation of the abts reagent solution overall these findings suggest that the initial e h and abts concentration of the reagent solution have strong effects on the reaction kinetics or thermodynamics of the reduction of abts by electron donating moieties in dom to obtain reproducible edc values initial abts concentrations have to be controlled accurately and changes in e h over the course of the reaction should be minimized similar to a previous study walpen et al 2016 we selected an initial e h of 0 71 v for the edc assay because this e h is slightly above the standard reduction potential e h 0 of the redox couple abts abts i e e h 0 0 68 v scott et al 1993 thereby ensuring only small decreases in e h over the course of the reaction i e decreases in the abts abts concentration ratio lead to smallest e h decreases around the e h 0 a concentration of 87 5 µm was selected as initial abts concentration which yielded an absorption coefficient of 1 23 cm 1 at 728 nm 3 1 5 working range of the edc assay to assess the doc concentration range that can be applied in the edc assay the upper limit of the working range and the limit of quantification loq were determined for two model dom isolates nlfa and plfa these isolates were selected because their edc values were previously found to be high and low respectively compared to edc values of other isolates as expected increasing doc concentrations of both nlfa and plfa resulted in decreasing absorption coefficients at 728 nm and thus decreasing abts concentrations fig 3 a the measured decreases followed linear trends at low doc concentrations but deviated from linearity at higher doc concentrations towards higher abts concentrations this deviation likely resulted from decreases in e h over the course of the reactions which become more pronounced as the reacting doc concentrations increased see discussion above to determine the upper limit of the linear range for nlfa and plfa we fitted linear regression models to the corresponding abts concentrations fig 3 a and sequentially removed data points with the highest doc concentration until the r 2 value of the model rose above a predefined threshold of 0 995 the upper limits of the linear ranges i e the largest doc concentrations of the models to first fulfill this condition solid lines in fig 3 a were 3 1 and 7 8 mgdoc l 1 for nlfa or plfa respectively the limit of quantification loq a blank 10 σ a blank currie 1999 corresponded to a doc concentration of 0 11 and 0 44 mgdoc l 1 for nlfa and plfa respectively loq values are similar to those determined for the recently published methods for edc quantification based on size exclusion chromatography and flow injection analysis önnby et al 2018b walpen et al 2016 both of these methods were previously used to quantify the change in edc of real wastewater samples upon chemical oxidation with chlorine and ozone taken together we recommend diluting dom sample solutions to doc concentrations between 0 5 and 3 0 mgdoc l 1 in the final reaction mixtures for routine analysis with the edc assay 3 1 6 comparison of the edc assay and meo to compare results obtained by the edc assay to previously published values determined by meo aeschbacher et al 2012 six model dom isolates were analyzed for every isolate a series of reaction mixtures containing increasing doc concentrations n 3 was prepared and linear regression models were fitted to the residual abts concentrations versus doc concentration fig s10 si overall the resulting edc values fig 3 b closely matched the edc values obtained for the same isolates determined by meo slope 1 01 0 07 intercept 0 1 0 4 r 2 0 98 3 2 development and validation of the edc analyzer 3 2 1 edc quantification of a srfa solution an edc analyzer was developed to automate liquid handling and absorbance measurements using a combined valve and syringe pump system exemplary absorbance traces λ1 255 nm λ2 730 nm over the course of one measurement cycle for the analysis of srfa are shown in fig s11 si the uv absorption coefficient a 255nm of the tested srfa solution was 0 181 0 001 cm 1 n 2 normalizing this value by the doc concentration yielded a specific uv absorbance suva255 of 4 63 0 02 l mgdoc m 1 which is in good agreement with a previously determined value of 4 4 l mgdoc m 1 walpen et al 2016 as expected from the edc assay the addition of the abts reagent to the srfa solution resulted in a lower absorbance at 730 nm after a reaction time of 15 min compared to the dom free blank sample this is caused by the electron transfer reactions from dom to abts the decrease in the absorption coefficient of 0 1686 0 0005 cm 1 n 2 corresponded to a loss of 12 05 0 04 µm abts normalizing this loss in abts concentration by the doc concentration yielded an edc value of 4 8 0 2 mmole gc 1 which is only slightly smaller than the value obtained from the edc assay i e 5 1 0 1 mmole gc 1 a possible explanation for this small deviation as well as a systematic comparison of this value to previously published values to validate the edc analyzer is provided in section 3 2 2 the total duration of the measurement cycle was 74 min during which the uv absorbance and the edc values of two dom samples were determined we note that by optimizing the analysis sequence e g by reducing the number of mixing cycles and rinsing steps or by shortening of the reaction time the analysis time for two samples may be shortened however since we considered the current analysis rate to be sufficient for detecting changes in sluggish systems such as wwtps we did not work towards shortening the duration of the measurement cycles 3 2 2 performance assessment of the edc analyzer the performance of the edc analyzer was assessed by testing the repeatability of edc and uv absorbance measurements of a single srfa solution over a total of seven measurement cycles the relative standard deviations of the edc and uv absorption coefficients were both small with 1 9 n 14 fig 4 a and 0 003 n 14 fig s12a si respectively similar to the edc assay edc values of six model dom isolates were quantified using the edc analyzer and compared to previously published edc values of the same isolates obtained by meo aeschbacher et al 2012 the edc values obtained using the edc analyzer correlated linearly with the edc values obtained by meo r 2 0 98 fig 4 b with a negative intercept of 0 4 0 3 and a slope of 0 95 0 06 these overall slightly lower edc values obtained by the analyzer compared to those obtained by meo and the edc assay see fig 3 b presumably reflect a slower mixing of the dom sample and abts reagent solution in the automated system resulting in a shorter reaction time in the edc analyzer compared to the edc assay in the analyzer solutions are sequentially aspirated into the syringe and subsequently delivered to a mixing chamber therefore the solutions did not mix immediately due to differences in their densities in contrast solutions in the edc assay are added to a cuvette and immediately mixed manually the slight offset in the edc values between the measurements may be eliminated by increasing the reaction time on the edc analyzer however since the subsequent discussion is based on relative changes in edc during ozonation small offsets in absolute values are not expected to affect the data interpretation the accuracy of the uv measurements was tested by comparing the results obtained using the edc analyzer to uv absorption coefficients obtained using a spectrophotometer fig s12b si the linear regression model fitted to the data had a slope of 1 05 0 01 and an intercept which was not significantly different from zero this small systematic bias was considered negligible and is not expected to affect relative changes in the uv absorbance 3 3 characterization of in and effluent of an ozonation reactor by the edc analyzer to demonstrate the performance of the edc analyzer with samples containing real dom filtered samples collected from the wwtp werdhölzli in zurich switzerland were analyzed the edc of dom from the ozonation reactor influent was 3 68 0 08 mmole gc 1 see table 1 and decreased by 62 to 1 39 0 03 mmole gc 1 after passing the ozonation reactor with an estimated specific ozone dose of 0 6 0 06 mgo3 mgdoc 1 based on the measured doc concentration and plant process data fig s3 si this pronounced decrease in edc reflects the oxidation of electron donating moieties in dom primarily phenols and is in good agreement with previous findings chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018b wenk et al 2013 the sand filter only had a minor effect on the edc which decreased by an additional 3 to 1 29 0 03 mmole gc 1 the uv absorption coefficient a 255nm of the ozonation reactor influent sample was 0 115 0 001 cm 1 and decreased by 44 to a value of 0 062 0 001 cm 1 after passing the ozonation reactor and further decreased by 2 by passing the sand filter to 0 060 0 001 cm 1 table 1 for full uv spectra see fig s13 si these findings clearly demonstrate that the high sensitivity of the edc analyzer allows to detect the relative decrease in edc and uv absorbance of real secondary treated wastewater dom 3 4 laboratory ozonation of secondary wwtp effluent 3 4 1 effect on edc and uv absorbance increasing specific ozone doses 0 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 were added to dom collected from the ozonation reactor influent werdhölzli wwtp zurich switzerland and the edc analyzer was subsequently used to monitor the relative changes in edc and uv absorbance compared to the untreated sample both parameters decreased with increasing specific ozone doses figs 5 a consistent with the ozone induced oxidation of electron donating and chromophoric moieties in dom wenk et al 2013 the relative edc showed a pronounced decrease at low specific ozone doses 0 35 mgo3 gc 1 fig 5 a at a specific ozone dose of 0 35 mgo3 gc 1 the relative edc decreased to 40 further increases in the specific ozone doses up to 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 resulted only in smaller additional decreases in the relative edc down to 31 the relative uv absorbance decreased to 60 and 42 at specific ozone doses of 0 35 and 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 respectively fig 5 a overall the relative decrease in edc was more pronounced compared to that in uv absorbance at low specific ozone doses fig 5 b in contrast the relative uv absorbance continued to decrease at higher doses and approximately matched the relative decrease in edc at the highest applied specific ozone dose of 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 this observation is consistent with previous findings and has been attributed to the oxidative transformation of phenolic moieties to chromophoric quinone moieties at low ozone doses and the subsequent oxidation of these quinones at higher ozone doses chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018a ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 3 4 2 edc and uv absorbance as surrogate parameters for micropollutant abatement and bromate formation fig 5 c shows the relative residual concentrations of the selected micropollutants i e 17α ethinylestradiol bezafibrate and atrazine as function of specific ozone doses 0 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 as expected the relative residual concentrations decreased with increasing specific ozone doses as a result of ozone induced oxidation lee et al 2014 2013 overall micropollutant abatement was proportional to the apparent second order rate constants k o3 of the reaction of these micropollutants with ozone at ph 7 9 table s2 si the relative residual concentration of 17α ethinylestradiol k o3 1 2 107 m 1 s 1 decreased to 9 at a specific ozone dose of 0 25 mgo3 gc 1 in contrast bezafibrate k o3 590 m 1 s 1 required a higher specific ozone dose of 0 6 mgo3 gc 1 to reach a relative residual concentration of 16 and the concentration of atrazine k o3 6 0 m 1 s 1 only decreased to 36 at the highest tested specific ozone dose of 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 since ozone and secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals are the predominant oxidants buffle et al 2006a and because the second order rate constants for the reactions of these micropollutants with hydroxyl radicals vary less than an order of magnitude 9 8 109 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 table s2 si variations in abatement efficiencies are largely explained by the variations in k o3 of these micropollutants finally bromate formation was observed at specific ozone doses 0 4 mgo3 gc 1 and increased abruptly from 2 0 to 20 4 µg l 1 between 0 4 and 0 9 mgo3 gc 1 fig 5 d consistent with the oxidation of bromide present in the untreated ozonation reactor influent cbr 258 3 µg l 1 by ozone and hydroxyl radical von gunten and hoigné 1994 to assess the suitability of the relative decrease in edc and uv absorbance as control parameters for ozonation the relative micropollutant concentrations were replotted against the relative edc fig 6 a and relative uv absorbance fig 6 b the relative concentration of 17α ethinylestradiol decreased approximately linearly with decreasing relative edc and reached a relative concentration of 9 while the relative edc decreased to 52 in contrast concentrations of the less ozone reactive micropollutants bezafibrate and atrazine showed smaller decreases to only about 78 for the same decrease in edc at higher specific ozone doses bezafibrate and atrazine concentrations continued to decrease while additional decreases in edc were small in comparison relative decreases in micropollutant concentrations were steeper and more linear when plotted against the relative decrease in uv absorbance similar to previous findings chon et al 2015 bromate concentrations sharply increased to 10 µg l 1 for relative decreases in edc and uv absorbance down to 34 and 44 respectively fig s14 si overall these results demonstrate that the edc analyzer which was designed for continual long term process monitoring achieves a similar analytical performance and predictive power for micropollutant abatement as a previously presented laboratory method based on size exclusion chromatography chon et al 2015 since the edc of dom was particularly sensitive to low ozone doses up to 0 4 mgo3 gc 1 monitoring changes in edc absorbance may be specifically suited as control parameter for treatment processes requiring low ozone doses applied for example in combined ozonation and adsorption systems 4 conclusions we developed and comprehensively validated i a photometric assay and ii an automated analyzer for the quantification of changes in edc and uv absorbance of dom during ozonation of secondary wwtp effluents for this particular application the two methods offer the following advantages over previous analytical systems in the photometric edc assay the reagents buffer and dom sample solution are mixed directly in disposable cuvettes which minimizes solution handling and residual abts reagent concentrations are directly quantified using a photometer enabling fast and scalable edc measurements the design of the fluidic system of the edc analyzer allows to perform continual on line edc and uv analyses at a frequency of approximately two samples per hour compared to existing continuous flow methods this fluidic system uses lower reagent volumes and is fully automated furthermore the use of only a single rotary valve and a single syringe pump in the edc analyzer minimizes maintenance and costs analysis of model dom isolates obtained with the edc assay and the edc analyzer are highly repeatable and closely match edc values determined using established laboratory analysis methods such as meo the edc analyzer will enable a continual monitoring of the relative decreases in edc and uv absorbance during ozonation and potentially allow to predict micropollutant abatement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17639,tire and road wear particles trwps are heteroagglomerates of tire rubber and other particles deposited on the road surface and one of the main contributors to non exhaust emissions of automobile traffic in this study samples from road environments were analyzed for their trwp contents and concentrations of eight organic tire constituents trwp concentrations were determined by quantifying zn

significant correlations with trwps were found for 2 hydroxybenzothiazole and 2 aminobenzothiazole indicating that these substances may be suitable markers of trwps the mass distribution of trwps in road dust suggests that the main mass fraction formed on roads consists of coarse particles 100 µm data for a sedimentation basin indicate that the fine fraction 50 µm is preferentially transported by road runoff into receiving waters the size distribution and density data of trwp gathered by three different quantitation approaches also suggest that aging of trwps leads to changes in their particle

studies aim at predicting the distribution of trwps in the environment sieber et al 2020 unice et al 2019a the particle properties on which these models are based on are largely uncertain unice et al 2019b and data on environmental concentrations for model calibration are scarce by modeling the share of trwps reaching surface water was estimated to be up to 25 while the proportion remaining at the roadside and in the soil near the road ranges between 50 and 80 kole et al 2017 sieber et al 2020 unice et al 2019a wagner et al 2018 uncertainties regarding trwp properties include the size distribution of trwps generated under environmental conditions the density of trwps and the influence of biofilm formation on size density and shape of trwps unice et al 2019a 2019b knowledge on the size distribution of trwps is fragmentary and sizes from 0 1 µm up to 100 µm have been reported the airborne pm10 fraction of trwps was analyzed in several studies grigoratos and martini 2014 in

diversity of compounds amongst which are for example substances belonging to the group of persistent mobile organic contaminants may be released from tire rubber and could be identified in environmental samples seiwert et al 2020 the quantification of trwp heteroagglomerates with mass spectrometric methods is challenging and can be achieved by quantification of tire specific marker

diphenylguanidine dpg cas 102 06 7 unice et al 2015 to study properties of trwps found in the environment highly concentrated samples would provide easiest access to trwp a number of samples from the vicinity of hotspots i e from road environments were selected in this study together with a lake sediment with low expected trwp concentration for comparison apart from reporting the occurrence of trwp in environmental samples the aims were to assess the suitability of zn analysis in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ and organic tire constituents as quantitative markers for trwp in various environmental samples furthermore the particle size distribution of trwps in road dust samples and sediments of a road runoff treatment system were investigated knowledge about the particle size distribution of trwps would be highly beneficial for removal strategies for road runoff transport prediction in surface waters and the assessment of exposure to aquatic organisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling a total of three road dust samples were taken in leipzig germany on 8th april 2019 at the facility of the communal road cleaning service straßenreinigung leipzig these samples are

measurement quantification of organic tire constituents was performed by external calibration with 7 calibration points ranging from 0 01 300 ng ml calibration with fresh standard solution 3 d was

discussion 3 1 comparison of trwp concentrations in near road environments as determined by two independent methods trwpzn and trwpted trwp content was determined by two independent methods in samples from road environments and in lake sediment in order to compare method performance and to obtain concentrations in traffic related environments quantification of trwps was achieved by particulate zn content in the fraction 1 9 g cm³ and by ted gc ms ted gc ms uses specific degradation products of the tire rubber hence no separation of trwp from the matrix is required before analysis and the bulk sample can be directly analyzed on the contrary zn is not sufficiently specific for tire rubber and trwp were separated from the particulate matrix by density separation before zn analysis in the studied samples trwp concentrations ranged from 0 17 mg g up to 480 mg g fig 1 trwp concentrations were highest in the sediments collected in the technical sedimentation basin hal while those of road dust sk and the open settlings ponds s1 s2 were one order of magnitude lower for lake sediment tgl quantification of trwps by zn resulted in a concentration of 40 mg trwp g whereas 0 17 mg trwp g were found by ted gc ms analysis only few studies are available that quantified trwp in environmental samples recently a review study estimated tp concentrations by using concentrations of the organic tire constituents n cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazolamine ncba and 2 4 morpholinyl benzothiazole 24mobt that had previously been determined in environmental compartments and tires bänsch baltruschat et al 2020 the concentrations estimated for road dust collected from road surfaces outside of tunnels ranged from 1 4 37 mg tp g bänsch baltruschat et al 2020 which would be equivalent to 3 75 mg trwp g assuming a 50 contribution of tp to trwp see also chapter 2 3 and 2 4 sediments from road runoff detention systems were estimated to contain up to 10 mg tp g i e 20 mg trwp g bänsch baltruschat et al 2020 these estimates agree well with the trwp contents in road dust sk and in the open settling ponds s1 s2 presented in this study whereas the concentrations as high as in the technical sedimentation basin hal could not be confirmed by literature data agreement and differences between the trwp concentration data obtained by the two methods deserve a more thorough consideration the correlation coefficient between trwpzn and trwpted for the whole set of 10 samples was r 0 986 p 1 89 10 7 see also figure s8 indicating a good agreement between the methods this high correlation however was in part due to the high values of the technical sedimentation basin without these two samples no correlation was found figure s9 for the subset of the road dust samples sk however the two methods deviated by only 20 and a correlation could again be obtained figure s10 pronounced differences between the two methods were found for the sediments from the open settling ponds s1 s2 and the lake these differences may be a result from errors in trwpzn determination such as a an incomplete enrichment of trwps in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ b or leaching of zn from trwps both leading to an underestimation of trwp c the presence of particulate zn from other sources in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ leading to an overestimation of trwp or they may results from errors in trwpted determination such as disturbances in sbr quantification by sample matrix while the latter cannot be addressed in this study possible interferences in the trwpzn determination may be discussed in more detail the efficiency of the density separation was determined by comparing the sbr content in the whole sample to the sbr content in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ fig 2 table s4 this also allows a confirmation of the assumed density of trwp and an assessment on the trwp in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ as would be expected sbr enrichment was high for the samples where the two methods provided good agreement in trwp quantification i e in road dust samples sk and sediments from the technical sedimentation basin hal the lake sediment tgl posed an extreme example while the trwpted concentration in the unseparated lake sediment was close to loq and accuracy might have been hampered density separation increased the trwp concentration and probably allowed a more accurate quantification of sbr this led to a theoretical sbr enrichment of 200 in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ see also table s4 the open settling pond sediments showed variable results for the samples from the first settling pond s1 sbr quantification in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ indicated that approximately half of the trwp had a density 1 9 g cm³ fig 2 table s4 the sample from the inlet of the second settling pond s2in had an even lower sbr enrichment in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ 34 while for the outlet s2out the enrichment of sbr in the fraction 1 9 g cm³ was high 81 a reason for the high variability in enrichment of trwps may be aging processes that lead to changes in the density of trwps road simulator studies have shown that trwps directly after their generation consist of tread rubber and mineral particles from the road surfaces kreider et al 2010 in this study these kind of trwps are referred to as young trwps when the particles are exposed to environmental conditions aging processes such as heteroagglomeration with other particles or biofilm growth may increase density besseling et al 2017 particles that may have undergone such changes are referred to as aged trwp in this study best agreement between the two methods and highest enrichment in density separation was generally found for samples expected to contain young trwps road dust and with comparatively high concentrations technical sedimentation basin reduced agreement between trwpzn and trwpted was observed for the open settling ponds and may among other reasons which are discussed further below originate in aging processes that lead to an increase in density and a reduced enrichment of trwps by the density fractionation the quantification of trwps via density separation and zn analysis may overestimate trwps if particulate zn from other sources is present in the density range 1 9 g cm³ such sources could for example be zn bound to or contained within organic particles of low density this may have been the case for two of the four samples from the open settling ponds s1in s2out for the sediments from the technical sedimentation basin 18hal 19hal and for the lake sediment the lake sediment however represents a worst case sample as its total zn concentration 0 86 mg zn g was much higher than in usual sediments together with a high concentration of particulate organic matter 16 5 dw to which the zn may have been adsorbed while the traffic impact was presumably low klöckner et al 2019 trwp quantification by the zn method could underestimate the true trwp concentration if zn was leached during aging this would be visible by a high sbr enrichment and an underestimation with the zn method such combination could not clearly be identified however the difference between trwp quantification by zn and ted gc ms for one of the samples of the open settling pond samples s2in may be due to a combination of low enrichment and leaching of zn trwpzn in the road dust samples is always slightly lower than trwpted and leaching of zn could also occur on the road surface when trwps are in contact with rain water such small differences however could also result from deviations in the assumed average zn and sbr content of trwps and an associated systematic under or overestimation in trwp quantification it has to be noted that also sbr quantification by ted gc ms may be prone to errors for example due to the matrix that may interfere with the formation of 3 phenylcyclohexene as decomposition product of sbr or due to variability in the portion of sbr in trwps eisentraut et al 2018 it is also unclear how differences in generation conditions and associated chemical changes in trwp composition may influence instrumental sensitivity or if high organic matter contents affect quantification furthermore the deviation of ted gc ms analyses cannot be assessed since only single measurements were performed given the uncertainties associated with both methods an agreement by a factor of two as in the case for the technical treatment system hal can be considered acceptable however further analyses of different sample types would be beneficial for the assessment of the correlation of the two methods samples with trwp concentrations in the intermediate concentration range would be required 3 2 presence of organic tire constituents in near road environments as mentioned above organic tire constituents such as the benzothiazole derivatives ncba or 24mobt have been used to assess the amount of tire material in aquatic and road environments bänsch baltruschat et al 2020 in order to examine if organic tire constituents show a similar distribution as trwps in different environments and can thus serve as markers for trwps or whether they occur independently extracts of the 10 samples from road environments chapter 3 1 were screened for the presence of eight organic compounds table s1 all these substances have been determined in tire rubber before table s5 but their suitability as marker substances for trwps has been questioned wagner et al 2018 the concentrations of the eight organic compounds table s6 were compared with the trwpzn and trwpted data using pca four clusters of samples were obtained fig 3 a interestingly the two samples from the technical sedimentation basin hal were clearly distinguished one from the other meaning that they showed a different composition compared to the other samples but were relatively similar to each other a third group comprised the two samples from the first open settling pond s1 while all other samples formed a single cluster in this cluster also the tgl sample was contained which showed presence of most organic analytes although trwpted was at least one order of magnitude lower 0 17 mg trwp g than all other samples this indicates that either emission sources of the organic tire constituents other than trwp or leaching of substances from tires and transport in the aqueous phase contributed to the measured concentrations kumata et al 2002 unice et al 2015 or degradation of sbr in the lake led to an underestimation of trwpted the high correlation between trwpzn and trwpted is reflected by the small angle between the vectors in the loading plot fig 3b ted gc ms results showed a lower loading since only single measurement results were available whereas other values were determined in triplicates similar correlations were obtained with abt ohbt mtbt and obs whereas mbt 6ppd dpg and bt did not correlate a pca on a subset of analytes excluding the compounds that were frequently loq 6ppd obs mtbt and bt indicated similar correlations between variables but a slightly different clustering of individuals figure s11 strong and statistically significant correlations were obtained for ohbt r 0 94 p 4 0 10 5 abt r 0 99 p 5 8 10 6 and mtbt r 0 94 p 0 020 with trwpzn while correlation of obs r 0 67 p 0 071 was strong but not significant see also figure s12 correlation of organic tire constituents with trwpted were similar to those with trwpzn fig 3b figure s14 and table s8 physicochemical properties of the analytes such as their octanol water partitioning coefficient log p or water solubility were not decisive for the correlations table s1 this could be an indication that the substances were not solely adsorbed to particulate matter but that they were still fixed in the rubber matrix of trwps and only available to dissolution by an organic solvent since mtbt was loq in 50 of the analyzed samples ohbt and abt seemed to be most suitable to indicate presence of trwps as in the case of the correlation between trwpzn and trwpted the correlations between these substances and trwpzn were caused by the extremely high concentrations in the samples from the technical sedimentation basin see also figure s14 however even without the extreme samples a correlation of ohbt and abt with trwpted could be obtained figure s15 this correlation was significant for abt with r 0 86 and p 0 028 but no longer for ohbt r 0 69 p 0 059 in order for a substance to serve as a trwp marker the following criteria should ideally be met wagner et al 2018 the substance should be present in comparable concentrations among different tires and in a high concentration compared to the surrounding matrix be amenable to analytical methods be specific for tires i e have few other sources provide a high environmental stability when contained within trwp and not leave trwp due to leaching when exposed to aqueous media while not all these criteria can be examined in this study the leaching behavior is particularly interesting since abt and ohbt are quite polar and highly water soluble sw 1480 mg l abt 2350 mg l ohbt us epa 2019 concentrations of ohbt and abt in the isopropanol extract of shredded car tires tpmix were compared with an aqueous leachate obtained by sonication of tpmix in ultrapure water the leachate contained only 7 of the ohbt and 16 of the abt extracted with isopropanol table s7 it seems that even though the solubility of ohbt and abt in water is high their availability for leaching from the tire matrix is limited moreover the stability of ohbt and abt in aqueous environment is also limited kloepfer et al 2005 reddy and quinn 1997 however ohbt has been found in the dissolved phase of street runoff kloepfer et al 2005 a rapid degradation after dissolution would be beneficial for a trwp marker as this would avoid to detect the marker independent from the presence of trwps the low leaching potential and the high correlation with the trwpted concentrations both in the 10 samples as well as without the extreme samples hal renders ohbt and abt promising candidates as trwp markers the determination of organic trwp markers would provide a third approach to quantify trwps in environmental samples but this needs further investigation for example parallel application of all three methods to a larger set of samples would be required to validate the suitability of ohbt and abt as trwp markers in different matrices it would also be necessary to check if other quantitatively relevant sources for these compounds in the environment exist 3 3 mass distribution of trwps and organic tire constituents throughout grain size fractions knowledge about the size distribution of trwps is essential to predict their transport therefore four of the samples were size fractionated two road dust samples sk and the two samples from the technical sedimentation basin hal the road dust samples are close to the source of emission while the sediment samples were expected to represent material washed off the road and transported with road runoff towards aquatic environment the distribution of trwpzn abt and ohbt among the different grain size fractions was determined the particle size distribution of the four analyzed samples is shown in the supporting information figure s16 in the road dust samples sk the size fraction 100 µm dominated total particulate matter while the sediments of the technical sedimentation basin hal were much finer with 60 85 of the mass in the fractions 100 µm this indicates that the sedimentation basin receives most of the sediments during low flow conditions that allow the settling of fine particles whereas at high flow conditions of up to 10 m h hydraulic surface load fine particles would likely not settle see also figure s5 trwpzn was not evenly distributed over the five size fractions in the road dust samples 65 75 of the trwp mass was found in the size fractions 50 500 µm fig 4 a b contrary to the road dust the trwps found in the sediments of the sedimentation basin were dominated by finer particles with 50 80 of their mass in the range 50 µm fig 4c d the same is true for the two potential organic markers abt and ohbt and size distributions of the three parameters do well agree for all four samples fig 4 this underlines the possible use of ohbt and abt as indicators of trwps in particulate samples from road environment while these samples provide only a snapshot of the multitude of road environments it seems as if the majority of trwps in road dust is 50 µm whereas the particle sizes in the treatment system are the result of a fractionation process the shift towards finer trwps from the road sk to the sedimentation basin hal may be due to different processes a coarse particles may have been washed off the road less effectively by the surface runoff than finer ones or b coarser particles may have settled already in the silt trap that precedes the sedimentation basin or c coarser particles disintegrated due to mechanical forces during transport with runoff water the sediment of the silt trap was not investigated for trwps possible aging processes on the road that may have affected the size distribution of trwps could be photo oxidation romero sánchez et al 2003 and thermo oxidation carli et al 2012 while in water leaching of softeners halle et al 2020 could lead to an embrittlement of the rubber compounds and associated reduction in stability causing mechanical degradation differences in the particle size distributions between the two samples from the sedimentation basin may be explained by the fact that one of the samples 19hal was taken after the basin had been cleared and while fresh rain water was entering the basin fine particles 20 µm may therefore not have settled at the time of sampling they would rather settle after the rain event when the flow rate in the basin approaches zero the limited presence of fine particles in road dust may also be due to other reasons the fraction 10 µm may under dry conditions be transferred into atmosphere grigoratos and martini 2014 or under wet conditions be bound to and transported with water furthermore road sweeping cars were not designed for representative sampling of road dust like for example the wet dust sampler lundberg et al 2019 and the collection efficiency of road sweepers for particles 10 µm may be limited amato et al 2010 this aspect would require more attention for a final assessment of the size distribution of trwp on roads particle loss due to the wet sieving step can be excluded since the total trwp concentrations calculated from the size fractions matched the total concentrations shown in fig 1 for sk north and sk west concentrations of 9 5 and 6 3 mg trwp g while for 18hal and 19hal concentrations of 410 and 360 mg trwp g were obtained respectively it should be noted that fig 4 shows mass distributions of trwps the trwp number distribution would be much more clearly dominated by fine particles in all four samples assuming a spherical form for trwps 125 particles of 20 µm diameter would correspond in mass to only one trwp with 100 µm in diameter comparing the determined trwp size distributions in the samples from road environment with literature data is complicated since most previous studies focused on the airborne pm10 fraction trwps of up to 350 µm in size were determined in a road simulator with a predominating size of 75 100 µm kreider et al 2010 recently the influence of parameters such as road roughness or humidity on the trwp size distribution generated in a road simulator was assessed and also revealed particles up to 400 µm in size chang et al 2020 these results are in agreement with the data for the road dust determined in this study fig 4a b total particulate matter in road runoff has been reported to be dominated by fine particles 100 µm or even 50 µm charters et al 2015 kayhanian et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the dominance of trwps in this size range in the sedimentation basin fig 4c d is thus plausible 4 conclusions zn analysis in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ and the analysis of organic tire components both were suitable to determine the trwp size distribution in samples from road environment and can therefore be considered valuable tools for trwp research the correlation between trwp determined by ted gc ms and by zn in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ and two organic tire components ohbt and abt is promising to establish a set of potential marker compounds for the quantification of trwp for a more profound assessment of these correlations additional research would be required in particular regarding the correlations at further concentration levels and for different sample types as well as concerning the influence of aging processes on the quantification methods although the particle size distribution between road dust samples differs the dominant mass fraction 60 of the trwp may be emitted as coarse particles with a size of 50 µm the decrease of the particle size distribution between road dust and sediments from the technical sedimentation basin indicates that trwps of smaller size are transported preferentially it is reasonable to assume that the same is true for the transport of trwps from road to surface waters on the contrary coarser particles tend to be retained in near road environments and with them also the majority of trwp mass would remain in near road environments any aging process however that would lead to disintegration of coarser trwps into finer ones would facilitate their subsequent transport into aquatic environment and over large distances besides size particle density also affects trwp transport the assumption that trwp density is below 1 9 g cm³ could be verified for relatively young trwps but not for aged ones which seem to reach densities above 1 9 g cm³ the processes leading to these alterations in density are yet unknown thus also changes in trwp density must be taken into account in the assessment of trwp transport this study outlines that the properties of trwps generated on roads are subject to change the extent of these changes as well as the processes leading to these changes need to be known better only then can the emissions of trwps the extent to which they are distributed in the environment and the compartments in which they eventually remain be adequately assessed funding sources this study was funded by the federal ministry of education and research germany bmbf through the

17639,tire and road wear particles trwps are heteroagglomerates of tire rubber and other particles deposited on the road surface and one of the main contributors to non exhaust emissions of automobile traffic in this study samples from road environments were analyzed for their trwp contents and concentrations of eight organic tire constituents trwp concentrations were determined by quantifying zn in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ and by thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms and the concentrations ranged from 3 7 to 480 mg trwp g strong and statistically significant correlations with trwps were found for 2 hydroxybenzothiazole and 2 aminobenzothiazole indicating that these substances may be suitable markers of trwps the mass distribution of trwps in road dust suggests that the main mass fraction formed on roads consists of coarse particles 100 µm data for a sedimentation basin indicate that the fine fraction 50 µm is preferentially transported by road runoff into receiving waters the size distribution and density data of trwp gathered by three different quantitation approaches also suggest that aging of trwps leads to changes in their particle density an improved understanding of the dynamics of trwp properties is essential to assess the distribution and dissipation of this contaminant of emerging concern in the environment graphical

tread particles tp and particles that are deposited on the road surface kreider et al 2010 wagner et al 2018 the share of non exhaust emissions to total particulate matter pm is expected to become even higher with growing traffic volume and a reduction in exhaust emissions due to technological advancements in combustion technology rexeis and hausberger 2009 for the european union emissions of

2017 with increasing traffic volume also the emissions of trwps will increase the fate of this contaminant of emerging concern after emission however is a matter of ongoing research while modeling studies aim at predicting the distribution of trwps in the environment sieber et al 2020 unice et al 2019a the particle properties on which these models are based on are largely uncertain unice et al 2019b and data on environmental concentrations for model calibration are scarce by modeling the share of trwps reaching surface water was estimated to be up to 25 while the proportion remaining at the roadside and in the soil near the road ranges between 50 and 80 kole et al 2017 sieber et al 2020 unice et al 2019a wagner et al 2018 uncertainties regarding trwp properties include the size distribution of trwps generated under environmental conditions the density of trwps and the influence of biofilm formation on size density and shape of trwps unice et al 2019a 2019b knowledge on the size distribution of trwps is fragmentary and sizes from 0 1 µm up to 100 µm have been reported the airborne pm10 fraction of trwps was analyzed in several studies grigoratos and martini 2014 in contrast coarse particles 10 µm have rarely been analyzed and information is limited to particles collected during on road driving where presence of other particles affecting the measured size

environment are still scarce wagner et al 2018 tire rubber is a complex and heterogeneous mixture and formulation varies between tire model and manufacturer wagner et al 2018 wik and dave 2009 a large diversity of compounds amongst which are for example substances belonging to the group of persistent mobile organic contaminants may be released from tire rubber and could be identified in environmental samples seiwert et al 2020 the quantification of trwp heteroagglomerates with mass spectrometric methods is challenging and can be achieved by quantification of tire specific marker substances wagner et al 2018 markers can be tire constituents or degradation products of the rubber polymers generated during analysis for example by using thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms eisentraut et al 2018 an example for an elemental marker is particulate zn in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ which was found suitable for trwp quantification in samples from road environments klöckner et al 2019 benzothiazole bt cas 95 16 9 and its derivatives are common organic tire constituents and have been identified in tire particles as well as in environmental samples kumata et al 2002 spies et al 1987 wik and dave 2009 zhang et al 2018 among these are for example the vulcanization agents 2 mercaptobenzothiazole mbt cas 149 30 4 or 2

diphenylguanidine dpg cas 102 06 7 unice et al 2015 to study properties of trwps found in the environment highly concentrated samples would provide easiest access to trwp a number of samples from the vicinity of hotspots i e from road environments were selected in this study together with a lake sediment with low expected trwp concentration for comparison apart from reporting the occurrence of trwp in environmental samples the aims were to assess the suitability of zn analysis in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ and organic tire constituents as quantitative markers for trwp in various environmental samples furthermore the particle size distribution of trwps in road dust samples and sediments of a road runoff treatment system were investigated knowledge about the particle size distribution of trwps would be highly beneficial for removal strategies for road runoff transport prediction in surface waters and the assessment of exposure to aquatic organisms 2 materials and

organic analyses subsamples were extracted in three replicates to account for sample heterogeneity and random errors in sample preparation procedural blanks and solvent blanks accompanied each measurement quantification of organic tire constituents was performed by external calibration with 7 calibration points ranging from 0 01 300 ng ml calibration with fresh standard solution 3 d was

germany indium spex certiprep metuchen nj usa was added to each sample digest and was used as internal standard quantification of trwpted was performed with external calibrations by spiking a sample with deuterated polystyrene and sbr standards at four to six concentration levels respectively this was done for the unseparated as well as the density separated samples the sample matrix used for spiking was selected based on the average mass loss in tga during sampling all sampling equipment was rinsed with ultrapure water before use large sample volumes of 5 l were obtained at each site and thoroughly mixed to increase sample homogeneity when taking subsamples 2 9 statistical analysis median and standard deviation were calculated for concentrations of each sample if triplicate analyses were performed correlations between trwpzn trwpted trwpzn sbr 1 9 g cm³ trwpzn organic tire constituents and trwpted organic tire constituents were obtained by a pearson product moment correlation a principal component analysis pca was performed on concentration data from all analyses for pca values below loq were replaced with 0 5 loq data was centered by subtracting the column mean and scaled by dividing the centered column with the standard deviation in addition k means clustering was performed on the coordinates of the individuals obtained by pca in order to better differentiate between clusters pca was performed using rstudio version 1 1 414 and the packages factominer v 1 42 and factoextra v 1 0 5 while k means clustering was performed using the stats package v 3 6 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of trwp concentrations in near road environments as determined by two independent methods trwpzn and trwpted trwp content was determined by two independent methods in samples from road environments and in lake sediment in order to compare method performance and to obtain concentrations in traffic related environments quantification of trwps was achieved by particulate zn content in the fraction 1 9 g cm³ and by ted gc ms ted gc ms uses specific degradation products of the tire rubber hence no separation of trwp from the matrix is required before analysis and the bulk sample can be directly analyzed on the contrary zn is not sufficiently specific for tire rubber and trwp were separated from the particulate matrix by density separation before zn analysis in the studied samples trwp concentrations ranged from 0 17 mg g up to 480 mg g fig 1 trwp concentrations were highest in the sediments collected in the technical sedimentation basin hal while those of road dust sk and the open settlings ponds s1 s2 were one order of magnitude lower for lake sediment tgl quantification of trwps by zn resulted in a concentration of 40 mg trwp g whereas 0 17 mg trwp g were found by ted gc ms analysis only few studies are available that quantified trwp in environmental samples recently a review study estimated tp concentrations by using concentrations of the organic tire constituents n cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazolamine ncba and 2 4 morpholinyl benzothiazole 24mobt that had previously been determined in environmental compartments and tires bänsch baltruschat et al 2020 the concentrations estimated for road dust collected from road surfaces outside of tunnels ranged from 1 4 37 mg tp g bänsch baltruschat et al 2020 which would be equivalent to 3 75 mg trwp g assuming a 50 contribution of tp to trwp see also chapter 2 3 and 2 4 sediments from road runoff detention systems were estimated to contain up to 10 mg tp g i e 20 mg trwp g bänsch baltruschat et al 2020 these estimates agree well with the trwp contents in road dust sk and in the open settling ponds s1 s2 presented in this study whereas the concentrations as high as in the technical sedimentation basin hal could not be confirmed by literature data agreement and differences between the trwp concentration data obtained by the two methods deserve a more thorough consideration the correlation coefficient between trwpzn and trwpted for the whole set of 10 samples was r 0 986 p 1 89 10 7 see also figure s8 indicating a good agreement between the methods this high correlation however was in part due to the high values of the technical sedimentation basin without these two samples no correlation was found figure s9 for the subset of the road dust samples sk however the two methods deviated by only 20 and a correlation could again be obtained figure s10 pronounced differences between the two methods were found for the sediments from the open settling ponds s1 s2 and the lake these differences may be a result from errors in trwpzn determination such as a an incomplete enrichment of trwps in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ b or leaching of zn from trwps both leading to an underestimation of trwp c the presence of particulate zn from other sources in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ leading to an overestimation of trwp or they may results from errors in trwpted determination such as disturbances in sbr quantification by sample matrix while the latter cannot be addressed in this study possible interferences in the trwpzn determination may be discussed in more detail the efficiency of the density separation was determined by comparing the sbr content in the whole sample to the sbr content in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ fig 2 table s4 this also allows a confirmation of the assumed density of trwp and an assessment on the trwp in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ as would be expected sbr enrichment was high for the samples where the two methods provided good agreement in trwp quantification i e in road dust samples sk and sediments from the technical sedimentation basin hal the lake sediment tgl posed an extreme example while the trwpted concentration in the unseparated lake sediment was close to loq and accuracy might have been hampered density separation increased the trwp concentration and probably allowed a more accurate quantification of sbr this led to a theoretical sbr enrichment of 200 in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ see also table s4 the open settling pond sediments showed variable results for the samples from the first settling pond s1 sbr quantification in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ indicated that approximately half of the trwp had a density 1 9 g cm³ fig 2 table s4 the sample from the inlet of the second settling pond s2in had an even lower sbr enrichment in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ 34 while for the outlet s2out the enrichment of sbr in the fraction 1 9 g cm³ was high 81 a reason for the high variability in enrichment of trwps may be aging processes that lead to changes in the density of trwps road simulator studies have shown that trwps directly after their generation consist of tread rubber and mineral particles from the road surfaces kreider et al 2010 in this study these kind of trwps are referred to as young trwps when the particles are exposed to environmental conditions aging processes such as heteroagglomeration with other particles or biofilm growth may increase density besseling et al 2017 particles that may have undergone such changes are referred to as aged trwp in this study best agreement between the two methods and highest enrichment in density separation was generally found for samples expected to contain young trwps road dust and with comparatively high concentrations technical sedimentation basin reduced agreement between trwpzn and trwpted was observed for the open settling ponds and may among other reasons which are discussed further below originate in aging processes that lead to an increase in density and a reduced enrichment of trwps by the density fractionation the quantification of trwps via density separation and zn analysis may overestimate trwps if particulate zn from other sources is present in the density range 1 9 g cm³ such sources could for example be zn bound to or contained within organic particles of low density this may have been the case for two of the four samples from the open settling ponds s1in s2out for the sediments from the technical sedimentation basin 18hal 19hal and for the lake sediment the lake sediment however represents a worst case sample as its total zn concentration 0 86 mg zn g was much higher than in usual sediments together with a high concentration of particulate organic matter 16 5 dw to which the zn may have been adsorbed while the traffic impact was presumably low klöckner et al 2019 trwp quantification by the zn method could underestimate the true trwp concentration if zn was leached during aging this would be visible by a high sbr enrichment and an underestimation with the zn method such combination could not clearly be identified however the difference between trwp quantification by zn and ted gc ms for one of the samples of the open settling pond samples s2in may be due to a combination of low enrichment and leaching of zn trwpzn in the road dust samples is always slightly lower than trwpted and leaching of zn could also occur on the road surface when trwps are in contact with rain water such small differences however could also result from deviations in the assumed average zn and sbr content of trwps and an associated systematic under or overestimation in trwp quantification it has to be noted that also sbr quantification by ted gc ms may be prone to errors for example due to the matrix that may interfere with the formation of 3 phenylcyclohexene as decomposition product of sbr or due to variability in the portion of sbr in trwps eisentraut et al 2018 it is also unclear how differences in generation conditions and associated chemical changes in trwp composition may influence instrumental sensitivity or if high organic matter contents affect quantification furthermore the deviation of ted gc ms analyses cannot be assessed since only single measurements were performed given the uncertainties associated with both methods an agreement by a factor of two as in the case for the technical treatment system hal can be considered acceptable however further analyses of different sample types would be beneficial for the assessment of the correlation of the two methods samples with trwp concentrations in the intermediate concentration range would be required 3 2 presence of organic tire constituents in near road environments as mentioned above organic tire constituents such as the benzothiazole derivatives ncba or 24mobt have been used to assess the amount of tire material in aquatic and road environments bänsch baltruschat et al 2020 in order to examine if organic tire constituents show a similar distribution as trwps in different environments and can thus serve as markers for trwps or whether they occur independently extracts of the 10 samples from road environments chapter 3 1 were screened for the presence of eight organic compounds table s1 all these substances have been determined in tire rubber before table s5 but their suitability as marker substances for trwps has been questioned wagner et al 2018 the concentrations of the eight organic compounds table s6 were compared with the trwpzn and trwpted data using pca four clusters of samples were obtained fig 3 a interestingly the two samples from the technical sedimentation basin hal were clearly distinguished one from the other meaning that they showed a different composition compared to the other samples but were relatively similar to each other a third group comprised the two samples from the first open settling pond s1 while all other samples formed a single cluster in this cluster also the tgl sample was contained which showed presence of most organic analytes although trwpted was at least one order of magnitude lower 0 17 mg trwp g than all other samples this indicates that either emission sources of the organic tire constituents other than trwp or leaching of substances from tires and transport in the aqueous phase contributed to the measured concentrations kumata et al 2002 unice et al 2015 or degradation of sbr in the lake led to an underestimation of trwpted the high correlation between trwpzn and trwpted is reflected by the small angle between the vectors in the loading plot fig 3b ted gc ms results showed a lower loading since only single measurement results were available whereas other values were determined in triplicates similar correlations were obtained with abt ohbt mtbt and obs whereas mbt 6ppd dpg and bt did not correlate a pca on a subset of analytes excluding the compounds that were frequently loq 6ppd obs mtbt and bt indicated similar correlations between variables but a slightly different clustering of individuals figure s11 strong and statistically significant correlations were obtained for ohbt r 0 94 p 4 0 10 5 abt r 0 99 p 5 8 10 6 and mtbt r 0 94 p 0 020 with trwpzn while correlation of obs r 0 67 p 0 071 was strong but not significant see also figure s12 correlation of organic tire constituents with trwpted were similar to those with trwpzn fig 3b figure s14 and table s8 physicochemical properties of the analytes such as their octanol water partitioning coefficient log p or water solubility were not decisive for the correlations table s1 this could be an indication that the substances were not solely adsorbed to particulate matter but that they were still fixed in the rubber matrix of trwps and only available to dissolution by an organic solvent since mtbt was loq in 50 of the analyzed samples ohbt and abt seemed to be most suitable to indicate presence of trwps as in the case of the correlation between trwpzn and trwpted the correlations between these substances and trwpzn were caused by the extremely high concentrations in the samples from the technical sedimentation basin see also figure s14 however even without the extreme samples a correlation of ohbt and abt with trwpted could be obtained figure s15 this correlation was significant for abt with r 0 86 and p 0 028 but no longer for ohbt r 0 69 p 0 059 in order for a substance to serve as a trwp marker the following criteria should ideally be met wagner et al 2018 the substance should be present in comparable concentrations among different tires and in a high concentration compared to the surrounding matrix be amenable to analytical methods be specific for tires i e have few other sources provide a high environmental stability when contained within trwp and not leave trwp due to leaching when exposed to aqueous media while not all these criteria can be examined in this study the leaching behavior is particularly interesting since abt and ohbt are quite polar and highly water soluble sw 1480 mg l abt 2350 mg l ohbt us epa 2019 concentrations of ohbt and abt in the isopropanol extract of shredded car tires tpmix were compared with an aqueous leachate obtained by sonication of tpmix in ultrapure water the leachate contained only 7 of the ohbt and 16 of the abt extracted with isopropanol table s7 it seems that even though the solubility of ohbt and abt in water is high their availability for leaching from the tire matrix is limited moreover the stability of ohbt and abt in aqueous environment is also limited kloepfer et al 2005 reddy and quinn 1997 however ohbt has been found in the dissolved phase of street runoff kloepfer et al 2005 a rapid degradation after dissolution would be beneficial for a trwp marker as this would avoid to detect the marker independent from the presence of trwps the low leaching potential and the high correlation with the trwpted concentrations both in the 10 samples as well as without the extreme samples hal renders ohbt and abt promising candidates as trwp markers the determination of organic trwp markers would provide a third approach to quantify trwps in environmental samples but this needs further investigation for example parallel application of all three methods to a larger set of samples would be required to validate the suitability of ohbt and abt as trwp markers in different matrices it would also be necessary to check if other quantitatively relevant sources for these compounds in the environment exist 3 3 mass distribution of trwps and organic tire constituents throughout grain size fractions knowledge about the size distribution of trwps is essential to predict their transport therefore four of the samples were size fractionated two road dust samples sk and the two samples from the technical sedimentation basin hal the road dust samples are close to the source of emission while the sediment samples were expected to represent material washed off the road and transported with road runoff towards aquatic environment the distribution of trwpzn abt and ohbt among the different grain size fractions was determined the particle size distribution of the four analyzed samples is shown in the supporting information figure s16 in the road dust samples sk the size fraction 100 µm dominated total particulate matter while the sediments of the technical sedimentation basin hal were much finer with 60 85 of the mass in the fractions 100 µm this indicates that the sedimentation basin receives most of the sediments during low flow conditions that allow the settling of fine particles whereas at high flow conditions of up to 10 m h hydraulic surface load fine particles would likely not settle see also figure s5 trwpzn was not evenly distributed over the five size fractions in the road dust samples 65 75 of the trwp mass was found in the size fractions 50 500 µm fig 4 a b contrary to the road dust the trwps found in the sediments of the sedimentation basin were dominated by finer particles with 50 80 of their mass in the range 50 µm fig 4c d the same is true for the two potential organic markers abt and ohbt and size distributions of the three parameters do well agree for all four samples fig 4 this underlines the possible use of ohbt and abt as indicators of trwps in particulate samples from road environment while these samples provide only a snapshot of the multitude of road environments it seems as if the majority of trwps in road dust is 50 µm whereas the particle sizes in the treatment system are the result of a fractionation process the shift towards finer trwps from the road sk to the sedimentation basin hal may be due to different processes a coarse particles may have been washed off the road less effectively by the surface runoff than finer ones or b coarser particles may have settled already in the silt trap that precedes the sedimentation basin or c coarser particles disintegrated due to mechanical forces during transport with runoff water the sediment of the silt trap was not investigated for trwps possible aging processes on the road that may have affected the size distribution of trwps could be photo oxidation romero sánchez et al 2003 and thermo oxidation carli et al 2012 while in water leaching of softeners halle et al 2020 could lead to an embrittlement of the rubber compounds and associated reduction in stability causing mechanical degradation differences in the particle size distributions between the two samples from the sedimentation basin may be explained by the fact that one of the samples 19hal was taken after the basin had been cleared and while fresh rain water was entering the basin fine particles 20 µm may therefore not have settled at the time of sampling they would rather settle after the rain event when the flow rate in the basin approaches zero the limited presence of fine particles in road dust may also be due to other reasons the fraction 10 µm may under dry conditions be transferred into atmosphere grigoratos and martini 2014 or under wet conditions be bound to and transported with water furthermore road sweeping cars were not designed for representative sampling of road dust like for example the wet dust sampler lundberg et al 2019 and the collection efficiency of road sweepers for particles 10 µm may be limited amato et al 2010 this aspect would require more attention for a final assessment of the size distribution of trwp on roads particle loss due to the wet sieving step can be excluded since the total trwp concentrations calculated from the size fractions matched the total concentrations shown in fig 1 for sk north and sk west concentrations of 9 5 and 6 3 mg trwp g while for 18hal and 19hal concentrations of 410 and 360 mg trwp g were obtained respectively it should be noted that fig 4 shows mass distributions of trwps the trwp number distribution would be much more clearly dominated by fine particles in all four samples assuming a spherical form for trwps 125 particles of 20 µm diameter would correspond in mass to only one trwp with 100 µm in diameter comparing the determined trwp size distributions in the samples from road environment with literature data is complicated since most previous studies focused on the airborne pm10 fraction trwps of up to 350 µm in size were determined in a road simulator with a predominating size of 75 100 µm kreider et al 2010 recently the influence of parameters such as road roughness or humidity on the trwp size distribution generated in a road simulator was assessed and also revealed particles up to 400 µm in size chang et al 2020 these results are in agreement with the data for the road dust determined in this study fig 4a b total particulate matter in road runoff has been reported to be dominated by fine particles 100 µm or even 50 µm charters et al 2015 kayhanian et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the dominance of trwps in this size range in the sedimentation basin fig 4c d is thus plausible 4 conclusions zn analysis in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ and the analysis of organic tire components both were suitable to determine the trwp size distribution in samples from road environment and can therefore be considered valuable tools for trwp research the correlation between trwp determined by ted gc ms and by zn in the density fraction 1 9 g cm³ and two organic tire components ohbt and abt is promising to establish a set of potential marker compounds for the quantification of trwp for a more profound assessment of these correlations additional research would be required in particular regarding the correlations at further concentration levels and for different sample types as well as concerning the influence of aging processes on the quantification methods although the particle size distribution between road dust samples differs the dominant mass fraction 60 of the trwp may be emitted as coarse particles with a size of 50 µm the decrease of the particle size distribution between road dust and sediments from the technical sedimentation basin indicates that trwps of smaller size are transported preferentially it is reasonable to assume that the same is true for the transport of trwps from road to surface waters on the contrary coarser particles tend to be retained in near road environments and with them also the majority of trwp mass would remain in near road environments any aging process however that would lead to disintegration of coarser trwps into finer ones would facilitate their subsequent transport into aquatic environment and over large distances besides size particle density also affects trwp transport the assumption that trwp density is below 1 9 g cm³ could be verified for relatively young trwps but not for aged ones which seem to reach densities above 1 9 g cm³ the processes leading to these alterations in density are yet unknown thus also changes in trwp density must be taken into account in the assessment of trwp transport this study outlines that the properties of trwps generated on roads are subject to change the extent of these changes as well as the processes leading to these changes need to be known better only then can the emissions of trwps the extent to which they are distributed in the environment and the compartments in which they eventually remain be adequately assessed funding sources this study was funded by the federal ministry of education and research germany bmbf through the
