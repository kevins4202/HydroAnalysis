7570,precipitation is one of the most critical inputs for models used to improve understanding of hydrological processes in high mountain areas it is challenging to generate a reliable precipitation data set capturing the spatial and temporal heterogeneity due to the harsh climate extreme terrain and the lack of observations this study conducts intensive observation of precipitation in the mabengnong catchment in the southeast of the tibetan plateau during july to august 2013 because precipitation is greatly influenced by altitude the observed data are used to characterize the precipitation gradient pg and hourly distribution hd showing that the average pg is 0 10 0 28 and 0 26 mm d 100 m and the average duration is around 0 1 0 8 and 5 2 h for trace light and moderate rain

bocchiola et al 2011 viviroli et al 2011 although the importance of mountainous areas has been touched upon by some benchmark reports parry et al 2007 solomon et al 2007 bates et al 2008 the hydrological processes are still poorly characterized due to harsh climate extreme terrain and the lack of observed data immerzeel et al 2010 ragettli et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 distributed

hydrological simulation daly et al 1994 faurès et al 1995 beven 2001a b however characterization of precipitation in high altitude localities is a challenging task because the hydrometeorological data sets are extremely limited and precipitation is highly variable in mountainous areas buytaert et al 2006 immerzeel et al 2014 therefore an appropriate method is needed to interpolate point observations to gridded input for distributed models ahrens 2006 tahir et al 2011 immerzeel et al 2012 it is generally accepted that altitude has a significant influence on the spatial distribution of precipitation in mountainous areas due to the decreasing temperature and the increasing condensation with orographic lift on windward slopes barros and lettenmaier 1994 sevruk 1997 sokol and bližňák 2009 in catchments with significant differences in altitude the precipitation input may be underestimated if only data accessible from rain gauges in lowland areas are used for simulation martinec et al 2008 in many mountainous areas the relationship between precipitation and altitude approximates a linear form hanson 1982 daly et al 1994 brunsdon et al 2001 sokol and bližňák 2009 and the assumption of increasing daily precipitation with altitude is used in most current models sevruk 1997 moreover sub daily precipitation is often required in hydrological simulation studies koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 wheater et al 2005 astutik et al 2013 particularly in small catchments however most long duration precipitation records are available only at a daily timestep rupp et al 2009 thus it is necessary to develop and test a robust technique to disaggregate precipitation from coarser to finer temporal resolution to estimate hourly precipitation rupp et al 2009 for modeling studies appropriate calibration is essential to match model outputs with the observed data sorman et al 2009 pellicciotti et al 2012 ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 more than one parameterization may result in acceptable results when a single variable generally stream flow is chosen as the only calibration criteria this is known as the equifinality problem beven 1996 2002 2001a b brooks et al 2007 in order to avoid this undesired effect additional data sets should be included in the calibration procedure bergström et al 2002 cao et al 2006 the inclusion of remotely sensed snow cover has the potential to improve model performance and alleviate compensation of model errors pellicciotti et al 2012 snow cover images provided by moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis have been

evaluate simulation of catchment scale energy budget processes wan 2008 zhou et al 2015 the purpose of the present study is to address data scarcity and better understand the influence of precipitation on hydrological processes in mountainous catchments precipitation data at different altitudes in a high mountain catchment in the southeast of the tibetan plateau are obtained and used to estimate the precipitation gradient pg with altitude and describe the spatial distribution of precipitation moreover daily precipitation in the study area is disaggregated to hourly precipitation according to the statistical hourly distribution hd based on observations a distributed biosphere hydrological model based on water and energy budget with improved snow physics web dhm s is used to

performance 2 methodology 2 1 study area this study focuses on the mabengnong catchment bounded by 94 21 e 94 26 e and 29 31 n 29 34 n within the nyingchi district of the tibet autonomous region china in the southeast of the tibetan plateau digital elevation model dem data at 30 m resolution are downloaded from geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn land use data at 1 1 000 000 scale are obtained from environmental and ecological science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn the catchment covers an area of 21 km2 with altitude ranging from 3031 m above sea level asl at the mabengnong hydrological station to 4828 m asl land use types in this catchment are mainly needleleaf evergreen trees dwarf trees and shrubs broadleaf shrubs and grasslands fig 1 a meteorological station at altitude of 2992 m asl providing meteorological data including air pressure air temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation at daily step is located in the nyingchi county which is about 16 km away from the catchment according to the meteorological data from 1992 to 2013 the average annual temperature is 9 4 c and the annual mean precipitation is about 694 mm at the nyingchi meteorological station fig 2 a and b shows the mean monthly temperature and precipitation at nyingchi station 2992 m asl and average elevation of the catchment 3907 m asl respectively the precipitation in summer accounts for about fifty percent of the annual precipitation with consideration of the temperature lapse rate tlr and pg described in detail below the average annual temperature is 3 1 c and the annual mean precipitation is about 1100 mm at the average elevation as the meteorological station does not record the precipitation type separate shares of rainfall and snowfall are calculated based on the method proposed by ding et al 2014 which is given in appendix a at higher altitudes the percentage of snowfall is greater and occurs over longer duration in order to obtain the spatial and temporal variation of precipitation four rain gauges rhd 14 2 china were set up at different altitudes table 1 which logged the precipitation every 5 min from july 21 to august 19 2013 the original plan was to set up at least one rain gauge at 4000 m asl but this could not be achieved due to inaccessibility of the higher altitude area according to the previous study in the southeast of the tibetan plateau liu et al 2010 precipitation shows an increasing trend with altitude in high mountain area of 3600 6000 m asl that covers the elevation range of the mabengnong catchment therefore it is reasonable to apply the pg obtained from the rain gauges to estimate the precipitation in the catchment at the mabengnong hydrological station weekly runoff from june to october was observed in 2012 and 2013 during the intensive observation period i e july 22 to august 19 2013 hourly runoff data were observed from 9 am to 7 pm on each day 2 2 web dhm s model the model used is a distributed biosphere hydrological model with improved snow physics web dhm s shrestha et al 2010 it upgraded the water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm wang et al 2009a b by coupling the prognostic albedo scheme yang et al 1997 and three layer energy balance snow scheme xue et al 2003 both models have been applied and evaluated in several river catchments wang et al 2009a b shrestha et al 2014 and performed well in representing catchment scale water and energy cycles the model consists of multilayer soil routine three layer snow routine and water flow routine for soil water flow multilayer soil is used to depict the unsaturated zone and the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 is employed to characterize the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity

where kz and ksurface are the hydraulic conductivities at depth z and soil surface respectively and f is a decay factor specific enthalpy is used as the prognostic variable for the snow energy balance the mass balance is controlled by the snowfall rainfall compaction snowmelt runoff and sublimation evaporation the hydrological submodel is used to calculate subsurface and surface runoff and simulate lateral water redistribution manning s equation is applied to describe overland flow and darcy s law is employed to simulate the groundwater contribution and subsurface runoff wang et al 2009a the runoff of all the model grid cells is accumulated into river channels and routed through the river network using the kinematic method wang 2007 2 3 data preparation 2 3 1 meteorological station data the necessary atmospheric forcing data to drive the model include air pressure relative humidity wind speed downward longwave and shortwave radiation and air temperature at hourly time step in this study daily wind speed relative humidity air temperature and air pressure are available in the nyingchi meteorological station daily average wind speed relative humidity and air pressure are used as model input wang et al 2011 hourly temperature is generated from the variable infiltration capacity vic model using an interpolation scheme liang et al 1994 maurer et al 2002 based on the temperature obtained from the nyingchi meteorological station as temperature varies with altitude the tlr is estimated using the historical meteorological data from available stations as specified in section 2 3 3 due to the lack of observed radiation at the site 3 hourly downward longwave and shortwave radiation data are obtained from china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd chen et al 2011 which can be downloaded from doi 10 3972 westdc 002 2014 db in precipitation measurements there are systematic errors caused by trace events wind induced undercatch wetting and evaporation losses sevruk 1982 zhang et al 2004 thus corrections of daily precipitation biases are made by the following equation ye et al 2007 2 p p 0 δ p w δ p e cr other precipitation events δ p t trace precipitation event s where p stands for the corrected precipitation p0 is the measured precipitation δpw is the wetting loss while δpe is the evaporation loss cr is the catch ratio and δpt is an adjusted value for trace events generally δpw is 0 230 mm d δpe is 0 30 mm d and δpt is 0 1 mm d in china cr can be estimated via 3 cr exp 0 041 w 0 w 7 3 where w is the wind speed m s at 10 m 2 3 2 estimation of precipitation gradient and hourly distribution according to the grading criteria issued by the china meteorological administration precipitation events in the study area are categorized into trace precipitation 0 1 mm d light precipitation 0 1 mm d and 10 mm d and moderate precipitation 10 mm d and 25 mm d based on daily precipitation at the nyingchi meteorological station during the intensive observation period there was no record of precipitation 25 mm d at the nyingchi station for each precipitation grade precipitation gradient pg and hourly distribution hd are characterized by introducing the rain gauge data of every 5 min at the four altitudes from july 21 to august 19 2013 first daily pg is derived based on daily precipitation of the nyingchi station and the four rain gauges corrections of daily precipitation of the rain gauges are also made using equations 1 and 2 daily precipitation gradients are achieved based on the five point regression including the nyingchi station and four rain gauges for trace light and moderate precipitation the average daily pg is estimated to be 0 10 0 28 and 0 26 mm d 100 m respectively described in detail in appendix b as a result the gridded daily precipitation pgrid shown in appendix c can be derived from the daily precipitation of the nyingchi station p0 the average daily pg of the precipitation grade pggrade corresponding to p0 and the altitude difference between the grid and the nyingchi station as follows 4 p grid p 0 z grid z 0 100 pg grade where zgrid is the altitude of the grid cell and z0 is the altitude of the nyingchi station in general this is applicable for small catchments where windward leeward effects are not pronounced second the daily precipitation is further disaggregated into hourly precipitation on the basis of the precipitation grade and hourly distribution proportion based on the rain gauge data it is observed that the average precipitation duration total raining time during the day is around 0 1 0 8 and 5 2 h for trace precipitation light precipitation and moderate precipitation respectively for each precipitation grade the hourly proportions of daily precipitation are calculated fig 3 based on the distribution the daily precipitation is disaggregated to each hour 2 3 3 estimation of temperature lapse rate tlr tlr is estimated based on available meteorological stations in the vicinity li et al 2013 four meteorological stations with temperature data available during 1992 2013 for estimating tlr in the study area are shown in table 2 the monthly tlr derived based on linear regression of monthly mean temperatures and altitudes at the four stations is 0 57 0 80 c 100 m r2 0 907 0 995 the high r2 values illustrate that the tlr has the potential to represent the temperature distribution in the study area and is thus used to describe the spatial variation of temperature 2 3 4 satellite data in web dhm s the vegetation dynamic parameters include lai leaf area index and fpar the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the green vegetation canopy lai and fpar data are 8 daily compounds from mod15a2 products and are downloaded from land process distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov products the soil type data in this catchment are obtained from fao food and agriculture organization 2003 global data product showing that the main soil type in the study area is lithosol as mentioned in more detail in the introduction satellite imagery is the most effective tool to assess the distribution of snow martinec et al 2008 and satellite snow products have been used extensively for snow modeling immerzeel et al 2009 bocchiola et al 2011 in this study modis snow cover data from the terra platform at 1 day and 500 m resolution are used for model calibration and validation in addition lst derived from modis product mod11a1 v5 at 1 day and 1 km resolution can be used to assess model performance of catchment scale energy budget modeling wan 2008 zhou et al 2015 through interpolation both snow cover and lst products are resampled to match the dem data 2 4 evaluation criteria to evaluate the model performance the model calibration period is selected as june to october 2013 including the intensive observation period of july 22 to august 19 2013 while the validation period is june to october in 2012 to evaluate the

gauges installed at different altitudes within the catchment i e 3023 3255 3345 and 3396 m asl shows significant correlation table 3 thus it is reasonable to use these precipitation data to estimate the pg in the study area 3 2 runoff simulation during the calibration period five parameters are optimized to match the simulated runoff sca and lst with observed runoff and modis snow and lst products respectively the calibrated parameters and their calibration values taken as the base case are listed in table 4 together with other parameters determined based on the literature the simulated runoff values are compared with the observation at mabengnong hydrological station for the calibration period with hourly and weekly runoff fig 4 a and for validation period of june to october in 2012 with weekly runoff fig 4b the simulation captures the variation of the runoff with spring and summer flow peaks occurring mainly in response to snow melt and rainfall respectively the base case model performance of runoff simulation is acceptable with nse reaching 0 619 and 0 652 and r2 of 0 674 and 0 718 for model calibration and validation periods respectively table 5 3 3 snow cover area simulation the snow cover distribution and snow cover area sca simulation are compared with modis snow products grid by grid for each day if the modis data for a grid is cloud then the grid is removed from the comparison in order to reduce the effects of clouds in the modis snow products on model evaluation only the days with more than 50 valid data are selected for comparison snow covers almost the entire catchment in winter keeps melting and accumulating in response to occasional snow fall in spring melts completely in summer and starts accumulating and melting in fall it is shown that the model performance of snow cover simulation is even better than runoff simulation with nse of 0 616 and 0 632 and r2 of 0 682 and 0 686 for model calibration and validation period respectively fig 5 3 4 land surface temperature simulation lst is the key factor governing the surface atmosphere sensible and latent heat fluxes wang et al 2009b zhou et al 2015 it can be applied to evaluate catchment scale energy process modeling in this study according to the quality control fields included in mod11a1 v5 only high quality lst data with reported errors 1 k are selected for comparison fig 6 show the comparison of the catchment averaged lst between modis and simulation during 2012 2013 the simulation closely captures the seasonal variation of lst with higher values in summer and lower values in winter the results indicate that nse is 0 876 and 0 701 and r2 is 0 903 and 0 832 for model calibration and validation periods respectively table 5 3 5 sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of spatial and temporal variation of precipitation on runoff dynamics sensitivity analyses are conducted by changing the pg and hd of precipitation and comparing simulation results to the base case case 1 uses the same pg as the base case but uniform distribution of precipitation within the day case 2 uses pg of zero but the same hd as the base case case 3 uses pg of zero and uniform distribution of precipitation within the day the simulated runoff values are compared with the observation fig 4a and b with simulation evaluation criteria listed in table 5 sensitivity analysis shows that changing of pg and or hd does not significantly affect the catchment scale energy cycles as indicated by the lst simulation since temperature longwave and shortwave radiation are more important factors changing the hd of precipitation only alters the sca simulation slightly without consideration of pg runoff and sca are under estimated for about 43 and 87 respectively while the total precipitation rainfall and snowfall are under estimated for about 72 38 5 and 60 8 respectively moreover changing hd of precipitation influences the diurnal change of runoff simulation the reason for the effect of hd in runoff simulation is that the precipitation type is mainly rainfall during the intensive observation therefore the time for snow melting is almost 0 when there is heavier rainfall the runoff responds to it quickly 4 discussion as described here short term intensified field campaigns may be able to surmount difficulties in obtaining the spatial and temporal variation of precipitation pellicciotti et al 2012 ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 studies focusing on the spatial and temporal variation of precipitation contribute to better understanding of the characteristics of precipitation in high mountain areas ueno et al 2001 johansson and chen 2003 buytaert et al 2006 seasonal and annual pg have been applied in high mountain areas to improve precipitation input for hydrological models and the results are acceptable zhang et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2014 in this study daily pg and hd are characterized based on rain gauge data at different altitudes in the mabengnong catchment collected intensively for about one month during the rainy season these are used to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation based on daily precipitation of the nyingchi station and taking the pg and hd of precipitation into consideration hydrological model obtained reasonable simulation of runoff snow cover and lst for a two year period of model calibration and validation the model captures both the diurnal and the seasonal changes of hydrological processes in this high mountain catchment since the gridded precipitation input is generated based on daily precipitation of the nyingchi station for a few cases that precipitation did occur in the catchment but was not detected at the nyingchi station due to spatial heterogeneity the runoff and sca peaks could not be captured by the simulation in the study area snow cover evolution shows seasonal variation it occupies a large area with accumulating and melting processes in winter and early spring and is close to zero in summer as temperature increases the model simulation of snow cover is consistent with this but the difference between simulated snow cover and modis data is a little larger in some cases this may be because the accuracies of modis snow cover decrease with decreasing snow depth hall and riggs 2007 liang et al 2008 plus the snow would be patchier within a 500 m resolution grid when the snow pack is thin which may lead to confined snow detection klein and barnett 2003 therefore the poor performance of modis snow mapping at low snow depth could be the reason for the somewhat larger difference between the simulated and modis snow cover the model performs well in producing catchment averaged lst except that the simulated lst was occasionally larger than modis lst the reason may lie in cloud effects when a grid observed by satellite is covered by cloud the corresponding modis temperature would not be the lst but the cloud top temperature however there exist deficiencies in the cloud detection algorithm of modis platnick et al 2003 and modis lst data are believed to be affected by undetected clouds to some degree benali et al 2012 overall differences between simulated lst and modis lst are small most of the time indicating a reasonable simulation of energy cycles it is shown that intensive observation of precipitation even for only one month provides crucial information to understand the hydrological processes in the high mountain catchment considering pg according to trace light and moderate precipitation grades makes it more reasonable and reduces the uncertainties in estimates of aggregate pg in summer convective precipitation occurs at the local scale in the tibetan plateau strong upvalley wind leading to convective cumulus clouds during the day along with the presence of stratus clouds suppressing radiative cooling in the evening result in peak precipitation occurring at certain altitudes immerzeel et al 2014 the maximum precipitation zone should be close to the height of the cloud base in a simple convective system barry 2008 studies in the tibetan plateau have shown the maximum precipitation zone ranging between 3000 and 6900 m thomas 1997 putkonen 2004 wang et al 2009c du et al 2016 it should be noted that the rain gauges set up in this study do not cover the whole altitude range of the catchment due to inaccessibility in the higher altitude area however according to the previous study in the southeast and south central part of the tibetan plateau precipitation increases with altitude in high mountain areas 3600 6000 m and the annual pg is 19 66 mm 100 m cheng 1996 ohta et al 1994 moreover based on the daily precipitation at the nyingchi meteorological station in 2013 and daily pgs estimated above the annual pg of this study area is 41 8 mm 100 m which is consistent with of the previous studies in terms of magnitude since there are seasonal variations of pg in high mountain areas immerzeel et al 2014 the estimated pgs based on summer observation may not exactly describe the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in other months under these circumstances the current pgs significantly improve precipitation estimation and thus runoff simulation showing that the estimation is efficient and effective 5 conclusions in this study precipitation data acquired from four rain gauges installed at different altitudes in the high mountain mabengnong catchment and the nearby nyingchi meteorological station in the southeast of the tibetan plateau are analyzed correlation analysis indicates that the precipitation observed at different altitudes is highly correlated these data are thus applied to estimate pg and hd to provide model input of precipitation with reasonable spatial and temporal variation so as to improve our understanding and simulation of hydrological processes five main conclusions are derived from this study first the spatial variation of precipitation is mainly influenced by altitude in the study area with average precipitation gradient pg of 0 10 0 28 and 0 26 mm d 100 m for trace light and moderate precipitation respectively second the average precipitation hourly duration hd is about 0 1 0 8 and 5 2 h for trace light and moderate precipitation respectively with trace precipitation mostly occurring in the evening while the diurnal distribution of light and moderate precipitation is relatively uniform third gridded precipitation input obtained based on the pg and hd results enables the web dhm s model to generate accurate simulation of the water and energy cycles in the study area represented by runoff snow cover area and land surface temperature fourth sensitivity analysis demonstrates that simulated runoff is significantly underestimated without consideration of pg finally intensive precipitation observation can play an important role in improving hydrological

precipitation on hydrological processes in mountainous catchments precipitation data at different altitudes in a high mountain catchment in the southeast of the tibetan plateau are obtained and used

in the southeast of the tibetan plateau digital elevation model dem data at 30 m resolution are downloaded from geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn land use data at 1 1 000 000 scale are obtained from environmental and ecological science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn the catchment covers an area of 21 km2 with altitude ranging from 3031 m above sea level asl at the mabengnong hydrological station to 4828 m asl land use types in this catchment are mainly needleleaf evergreen trees dwarf trees and shrubs broadleaf shrubs and grasslands fig 1 a meteorological station at altitude of 2992 m asl providing meteorological data including air pressure air temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation at daily step is located in the nyingchi county which is about 16 km away from the catchment according to the meteorological data from 1992 to 2013 the average annual temperature is 9 4 c and the annual mean precipitation is about 694 mm at the nyingchi meteorological station fig 2 a and b shows the mean monthly temperature and precipitation at nyingchi station 2992 m asl and average elevation of the catchment 3907 m asl respectively the precipitation in summer accounts for about fifty percent of the annual precipitation with consideration of the temperature lapse rate tlr and pg described in detail below the average annual temperature is 3 1 c and the annual mean precipitation is about 1100 mm at the average elevation as the meteorological station does not record the precipitation type separate shares of rainfall and snowfall are calculated based on the method proposed by ding et al 2014 which is given in appendix a at higher altitudes the percentage of snowfall is greater and occurs over longer duration in order to obtain the spatial and temporal variation of precipitation four rain gauges rhd 14 2 china were set up at different altitudes table 1 which logged the precipitation every 5 min from july 21 to august 19 2013 the original plan was to set up at least one rain gauge at 4000 m asl but this could not be achieved due to inaccessibility of the higher altitude area according to the previous study in the southeast of the tibetan plateau liu et al 2010 precipitation shows an increasing trend with altitude in high mountain area of 3600 6000 m asl that covers the elevation range of the mabengnong catchment therefore it is reasonable to apply the pg obtained from the rain gauges to estimate the precipitation in the catchment at the mabengnong hydrological station weekly runoff from june to october was observed in 2012 and 2013 during the intensive observation period i e july 22 to august 19 2013 hourly runoff data were observed from 9 am to 7 pm on each day 2 2 web dhm s model the model

obtained from the nyingchi meteorological station as temperature varies with altitude the tlr is estimated using the historical meteorological data from available stations as specified in section 2 3

downloaded from doi 10 3972 westdc 002 2014 db in precipitation measurements there are systematic errors caused by trace events wind induced undercatch wetting and evaporation losses sevruk 1982 zhang

gradient and hourly distribution according to the grading criteria issued by the china meteorological administration precipitation events in the study area are categorized into trace precipitation 0 1 mm d light precipitation 0 1 mm d and 10 mm d and moderate precipitation 10 mm d and 25 mm d based on daily precipitation at the nyingchi meteorological station during the intensive observation period there was no record of precipitation 25 mm d at the nyingchi station for each precipitation grade precipitation gradient pg and hourly distribution hd are characterized by introducing the rain gauge data of every 5 min at the four altitudes from july 21 to august 19 2013 first daily pg is derived based on daily precipitation of the nyingchi station and the four rain gauges corrections of daily precipitation of the rain gauges are also made using equations 1 and 2 daily precipitation gradients are achieved based on the five point regression including the nyingchi station and four rain gauges for trace light and moderate precipitation the average daily pg is estimated to be 0 10 0 28 and 0 26 mm d 100 m respectively described in detail in appendix b as a result the gridded daily precipitation pgrid shown in appendix c can be derived from the daily precipitation of the nyingchi station p0 the average daily pg of the precipitation grade pggrade corresponding to p0 and the altitude difference between the grid and the nyingchi station as follows 4 p grid p 0 z grid z 0 100 pg grade where zgrid is the altitude of the grid cell and z0 is the altitude of the nyingchi station in general this is applicable for small catchments where windward leeward effects are not pronounced second the daily precipitation is further disaggregated into hourly precipitation on the basis of the precipitation grade and hourly distribution proportion based on the rain gauge data it is observed that the average precipitation duration total raining time during the day is around 0 1 0 8 and 5 2 h for trace precipitation light precipitation and moderate precipitation respectively for each precipitation grade the hourly proportions of daily precipitation are calculated fig 3 based on the distribution the daily precipitation is disaggregated to each hour 2 3 3 estimation of temperature lapse rate tlr tlr is estimated based on available meteorological stations in the vicinity li

monthly mean temperatures and altitudes at the four stations is 0 57 0 80 c 100 m r2 0 907 0 995 the high r2 values illustrate that the tlr has the potential to represent the temperature distribution in the study area and is thus used to describe the spatial variation of temperature 2 3 4 satellite data in web dhm s the vegetation dynamic parameters include lai leaf area index and fpar the

type in the study area is lithosol as mentioned in more detail in the introduction satellite imagery is the most effective tool to assess the distribution of snow martinec et al 2008 and satellite snow products have been used extensively for snow modeling immerzeel et al 2009 bocchiola et al 2011 in this study modis snow cover data from the terra platform at 1 day and 500 m resolution are used for model calibration and validation in addition lst derived from modis product mod11a1 v5 at 1 day and 1 km resolution can be used to assess model performance of catchment scale energy budget modeling wan 2008 zhou et al 2015 through interpolation both snow cover and lst products are resampled to match the dem data 2 4 evaluation criteria to evaluate the model performance the model

gauges installed at different altitudes within the catchment i e 3023 3255 3345 and 3396 m asl shows significant correlation table 3 thus it is reasonable to use these precipitation data to estimate the pg in the study area 3 2 runoff simulation during the calibration period five parameters are optimized to match the simulated runoff sca and lst with observed runoff and modis snow and lst products respectively the calibrated parameters and their calibration values taken as the base case are listed in table 4 together with other parameters determined based on the literature the simulated runoff values are compared with the observation at mabengnong hydrological station for the calibration period with hourly and weekly runoff fig 4 a and for validation period of june to october in 2012 with weekly runoff fig 4b the simulation captures the variation of the runoff with spring and summer flow peaks occurring mainly in response to snow melt and rainfall respectively the base case model performance of runoff simulation is acceptable with nse reaching 0 619 and 0 652 and r2 of 0 674 and 0 718 for model calibration and validation periods respectively table 5 3 3 snow cover area simulation the snow cover distribution and snow cover area sca simulation are compared with modis snow products grid by grid for each day if the modis data for a grid is cloud then the grid is removed from the comparison in order to reduce the effects of clouds in the modis snow products on model evaluation only the days with more than 50 valid data are selected for comparison snow covers almost the entire catchment in winter keeps melting and accumulating in response to occasional snow fall in spring melts completely in summer and starts accumulating and melting in fall it is shown that the model performance of snow cover simulation is even better than runoff simulation with nse of 0 616 and 0 632 and r2 of 0 682 and 0 686 for model calibration and validation period respectively fig 5 3 4 land surface temperature simulation lst is the key factor governing the surface atmosphere sensible and latent heat fluxes wang et al 2009b zhou et al 2015 it can be applied to evaluate catchment scale energy process modeling in this study according to the quality control fields included in mod11a1 v5 only high quality lst data with reported errors 1 k are selected for comparison fig 6 show the comparison of the catchment averaged lst between modis and simulation during 2012 2013 the simulation closely captures the seasonal variation of lst with higher values in summer and lower values in winter the results indicate that nse is 0 876 and 0 701 and r2 is 0 903 and 0 832 for model calibration and validation periods respectively table 5 3 5 sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of spatial and temporal variation of precipitation on runoff dynamics sensitivity analyses are conducted by changing the pg and hd of precipitation and comparing simulation results to the base case case 1 uses the same pg as the base case but uniform distribution of precipitation within the day case 2 uses pg of zero but the same hd as the base case case 3 uses pg of zero and uniform distribution of precipitation within the day the simulated runoff values are compared with the observation fig 4a and b with simulation evaluation criteria listed in table 5 sensitivity analysis shows that changing of pg and or hd does not significantly affect the catchment scale energy cycles as indicated by the lst simulation since temperature longwave and shortwave radiation are more important factors changing the hd of precipitation only alters the sca simulation slightly without consideration of pg runoff and sca are under estimated for about 43 and 87 respectively while the total precipitation rainfall and snowfall are under estimated for about 72 38 5 and 60 8 respectively moreover changing hd of precipitation influences the diurnal change of runoff simulation the reason for the effect of hd in runoff simulation is that the precipitation type is mainly rainfall during the intensive observation therefore the time for snow melting is almost 0 when there is heavier rainfall the runoff responds to it quickly 4 discussion as described here short term intensified field campaigns may be able to surmount difficulties in obtaining the spatial and temporal variation of precipitation pellicciotti et al 2012 ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 studies focusing on the spatial and temporal variation of precipitation contribute to better understanding of the characteristics of precipitation in high mountain areas ueno et al 2001 johansson and chen 2003 buytaert et al 2006 seasonal and annual pg have been applied in high mountain areas to improve precipitation input for hydrological models and the results are acceptable zhang et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2014 in this study daily pg and hd are characterized based on rain gauge data at different altitudes in the mabengnong catchment collected intensively for about one month during the rainy season these are used to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation based on daily precipitation of the nyingchi station and taking the pg and hd of precipitation into consideration hydrological model obtained reasonable simulation of runoff snow cover and lst for a two year period of model calibration and validation the model captures both the diurnal and the seasonal changes of hydrological processes in this high mountain catchment since the gridded precipitation input is generated based on daily precipitation of the nyingchi station for a few cases that precipitation did occur in the catchment but was not detected at the nyingchi station due to spatial heterogeneity the runoff and sca peaks could not be captured by the simulation in the study area snow cover evolution shows seasonal variation it occupies a large area with accumulating and melting processes in winter and early spring and is close to zero in summer as temperature increases the model simulation of snow cover is consistent with this but the difference between simulated snow cover and modis data is a little larger in some cases this may be because the accuracies of modis snow cover decrease with decreasing snow depth hall and riggs 2007 liang et al 2008 plus the snow would be patchier within a 500 m resolution grid when the snow pack is thin which may lead to confined snow detection klein and barnett 2003 therefore the poor performance of modis snow mapping at low snow depth could be the reason for the somewhat larger difference between the simulated and modis snow cover the model performs well in producing catchment averaged lst except that the simulated lst was occasionally larger than modis lst the reason may lie in cloud effects when a grid observed by satellite is covered by cloud the corresponding modis temperature would not be the lst but the cloud top temperature however there exist deficiencies in the cloud detection algorithm of modis platnick et al 2003 and modis lst data are believed to be affected by undetected clouds to some degree benali et al 2012 overall differences between simulated lst and modis lst are small most of the time indicating a reasonable simulation of energy cycles it is shown that intensive observation of precipitation even for only one month provides crucial information to understand the hydrological processes in the high mountain catchment considering pg according to trace light and moderate precipitation grades makes it more reasonable and reduces the uncertainties in estimates of aggregate pg in summer convective precipitation occurs at the local scale in the tibetan plateau strong upvalley wind leading to convective cumulus clouds during the day along with the presence of stratus clouds suppressing radiative cooling in the evening result in peak precipitation occurring at certain altitudes immerzeel et al 2014 the maximum precipitation zone should be close to the height of the cloud base in a simple convective system barry 2008 studies in the tibetan plateau have shown the maximum precipitation zone ranging between 3000 and 6900 m thomas 1997 putkonen 2004 wang et al 2009c du et al 2016 it should be noted that the rain gauges set up in this study do not cover the whole altitude range of the catchment due to inaccessibility in the higher altitude area however according to the previous study in the southeast and south central part of the tibetan plateau precipitation increases with altitude in high mountain areas 3600 6000 m and the annual pg is 19 66 mm 100 m cheng 1996 ohta et al 1994 moreover based on the daily precipitation at the nyingchi meteorological station in 2013 and daily pgs estimated above the annual pg of this study area is 41 8 mm 100 m which is consistent with of the previous studies in terms of magnitude since there are seasonal variations of pg in high mountain areas immerzeel et al 2014 the estimated pgs based on summer observation may not exactly describe the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in other months under these circumstances the current pgs significantly improve precipitation estimation and thus runoff simulation showing that the estimation is efficient and effective 5 conclusions in this study precipitation data acquired from four rain gauges installed at different altitudes in the high mountain mabengnong catchment and the nearby nyingchi meteorological station in the southeast of the tibetan plateau are analyzed correlation analysis indicates that the precipitation observed at different altitudes is highly correlated these data are thus applied to estimate pg and hd to provide model input of precipitation with reasonable spatial and temporal variation so as to improve our understanding and simulation of hydrological processes five main conclusions are derived from this study first the spatial variation of precipitation is mainly influenced by altitude in the study area with average precipitation gradient pg of 0 10 0 28 and 0 26 mm d 100 m for trace light and moderate precipitation respectively second the average precipitation hourly duration hd is about 0 1 0 8 and 5 2 h for trace light and moderate precipitation respectively with trace precipitation mostly occurring in the evening while the diurnal distribution of light and moderate precipitation is relatively uniform third gridded precipitation input obtained based on the pg and hd results enables the web dhm s model to generate accurate simulation of the water and energy cycles in the study area represented by runoff snow cover area and land surface temperature fourth sensitivity analysis demonstrates that simulated runoff is significantly underestimated without consideration of pg finally intensive precipitation observation can play an important role in improving hydrological

7571,despite precipitation intensities may greatly vary during one flood event detailed information about these intensities may not be required to accurately simulate floods with a hydrological model which rather reacts to cumulative precipitation sums this raises two questions to which extent is it important to preserve sub daily precipitation intensities and how long does it effectively rain from the hydrological point of view both questions might seem straightforward to answer with a direct analysis of past precipitation events but require some arbitrary choices regarding the length of a precipitation event to avoid these arbitrary decisions here we present an alternative approach to characterize the effective length of precipitation event which is based on runoff simulations with respect to large floods more precisely we quantify the fraction of a day over which the daily precipitation has to be distributed to faithfully reproduce the large annual and seasonal floods which were generated by the hourly precipitation rate time series new precipitation time series were generated by first aggregating the hourly observed data into daily totals and then evenly distributing them over sub daily periods n hours these simulated time series were used as input to a hydrological bucket type model and the resulting runoff flood peaks were compared to those obtained when using the original precipitation time series we define then the effective daily precipitation duration as the number of hours n for which the largest peaks are simulated best for nine mesoscale swiss catchments this effective daily precipitation duration was about half a day which indicates that detailed information on precipitation intensities is not necessarily required to accurately estimate peaks of the largest annual and seasonal floods these findings support the use of simple disaggregation approaches to make usage of past daily precipitation observations or daily precipitation simulations e g from climate models for hydrological modeling at an hourly time step keywords effective precipitation duration flood events annual peaks seasonal peaks flood type fuzzy approach 1 introduction switzerland is a country with high flood risk especially in its mountainous areas where a number of factors connected to topography and relief lead to a continually high disposition for floods weingartner et al 2003 in addition the damage potential has multiplied over the past decades due to an increase in built up areas and extensive construction activity according to the swiss confederation swiss federal council 2016 about 20 of switzerland s population 25 of its material assets and 30 of its workplaces are situated in flood prone areas total flood losses in the years 1972 2014 amounted to an annual mean of 270 mio eur andres et al 2015 due to anticipated changes in climate and land cover even more severe floods are expected in the future in switzerland koplin et al 2013 2014 academies of arts and sciences 2016 the accurate estimation of flood peaks is thus of high importance as a basis for prevention of and protection from flood related hazards in this context not only annual but even more importantly seasonal floods have been shown to lead more frequently to unexpectedly severe flood episodes as a result of human induced changes european environment agency 2012 hirsch and archfield 2015 hence it has been recently recommended that studies of annual extreme floods should be compounded with analysis of seasonal floods brunner et al 2017 fischer et al 2016 estimation of annual and seasonal flood peaks requires on the one hand information on the amount and intensity of the corresponding precipitation event at a temporal scale which is adequate to represent the causative processes on the other hand assessing possible alterations in flood responses as due to human induced changes implies using a hydrological model that needs to be calibrated with observed precipitation runoff data in this respect one of practical issues that one has to deal with is the feasibility of using observed precipitation data for flood simulations that may require higher resolutions than actually available indeed traditionally and particularly in the 20th century measurement of precipitation amounts has been restricted to daily totals for practical reasons only koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 pui et al 2012 this is also the case for switzerland where hourly stations have been regularly operated only since the mid 1980s seiz and foppa 2007 another challenge is that one may need to deal with are simulations of future precipitation conditions from climate models which are usually available at daily scales only yet in terms of mesoscale catchments catchment area of roughly 40 500 km2 flood generation is assumed to occur at an hourly rather than at a daily scale thus daily precipitation totals are usually assumed not to be suited to accurately simulate large flood peaks aronica et al 2005 wetterhall et al 2011 if higher resolution of precipitation data is needed determination of the extent to which such a sub daily distribution is necessary for hydrological modelling of large annual and seasonal peaks is not trivial a direct way would be to analyze observed precipitation time series and based on these compute the average length of large precipitation events however such an approach requires taking arbitrary decisions regarding the threshold intensity to use to define the occurrence of the precipitation event and to decide how long breaks in precipitation are allowed within one precipitation event as an alternative we here propose an approach to characterize the effective length of precipitation events more precisely we address the question of which fraction of a day it effectively rains from a hydrological point of view when the largest annual and seasonal runoff events are generated we hypothesize that as far as flood peaks are considered the effect of varying precipitation intensities can be assessed in an integrated way by varying the length of a precipitation event of constant precipitation intensities we speculate that this effect is due to the postponed catchment reaction represented with the time of concentration grimaldi et al 2012 and different usually mixed hydrological mechanisms lying behind such large annual and seasonal floods represented with distinctive flood types sikorska et al 2015b merz and bloschl 2003 while the time of concentration measures how fast the precipitation water needs to travel to the catchment outlet and thus represents catchment storage properties flood types synthesize information on major natural processes that have contributed to the flood generation and are not limited to precipitation driven floods only at the first sight this approach may seem similar to the previous studies that identified input rainfall errors from rainfall runoff data with the help of a hydrological model e g kavetski et al 2006a b mcmillan et al 2012 renard et al 2011 sikorska et al 2012 thyer et al 2009 yet in contrast to these studies we do not aim at inferring errors in precipitation data or in the model structure we here focus on the question of how observed daily precipitation totals with their errors should be distributed over a day so that the largest flood peaks can be simulated best to address this issue a hydrological bucket type model was used for the simulation of flood peaks with different precipitation hourly time series used as input we generated new precipitation time series by first aggregating the hourly observed precipitation data into daily totals and then evenly distributing these totals over n hours these time series are then fed into the hydrological model and the resulting largest runoff peaks are diagnosed according to the magnitude of their under over estimation we then define the effective daily precipitation duration as the number of hours n for which the simulated peaks were closest to those being simulated using the original hourly precipitation time series please note that effective refers to the duration and the term effective daily precipitation duration should not be confused with the term effective precipitation as the resulting runoff peak depends largely on how the precipitation total is distributed over time with runoff peaks decreasing if the same amount is distributed over more hours and increasing vice versa changes in simulated peak magnitudes can be assigned based on the choice of n hence our approach allows a quantification of the effective daily precipitation duration which is interesting for two reasons firstly our approach provides a quantification of catchment behaviour which combines precipitation characteristics and catchment responsiveness in one value we suggest that this is a useful metric for catchment characterisation secondly this analysis is of practical value as it provides an indication how much detail is required for the temporal disaggregation of daily precipitation totals such information indicates to which degree historical precipitation data or precipitation simulations from climate models at daily resolution might be sufficient to estimate flood peaks while numerous patterns would be possible our simple approach covers the most extreme cases of concentration of all precipitation to one or a few hours or the even distribution over several hours we tested our approach for nine mesoscale catchments in switzerland with 35 years of hourly precipitation and runoff observations we further looked at the flood mechanisms causing annual and seasonal peaks by categorizing them into flood types using a recently developed fuzzy decision

effective rainfall durations 2 material and methods 2 1 study catchments and data in this study data from nine mesoscale swiss catchments with the catchment area in the range of 40 500 km2 were used table 1 of the catchments two were located in northern switzerland two in western switzerland three in central switzerland and two in the bernese alps fig 1 and have mean catchment altitudes between 511 m a s l and 2050 m a s l all of the three alpine catchments have an area fraction of glaciers of more than 5 which requires an adequate glacier melt routine in the hydrological model observation data for these nine catchments cover on average the period of 34 5 years of hourly records of precipitation and runoff at the catchment outlet as observed precipitation data we used information from hourly gauging stations which were then averaged to catchment mean precipitation totals using a thiessen polygon method due to a relatively good coverage of gauging stations for the sample catchments which in switzerland is equal to 1 47 stations per 100 km2 on average viviroli et al 2011 we assume this interpolation approach to provide reasonable estimates of areal precipitation totals over the analyzed period high flows in these catchments were not influenced by power plants or hydropower stations nor by the presence of large lakes which allows us to assume that observed runoff peaks are governed solely by precipitation snowmelt and glacier melt dynamics the extent to which these factors govern catchment hydrology in each catchment is to a large degree determined by the mean catchment altitude and described by the regime type in this context we differentiate between three groups of catchments according to the altitude zones proposed by weingartner et al 2003 swiss plateau c1 c3 with the mean catchment altitude below 1000 m a s l hydrological processes are expected to be mainly dominated by precipitation pre alps and jura mountains c4 c6 with the mean catchment altitude between 1000 and 1500 m a s l here a mix of precipitation and snowmelt processes is predominant alps c7 c9 with the mean catchment altitude above 1500 m a s l snowpack and glaciers are expected to have a dominant control on runoff with limited precipitation contribution because all of our sample mesoscale catchments have an area of at least several tens of square kilometres runoff generation in these catchments is expected to be postponed in time following the time of concentration concept grimaldi et al 2012 we estimated this time of concentration with an approach common for flood estimation in switzerland spreafico et al 2003 as the maximum flow time in the catchment with assumed flow velocities of 1 5 m s 1 for the main channel and 0 5 m s 1 for all other areas see also viparelli 1963 and rickenmann 1996 the resulting times of concentration correlate with the catchment area in our nine catchments and range from a minimum of 4 h in the smallest catchment of grosstalbach at isenthal c7 to a maximum of 12 h in the largest pre alpine catchment of kleine emme at littau c4 for a more in depth and critical appraisal of estimating times of concentration the reader is referred to grimaldi et al 2012 2 2 characteristics of the observed large precipitation events as a direct approach to determine the average duration of large precipitation events we examined characteristics of these precipitation events that were contributing to the annual runoff peaks to this end we analysed the precipitation intensity and the precipitation duration at the day of the annual flood episode and during three days preceding the flood episode specifically we investigated over how many hours during a day different thresholds for the precipitation intensity were exceeded considered thresholds were 0 1 mm 1 mm and 3 mm per hour this exceedance length defines the precipitation duration during the analysed days for consistency with runoff simulations that represent cumulative sums at the catchment outlet we decided to define the daily precipitation as the sum from 0 00 until 23 59 opposite to the definition based on the time of precipitation gauge readings such as 6 00 5 59 in this way all precipitation falling within this window frame was attributed to the same day and as belonging to the same precipitation event 2 3 sub daily precipitation distribution schemes next observed hourly precipitation records were aggregated to daily totals using a time window of one to 24 h 01 00 24 00 h and then evenly redistributed into n consecutive hours within each day see fig 2 using values of 1 2 3 6 12 and 24 for n the latter implies a constant precipitation during the entire day meaning that daily totals are uniformly distributed within 24 h the first hour of precipitation was chosen randomly but ensuring that the entire precipitation fell during the day in question the random choice of the starting hour is important to avoid systematic errors in attributing daily precipitation totals always within the same time of the day e g always in the night because the selection of the first hour was done for each observation day independently the risk of choosing always the same hour within the 24 h days and the entire observation period could be minimized such generated different sub daily precipitation time series were next used as inputs for a hydrological model to simulate runoff at the catchment outlet 2 4 hydrological modeling hbv to simulate runoff at the catchment outlet we used a conceptual bucket type model i e hbv in the version light developed at the university of zurich seibert and vis 2012 this model has five major routines for modelling the precipitation excess snowmelt processes soil moisture and routing in the river and in high altitude catchments also glacier melt and thus is suitable for swiss conditions for more details on the hbv model the reader is referred to lindstrom et al 1997 and on hbv light to seibert and vis 2012 the hbv model was run in this study at an hourly scale and observed or generated hourly precipitation time series and temperature observed data were used as inputs to simulate runoff continuously at an hourly time scale 2 5 model set up calibration and uncertainty consideration the hbv model was calibrated in nine sample catchments with 15 years of observed hourly runoff and precipitation data years 1990 2005 these optimized parameter sets were never changed after the calibration and were used for all model simulations with different sub daily distribution schemes to calibrate the model we used a genetic algorithm and powell optimization gap approach seibert 2000 within a multi objective framework genetic algorithms gas have been proved to be powerful and flexible tools in searching optimal solutions in water related research nicklow et al 2010 the ga optimization relies on an evolutionary mechanism of selection and recombination of x parameter sets parameter population randomly selected within defined parameter boundaries the value of each selected set is weighted using defined objective functions and only those sets that give the highest values of objective functions are retained from these retained sets a new parameter population sets is generated and this process is repeated until the given maximal value of permitted model runs is reached next the best obtained parameter set is used as a starting point for a local optimization search using the powell s quadratically convergent method press et al 2002 in this study the total number of model runs was set to 3000 with 2500 runs for the ga and 500 runs for the local powell s optimization in the multi objective framework three objective functions were used the kling gupta efficiency kge the peaks efficiency pe and the logarithmic efficiency of runoff le gupta et al 2009 seibert 2003 vis et al 2015 which were weighted as 0 3 0 5 and 0 2 respectively each of these objective functions is defined in a similar way as the nash sutcliffe efficiency i e they values vary from 1 to where 1 represents the perfect fit between the simulated and the observed variable the same applies to the weighted efficiency we which is the weighted mean of the different objective functions the efficiency metrics and their weights were assigned in pre analysis aimed at maximizing the model we and its fit for peaks the achieved average we in all nine sample catchments in the calibration period was equal to 0 72 with an average kge equal to 0 79 le to 0 68 and pe equal to 0 70 in the period of the model application i e years 1980 2015 the we was on average equal to 0 62 kge to 0 77 le to 0 70 and pe to 0 5 as an approach to consider parameter uncertainties the model calibration in each catchment was repeated 100 times giving 100 model parameter sets for runoff simulations using these 100 model parameter sets continuous hourly runoff series for the period of 1980 2015 were simulated using six different sub daily precipitation distribution schemes 2 6 selection of annual and seasonal peaks from continuous runoff time series the hbv model simulates continuous runoff time series at an hourly scale from which annual and seasonal peaks need to be filtered these peaks were extracted following the common annual maxima series ams procedure and in a similar way for seasonal peaks seasonal maximum series sms approach for this purpose we defined four seasons within the calendar year as winter i iii spring iv vi summer vii ix and fall x xii for consistency between different simulation schemes the selection of annual and seasonal peaks was based on the runoff series simulated with the observed hourly precipitation pobs which was treated as the benchmark whereas peaks simulated with six sub daily distributed precipitations p1h p24h were selected as maximal peaks belonging to the same flood episodes to this end a window with a total duration of 6 days i e interval of 72 h before and after the maximum observed peak at an hourly time scale was set around the selected peaks simulated with benchmark precipitation within this window the highest flows i e peaks were searched for note that in the extreme case when the flood episode simulated with the benchmark occurs at the very end or beginning of the season year the peaks with simulated sub daily distribution schemes might be chosen in the following or preceding season year 2 7 assessment of simulated peaks the effective daily precipitation duration we further define the effective daily precipitation duration which corresponds to the catchment time of concentration with the difference that is determined from peak simulations of a hydrological model only this effective daily precipitation duration is described as a number of n hours for which the simulated runoff peaks with different sub daily precipitation distributions are closest to those being simulated with the hydrological model using the original hourly precipitation time series benchmark thus we always assess how much worse it is compared to using original precipitation hourly data distributed precipitation time series as input to the model we introduce here the term relative peak which is obtained by simply dividing a simulated peak by the benchmark peak hence if the relative peak equals unity the perfect agreement between the benchmark and simulated peak is obtained if the value of a relative peak is higher than 1 the peak is overestimated and if it falls below 1 it is underestimated the assessment of simulated peaks was further analysed by fitting empirical probability density functions pdfs to relative annual and seasonal peaks independently for each of six sub daily distribution schemes the sample size for constructing such pdfs depended on the record length in each catchment and consisted of roughly 34 5 annual or seasonal peaks on average such fitted pdfs provide additional insights into the efficiency in simulating peaks with different sub daily distribution schemes each fitted pdf can be expressed with the mode the most common value and the span of the pdf around this mode as for simulated relative peaks the second information is especially important because modes of different pdfs may lie at or close to the desired unity line but their span may vary representing the sample variability hence we are searching here for the pdf with the smallest span and the mode as close to unity as possible as mentioned above we used 100 different calibrated parameter sets to consider parameter uncertainty which means that 100 runoff time series were simulated and 100 simulated peak values were generated for each of six sub daily distribution schemes 3 results in the following detailed results are presented for two study catchments the lowest surb döttingen c1 and the highest lütschine gsteig c9 the results for these catchments can be assumed representative for all nine catchments as seen from the summarizing results presented for all nine sample catchments 3 1 characteristics of precipitation events preceding annual runoff peaks the analysis of precipitation characteristics during the largest peaks indicated that the duration of precipitation events depended on how we defined the intensity threshold for defining an hour as having precipitation for the smallest threshold considered p 0 1 mm h 1 the average precipitation event in most catchments lasted for several hours between 10 and 16 on the day the flood episode occurred and on the day directly preceding the flood event see fig 3 for example catchments increasing the intensity threshold p 1 mm h 1 resulted in shortening the average duration of the precipitation event to about 5 8 h on the day of the flood event and the day directly before finally setting the threshold at p 3 mm h 1 resulted in further shortening the average precipitation event duration which lasted less than 4 h on the day of the flood event and the day before precipitation characteristics in all nine sample catchments over 35 years demonstrated that most of the precipitation events which led to annual peaks in these catchments were long lasting several hours over at least two days and of a low hourly intensity p 1 mm h 1 furthermore similar to the findings for c1 and c9 catchments the definition of the threshold largely influenced the computed precipitation duration in all nine catchments on average the precipitation duration during the day of the flood event was 13 h when a threshold of 0 1 mm h 1 was used whereas it was 3 h for a threshold of 3 mm h 1 3 2 results from sensitivity analysis to the sub daily precipitation distribution 3 2 1 simulated annual peaks for the six precipitation distributions the relative annual peaks simulated with 100 different parameter sets showed that distributing the daily precipitation over only 1 3 h led to overestimated peaks in both c1 and c9 catchments fig 4 and this was also the case in most other sample catchments contrarily the precipitation distribution over 24 h resulted in underestimated peaks it appears therefore that the sub daily distribution over 6 and 12 h resulted in the best simulated peaks for all nine sample catchments the boxplots lie closest to the intersect line 1 the results for c1 and c9 generally also apply to the other catchments fig 5 the simulated peaks were closest to a mean of one when the daily precipitation was distributed over 12 h whereas shorter periods lead to overestimated peaks and the distribution over the entire day to an underestimation fig 6 further summarizes the results in the smaller catchments c7 c1 c3 different precipitation distribution schemes generally lead to considerable changes in the relative annual peaks ranging from marked underestimation to equally marked overestimation this is valid both for small catchments located on the swiss plateau c1 c3 and to a lower extent for the small alpine catchment c7 in our sample similar patterns were observed for two medium catchments c6 c2 the largest alpine catchments c8 c9 in turn were generally less sensitive to the choice of the distribution scheme in contrast the largest pre alpine catchment c4 was very sensitive to changes in the distribution the only jura catchment c5 appears to be insensitive to the choice of the hour distribution 3 2 2 simulated seasonal peaks for the six precipitation distributions the simulated seasonal peaks indicated that using distribution schemes of 1 3 h led to a marked overestimation of spring and winter peaks and a modest overestimation of summer and fall peaks in the catchment c1 swiss plateau a 24 h scheme always underestimated peaks independent of the season the peaks were simulated the best when using the 12 h distribution scheme fig 7 in the second catchment c9 alpine the degree of a sub daily distribution did not play any role for spring and winter peaks because all schemes provided a similarly good fit but it did play a role for fall and summer peaks for which the best estimation was observed for the 6 and then the 12 h precipitation distribution scheme analyzing detailed results in all nine sample catchments revealed similar patterns not shown to those already observed for annual peaks i e a 12 h distribution scheme simulated at best seasonal peaks for most catchments and this effect was observed to be independent of the season yet in the highest elevation alpine catchments c7 c9 the 6 h scheme was found to be a better choice for spring and summer peaks than a 12 h scheme but had wider confidence intervals 4 discussion 4 1 patterns in simulating annual and seasonal peaks with different precipitation sub daily distributions the effective daily precipitation duration was about 12 h in all catchments independent of the catchment size and the season this finding was demonstrated by the fact that a 12 h sub daily precipitation distribution scheme best simulated both annual and seasonal peaks a 6 h scheme was the second best choice and in alpine catchments it provided as good results as the 12 h scheme for spring and summer floods looking at the sample catchments examined a clear relation would be expected between the catchment area on the one hand and the best sub daily distribution on the other hand following mulvaney 1851 and his idealized assumptions for the rational method the major floods in a catchment are produced when the entire area contributes to runoff this state can be characterized by the time of concentration and is generally reached more quickly in smaller catchments since the maximum possible precipitation intensity increases when the event duration decreases this means that smaller catchments are particularly reactive to short but intensive precipitation events in producing their highest peaks in our analysis this pattern holds only to a limited extent this is because one needs additionally to consider several effects confounding the relation between the catchment area and the best distribution scheme first the concept of the time of concentration and the maximum contributing area refers to rainfall driven events only and is based on the concept of maximum possible peaks in contrast in our study we examine a series of annual and seasonal peaks observed in the past which to a large extent encompass events of a mixed genesis see section 4 5 the precipitation input thus provides only one contribution to the flood peak while the other contribution sometimes major comes from melt processes this explains why the differences between the various precipitation distribution schemes are comparatively small for large alpine catchments the significant contributions of snowmelt and to a smaller extent glacier melt call for consideration of distinctive hydrological processes leading to large floods that can be represented with specific flood types section 4 5 second small catchments may indeed be receptive for short and intense precipitation events when the causative precipitation event is not an isolated one but rather embedded in a longer lasting frontal event compressing the daily precipitation total into a few hours only may lead to unrealistically high precipitation input for the catchment and the hydrological model the result would be an overestimation of flood peaks for the sub daily distribution that corresponds to the time of concentration as also observed in our case for the smallest catchments finally it is also worth noting that all of our catchments are at least of roughly 40 km2 and thus fell rather into a medium large size catchment group in which large floods are rather due to precipitation events of several hours or intense snowmelt rain on snow events merz and bloschl 2003 this could be explained with an extended time of concentration in such larger catchments thus in catchments smaller than analysed here 40 km2 a more detailed sub daily precipitation distribution scheme could still be expected to be important similarly in catchments larger than those investigated here or having a slower response time a disaggregation of daily totals into sub daily sums may not be needed 4 2 usefulness of the effective daily precipitation duration concept a direct analysis of precipitation event durations of the largest floods partly confirmed our findings from this simulation study but as expected additionally highlighted problems with defining the precipitation event duration based only on precipitation data thus depending on how we set the threshold for defining the precipitation occurrence very different results can be obtained this further shows that such arbitrary choices may indeed impact results and conclusions drawn from them in contrast our approach provides an alternative way of determining the effective daily precipitation duration from runoff simulations only hence it avoids making such arbitrary decisions related to the precipitation duration and the minimal precipitation intensity as it purely examines the effect of different precipitation distributions on simulated runoff peaks thus it is more efficient from a hydrological point of view focusing solely on the effect in simulating peaks with a hydrological model instead of precipitation also ensures our method to be independent from the type of the flood event considered thus it is suitable for any type of flood and also for those types that are not driven by precipitation events such as related to snow glacier melt processes this is one of the major advantages over the direct analysis of precipitation information which is thus limited to precipitation driven events only hence our approach may provide a feasible alternative to more advanced statistical approaches despite the fact that the detailed information on precipitation intensity variability becomes lost during aggregating and redistributing precipitation totals it has to be noted however that one reason for this might be the finding of the effective daily precipitation duration of about 12 h meaning that the exact precipitation intensity within a shorter period was in our case not so important these findings support the use of such a simple precipitation distribution approach which has several practical applications it complements more current records available at hourly resolutions with past records disaggregated to sub daily sums allowing for more detailed retrospective analysis of past floods together with runoff data that is usually available at sub daily time steps from longer periods it supports continuous hydrological modelling at hourly resolutions kossieris et al 2018 it extends the pool of observed flood events for statistical reasoning of extremes for which a large data sample is required reed 2002 but also for investigating flood processes finally it allows making usage of precipitation simulations from climate models that are currently available at a daily scale to investigate impacts on flow dynamics and flood magnitudes 4 3 robustness of results and uncertainties there are several potential sources of uncertainty in this work which might affect estimation of annual and seasonal peaks first of all both observational data i e precipitation and runoff are subject to measurement and representation uncertainty mostly precipitation which cannot be completely neglected but are difficult to quantify as the true values are not known e g di baldassarre and montanari 2009 mcmillan et al 2012 sikorska and renard 2017 sikorska et al 2018 to minimize this type of error both runoff and precipitation data were checked for inconsistency or systematic errors prior to the analysis by visual assessment and analysis of water balance components next the runoff simulations are uncertain due to the structural limitations of the hydrological model hbv its parametric uncertainty and boundary conditions as due to choices of initial values for state variables kuczera et al 2010 sikorska et al 2012 the latter source can be minimized by setting up a warm up period prior to the simulation and seibert and vis 2012 have revealed that one year of such a warm up period is sufficient for this kind of model and thus was also used in this study the structural uncertainty is linked to the structure of the hydrological model used in this study and affects estimation of all other uncertainty sources including model parameters sikorska et al 2015a this structural uncertainty source cannot be avoided in any environmental conceptual model but because the same model was always used with the same settings initial conditions model structure type model parameters for all sub daily precipitation distribution schemes this allowed us to assume that this uncertainty contribution was always the same and thus did not affect our results finally the parametric uncertainty was considered by using multiple 100 parameter sets for model simulations this should minimize the effect of the parameter uncertainty on the obtained results and demonstrated how strong results depend on the choice of the parameter set chosen for the hydrological model as our findings manifested the conclusions did not depend on the choice of the parameter set because flood peaks with different sub daily precipitation distribution schemes were always over or underestimated by the same magnitude 4 4 methodological aspects and study limitations our analysis is based on sampling peaks according to the annual maximum am and seasonal maximum sm approach by compounding our analysis with seasonal peaks we demonstrated that our findings hold not only for large annual but also for more frequent and thus smaller peaks i e in total 4 peaks per annum are selected the choice of am and sm approaches was in our case favorable to investigate seasonal flood events and to cover the flood variability resulting from different flood types optionally peaks could also have been chosen with a peak over threshold pot approach which selects peaks not on the maximum per period criterion but based on a preselected threshold flow value although the pot approach is often preferred both pot and am approaches have been proven to provide similar results in case of long time series tanaka and takara 2002 thus using the pot approach with a low threshold would result in selecting peaks of magnitudes similar to those chosen with the sm approach and thus would not change our major findings our method relies on evenly distributing precipitation daily totals into sub daily sums of constant precipitation intensities if a diversification of precipitation intensities at sub daily intervals is required one could use certain patterns such as a triangular shape instead of the uniform distribution an optimal distribution function could also be investigated from observed data furthermore the method is based on a random selection of the first hour for different sub daily precipitation distribution schemes although the choice of this hour plays potentially an important role for model simulations as we always randomly selected this hour for each simulation day independently over roughly 35 years of simulations this effect could have been minimized another discussion point is linked to the way the hydrological model is used in this study namely that it was pre calibrated with hourly observations of precipitation and runoff data the effect of the sub daily precipitation distribution on simulated peaks was then assessed on the basis of this model keeping model parameters constant this means two things first for calibrating the model at least some short series of hourly precipitation runoff data are required in this respect sikorska et al 2018 have proposed a suitable method for assessing the minimum length of the calibration period needed to obtain a sensible model performance in the case that no calibration data are available this restriction could be alleviated by deriving model parameters from regionalisation approaches parajka et al 2013 a limited number of runoff measurements seibert and beven 2009 or a combination of both viviroli and seibert 2015 but would add additional uncertainty to results second calibration on precipitation and runoff data with an interval of more than one hour could lead to a different model performance when using the corresponding distribution of daily precipitation totals for simulation our study did not examine this effect as we explicitly focused on hourly values as a starting point finally our simulations were assessed with the hbv model which is a typical bucket type model with several hydrological processes being represented in a conceptual manner as important for our study such a model uses lumped inputs computed as mean areal precipitation totals and thus the spatial representation of precipitation events does not play any significant role the temporal distribution of precipitation still remains important but is represented with lumped values at the catchment scale only thus for other type of models distributed with a more detailed spatial description of precipitation inputs a different distribution extent of precipitation totals may be required which can be assessed with the method proposed in this study yet in our opinion the necessary extent of precipitation distribution depends largely on the delay in the catchment reaction relative to the triggering input and only to a lower extent on the model type chosen for simulating floods as long as peaks of large floods are considered like in this study following the last point it has to be stressed that our study focuses only on the effect which evenly distributing daily precipitation totals into sub daily sums has on the peaks of large floods whereas the effect on the evolution of flood events is here not considered we expect that a more detailed representation of precipitation distributions within a day will play a role if other characteristics of flood events or the entire flood hydrographs are of one s interest indeed these aspects have been recently quantified by sikorska and seibert 2017 who tested different options of averaging observed hourly precipitation time series for an acceptable model performance focusing on entire hydrographs in their study they found that the sufficient length of precipitation averaging window varied from 1 to 24 h depending on the catchment size and the source of precipitation records our findings on the effective daily precipitation duration equal to half a day falls in the middle of this range which is reasonable given the size of our sample catchments despite these limitations results of our study proved that this approach is suitable for identifying an optimal effective temporal length for sub daily precipitation distribution in mesoscale catchments and thus it can be used as a hydrological alternative to a direct analysis of precipitation data therewith it enables making a usage of daily precipitation data for flood simulations and particularly for analysis of flood peaks at an hourly resolution 4 5 hydrological reasoning flood types of annual and seasonal floods the simulation study presented above purely examined magnitude changes in flood peaks with only a limited process understanding expressed with the flood seasonality episode occurrence within a year but without looking at flood drivers thus treating all floods as one group the major challenge of pooling all floods together is the non possibility to distinguish between different processes driving floods which may potentially play a role in defining the effective daily precipitation duration for instance this value would be rather smaller for flash floods driven by short intensive precipitation events than for slowly rising floods due to melt processes in this respect the recently developed fuzzy flood type decision tree sikorska et al 2015b enables hydrological reasoning to be incorporated into peaks analysis by diagnosing flood causative mechanisms responsible for observed episodes therewith the tree allows the splitting of the flood sample into sub groups of specific flood types according to their observed properties using similarity metrics flood indices the splitting into sub groups is performed by attributing fuzzy memberships m f defined from 0 to 1 the m f equal 0 means that a certain flood type did not occur probability equals 0 and 1 that this type occurred with certainty probability equals 1 while memberships in the range from 0 to 1 are attributed depending on how strongly the event belongs to a certain flood type see sikorska et al 2015b for more details note that the flood tree does not allow an exact value of the effective daily precipitation duration to be identified as it was possible with our simulation study but only pre defined classes of events i e flood types following sikorska et al 2015b we considered here six distinctive flood types which are flash floods ff short rainfall floods srf long rainfall floods lrf rain on snow events rosf snowmelt events smf and glacier melt floods gmf as for this study the important information contained in these flood types is the duration of the precipitation event and its intensity and both of these characteristics vary by definition between the six types considered here namely ffs are defined by very short 12 h and intensive rainfall events and are implicitly spatially limited to smaller catchments in this study with an area 120 km2 srfs correspond to short rainfall events with a precipitation duration of 12 24 h and an average precipitation intensity lrfs and rosfs are both long lasting events 24 h with the precipitation of low intensity with the difference that rosf occurs as a rainfall event on snow cover accumulated in the catchment whereas lrf is generated without any significant contribution from snow cover smfs and gmfs are both driven by melted water originating from snowpack smf or glacier gmf with an insignificant contribution from rainfall and can only occur if a snowpack or glacier are present in the catchment prior to the event application of the fuzzy decision tree in our sample catchments revealed that among annual floods srf and rosf were detected as dominant flood types in plateau catchments c1 c3 with average memberships m f of 0 55 and 0 32 and in pre alpine and jura catchments c4 c6 m f equal to 0 56 and 0 41 in alpine catchments c7 c8 srfs 0 33 rosfs 0 31 glacier melt floods gmfs 0 17 and in the smallest alpine catchment c7 ffs 0 20 were also determined as dominant flood types of annual peaks considering seasonal flood types seasonal floods in plateau m f 0 61 and in jura and pre alpine catchments 0 52 were distinctly dominated by srf mostly responsible for spring summer and fall peaks the second major contribution was due to rosf events 0 20 and 0 43 respectively which contributed mostly to winter peaks seasonal floods in alpine catchments c7 c9 were identified mostly due to rosf events with a contribution of 0 51 on average and were mostly detected in winter and fall srf events were the second major contribution 0 30 and were detected in spring summer and fall seasons other contributions were due to flash floods ff 0 09 only in c7 and in summer and spring and glacier melt floods gmf 0 07 in spring and summer fig 8 these observations on annual and seasonal flood types found that large annual and seasonal floods a were mostly driven by events of a mixed genesis and b mostly induced by precipitation events lasting at least several hours but shorter than a day for which an exact precipitation distribution is of low importance hence these results of the flood type categorization are consistent with our findings from this simulation study suggesting that the effective daily precipitation duration for annual and seasonal floods can be assumed as 12 h thus an even distribution of precipitation daily totals over several hours rather than only a few hours is most suitable yet when looking only on flood magnitudes peaks within the simulation study even with information of their seasonality it would not have provided enough information to draw sensible conclusions because it leaves room for misinterpretation using a flood type tree enabled us thus to better understand our simulation results already several recent studies have pointed out that flood analysis should incorporate process understanding brunner et al 2017 merz and bloschl 2008 sauquet and catalogne 2011 for example brunner et al 2017 have demonstrated that information on specific flood types can support flood frequency analysis with additional information on flood behaviour and seasonality this information may be particularly useful in flood predictions and flood risk management and allows for more dedicated flood prevention designed to a specific flood type event merz and bloschl 2008 proposed a flood frequency hydrology which incorporates hydrological processes into statistical frequency analysis as a needed step towards improving designed flood predictions our results also demonstrate the suitability of such a dedicated flood tree approach to qualitatively analyse results of hydrological simulations and to diagnose observed floods and in this way to support results obtained with formal methods with hydrological reasoning 5 conclusions the results of this study allow us to draw the following conclusions the duration of precipitation events leading to annual flood peaks depends strongly on how we define the threshold precipitation intensity for the event in our case most of the observed precipitation events lasted over about 13 h on the day of the flood event and the day before when assuming the threshold of 0 1 mm h 1 but only 3 h if the threshold was increased to 3 mm h 1 the best choice for simulating annual and seasonal peaks in the studied catchments was a sub daily precipitation distribution scheme over 12 h assessed by relative peaks sub daily distributions over 1 3 h always overestimated peaks while a 24 h scheme always slightly underestimated peaks a 6 h scheme usually overestimated peaks in plateau jura and pre alpine catchments but was the second best choice for alpine catchments results from our study indicate that the exact distribution of precipitation during a day might be less important and simple disaggregation schemes like the uniform distribution might be sufficient for simulating largest flood peaks in catchments similar to investigated here while short time precipitation variations are still expected to be important for small catchments for catchments above 40 km2 the effective daily precipitation duration was in the order of 12 h for catchments larger than 500 km2 or slow reacting catchments we expect that a sub daily distribution would not be needed our simulation findings are consistent with flood processes driving observed large floods most of the annual and seasonal flood events were identified as mixed genesis and either with a major contribution of precipitation events of at least 12 h with medium to low precipitation intensities or due to rain on snow events for which an exact sub daily precipitation distribution within a day becomes irrelevant finally we present here a novel method to evaluate the effective daily precipitation duration from hydrological simulations which is useful to characterise precipitation characteristics for different catchments and different geographic regions and for their inter comparison without the need to analyze precipitation data our method as an inverse approach allows for estimating the degree of sub daily precipitation disaggregation needed which is useful for extending hourly records or making usage of daily precipitation totals such as from climate model simulations available currently at daily resolutions acknowledgments this research is a

7571,despite precipitation intensities may greatly vary during one flood event detailed information about these intensities may not be required to accurately simulate floods with a hydrological model which rather reacts to cumulative precipitation sums this raises two questions to which extent is it important to preserve sub daily precipitation intensities and how long does it effectively rain from the hydrological point of view both questions might seem straightforward to answer with a direct analysis of past precipitation events but require some arbitrary choices regarding the length of a precipitation event to avoid these arbitrary decisions here we present an alternative approach to characterize the effective length of precipitation event which is based on runoff simulations with respect to large floods more precisely we quantify the fraction of a day over which the daily precipitation has to be distributed to faithfully reproduce the large annual and seasonal floods which were generated by the hourly precipitation rate time series new precipitation time series were generated by first aggregating the hourly observed data into daily totals and then evenly distributing them over sub daily periods n hours these simulated time series were used as input to a hydrological bucket type model and the resulting runoff flood peaks were compared to those obtained when using the original precipitation time series we define then the effective daily precipitation duration as the number of hours n for which the largest peaks are simulated best for nine mesoscale swiss catchments this effective daily precipitation duration was about half a day which indicates that detailed information on precipitation intensities is not necessarily required to accurately estimate

introduction switzerland is a country with high flood risk especially in its mountainous areas where a number of factors connected to topography and relief lead to a continually high disposition for floods weingartner et al 2003 in addition the damage potential has multiplied over the past decades due to an increase in built up areas and extensive construction activity according to the swiss confederation swiss federal council 2016 about 20 of switzerland s population 25 of its material assets and 30 of its workplaces are situated in flood prone areas total flood losses in the years 1972 2014 amounted to an annual mean of 270 mio eur andres et al 2015 due to anticipated changes in climate and land cover even more severe floods are expected in the future in switzerland koplin et al 2013 2014 academies of arts and sciences 2016 the accurate estimation of flood peaks is thus of high importance as a basis for prevention of and protection from flood related hazards in this context not only annual but even more importantly seasonal floods have been shown to lead more frequently to unexpectedly severe flood episodes as a result of human induced changes european environment agency 2012 hirsch and archfield 2015 hence it has been recently recommended that studies of annual extreme floods should be compounded with analysis of seasonal floods brunner et al 2017 fischer et al 2016 estimation of annual and seasonal flood peaks requires on the one hand information on the amount and intensity of the corresponding precipitation event at a temporal scale which is adequate to represent the causative processes on the other hand assessing possible alterations in flood responses as due to human induced changes implies using a hydrological model that needs to be calibrated with observed precipitation runoff data in this respect one of practical issues that one has to deal with is the feasibility of using observed precipitation data for flood simulations that may require higher resolutions than actually available indeed traditionally and particularly in the 20th century measurement of precipitation amounts has been restricted to daily totals for practical reasons only koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 pui et al 2012 this is also the case for switzerland where hourly stations have been regularly operated only since the mid 1980s seiz and foppa 2007 another challenge is that one may need to deal with are simulations of future precipitation conditions from climate models which are usually available at daily scales only yet in terms of mesoscale catchments catchment area of roughly 40 500 km2 flood generation is assumed to occur at an hourly rather than at a daily scale thus daily precipitation totals are usually assumed not to be suited to accurately simulate large flood peaks aronica et al 2005 wetterhall et al 2011 if higher resolution of precipitation data is needed determination of the extent to which such a sub daily distribution is necessary for hydrological modelling of large annual and seasonal peaks is not trivial a direct way would be to analyze observed precipitation time series and based on these compute the average length of large precipitation events however such an approach requires taking arbitrary decisions regarding the threshold intensity to use to define the occurrence of the precipitation event and to decide how long breaks in precipitation are allowed within one precipitation event as an alternative we here propose an approach to characterize the effective length of precipitation events more precisely we address the question of which fraction of a day it effectively rains from a hydrological point of view when the largest annual and seasonal runoff events are generated we hypothesize that as far as flood peaks are considered the effect of varying precipitation intensities can be assessed in an integrated way by varying the length of a precipitation event of constant precipitation intensities we speculate that this effect is due to the postponed catchment reaction represented with the time of concentration grimaldi et al 2012 and different usually mixed hydrological mechanisms lying behind such large annual and seasonal floods represented with distinctive flood types sikorska et al 2015b merz and bloschl 2003 while the time of concentration measures how fast the precipitation water needs to travel to the catchment outlet and thus represents catchment storage properties flood types synthesize information on major natural processes that have contributed to the flood generation and are not limited to precipitation driven floods only at the first sight this approach may seem similar to the previous studies that identified input rainfall errors from rainfall runoff data with the help of a hydrological model e g kavetski et al 2006a b mcmillan et al 2012 renard et al 2011 sikorska et al 2012 thyer et al 2009 yet in contrast to these studies we do not aim at inferring errors in precipitation data or in the model structure we here focus on the question of how observed daily precipitation totals with their errors should be distributed over a day so that the largest flood peaks can be simulated best to address this issue a hydrological bucket type model was used for the simulation of flood peaks with different precipitation hourly time series used as input we generated new precipitation time series by first aggregating the hourly observed precipitation data into daily totals and then evenly distributing these totals over n hours these time series are then fed into the hydrological model and the resulting largest runoff peaks are diagnosed according to the magnitude of their under over estimation we then define the effective daily precipitation duration as the number of hours n for which the simulated peaks were closest to those being simulated using the original hourly precipitation time series please note that effective refers to the duration and the term effective daily precipitation duration should not be confused with the term effective precipitation as the resulting runoff peak depends largely on how the precipitation total is distributed over time with runoff peaks decreasing if the same amount is distributed over more hours and increasing vice versa changes in simulated peak magnitudes can be assigned based on the choice of n hence our approach allows a quantification of the effective daily precipitation duration which is interesting for two reasons firstly our approach provides a quantification of catchment behaviour which combines precipitation characteristics and catchment responsiveness in one value we suggest that this is a useful metric for catchment characterisation secondly this analysis is of practical value as it provides an indication how much detail is required for the temporal disaggregation of daily precipitation totals such information indicates to which degree historical precipitation data or precipitation simulations from climate models at daily resolution might be sufficient to estimate flood peaks while numerous patterns would be possible our simple approach covers the most extreme cases of concentration of all precipitation to one or a few hours or the even distribution over several hours we tested our approach for nine mesoscale catchments in switzerland with 35 years of hourly precipitation and runoff observations we further looked at the flood mechanisms causing annual and seasonal peaks by categorizing them into flood types using a recently developed fuzzy decision tree sikorska et al 2015b please note that this study focuses purely on the effect of precipitation daily totals evenly distributed into n hours on simulated runoff largest annual and seasonal peaks

estimation of the best precipitation disaggregation approach e g kossieris et al 2018 pui et al 2012 both are a research focus on their own and are not considered in our approach to estimate the effective rainfall durations 2 material and methods 2 1 study catchments and data in this study data from nine mesoscale swiss catchments with the catchment area in the range of 40 500 km2 were used table 1 of the catchments two were located in northern switzerland two in western switzerland three in central switzerland and two in the bernese alps fig 1 and have mean catchment altitudes between 511 m a s l and 2050 m a s l all of the three alpine catchments have an area fraction of glaciers of more than 5 which requires an adequate glacier melt routine in the hydrological model observation data for these nine catchments cover on average the period of 34 5 years of hourly records of precipitation and runoff at the catchment outlet as observed precipitation data we used information from hourly gauging stations which were then averaged to catchment mean precipitation totals using a thiessen polygon method due to a relatively good coverage of gauging stations for the sample catchments which in switzerland is equal to 1 47 stations per 100 km2 on average viviroli et al 2011 we assume this interpolation approach to provide reasonable estimates of areal precipitation totals over the analyzed period high flows in these catchments were not influenced by power plants or hydropower stations nor by the presence of large lakes which allows us to assume that observed runoff peaks are governed solely by precipitation snowmelt and glacier melt dynamics the extent to which these factors govern catchment hydrology in each catchment is to a large degree determined by the mean catchment altitude and described by the regime type in this context we differentiate between three groups of catchments according to the altitude zones proposed by weingartner et al 2003 swiss plateau c1 c3 with the mean catchment altitude below 1000 m a s l hydrological processes are expected to be mainly dominated by precipitation pre alps and jura mountains c4 c6 with the mean catchment altitude between 1000 and 1500 m a s l here a mix of precipitation and snowmelt processes is predominant alps c7 c9 with the mean catchment altitude above 1500 m a s l snowpack and glaciers are expected to have a dominant control on runoff with limited precipitation contribution because all of our sample mesoscale catchments have an area of at least several tens of square kilometres runoff generation in these catchments is expected to be postponed in time following the time of concentration concept grimaldi et al 2012 we estimated this time of concentration with an approach common for flood estimation in switzerland spreafico et al 2003 as the maximum flow time in the catchment with assumed flow velocities of 1 5 m s 1 for the main channel and 0 5 m s 1 for all other areas see also viparelli 1963 and rickenmann 1996 the resulting times of concentration correlate with the catchment area in our nine catchments and range from a minimum of 4 h in the smallest catchment of grosstalbach at isenthal c7 to a maximum of 12 h in the largest pre alpine catchment of kleine emme at littau c4 for a more in depth and critical appraisal of estimating times of concentration the reader is referred to grimaldi et al 2012 2 2 characteristics of the observed large precipitation events as a direct approach to determine the average duration of large precipitation events we examined characteristics of these precipitation events that were contributing to the annual runoff peaks to this end we analysed the precipitation intensity and the precipitation duration at the day of the annual flood episode and during three days preceding the flood episode specifically we investigated over how many hours during a day different thresholds for the precipitation intensity were exceeded considered thresholds were 0 1 mm 1 mm and 3 mm per hour this exceedance length defines the precipitation duration during the analysed days for consistency with runoff simulations that represent cumulative sums at the catchment outlet we decided to define the daily precipitation as the sum from 0 00 until 23 59 opposite to the definition based on the time of precipitation gauge readings such as 6 00 5 59 in this way all precipitation falling within this window frame was attributed to the same day and as belonging to the same precipitation event 2 3 sub daily precipitation distribution schemes next observed hourly precipitation records were aggregated to daily totals using a time window of one to 24 h 01 00 24 00 h and then evenly redistributed into n consecutive hours within each day see fig 2 using values of 1 2 3 6 12 and 24 for n the latter implies a constant precipitation during the entire day meaning that daily totals are uniformly distributed within 24 h the first hour of precipitation was chosen randomly but ensuring that the entire precipitation fell during the day in question the random choice of the starting hour is important to avoid systematic errors in attributing daily precipitation totals always within the same time of the day e g always in the night because the selection of the first hour was done for each observation day independently the risk of choosing always the same hour within the 24 h days and the entire observation period could be minimized such generated different sub daily precipitation time series were next used as inputs for a hydrological model to simulate runoff at the catchment outlet 2 4 hydrological modeling hbv to simulate runoff at the catchment outlet we used a conceptual bucket type model i e hbv in the version light developed at the university of zurich seibert and vis 2012 this model has five major routines for modelling the precipitation excess snowmelt processes soil moisture and routing in the river and in high altitude catchments also glacier melt and thus is suitable for swiss conditions for more details on the hbv model the reader is referred to lindstrom et al 1997 and on hbv light to seibert and vis 2012 the hbv model was run in this study at an hourly scale and observed or generated hourly precipitation time series and temperature observed data were used as inputs to simulate runoff continuously at an hourly time scale 2 5 model set up calibration and uncertainty consideration the hbv model was calibrated in nine sample catchments with 15 years of observed hourly runoff and precipitation data years 1990 2005 these optimized parameter sets were never changed after the calibration and were used for all model simulations with different sub daily distribution schemes to calibrate the model we used a genetic algorithm and powell optimization gap approach seibert 2000 within a multi objective framework genetic algorithms gas have been proved to be powerful and flexible tools in searching optimal solutions in water related research nicklow et al 2010 the ga optimization relies on an evolutionary mechanism of selection and recombination of x parameter sets parameter population randomly selected within defined parameter boundaries the value of each selected set is weighted using defined objective functions and only those sets that give the highest values of objective functions are retained from these retained sets a new parameter population sets is generated and this process is repeated until the given maximal value of permitted model runs is reached next the best obtained parameter set is used as a starting point for a local optimization search using the powell s quadratically convergent method press et al 2002 in this study the total number of model runs was set to 3000 with 2500 runs for the ga and 500 runs for the local powell s optimization in the multi objective framework three objective functions were used the kling gupta efficiency kge the peaks efficiency pe and the logarithmic efficiency of runoff le gupta et al 2009 seibert 2003 vis et al 2015 which were weighted as 0 3 0 5 and 0 2 respectively each of these objective functions is defined in a similar way as the nash sutcliffe efficiency i e they values vary from 1 to where 1 represents the perfect fit between the simulated and the observed variable the same applies to the weighted efficiency we which is the weighted mean of the different objective functions the efficiency metrics and their weights were assigned in pre analysis aimed at maximizing the model we and its fit for peaks the achieved average we in all nine sample catchments in the calibration period was equal to 0 72 with an average kge equal to 0 79 le to 0 68 and pe equal to 0 70 in the period of the model application i e years 1980 2015 the we was on average equal to 0 62 kge to 0 77 le to 0 70 and pe to 0 5 as an approach to consider parameter uncertainties the model calibration in each catchment was repeated 100 times giving 100 model parameter sets for runoff simulations using these 100 model parameter sets continuous hourly runoff series for the period of 1980 2015 were simulated using six different sub daily precipitation distribution schemes 2 6 selection of annual and seasonal peaks from continuous runoff time series the hbv model simulates continuous runoff time series at an hourly scale from which annual and seasonal peaks need to be filtered these peaks were extracted following the common annual maxima series ams procedure and in a similar way for seasonal peaks seasonal maximum series sms approach for this purpose we defined four seasons within the calendar year as winter i iii spring iv vi summer vii ix and fall x xii for consistency between different simulation schemes the selection of annual and seasonal peaks was based on the runoff series simulated with the observed hourly precipitation pobs which was treated as the benchmark whereas peaks simulated with six sub daily distributed precipitations p1h p24h were selected as maximal peaks belonging to the same flood episodes to this end a window with a total duration of 6 days i e interval of 72 h before and after the maximum observed peak at an hourly time scale was set around the selected peaks simulated with benchmark precipitation within this window the highest flows i e peaks were searched for note that in the extreme case when the flood episode simulated with the benchmark occurs at the very end or beginning of the season year the peaks with simulated sub daily distribution schemes might be chosen in the following or preceding season year 2 7 assessment of simulated peaks the effective daily precipitation duration we further define the effective daily precipitation duration which corresponds to the catchment time of concentration with the difference that is determined from peak simulations of a hydrological model only this effective daily precipitation duration is described as a number of n hours for which the simulated runoff peaks with different sub daily precipitation distributions are closest to those being simulated with the hydrological model using the original hourly precipitation time series benchmark thus we always assess how much worse it is compared to using original precipitation hourly data distributed precipitation time series as input to the model we introduce here the term relative peak which is obtained by simply dividing a simulated peak by the benchmark peak hence if the relative peak equals unity the perfect agreement between the benchmark and simulated peak is obtained if the value of a relative peak is higher than 1 the peak is overestimated and if it falls below 1 it is underestimated the assessment of simulated peaks was further analysed by fitting empirical probability density functions pdfs to relative annual and seasonal peaks independently for each of six sub daily distribution schemes the sample size for constructing such pdfs depended on the record length in each catchment and consisted of roughly 34 5 annual or seasonal peaks on average such fitted pdfs provide additional insights into the efficiency in simulating peaks with different sub daily distribution schemes each fitted pdf can be expressed with the mode the most common value and the span of the pdf around this mode as for simulated relative peaks the second information is especially important because modes of different pdfs may lie at or close to the desired unity line but their span may vary representing the sample variability hence we are searching here for the pdf with the smallest span and the mode as close to unity as possible as mentioned above we used 100 different calibrated parameter sets to consider parameter uncertainty which means that 100 runoff time series were simulated and 100 simulated peak values were generated for each of six sub daily distribution schemes 3 results in the following detailed results are presented for two study catchments the lowest surb döttingen c1 and the highest lütschine gsteig c9 the results for these catchments can be assumed representative for all nine catchments as seen from the summarizing results presented for all nine sample catchments 3 1 characteristics of precipitation events preceding annual runoff peaks the analysis of precipitation characteristics during the largest peaks indicated that the duration of precipitation events depended on how we defined the intensity threshold for defining an hour as having precipitation for the smallest threshold considered p 0 1 mm h 1 the average precipitation event in most catchments lasted for several hours between 10 and 16 on the day the flood episode occurred and on the day directly preceding the flood event see fig 3 for example catchments increasing the intensity threshold p 1 mm h 1 resulted in shortening the average duration of the precipitation event to about 5 8 h on the day of the flood event and the day directly before finally setting the threshold at p 3 mm h 1 resulted in further shortening the average precipitation event duration which lasted less than 4 h on the day of the flood event and the day before precipitation characteristics in all nine sample catchments over 35 years demonstrated that most of the precipitation events which led to annual peaks in these catchments were long lasting several hours over at least two days and of a low hourly intensity p 1 mm h 1 furthermore similar to the findings for c1 and c9 catchments the definition of the threshold largely influenced the computed precipitation duration in all nine catchments on average the precipitation duration during the day of the flood event was 13 h when a threshold of 0 1 mm h 1 was used whereas it was 3 h for a threshold of 3 mm h 1 3 2 results from sensitivity analysis to the sub daily precipitation distribution 3 2 1 simulated annual peaks for the six precipitation distributions the relative annual peaks simulated with 100 different parameter sets showed that distributing the daily precipitation over only 1 3 h led to overestimated peaks in both c1 and c9 catchments fig 4 and this was also the case in most other sample catchments contrarily the precipitation distribution over 24 h resulted in underestimated peaks it appears therefore that the sub daily distribution over 6 and 12 h resulted in the best simulated peaks for all nine sample catchments the boxplots lie closest to the intersect line 1 the results for c1 and c9 generally also apply to the other catchments fig 5 the simulated peaks were closest to a mean of one when the daily precipitation was distributed over 12 h whereas shorter periods lead to overestimated peaks and the distribution over the entire day to an underestimation fig 6 further summarizes the results in the smaller catchments c7 c1 c3 different precipitation distribution schemes generally lead to considerable changes in the relative annual peaks ranging from marked underestimation to equally marked overestimation this is valid both for small catchments located on the swiss plateau c1 c3 and to a lower extent for the small alpine catchment c7 in our sample similar patterns were observed for two medium catchments c6 c2 the largest alpine catchments c8 c9 in turn were generally less sensitive to the choice of the distribution scheme in contrast the largest pre alpine catchment c4 was very sensitive to changes in the distribution the only jura catchment c5 appears to be insensitive to the choice of the hour distribution 3 2 2 simulated seasonal peaks for the six precipitation distributions the simulated seasonal peaks indicated that using distribution schemes of 1 3 h led to a marked overestimation of spring and winter peaks and a modest overestimation of summer and fall peaks in the catchment c1 swiss plateau a 24 h scheme always underestimated peaks independent of the season the peaks were simulated the best when using the 12 h distribution scheme fig 7 in the second catchment c9 alpine the degree of a sub daily distribution did not play any role for spring and winter peaks because all schemes provided a similarly good fit but it did play a role for fall and summer peaks for which the best estimation was observed for the 6 and then the 12 h precipitation distribution scheme analyzing detailed results in all nine sample catchments revealed similar patterns not shown to those already observed for annual peaks i e a 12 h distribution scheme simulated at best seasonal peaks for most catchments and this effect was observed to be independent of the season yet in the highest elevation alpine catchments c7 c9 the 6 h scheme was found to be a better choice for spring and summer peaks than a 12 h scheme but had wider confidence intervals 4 discussion 4 1 patterns in simulating annual and seasonal peaks with different precipitation sub daily distributions the effective daily precipitation duration was about 12 h in all catchments independent of the catchment size and the season this finding was demonstrated by the fact that a 12 h sub daily precipitation distribution scheme best simulated both annual and seasonal peaks a 6 h scheme was the second best choice and in alpine catchments it provided as good results as the 12 h scheme for spring and summer floods looking at the sample catchments examined a clear relation would be expected between the catchment area on the one hand and the best sub daily distribution on the other hand following mulvaney 1851 and his idealized assumptions for the rational method the major floods in a catchment are produced when the entire area contributes to runoff this state can be characterized by the time of concentration and is generally reached more quickly in smaller catchments since the maximum possible precipitation intensity increases when the event duration decreases this means that smaller catchments are particularly reactive to short but intensive precipitation events in producing their highest peaks in our analysis this pattern holds only to a limited extent this is because one needs additionally to consider several effects confounding the relation between the catchment area and the best distribution scheme first the concept of the time of concentration and the maximum contributing area refers to rainfall driven events only and is based on the concept of maximum possible peaks in contrast in our study we examine a series of annual and seasonal peaks observed in the past which to a large extent encompass events of a mixed genesis see section 4 5 the precipitation input thus provides only one contribution to the flood peak while the other contribution sometimes major comes from melt processes this explains why the differences between the various precipitation distribution schemes are comparatively small for large alpine catchments the significant contributions of snowmelt and to a smaller extent glacier melt call for consideration of distinctive hydrological processes leading to large floods that can be represented with specific flood types section 4 5 second small catchments may indeed be receptive for short and intense precipitation events when the causative precipitation event is not an isolated one but rather embedded in a longer lasting frontal event compressing the daily precipitation total into a few hours only may lead to unrealistically high precipitation input for the catchment and the hydrological model the result would be an overestimation of flood peaks for the sub daily distribution that corresponds to the time of concentration as also observed in our case for the smallest catchments finally it is also worth noting that all of our catchments are at least of roughly 40 km2 and thus fell rather into a medium large size catchment group in which large floods are rather due to precipitation events of several hours or intense snowmelt rain on snow events merz and bloschl 2003 this could be explained with an extended time of concentration in such larger catchments thus in catchments smaller than analysed here 40 km2 a more detailed sub daily precipitation distribution scheme could still be expected to be important similarly in catchments larger than those investigated here or having a slower response time a disaggregation of daily totals into sub daily sums may not be needed 4 2 usefulness of the effective daily precipitation duration concept a direct analysis of precipitation event durations of the largest floods partly confirmed our findings from this simulation study but as expected additionally highlighted problems with defining the precipitation event duration based only on precipitation data thus depending on how we set the threshold for defining the precipitation occurrence very different results can be obtained this further shows that such arbitrary choices may indeed impact results and conclusions drawn from them in contrast our approach provides an alternative way of determining the effective daily precipitation duration from runoff simulations only hence it avoids making such arbitrary decisions related to the precipitation duration and the minimal precipitation intensity as it purely examines the effect of different precipitation distributions on simulated runoff peaks thus it is more efficient from a hydrological point of view focusing solely on the effect in simulating peaks with a hydrological model instead of precipitation also ensures our method to be independent from the type of the flood event considered thus it is suitable for any type of flood and also for those types that are not driven by precipitation events such as related to snow glacier melt processes this is one of the major advantages over the direct analysis of precipitation information which is thus limited to precipitation driven events only hence our approach may provide a feasible alternative to more advanced statistical approaches despite the fact that the detailed information on precipitation intensity variability becomes lost during aggregating and redistributing precipitation totals it has to be noted however that one reason for this might be the finding of the effective daily precipitation duration of about 12 h meaning that the exact precipitation intensity within a shorter period was in our case not so important these findings support the use of such a simple precipitation distribution approach which has several practical applications it complements more current records available at hourly resolutions with past records disaggregated to sub daily sums allowing for more detailed retrospective analysis of past floods together with runoff data that is usually available at sub daily time steps from longer periods it supports continuous hydrological modelling at hourly resolutions kossieris et al 2018 it extends the pool of observed flood events for statistical reasoning of extremes for which a large data sample is required reed 2002 but also for investigating flood processes finally it allows making usage of precipitation simulations from climate models that are currently available at a daily scale to investigate impacts on flow dynamics and flood magnitudes 4 3 robustness of results and uncertainties there are several potential sources of uncertainty in this work which might affect estimation of annual and seasonal peaks first of all both observational data i e precipitation and runoff are subject to measurement and representation uncertainty mostly precipitation which cannot be completely neglected but are difficult to quantify as the true values are not known e g di baldassarre and montanari 2009 mcmillan et al 2012 sikorska and renard 2017 sikorska et al 2018 to minimize this type of error both runoff and precipitation data were checked for inconsistency or systematic errors prior to the analysis by visual assessment and analysis of water balance components next the runoff simulations are uncertain due to the structural limitations of the hydrological model hbv its parametric uncertainty and boundary conditions as due to choices of initial values for state variables kuczera et al 2010 sikorska et al 2012 the latter source can be minimized by setting up a warm up period prior to the simulation and seibert and vis 2012 have revealed that one year of such a warm up period is sufficient for this kind of model and thus was also used in this study the structural uncertainty is linked to the structure of the hydrological model used in this study and affects estimation of all other uncertainty sources including model parameters sikorska et al 2015a this structural uncertainty source cannot be avoided in any environmental conceptual model but because the same model was always used with the same settings initial conditions model structure type model parameters for all sub daily precipitation distribution schemes this allowed us to assume that this uncertainty contribution was always the same and thus did not affect our results finally the parametric uncertainty was considered by using multiple 100 parameter sets for model simulations this should minimize the effect of the parameter uncertainty on the obtained results and demonstrated how strong results depend on the choice of the parameter set chosen for the hydrological model as our findings manifested the conclusions did not depend on the choice of the parameter set because flood peaks with different sub daily precipitation distribution schemes were always over or underestimated by the same magnitude 4 4 methodological aspects and study limitations our analysis is based on sampling peaks according to the annual maximum am and seasonal maximum sm approach by compounding our analysis with seasonal peaks we demonstrated that our findings hold not only for large annual but also for more frequent and thus smaller peaks i e in total 4 peaks per annum are selected the choice of am and sm approaches was in our case favorable to investigate seasonal flood events and to cover the flood variability resulting from different flood types optionally peaks could also have been chosen with a peak over threshold pot approach which selects peaks not on the maximum per period criterion but based on a preselected threshold flow value although the pot approach is often preferred both pot and am approaches have been proven to provide similar results in case of long time series tanaka and takara 2002 thus using the pot approach with a low threshold would result in selecting peaks of magnitudes similar to those chosen with the sm approach and thus would not change our major findings our method relies on evenly distributing precipitation daily totals into sub daily sums of constant precipitation intensities if a diversification of precipitation intensities at sub daily intervals is required one could use certain patterns such as a triangular shape instead of the uniform distribution an optimal distribution function could also be investigated from observed data furthermore the method is based on a random selection of the first hour for different sub daily precipitation distribution schemes although the choice of this hour plays potentially an important role for model simulations as we always randomly selected this hour for each simulation day independently over roughly 35 years of simulations this effect could have been minimized another discussion point is linked to the way the hydrological model is used in this study namely that it was pre calibrated with hourly observations of precipitation and runoff data the effect of the sub daily precipitation distribution on simulated peaks was then assessed on the basis of this model keeping model parameters constant this means two things first for calibrating the model at least some short series of hourly precipitation runoff data are required in this respect sikorska et al 2018 have proposed a suitable method for assessing the minimum length of the calibration period needed to obtain a sensible model performance in the case that no calibration data are available this restriction could be alleviated by deriving model parameters from regionalisation approaches parajka et al 2013 a limited number of runoff measurements seibert and beven 2009 or a combination of both viviroli and seibert 2015 but would add additional uncertainty to results second calibration on precipitation and runoff data with an interval of more than one hour could lead to a different model performance when using the corresponding distribution of daily precipitation totals for simulation our study did not examine this effect as we explicitly focused on hourly values as a starting point finally our simulations were assessed with the hbv model which is a typical bucket type model with several hydrological processes being represented in a conceptual manner as important for our study such a model uses lumped inputs computed as mean areal precipitation totals and thus the spatial representation of precipitation events does not play any significant role the temporal distribution of precipitation still remains important but is represented with lumped values at the catchment scale only thus for other type of models distributed with a more detailed spatial description of precipitation inputs a different distribution extent of precipitation totals may be required which can be assessed with the method proposed in this study yet in our opinion the necessary extent of precipitation distribution depends largely on the delay in the catchment reaction relative to the triggering input and only to a lower extent on the model type chosen for simulating floods as long as peaks of large floods are considered like in this study following the last point it has to be stressed that our study focuses only on the effect which evenly distributing daily precipitation totals into sub daily sums has on the peaks of large floods whereas the effect on the evolution of flood events is here not considered we expect that a more detailed representation of precipitation distributions within a day will play a role if other characteristics of flood events or the entire flood hydrographs are of one s interest indeed these aspects have been recently quantified by sikorska and seibert 2017 who tested different options of averaging observed hourly precipitation time series for an acceptable model performance focusing on entire hydrographs in their study they found that the sufficient length of precipitation averaging window varied from 1 to 24 h depending on the catchment size and the source of precipitation records our findings on the effective daily precipitation duration equal to half a day falls in the middle of this range which is reasonable given the size of our sample catchments despite these limitations results of our study proved that this approach is suitable for identifying an optimal effective temporal length for sub daily precipitation distribution in mesoscale catchments and thus it can be used as a hydrological alternative to a direct analysis of precipitation data therewith it enables making a usage of daily precipitation data for flood simulations and particularly for analysis of flood peaks at an hourly resolution 4 5 hydrological reasoning flood types of annual and seasonal floods the simulation study presented above purely examined magnitude changes in flood peaks with only a limited process understanding expressed with the flood seasonality episode occurrence within a year but without looking at flood drivers thus treating all floods as one group the major challenge of pooling all floods together is the non possibility to distinguish between different processes driving floods which may potentially play a role in defining the effective daily precipitation duration for instance this value would be rather smaller for flash floods driven by short intensive precipitation events than for slowly rising floods due to melt processes in this respect the recently developed fuzzy flood type decision tree sikorska et al 2015b enables hydrological reasoning to be incorporated into peaks analysis by diagnosing flood causative mechanisms responsible for observed episodes therewith the tree allows the splitting of the flood sample into sub groups of specific flood types according to their observed properties using similarity metrics flood indices the splitting into sub groups is performed by attributing fuzzy memberships m f defined from 0 to 1 the m f equal 0 means that a certain flood type did not occur probability equals 0 and 1 that this type occurred with certainty probability equals 1 while memberships in the range from 0 to 1 are attributed depending on how strongly the event belongs to a certain flood type see sikorska et al 2015b for more details note that the flood tree does not allow an exact value of the effective daily precipitation duration to be identified as it was possible with our simulation study but only pre defined classes of events i e flood types following sikorska et al 2015b we considered here six distinctive flood types which are flash floods ff short rainfall floods srf long rainfall floods lrf rain on snow events rosf snowmelt events smf and glacier melt floods gmf as for this study the important information contained in these flood types is the duration of the precipitation event and its intensity and both of these characteristics vary by definition between the six types considered here namely ffs are defined by very short 12 h and intensive rainfall events and are implicitly spatially limited to smaller catchments in this study with an area 120 km2 srfs correspond to short rainfall events with a precipitation duration of 12 24 h and an average precipitation intensity lrfs and rosfs are both long lasting events 24 h with the precipitation of low intensity with the difference that rosf occurs as a rainfall event on snow cover accumulated in the catchment whereas lrf is generated without any significant contribution from snow cover smfs and gmfs are both driven by melted water originating from snowpack smf or glacier gmf with an insignificant contribution from rainfall and can only occur if a snowpack or glacier are present in the catchment prior to the event application of the fuzzy decision tree in our sample catchments revealed that among annual floods srf and rosf were detected as dominant flood types in plateau catchments c1 c3 with average memberships m f of 0 55 and 0 32 and in pre alpine and jura catchments c4 c6 m f equal to 0 56 and 0 41 in alpine catchments c7 c8 srfs 0 33 rosfs 0 31 glacier melt floods gmfs 0 17 and in the smallest alpine catchment c7 ffs 0 20 were also determined as dominant flood types of annual peaks considering seasonal flood types seasonal floods in plateau m f 0 61 and in jura and pre alpine catchments 0 52 were distinctly dominated by srf mostly responsible for spring summer and fall peaks the second major contribution was due to rosf events 0 20 and 0 43 respectively which contributed mostly to winter peaks seasonal floods in alpine catchments c7 c9 were identified mostly due to rosf events with a contribution of 0 51 on average and were mostly detected in winter and fall srf events were the second major contribution 0 30 and were detected in spring summer and fall seasons other contributions were due to flash floods ff 0 09 only in c7 and in summer and spring and glacier melt floods gmf 0 07 in spring and summer fig 8 these observations on annual and seasonal flood types found that large annual and seasonal floods a were mostly driven by events of a mixed genesis and b mostly induced by precipitation events lasting at least several hours but shorter than a day for which an exact precipitation distribution is of low importance hence these results of the flood type categorization are consistent with our findings from this simulation study suggesting that the effective daily precipitation duration for annual and seasonal floods can be assumed as 12 h thus an even distribution of precipitation daily totals over several hours rather than only a few hours is most suitable yet when looking only on flood magnitudes peaks within the simulation study even with information of their seasonality it would not have provided enough information to draw sensible conclusions because it leaves room for misinterpretation using a flood type tree enabled us thus to better understand our simulation results already several recent studies have pointed out that flood analysis should incorporate process understanding brunner et al 2017 merz and bloschl 2008 sauquet and catalogne 2011 for example brunner et al 2017 have demonstrated that information on specific flood types can support flood frequency analysis with additional information on flood behaviour and seasonality this information may be particularly useful in flood predictions and flood risk management and allows for more dedicated flood prevention designed to a specific flood type event merz and bloschl 2008 proposed a flood frequency hydrology which incorporates hydrological processes into statistical frequency analysis as a needed step towards improving designed flood predictions our results also demonstrate the suitability of such a dedicated flood tree approach to qualitatively analyse results of hydrological simulations and to diagnose observed floods and in this way to support results obtained with formal methods with hydrological reasoning 5 conclusions the results of this study allow us to draw the following conclusions the duration of precipitation events leading to annual flood peaks depends strongly on how we define the threshold precipitation intensity for the event in our case most of the observed precipitation events lasted over about 13 h on the day of the flood event and the day before when assuming the threshold of 0 1 mm h 1 but only 3 h if the threshold was increased to 3 mm h 1 the best choice for simulating annual and seasonal peaks in the studied catchments was a sub daily precipitation distribution scheme over 12 h assessed by relative peaks sub daily distributions over 1 3 h always overestimated peaks while a 24 h scheme always slightly underestimated peaks a 6 h scheme usually overestimated peaks in plateau jura and pre alpine catchments but was the second best choice for alpine catchments results from our study indicate that the exact distribution of precipitation during a day might be less important and simple disaggregation schemes like the uniform distribution might be sufficient for simulating largest flood peaks in catchments similar to investigated here while short time precipitation variations are still expected to be important for small catchments for catchments above 40 km2 the effective daily precipitation duration was in the order of 12 h for catchments larger than 500 km2 or slow reacting catchments we expect that a sub daily distribution would not be needed our simulation findings are consistent with flood processes driving observed large floods most of the annual and seasonal flood events were identified as mixed genesis and either with a major contribution of precipitation events of at least 12 h with medium to low precipitation intensities or due to rain on snow events for which an exact sub daily precipitation distribution within a day becomes irrelevant finally we present here a novel method to evaluate the effective daily precipitation duration from hydrological simulations which is useful to characterise precipitation characteristics for different catchments and different geographic regions and for their inter comparison without the need to analyze precipitation data our method as an inverse approach allows for estimating the degree of sub daily precipitation disaggregation needed which is useful for extending hourly records or making usage of daily precipitation totals such as from climate model simulations available currently at daily resolutions acknowledgments this research is a

7572,an integrated simulation optimization iso approach is developed for assessing climate change impacts on water resources in the iso uncertainties presented as both interval numbers and probability distributions can be reflected moreover iso permits in depth analyses of various policy scenarios that are associated with different levels of economic consequences when the promised water allocation targets are violated a snowmelt precipitation driven watershed kaidu watershed in northwest china is selected as the study case for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method results of meteorological projections disclose that the incremental trend of temperature e g minimum and maximum values and precipitation exist results also reveal that i the system uncertainties would significantly affect water resources allocation pattern including target and shortage ii water shortage would be enhanced from 2016 to 2070 and iii the more the inflow amount decreases the higher estimated water shortage rates are the iso method is useful for evaluating climate change impacts within a watershed system with complicated uncertainties and helping identify appropriate water resources management strategies hedging against drought keywords climate change multistage simulation optimization stochastic analysis uncertainty water resources 1 introduction global warming has measurable effects on a hydrological cycle altering the amount distribution and timing of available water kandiah et al 2016 climate change affects water supply through hydrologic extreme which potentially results in flooding and drought risks poorsepahy samian et al 2016 increasing water demand with socioeconomic development and population growth as well as shrinking water availability due to climatic and anthropogenic changes has brought conflict laden issues of water resources allocation andersson et al 2006 water resources management has become a challenging task under changing climate therefore forecast of climate change scenarios and assessment of its impacts on water resources can help decision makers implement mitigating policies and make strategic investment in infrastructure for future water resources management rheinheimer et al 2016 however the impacts of climate change are difficult to investigate due to uncertainties of meteorological projection as well as the inherent nonlinearity and complexity of climate hydrological processes besides in real world problems many parameters in water resources systems are highly uncertain and their interrelationships could be extremely complicated li and huang 2009 wasko and sharma 2016 previously a number of research efforts were conducted to cope with uncertainties in simulation and optimization of water resources systems li et al 2009a due to a variety of uncertainties existed in hydrological model structure and forecasting capability more and more literatures investigated uncertainties in hydrological processes besides uncertain factors e g climate change impacts on variability of water resources exist in management models nguyen et al 2016 for instance watkins et al 2000 proposed a scenario based multistage stochastic programming model for planning water supplies from highland lakes where dynamics and uncertainties of water availability and thus water allocation could be taken into account through generation of multiple representative scenarios jiang et al 2007 used six conceptual rainfall runoff models to examine hydrological model structure uncertainties under fifteen hypothetical climate change scenarios from the combinations of three temperature increases and five precipitation changes li et al 2009b studied an agricultural catchment area on the loess plateau in china during the period 1981 2000 and identified the separate impacts of climate change and land use cover change on decreasing river flow amounting to about 95 8 and 9 6 respectively poulin et al 2011 employed two different simulation tools lumped conceptual model and spatially distributed physically based model to investigate the effects of model structure and parameter equifinality on the uncertainty related to hydrological modelling in climate impact studies wada et al 2013 used seven global hydrological models to quantify the impact of projected global climate change on future water demand results indicate that uncertainties arising from hydrological models and global climate models gcms are large borgomeo et al 2014 proposed nonstationary synthetic time series of future climates obtained via a stochastic weather generator to construct a probability distribution of the frequency of future water shortages and provided the basis for testing the robustness of water resources management to future climate related uncertainties kotir et al 2016 developed an integrated dynamics simulation model to examine the feedback processes and interaction among population water resource and agricultural production sub sectors results show that the model is reliable and robust to uncertainties in model structure parameters and inputs as mentioned above despite the levels of uncertainty associated with the magnitude and direction of climate variability and change they are expected to have impacts on water availability the effects of climate change on the hydrological cycle include variations in the quantity and seasonal distribution of precipitation increased precipitation intensity increasingly frequent and severe temperature fluctuations and weather events as well as redistributed balance between rain and snow there is much heterogeneity in the climate change models used as well as the assumptions made a tendency of increment in runoff has been observed in northwestern china which is supplied by melting ice snowmelt and precipitation future changes in hydrological processes and stream flows have become increasingly essential to water resources management in the northwest of china with the climate change anticipated to have threatening consequences on water resources and environment both at the global level and at local regional levels e g increases in the number and magnitude of floods and droughts increases in sea levels a general assessment is that the future state of water will be a lot worse than it is now unesco 2002 lobell et al 2011 besides the lack of understanding of climate dynamics as well as various uncertainties associated with future emission scenarios and their spatial and temporal details hinder the capability to provide reliable climate change scenarios nevertheless various complexities and uncertainties existed in water resources systems pose significant challenges to water resources planning and hydrologic prediction under changing climate fan et al 2016 water resources management under changing climate is complicated due to i the disagreement among climate change scenarios ii formulation of appropriate techniques for downscaling global climate model gcm outputs to local condition for hydrologic prediction iii difference between simplification of hydrological model and nonlinearity of hydro processing and iv error of water management planning or policy that should not be ignored in practical applications risbey 1998 for example water supply and demand can continue to change commensurate with changes in population economic condition social and political factors as well as investment in supply systems harman et al 2011 besides water management arises in the context of complex and interdependent ecological social and economic systems whose behavior is governed by numerous feedback interactions that are characterized by nonlinearity correspondingly mitigation of adverse conditions and reliable estimation of the associated uncertainties inherent in water management under climate change is desirable consigli and dempster 1998 this brings a number of challenges to water related professionals policymakers and stakeholders it is desired that more innovative approaches are developed with improved algorithms in propagating uncertainties associated with both climate changing modeling and hydrological analysis naadimuthu 1982 therefore the objective of this study is to develop an integrated simulation optimization iso method to evaluate climate change impacts on water resources through incorporating techniques of multi ensemble gcms daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation and interval multistage chance constrained imc optimization into a general framework iso can not only address the model related uncertainties in meteorological prediction in hydrological simulation and in water resources allocation but also examine the risk of violating individual probabilistic constraints under various scenarios a case study of the kaidu watershed in northwestern china will then be provided for demonstrating how the developed method will support water resources management under climate change 2 methodology 2 1 general framework of iso iso is consisted of i climate projection from multi ensemble gcms ii daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation and iii interval multistage chance constrained optimization the general flow chart is shown in fig 1 first the large scale simulation outputs e g minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation of multi ensemble gcms are downscaled for constructing watershed scale meteorological scenarios second the daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation is employed to simulate streamflows in baseline 1961 1990 recent 2006 2011 and future 2016 2070 periods consequently the downscaled meteorological projections are used as inputs into the hydrological simulation and then hydrologic model is used to simulate streamflows that are used as inputs into a water resources management model finally imc is used for optimizing water resources allocation under climate change and uncertainty imc can tackle random parameters in constraints and intervals in objective function as well as reflect risk of violating individual probabilistic constraints watkins et al 2000 li et al 2006 the proposed iso approach can thus examine various water allocation patterns with different risks of violating water demand targets and further illustrate the individual probabilities of different combinations of water supply and water demand quantitatively zarghami and akbariyeh 2012 2 2 climate change projections datasets of observed and simulated meteorological variables are collected for watershed climate change impact analysis the historical datasets of meteorological variables precipitation and minimum maximum temperatures during the period of 1961 2011 in the kaidu watershed are obtained from three meteorological stations i e baluntai bayinbuluke and yanqi the dashankou hydrological station provides dataset of daily streamflow ranging from 1957 to 2011 besides gcm is an effective tool for simulating predicting climate however climate scenarios calculated by gcms are subject to significant uncertainties in particular regarding precipitation because single model is overconfident and multi model ensemble of gcms contains information from all participating models it is generally believed that multi model ensemble is superior to single model wilby and harris 2006 correspondingly the dataset of average values calculated from multi ensemble gcms is employed for meteorological projections which allows ensemble climate projections to reduce the bias of simulated outputs woldemeskel et al 2016 in this study the simulated results under ipcc rcp4 5 scenario in baseline 1961 1990 recent 2006 2011 and future 2016 2070 periods are obtained from multi ensemble gcms ccsm hadcm3 and mri cgcm uncertainties in climate change projections are derived from the difference of gcms as well as the utilization of statistical downscaling tools milly et al 2002 in fact since gcms produce outputs at much larger spatial scales than those required for catchment scale hydrologic and water resources analyses transformation of data among these scales i e downscaling becomes essential reshmidevi et al 2018 in this study the stepwise clustered downscaling method is employed for atmospheric simulation outputs predictors to acquire high resolution climate projections predictands with discrete and nonlinear uncertainties sharma et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhuang et al 2016a in detail the simulation outputs are effectively extracted from multi ensemble gcms to reduce the uncertain effect of climate projection and then the large scale climate projections are transferred by the statistical downscaling method to construct watershed scale meteorological simulations e g daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation zhuang et al 2016a 2 3 hydrological simulation through using observed and downscaled climate variables maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation as inputs a daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation based on stepwise cluster analysis sca technique is employed for streamflows simulation in the kaidu watershed zhuang et al 2016b the detailed steps include 1 data preparation of system inputs and outputs which generally requires some necessary correlation analyses for each pair of inputs and outputs 2 cutting of clusters based on clustering principles 3 merging of clusters 4 cut merge loops 5 establishment of the cluster tree and 6 generation of required streamflow when a new sample x 1 x 2 xm y y is unknown enters the tree at a cutting point the sample will finally drop into a tip cluster which cannot be either cut or merged further according to the routes decided by new independent variables x 1 x2 xm the predicted value of y will be the mean of dependent variables of the training samples in the tip cluster thus the sca tree is capable of predicting new dependent variables when new samples enter the tree from top to bottom the detailed interpretation for implementing sca is provided in the appendix a datasets of hydro meteorological variables maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and streamflow during 1961 1990 are used for calibration of the hydrological simulation and datasets during 2006 2011 for verification the simulated results during calibration and validation are checked by nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of correlation r2 the criteria are defined as follows 1a nse 1 i 1 n obs i pred i 2 i 1 n obs i obs i 2 1b r 2 n i 1 n obs i pred i i 1 n obs i i 1 n pred i 2 n i 1 n obs i 2 i 1 n obs i 2 n i 1 n pred i 2 i 1 n pred i 2 where obsi is the observed data value on day i predi is the predicted data value on day i and obs i is the mean observed data value n is the number of simulated days the closer nse and r2 values to 1 the model performances are better 2 4 interval multistage chance constrained optimization in this study imc method is proposed not only for dealing with uncertainties presented in terms of individual probabilities i e a level of probability represents the admissible risk of violating the uncertain satisfactory constraints but also for reflecting complexities in water allocation problems where interactive and dynamic relationships exist within a multistage context gulpinar et al 2002 the techniques of chance constrained programming ccp and multistage stochastic programming msp are used for dealing with random uncertainties charnes et al 1972 li et al 2006 besides uncertain parameters may be expressed as interval values with known lower and upper bounds but unknown membership or distribution functions sun et al 2013 for uncertainties in left and right hand sides and cost revenue parameters in the objective function an extended consideration is the introduction of techniques of interval parameter programming ipp loukas et al 2007 thus an interval multistage chance constrained imc optimization approach is developed through introduction of techniques of ccp msp and ipp into a general framework thus we have 2a maxf t 1 t c t x t t 1 t k 1 k t p

tarim river in china the kaidu watershed enclosed between 42 14 43 21 n latitudes and 82 58 86 05 e longitudes is located in the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of northwest china and is near the taklimakan desert kaidu watershed drains an area of about 19 103 km2 with an average elevation of 3100 m fig 2 the climate of kaidu watershed is characterized mainly by dryness and coldness its annual average precipitation is less than 500 mm and pan evaporation is 1100 mm where evaporation exceeds precipitation leading to a dry desert climate ling et al 2013 under the general background of global warming the climate in kaidu watershed has been undergoing significant changes such as increased temperature and precipitation added river runoff volumes accelerated retreat of glaciers and increased lake water surface elevation and area the increasing trend of air temperature over the past 50 years in the kaidu watershed has been indicated with a jump around 1986 deng et al 2015 as the unique high alpine cold climate and topography the streamflow of kaidu watershed is principally provided by high mountain precipitation and seasonal snow and glacier melting the climate factors directly affecting the recharge of the river are temperature and precipitation assessments of variation and vulnerability of runoff are essential for future planning because changes in climatic processes affect both water availability and water demand recent studies identified the kaidu watershed as one of the world s water crisis hot spots it is an inland area that water crisis is aggravated due to climatic change population growth agricultural exploration and economic development it is desirable for projection of future range of climate change scenarios in order to evaluate the vulnerability of water resources system and the effectiveness of different adaptation strategies in managing climate related stresses besides uncertainties exist in water resources systems such as hydrological processes water conservancy facilities water consumption and water supply and socioeconomic activities in the study system the streamflow is random variable with known probability distributions the relevant water allocation plan would be of dynamic feature over a multi period context and uncertainties also provide as intervals for water allocation targets and economic data therefore the developed iso is an effective tool for forecasting or allocating water resources under climate change which can support water allocation more efficiently to relieve the pressure of water conflicts in such an arid region a number of cases associated with different probabilities listed in table 1 are examined correspondingly the probability q q 0 1 is a prescribed level of probability for each constraint imposing a condition that the constraint is satisfied with at least a probability of 1 q table 2 shows the economic inputs during different periods the time horizon of this study is divided into eleven planning periods with each five years 4 result and discussion 4 1 downscaled climate scenarios the developed iso approach was employed for transferring atmospheric simulation outputs to acquire high resolution climate projections during baseline 1961 1990 and future 2016 2070 periods at the kaidu watershed fig 3 shows the simulated results of monthly minimum and maximum temperatures during baseline and future periods results indicate that minimum and maximum temperatures would both increase from baseline to future as shown in table 3 for example the minimum temperature values of august in future would be 3 87 2016 2040 and 4 61 c 2041 2070 which are larger than that i e 2 64 c during the baseline 1961 1990 fig 3 generally meteorological projections enable to reflect wet dry warm or cool conditions and facilitate simulation prediction of future climate change in the kaidu watershed fig 4 presents monthly precipitation for different stations baluntay bayinbulak and yanqi during baseline 1961 1990 and future 2016 2070 periods results discover that precipitation would increase for instance the precipitation values for june would be 40 19 mm 1961 1990 56 60 mm 2016 2040 and 65 52 mm 2041 2070 for baluntay additionally the monthly mean values would be 14 22 mm 1961 1990 19 03 mm 2016 2040 and 22 51 mm 2041 2070 implying an increase of perturbed climatic time series for future besides results indicate that projected climate change scenarios are variable for different stations for example the projected precipitation for december would be 0 2 mm baluntay 3 0 mm bayinbulak and 1 1 mm yanqi the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation distribution is attributed to the complexity of topography and variation in elevations 4 2 future water resources conditions in this study through using datasets of meteorological factors minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation as inputs the daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation were calibrated and validated correspondingly trends of daily streamflows in calibration 1961 1990 validation 2006 2011 and future 2016 2070 periods would be simulated in the kaidu watershed fig 5 shows the daily observed and simulated streamflows during calibration and validation periods the nse values would be 0 68 calibration and 0 65 validation which indicating the good agreement between observed and simulated streamflows the coefficient of correlation r2 for calibration and validation would be 1 68 and 4 11 respectively with a satisfactory fitting for streamflow simulation fig 6 presents comparison of simulated streamflows during prediction period 2016 2070 table 4 lists the occurrence probability of streamflow ptk over the planning period 2016 2070 table 5 shows the simulated streamflows i e random water availability with probability ptk in the future periods in this study totally 110 scenarios for water resources management were investigated it can be disclosed that water deficit exists in future for the study watershed fig 7 presents the allocated water resources under different cases 1 11 when streamflows are at low and low medium levels fig 8 shows the allocated water resources at medium medium high and high levels under cases 1 11 results indicate that allocated water resources would be changed under different cases for instance the allocated water at low level during 2016 2020 would be 1574 6 2549 7 case 1 1594 0 2572 1 case 2 1615 6 2597 1 case 3 1629 0 2612 6 case 4 1638 6 2623 8 case 5 1646 4 2632 7 case 6 1653 3 2640 7 case 7 1659 2 2647 5 case 8 1665 1 2654 4 case 9 1669 1 2659 0 case 10 and 1674 1 2664 7 case 11 106 m3 fig 8 it can be found that the lowest amount of allocated water would be under case 1 while the highest one would be under case 11 for example under case 1 the allocated water during 2066 2070 would be 1879 8 2868 3 low 2236 8 3124 2 low medium 2492 7 3444 4 medium 2812 9 3701 0 medium high and 3069 5 3791 8 high 106 m3 in contrast the allocated water under case 11 would be 1993 1 2997 7 low 2366 2 3265 2 low medium 2633 7 3599 8 medium 2968 3 3791 8 medium high and 3236 5 3791 8 high 106 m3 which indicating an increase trend furthermore the allocated water resources in different periods are variable therefore vulnerability assessments of water resources can help evaluate the susceptibility of water systems to potential climate change threats and identify effective adaptation strategies to reduce or mitigate the risk of serious consequences from adverse climate impacts figs 9 and 10 show the water shortage amount under cases 1 and 2 q 0 01 and q 0 02 cases 10 and 11 q 0 18 and q 0 20 when streamflows are at low low medium medium medium high and high levels for instance the water shortage amount under case 1 at low level would vary from 682 2 1629 7 to 923 5 1912 0 106 m3 in 2016 2070 which indicating insufficient available water resources result in water deficiency in contrast when the streamflow is at high level the water shortage amount under low level would vary from 0 535 9 to 0 822 9 106 m3 results show that water deficit would occur although available water is high besides the water deficit would occur over the planning period as shown in figs 9 and 10 water shortage amount under case 2 at low level would be 897 5 1898 5 2026 2030 717 8 1651 5 2031 2035 623 1 1684 0 2036 2040 898 6 1869 2 2041 2045 855 4 1810 9 2046 2050 832 2 1755 2 2051 2055 691 8 1668 1 2056 2060 767 4 1657 8 2061 2065 and 898 2 1889 9 2066 2070 106 m3 there are no obvious changes of future water deficit under climate change impacts in other words with population increase and economic expansion water shortage would become evident during future consequently the exposure of water resources to drought would increase because variability of available water it can be explained that the large scale development and utilization of water resources would aggravate water deficit causing a series of ecological environment problems li et al 2016 result can also be found that with the highest risk of violating the water target demands i e q 0 20 the water shortage patterns under cases 9 10 and 11 are different from it under cases 1 and 2 for instance the water shortage amounts at low level during period 2 t 2 2021 2025 would be 682 2 1629 7 case 1 q 0 01 658 1 1608 4 case 2 q 0 02 569 8 1530 3 case 9 q 0 16 564 9 1525 9 case 10 q 0 18 and 558 7 1520 4 case 11 q 0 20 106 m3 results disclose that water shortage amount would be lowest under case 11 while it would be highest under case 1 moreover it is indicated that the effects of individual probability levels on the water resources results would vary in different cases it can be explained that a higher level of individual probability corresponds to a relaxed decision domain a more reliability of sufficient water supply which results in a higher satisfactory degree of water demands constraint and lower risk of water shortage it can be discovered that different characteristics of water shortage exist in different levels when the sreamflow is at low level the water shortage amount would be larger for instance water shortage under case 1 at low level would be 682 2 1629 7 t 2 2021 2025 106 m3 in contrast the water shortage amounts would be 448 2 1313 7 low medium 158 5 1079 7 medium 0 0 790 0 medium high and 0 0 535 9 high 106 m3 which indicating a decreasing trend generally results can be found that the more the inflow amount decreases the higher the estimated water shortage rates are 4 3 uncertainties of water deficit fig 11 shows results of water deficit during 2016 2070 in the study watershed mean values and variability ranges of water deficit under different streamflows are varied over the planning periods correspondingly dynamics of water shortage can be reflected and should be taken into consideration in water resources management in fact as the increase in precipitation falls short of temperature increase evaporation may intensify and thus aggravate drought xu et al 2004 additionally variability of water demand is one main factor contributing the risk of water shortage the water demand gets its maximum value due to that the high temperature resulting in the high amount of evaporation and transpiration moreover the most sensitive growth period of plants to water deficit is in the dry season april may and june karamouz et al 2012 fig 12 presents water resources allocation pattern results discover that increasing trends of allocated water resources under climate change impacts exist during different future periods for instance the allocated water would be highest during 2066 2070 while the lowest amount would be during 2016 2020 the possible reason for the different performances of water resources variability over the planning period is that changes of meteorological variables minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation pose significant impacts on future available water thus leading to changes of allocated water it can be analyzed from three aspects i precipitation runoff occurs heavily and snowmelt water reduces significantly during the summer and autumn seasons thereby reducing the proportion of snowmelt runoff ii increasing air temperatures have resulted in a decrease in the proportion of solid precipitation and enhanced snowmelt and iii temperature increases during spring season have a relative more positive effect on streamflow than the other seasons because streamflow is primarily supplied by the snowmelt water 5 conclusions in this study an integrated simulation optimization iso method has been developed for assessing climate change impacts on water resources allocation the developed iso incorporates the meteorological projection from multi ensemble gcms a daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation and an interval multistage chance constrained imc optimization within a general framework the advantages of iso are as follows 1 it can help investigate the uncertainty in projected climate changes through extracting the atmospheric simulation outputs from multi ensemble of gcms and then to transfer large scale climate variables to create watershed scale meteorological projections 2 through employing the daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation it can reflect the nonlinear relationship between hydrological variable e g streamflow and meteorological factors e g precipitation and temperature in hydrological processes and 3 it can reflect uncertainties in water management scenarios and system violation risks through employing techniques of multistage stochastic programming and individual probabilistic constraints based on the proposed iso approach a case study for evaluating the climate change impacts on water resources in the kaidu watershed located in northwest china has been conducted precipitation and temperature variations during baseline 1961 1990 recent 2006 2011 and future 2016 2070 periods with respect to climate change effects are assessed using watershed scale simulation results which are transferred from the multi ensemble of gcms ccsm hadcm3 and mri cgcm correspondingly the iso is able to simulate and capture monthly patterns of hydro meteorological variables minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation using datasets of meteorological factors minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation as inputs the daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation prediction can be employed for streamflow simulating during calibration 1960 1990 validation 2006 2011 and prediction 2016 2070 it can be found that increase trends of temperature and precipitation exist during future period 2016 2070 besides available amounts of water resources would increase as precipitation increases and higher temperature for instance the increase in precipitation would reduce the drought conditions and increase the amount of available water the developed iso has been employed for water resources management through utilizing individual probabilities to present risk of violating the water target demands and various policy scenarios within a multistage context since different individual probabilities associated with different admissible risks of violating the uncertain available water constraints consequently results indicate that various water allocation and water shortage patterns under 110 scenarios exist in future period 2016 2070 for example with the highest risk of violating the water target demands i e case 11 q 0 20 the water shortage pattern during 2016 2020 would be 923 5 1912 0 106 m3 lower than 829 1 1804 2 106 m3 when the constraint violation risk is 0 01 i e case 1 besides results discover that from the 2016 to 2070 the drought conditions would be vulnerable with large amount of water shortage correspondingly water deficit in such an arid region would occur under changing climate which desiring effective water management measures during decision making processes generally adaptability assessment of water resources under climate change is crucial to identify effective adaptive measures for integrated management of water resources acknowledgements this research was supported by the natural science foundation of china 51779008 and the national key r d program of china 2016yfa0601500 and

appendix a in sca sample sets of predictors are cut or merged into new sets and values of predictands are used as references to judge into which new set a sample in the parent set will enter in detail the clustering criterion is the f test based on wilks likelihood ratio criterion let cluster c which contains n c samples be cut into two sub clusters a and b a and b contain n a and n b samples respectively i e n a n b n c according to wilks likelihood ratio criterion if the cutting point is optimal the value of wilks λ λ u u v should be the minimum kennedy and gentle 1981 where u and v are the total sample matrix u ij and the within groups matrix v ij respectively and u and v mean the determinants of matrixes u ij and v ij respectively when λ value is very large clusters a and b cannot be cut but must be merged into greater cluster c by rao s f approximation the r statistic can be given by rao 1965 6a r 1 λ 1 s λ 1 s z s p k 1 2 1 p k 1 6b z n h 1 p k 2 6c s p 2 k 1 2 4 p 2 k 1 2 5 where statistic r is distributed approximately as an f variate with v 1 p k 1 and v 2 p k 1 2 1 degrees of freedom k is the number of groups and p is the number of predictors the r statistics can reduce to an exact f variate when p 1 or 2 or when k 2 or 3 since the number of groups is two k 2 in this study an exact f test is possible based on the wilks λ criterion thus we have f p n h p 1 1 λ

the values of x r i h in x i r 1 2 n according to wilks likelihood ratio criterion the optimal cutting point which split the cluster h into two subclusters e and f when the samples are sequenced according to the values of x r i h in x i should satisfy that λ n e n f is the minimum comparing to that of any other cutting alternatives then the f test can be undertaken if 7 f p n e p 1 1 λ n e n f λ n e n f n e p 1 p f 1 is satisfied cluster h can then be cut into two subclusters e and f x i is identified as the most important predictor which significantly affects the values of the predictands conversely if eq 7 is not satisfied cluster h cannot be cut then all the other clusters will be tested and cut if it satisfies the above testing criterion until no cluster can be further cut the next step is to test whether any two of the generated subclusters should be merged into a new cluster for two clusters c and d among the existing h clusters if 8 f p n c n d p 1 1 λ n c n d 2

be tested and merged if it satisfies the above testing criterion until no clusters can be further merged final step is building a cluster tree for prediction after all calculations and tests have been completed when all hypotheses of further cut or mergence are rejected a cluster tree can be derived for a new sample prediction the predictor values in the cluster tree will be used as the criteria to determine which end nodes the new predictor samples will enter into the predictand values of the end nodes in the cluster tree will be used to calculate the values of the predictands corresponding to the new predictor samples each cutting point which leads to two branches corresponds to a value x r i h of the predictor x i when a new sample set of predictors x p is examined its x p i values are compared with x r i h at the cutting points and classified into relevant branches step by step the sample finally enters into a tip branch tip cluster which cannot be either cut or merged further let

7572,an integrated simulation optimization iso approach is developed for assessing climate change impacts on water resources in the iso uncertainties presented as both interval numbers and probability distributions can be reflected moreover iso permits in depth analyses of various policy scenarios that are associated with different levels of economic consequences when the promised water allocation targets are violated a snowmelt precipitation driven watershed kaidu watershed in northwest china is selected as the study case for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method results of meteorological projections disclose that the incremental trend of temperature e g minimum and maximum values and precipitation exist results also reveal that i the system uncertainties would significantly affect water resources allocation pattern including target and shortage ii water shortage would be enhanced from 2016 to 2070 and iii the more the inflow amount decreases the higher estimated water shortage rates are the iso method is useful for evaluating climate change impacts within a watershed system with complicated uncertainties and helping identify appropriate water resources management strategies hedging against drought keywords climate change multistage simulation optimization stochastic analysis uncertainty water resources 1 introduction global warming has measurable effects on a hydrological cycle altering the amount distribution and timing of available water kandiah et al 2016 climate change affects water supply through hydrologic extreme which potentially results in flooding and drought risks poorsepahy samian et al 2016 increasing water demand with socioeconomic development and population growth as well as shrinking water availability due to climatic and anthropogenic changes has brought conflict laden issues of water resources allocation andersson et al 2006 water resources management has become a challenging task under changing climate therefore forecast of climate change scenarios and assessment of its impacts on water resources can help decision makers implement mitigating policies and make strategic investment in infrastructure for future water resources management rheinheimer et al 2016 however the impacts of climate change are difficult to investigate due to uncertainties of meteorological projection as well as the inherent nonlinearity and complexity of climate hydrological processes besides in real world problems many parameters in water resources systems are highly uncertain and their interrelationships could be extremely complicated li and huang 2009 wasko and sharma 2016 previously a number of research efforts were conducted to cope with uncertainties in simulation and optimization of water resources systems li et al 2009a due to a variety of uncertainties existed in hydrological model structure and forecasting capability more and more literatures investigated uncertainties in hydrological processes besides uncertain factors e g climate change impacts on variability of water resources exist in management models nguyen et al 2016 for instance watkins et al 2000 proposed a scenario based multistage stochastic programming model for planning water supplies from highland lakes where dynamics and uncertainties of water availability and thus water allocation could be taken into account through generation of multiple representative scenarios jiang et al 2007 used six conceptual rainfall runoff models to examine hydrological model structure uncertainties under fifteen hypothetical climate change scenarios from the combinations of three temperature increases and five precipitation changes li et al 2009b studied an agricultural catchment area on the loess plateau in china during the period 1981 2000 and identified the separate impacts of climate change and land use cover change on decreasing river flow amounting to about 95 8 and 9 6 respectively poulin et al 2011 employed two different simulation tools lumped conceptual model and spatially distributed physically based model to investigate the effects of model structure and parameter equifinality on the uncertainty related to hydrological modelling in climate impact studies wada et al 2013 used seven global hydrological models to quantify the impact of projected global climate change on future water demand results indicate that uncertainties arising from hydrological models and global climate models gcms are large borgomeo et al 2014 proposed nonstationary synthetic time series of future climates obtained via a stochastic weather generator to construct a probability distribution of the frequency of future water shortages and provided the basis for testing the robustness of water resources management to future climate related uncertainties kotir et al 2016 developed an integrated dynamics simulation model to examine the feedback processes and interaction among population water resource and agricultural production sub sectors results show that the model is reliable and robust to uncertainties in model structure parameters and inputs as mentioned above despite the levels of uncertainty associated with the magnitude and direction of climate variability and change they are expected to have impacts on water availability the effects of climate change on the hydrological cycle include variations in the quantity and seasonal distribution of precipitation increased precipitation intensity increasingly frequent and severe temperature fluctuations and weather events as well as redistributed balance between rain and snow there is much heterogeneity in the climate change models used as well as the assumptions made a tendency of increment in runoff has been observed in northwestern china which is supplied by melting ice snowmelt and precipitation future changes in hydrological processes and stream flows have become increasingly essential to water resources management in the northwest of china with the climate change anticipated to have threatening consequences on water resources and environment both at the global level and at local regional levels e g increases in the number and magnitude of floods and droughts increases in sea levels a general assessment is that the future state of water will be a lot worse than it is now unesco 2002 lobell et al 2011 besides the lack of understanding of climate dynamics as well as various uncertainties associated with future emission scenarios and their spatial and temporal details hinder the capability to provide reliable climate change scenarios nevertheless various complexities and uncertainties existed in water resources systems pose significant challenges to water resources planning and hydrologic prediction under changing climate fan et al 2016 water resources management under changing climate is complicated due to i the disagreement among climate change scenarios ii formulation of appropriate techniques for downscaling global climate model gcm outputs to local condition for hydrologic prediction iii difference between simplification of hydrological model and nonlinearity of hydro processing and iv error of water management planning or policy that should not be ignored in practical applications risbey 1998 for example water supply and demand can continue to change commensurate with changes in population economic condition social and political factors as well as investment in supply systems harman et al 2011 besides water management arises in the context of complex and interdependent ecological social and economic systems whose behavior is governed by numerous feedback interactions that are characterized by nonlinearity correspondingly mitigation of adverse conditions and reliable estimation of the associated uncertainties inherent in water management under climate change is desirable consigli and dempster 1998 this brings a number of challenges to water related professionals policymakers and stakeholders it is desired that more innovative approaches are developed with improved algorithms in propagating uncertainties associated with both climate changing modeling and hydrological analysis naadimuthu 1982 therefore the objective of this study is to develop an integrated simulation optimization iso method to evaluate climate change impacts on water resources through incorporating techniques of multi ensemble gcms daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation and interval multistage chance constrained imc optimization into a general framework iso can not only address the model related uncertainties in meteorological prediction in hydrological simulation and in water resources allocation but also examine the risk of violating individual probabilistic constraints under various scenarios a case study of the kaidu watershed in northwestern china will then be provided for demonstrating how the developed method will support water resources management under climate change 2 methodology 2 1 general framework of iso iso is consisted of i climate projection from multi ensemble gcms ii daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation and iii interval multistage chance constrained optimization the general flow chart is shown in fig 1 first the large scale simulation outputs e g minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation of multi ensemble gcms are downscaled for constructing watershed scale meteorological scenarios second the daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation is employed to simulate streamflows in baseline 1961 1990 recent 2006 2011 and future 2016 2070 periods consequently the downscaled meteorological projections are used as inputs into the hydrological simulation and then hydrologic model is used to simulate streamflows that are used as inputs into a water resources management model finally imc is used for optimizing water resources allocation under climate change and uncertainty imc can tackle random parameters in constraints and intervals in objective function as well as reflect risk of violating individual probabilistic constraints watkins et al 2000 li et al 2006 the proposed iso approach can thus examine various water allocation patterns with different risks of violating water demand targets and further illustrate the individual probabilities of different combinations of water supply and water demand quantitatively zarghami and akbariyeh 2012 2 2 climate change projections datasets of observed and simulated meteorological variables are collected for watershed climate change impact analysis the historical datasets of meteorological variables precipitation and minimum maximum temperatures during the period of 1961 2011 in the kaidu watershed are obtained from three meteorological stations i e baluntai bayinbuluke and yanqi the dashankou hydrological station provides dataset of daily streamflow ranging from 1957 to 2011 besides gcm is an effective tool for simulating predicting climate however climate scenarios calculated by gcms are subject to significant uncertainties in particular regarding precipitation because single model is overconfident and multi model ensemble of gcms contains information from all participating models it is generally believed that multi model ensemble is superior to single model wilby and harris 2006 correspondingly the dataset of average values calculated from multi ensemble gcms is employed for meteorological projections which allows ensemble climate projections to reduce the bias of simulated outputs woldemeskel et al 2016 in this study the simulated results under ipcc rcp4 5 scenario in baseline 1961 1990 recent 2006 2011 and future 2016 2070 periods are obtained from multi ensemble gcms ccsm hadcm3 and mri cgcm uncertainties in climate change projections are derived from the difference of gcms as well as the utilization of statistical downscaling tools milly et al 2002 in fact since gcms produce outputs at much larger spatial scales than those required for catchment scale hydrologic and water resources analyses transformation of data among these scales i e downscaling becomes essential reshmidevi et al 2018 in this study the stepwise clustered downscaling method is employed for atmospheric simulation outputs predictors to acquire high resolution climate projections predictands with discrete and nonlinear uncertainties sharma et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhuang et al 2016a in detail the simulation outputs are effectively extracted from multi ensemble gcms to reduce the uncertain effect of climate projection and then the large scale climate projections are transferred by the statistical downscaling method to construct watershed scale meteorological simulations e g daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation zhuang et al 2016a 2 3 hydrological simulation through using observed and downscaled climate variables maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation as inputs a daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation based on stepwise cluster analysis sca technique is employed for streamflows simulation in the kaidu watershed zhuang et al 2016b the detailed steps include 1 data preparation of system inputs and outputs which generally requires some necessary correlation analyses for each pair of inputs and outputs 2 cutting of clusters based on clustering principles 3 merging of clusters 4 cut merge loops 5 establishment of the cluster tree and 6 generation of required streamflow when a new sample x 1 x 2 xm y y is unknown enters the tree at a cutting point the sample will finally drop into a tip cluster which cannot be either cut or merged further according to the routes decided by new independent variables x 1 x2 xm the predicted value of y will be the mean of dependent variables of the training samples in the tip cluster thus the sca tree is capable of predicting new dependent variables when new samples enter the tree from top to bottom the detailed interpretation for implementing sca is provided in the appendix a datasets of hydro meteorological variables maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and streamflow during 1961 1990 are used for calibration of the hydrological simulation and datasets during 2006 2011 for verification the simulated results during calibration and validation are checked by nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of correlation r2 the criteria are defined as follows 1a nse 1 i 1 n obs i pred i 2 i 1 n obs i obs i 2 1b r 2 n i 1 n obs i pred i i 1 n obs i i 1 n pred i 2 n i 1 n obs i 2 i 1 n obs i 2 n i 1 n pred i 2 i 1 n pred i 2 where obsi is the observed data value on day i predi is the predicted data value on day i and obs i is the mean observed data value n is the number of simulated days the closer nse and r2 values to 1 the model performances are better 2 4 interval multistage chance constrained optimization in this study imc method is proposed not only for dealing with uncertainties presented in terms of individual probabilities i e a level of probability represents the admissible risk of violating the uncertain satisfactory constraints but also for reflecting complexities in water allocation problems where interactive and dynamic relationships exist within a multistage context gulpinar et al 2002 the techniques of chance constrained programming ccp and multistage stochastic programming msp are used for dealing with random uncertainties charnes et al 1972 li et al 2006 besides uncertain parameters may be expressed as interval values with known lower and upper bounds but unknown membership or distribution functions sun et al 2013 for uncertainties in left and right hand sides and cost revenue parameters in the objective function an extended consideration is the introduction of techniques of interval parameter programming ipp loukas et al 2007 thus an interval multistage chance constrained imc optimization approach is developed through introduction of techniques of ccp msp and ipp into a general framework thus we have 2a maxf t 1 t c t x t t 1 t k 1 k t p

tarim river in china the kaidu watershed enclosed between 42 14 43 21 n latitudes and 82 58 86 05 e longitudes is located in the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of northwest china and is near the taklimakan desert kaidu watershed drains an area of about 19 103 km2 with an average elevation of 3100 m fig 2 the climate of kaidu watershed is characterized mainly by dryness and coldness its annual average precipitation is less than 500 mm and pan evaporation is 1100 mm where evaporation exceeds precipitation leading to a dry desert climate ling et al 2013 under the general background of global warming the climate in kaidu watershed has been undergoing significant changes such as increased temperature and precipitation added river runoff volumes accelerated retreat of glaciers and increased lake water surface elevation and area the increasing trend of air temperature over the past 50 years in the kaidu watershed has been indicated with a jump around 1986 deng et al 2015 as the unique high alpine cold climate and topography the streamflow of kaidu watershed is principally provided by high mountain precipitation and seasonal snow and glacier melting the climate factors directly affecting the recharge of the river are temperature and precipitation assessments of variation and vulnerability of runoff are essential for future planning because changes in climatic processes affect both water availability and water demand recent studies identified the kaidu watershed as one of the world s water crisis hot spots it is an inland area that water crisis is aggravated due to climatic change population growth agricultural exploration and economic development it is desirable for projection of future range of climate change scenarios in order to evaluate the vulnerability of water resources system and the effectiveness of different adaptation strategies in managing climate related stresses besides uncertainties exist in water resources systems such as hydrological processes water conservancy facilities water consumption and water supply and socioeconomic activities in the study system the streamflow is random variable with known probability distributions the relevant water allocation plan would be of dynamic feature over a multi period context and uncertainties also provide as intervals for water allocation targets and economic data therefore the developed iso is an effective tool for forecasting or allocating water resources under climate change which can support water allocation more efficiently to relieve the pressure of water conflicts in such an arid region a number of cases associated with different probabilities listed in table 1 are examined correspondingly the probability q q 0 1 is a prescribed level of probability for each constraint imposing a condition that the constraint is satisfied with at least a probability of 1 q table 2 shows the economic inputs during different periods the time horizon of this study is divided into eleven planning periods with each five years 4 result and discussion 4 1 downscaled climate scenarios the developed iso approach was employed for transferring atmospheric simulation outputs to acquire high resolution climate projections during baseline 1961 1990 and future 2016 2070 periods at the kaidu watershed fig 3 shows the simulated results of monthly minimum and maximum temperatures during baseline and future periods results indicate that minimum and maximum temperatures would both increase from baseline to future as shown in table 3 for example the minimum temperature values of august in future would be 3 87 2016 2040 and 4 61 c 2041 2070 which are larger than that i e 2 64 c during the baseline 1961 1990 fig 3 generally meteorological projections enable to reflect wet dry warm or cool conditions and facilitate simulation prediction of future climate change in the kaidu watershed fig 4 presents monthly precipitation for different stations baluntay bayinbulak and yanqi during baseline 1961 1990 and future 2016 2070 periods results discover that precipitation would increase for instance the precipitation values for june would be 40 19 mm 1961 1990 56 60 mm 2016 2040 and 65 52 mm 2041 2070 for baluntay additionally the monthly mean values would be 14 22 mm 1961 1990 19 03 mm 2016 2040 and 22 51 mm 2041 2070 implying an increase of perturbed climatic time series for future besides results indicate that projected climate change scenarios are variable for different stations for example the projected precipitation for december would be 0 2 mm baluntay 3 0 mm bayinbulak and 1 1 mm yanqi the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation distribution is attributed to the complexity of topography and variation in elevations 4 2 future water resources conditions in this study through using datasets of meteorological factors minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation as inputs the daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation were calibrated and validated correspondingly trends of daily streamflows in calibration 1961 1990 validation 2006 2011 and future 2016 2070 periods would be simulated in the kaidu watershed fig 5 shows the daily observed and simulated streamflows during calibration and validation periods the nse values would be 0 68 calibration and 0 65 validation which indicating the good agreement between observed and simulated streamflows the coefficient of correlation r2 for calibration and validation would be 1 68 and 4 11 respectively with a satisfactory fitting for streamflow simulation fig 6 presents comparison of simulated streamflows during prediction period 2016 2070 table 4 lists the occurrence probability of streamflow ptk over the planning period 2016 2070 table 5 shows the simulated streamflows i e random water availability with probability ptk in the future periods in this study totally 110 scenarios for water resources management were investigated it can be disclosed that water deficit exists in future for the study watershed fig 7 presents the allocated water resources under different cases 1 11 when streamflows are at low and low medium levels fig 8 shows the allocated water resources at medium medium high and high levels under cases 1 11 results indicate that allocated water resources would be changed under different cases for instance the allocated water at low level during 2016 2020 would be 1574 6 2549 7 case 1 1594 0 2572 1 case 2 1615 6 2597 1 case 3 1629 0 2612 6 case 4 1638 6 2623 8 case 5 1646 4 2632 7 case 6 1653 3 2640 7 case 7 1659 2 2647 5 case 8 1665 1 2654 4 case 9 1669 1 2659 0 case 10 and 1674 1 2664 7 case 11 106 m3 fig 8 it can be found that the lowest amount of allocated water would be under case 1 while the highest one would be under case 11 for example under case 1 the allocated water during 2066 2070 would be 1879 8 2868 3 low 2236 8 3124 2 low medium 2492 7 3444 4 medium 2812 9 3701 0 medium high and 3069 5 3791 8 high 106 m3 in contrast the allocated water under case 11 would be 1993 1 2997 7 low 2366 2 3265 2 low medium 2633 7 3599 8 medium 2968 3 3791 8 medium high and 3236 5 3791 8 high 106 m3 which indicating an increase trend furthermore the allocated water resources in different periods are variable therefore vulnerability assessments of water resources can help evaluate the susceptibility of water systems to potential climate change threats and identify effective adaptation strategies to reduce or mitigate the risk of serious consequences from adverse climate impacts figs 9 and 10 show the water shortage amount under cases 1 and 2 q 0 01 and q 0 02 cases 10 and 11 q 0 18 and q 0 20 when streamflows are at low low medium medium medium high and high levels for instance the water shortage amount under case 1 at low level would vary from 682 2 1629 7 to 923 5 1912 0 106 m3 in 2016 2070 which indicating insufficient available water resources result in water deficiency in contrast when the streamflow is at high level the water shortage amount under low level would vary from 0 535 9 to 0 822 9 106 m3 results show that water deficit would occur although available water is high besides the water deficit would occur over the planning period as shown in figs 9 and 10 water shortage amount under case 2 at low level would be 897 5 1898 5 2026 2030 717 8 1651 5 2031 2035 623 1 1684 0 2036 2040 898 6 1869 2 2041 2045 855 4 1810 9 2046 2050 832 2 1755 2 2051 2055 691 8 1668 1 2056 2060 767 4 1657 8 2061 2065 and 898 2 1889 9 2066 2070 106 m3 there are no obvious changes of future water deficit under climate change impacts in other words with population increase and economic expansion water shortage would become evident during future consequently the exposure of water resources to drought would increase because variability of available water it can be explained that the large scale development and utilization of water resources would aggravate water deficit causing a series of ecological environment problems li et al 2016 result can also be found that with the highest risk of violating the water target demands i e q 0 20 the water shortage patterns under cases 9 10 and 11 are different from it under cases 1 and 2 for instance the water shortage amounts at low level during period 2 t 2 2021 2025 would be 682 2 1629 7 case 1 q 0 01 658 1 1608 4 case 2 q 0 02 569 8 1530 3 case 9 q 0 16 564 9 1525 9 case 10 q 0 18 and 558 7 1520 4 case 11 q 0 20 106 m3 results disclose that water shortage amount would be lowest under case 11 while it would be highest under case 1 moreover it is indicated that the effects of individual probability levels on the water resources results would vary in different cases it can be explained that a higher level of individual probability corresponds to a relaxed decision domain a more reliability of sufficient water supply which results in a higher satisfactory degree of water demands constraint and lower risk of water shortage it can be discovered that different characteristics of water shortage exist in different levels when the sreamflow is at low level the water shortage amount would be larger for instance water shortage under case 1 at low level would be 682 2 1629 7 t 2 2021 2025 106 m3 in contrast the water shortage amounts would be 448 2 1313 7 low medium 158 5 1079 7 medium 0 0 790 0 medium high and 0 0 535 9 high 106 m3 which indicating a decreasing trend generally results can be found that the more the inflow amount decreases the higher the estimated water shortage rates are 4 3 uncertainties of water deficit fig 11 shows results of water deficit during 2016 2070 in the study watershed mean values and variability ranges of water deficit under different streamflows are varied over the planning periods correspondingly dynamics of water shortage can be reflected and should be taken into consideration in water resources management in fact as the increase in precipitation falls short of temperature increase evaporation may intensify and thus aggravate drought xu et al 2004 additionally variability of water demand is one main factor contributing the risk of water shortage the water demand gets its maximum value due to that the high temperature resulting in the high amount of evaporation and transpiration moreover the most sensitive growth period of plants to water deficit is in the dry season april may and june karamouz et al 2012 fig 12 presents water resources allocation pattern results discover that increasing trends of allocated water resources under climate change impacts exist during different future periods for instance the allocated water would be highest during 2066 2070 while the lowest amount would be during 2016 2020 the possible reason for the different performances of water resources variability over the planning period is that changes of meteorological variables minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation pose significant impacts on future available water thus leading to changes of allocated water it can be analyzed from three aspects i precipitation runoff occurs heavily and snowmelt water reduces significantly during the summer and autumn seasons thereby reducing the proportion of snowmelt runoff ii increasing air temperatures have resulted in a decrease in the proportion of solid precipitation and enhanced snowmelt and iii temperature increases during spring season have a relative more positive effect on streamflow than the other seasons because streamflow is primarily supplied by the snowmelt water 5 conclusions in this study an integrated simulation optimization iso method has been developed for assessing climate change impacts on water resources allocation the developed iso incorporates the meteorological projection from multi ensemble gcms a daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation and an interval multistage chance constrained imc optimization within a general framework the advantages of iso are as follows 1 it can help investigate the uncertainty in projected climate changes through extracting the atmospheric simulation outputs from multi ensemble of gcms and then to transfer large scale climate variables to create watershed scale meteorological projections 2 through employing the daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation it can reflect the nonlinear relationship between hydrological variable e g streamflow and meteorological factors e g precipitation and temperature in hydrological processes and 3 it can reflect uncertainties in water management scenarios and system violation risks through employing techniques of multistage stochastic programming and individual probabilistic constraints based on the proposed iso approach a case study for evaluating the climate change impacts on water resources in the kaidu watershed located in northwest china has been conducted precipitation and temperature variations during baseline 1961 1990 recent 2006 2011 and future 2016 2070 periods with respect to climate change effects are assessed using watershed scale simulation results which are transferred from the multi ensemble of gcms ccsm hadcm3 and mri cgcm correspondingly the iso is able to simulate and capture monthly patterns of hydro meteorological variables minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation using datasets of meteorological factors minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation as inputs the daily climate streamflow hydrological simulation prediction can be employed for streamflow simulating during calibration 1960 1990 validation 2006 2011 and prediction 2016 2070 it can be found that increase trends of temperature and precipitation exist during future period 2016 2070 besides available amounts of water resources would increase as precipitation increases and higher temperature for instance the increase in precipitation would reduce the drought conditions and increase the amount of available water the developed iso has been employed for water resources management through utilizing individual probabilities to present risk of violating the water target demands and various policy scenarios within a multistage context since different individual probabilities associated with different admissible risks of violating the uncertain available water constraints consequently results indicate that various water allocation and water shortage patterns under 110 scenarios exist in future period 2016 2070 for example with the highest risk of violating the water target demands i e case 11 q 0 20 the water shortage pattern during 2016 2020 would be 923 5 1912 0 106 m3 lower than 829 1 1804 2 106 m3 when the constraint violation risk is 0 01 i e case 1 besides results discover that from the 2016 to 2070 the drought conditions would be vulnerable with large amount of water shortage correspondingly water deficit in such an arid region would occur under changing climate which desiring effective water management measures during decision making processes generally adaptability assessment of water resources under climate change is crucial to identify effective adaptive measures for integrated

appendix a in sca sample sets of predictors are cut or merged into new sets and values of predictands are used as references to judge into which new set a sample in the parent set will enter in detail the clustering criterion is the f test based on wilks likelihood ratio criterion let cluster c which contains n c samples be cut into two sub clusters a and b a and b contain n a and n b samples respectively i e n a n b n c according to wilks likelihood ratio criterion if the cutting point is optimal the value of wilks λ λ u u v should be the minimum kennedy and gentle 1981 where u and v are the total sample matrix u ij and the within groups matrix v ij respectively and u and v mean the determinants of matrixes u ij and v ij respectively when λ value is very large clusters a and b cannot be cut but must be merged into greater cluster c by rao s f approximation the r statistic can be given by rao 1965 6a r 1 λ 1 s λ 1 s z s p k 1 2 1 p k 1 6b z n h 1 p k 2 6c s p 2 k 1 2 4 p 2 k 1 2 5 where statistic r is distributed approximately as an f variate with v 1 p k 1 and v 2 p k 1 2 1 degrees of freedom k is the number of groups and p is the number of predictors the r statistics can reduce to an exact f variate when p 1 or 2 or when k 2 or 3 since the number of groups is two k 2 in this study an exact f test is possible based on the wilks λ criterion thus we have f p n h p 1 1 λ

the values of x r i h in x i r 1 2 n according to wilks likelihood ratio criterion the optimal cutting point which split the cluster h into two subclusters e and f when the samples are sequenced according to the values of x r i h in x i should satisfy that λ n e n f is the minimum comparing to that of any other cutting alternatives then the f test can be undertaken if 7 f p n e p 1 1 λ n e n f λ n e n f n e p 1 p f 1 is satisfied cluster h can then be cut into two subclusters e and f x i is identified as the most important predictor which significantly affects the values of the predictands conversely if eq 7 is not satisfied cluster h cannot be cut then all the other clusters will be tested and cut if it satisfies the above testing criterion until no cluster can be further cut the next step is to test whether any two of the generated subclusters should be merged into a new cluster for two clusters c and d among the existing h clusters if 8 f p n c n d p 1 1 λ n c n d 2

be tested and merged if it satisfies the above testing criterion until no clusters can be further merged final step is building a cluster tree for prediction after all calculations and tests have been completed when all hypotheses of further cut or mergence are rejected a cluster tree can be derived for a new sample prediction the predictor values in the cluster tree will be used as the criteria to determine which end nodes the new predictor samples will enter into the predictand values of the end nodes in the cluster tree will be used to calculate the values of the predictands corresponding to the new predictor samples each cutting point which leads to two branches corresponds to a value x r i h of the predictor x i when a new sample set of predictors x p is examined its x p i values are compared with x r i h at the cutting points and classified into relevant branches step by step the sample finally enters into a tip branch tip cluster which cannot be either cut or merged further let

7573,the objective of this study is to compare two new generation low complexity tools autoroute and height above the nearest drainage hand with a two dimensional hydrodynamic model hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras 2d the assessment was conducted on two hydrologically different and geographically distant test cases in the united states including the 16 900 km2 cedar river cr watershed in iowa and a 62 km2 domain along the black warrior river bwr in alabama for bwr twelve different configurations were set up for each of the models including four different terrain setups e g with and without channel bathymetry and a levee and three flooding conditions representing moderate to extreme hazards at 10 100 and 500 year return periods for the cr watershed models were compared with a simplistic terrain setup without bathymetry and any form of hydraulic controls and one flooding condition 100 year return period input streamflow forcing data representing these hypothetical events were constructed by applying a new fusion approach on national water model outputs simulated inundation extent and depth from autoroute hand and hec ras 2d were compared with one another and with the corresponding fema reference estimates irrespective of the configurations the low complexity models were able to produce inundation extents similar to hec ras 2d with autoroute showing slightly higher accuracy than the hand model among four terrain setups the one including both levee and channel bathymetry showed lowest fitness score on the spatial agreement of inundation extent due to the weak physical representation of low complexity models compared to a hydrodynamic model for inundation depth the low complexity models showed an overestimating tendency especially in the deeper segments of the channel based on such reasonably good prediction skills low complexity flood models can be considered as a suitable alternative for fast predictions in large scale hyper resolution operational frameworks without completely overriding hydrodynamic models efficacy keywords hyper resolution modeling autoroute hand hec ras 2d multi model comparison national water model 1 introduction with an increasing stress of climate and land use changes in recent times flood events are becoming more frequent and perhaps more disastrous hirabayashi et al 2013 in the

applications listed in table 1 are limited to small spatial scales over either a single river reach or a low density river network executing most of the hydraulic hydrodynamic models requires modelers

packages come with a black box configuration that can be executed only for research purposes in a stand alone desktop environment kauffeldt et al 2016 néelz 2009 these models also require considerable setup and computation time especially with high resolution river networks accordingly using a model that is as realistic as possible is not the panacea hunter et al 2007 the choice should be balanced against several other considerations when it comes to the question of integration into a continental scale operational system such as the nwm choice of a hydraulic hydrodynamic model as component of a large scale framework is determined less by the superior model physics and more by its suitability to be executed in cyber infrastructures computational overhead interoperability with the driver hydrologic model output retrieval and visualization capabilities rajib et al 2016 being driven by such constraints follum 2012 introduced autoroute table 1 as a rapid tool to create flood inundation mapping over large scales using the simulated streamflow outputs from tavakoly et al 2017 as an input forcing to the autoroute follum et al 2017 generated high resolution 10 m flood maps for the midwest us 230 000 km2 and the mississippi delta 109 500 km2 despite such intensive application computational overhead for executing autoroute was remarkably small liu et al 2016 adopted the concept of height above the nearest drainage hand nobre et al 2011 rennó et al 2008 and transformed 10 m national elevation dataset ned for the continental us into a hand raster this hand raster shows the relative height of a given location above the nearest reach in the nationally mapped river network national hydrography dataset plus maidment et al 2016 featured several case studies based upon the loose coupling of nwm streamflow outputs with this hand raster to generate near real time flood inundation maps considering these recent advancements it is timely to examine whether fast computing low complexity inundation mapping tools with simplified input requirements and process representations can be preferred from an operational standpoint particularly in time limited emergency response scenarios over computationally exhaustive input intensive physics based and presumably accurate hydraulic hydrodynamic models ability to capture natural floodplain processes and the influence of man made control structures is different in each model no model has the perfect realization of flooding hence simplification of the model physics may further undermine its already limited ability in this regard a multi model comparison can help measure relative accuracy of each model previous studies are heavily skewed towards the comparison of 1d versus 2d hydraulic hydrodynamic models cook and

upon the preliminary work of afshari et al 2016 attempts to fill this gap with a view to provide a practical yet reliable flood inundation modeling alternative to be coupled with continental scale hydrologic forecasting models the main objective of this study is to evaluate the relative accuracy between autoroute hand and hec ras 2d for different magnitudes of flooding events in terms of both

area along the black warrior river bwr in alabama in the us the cr watershed stretches about 380 km in a mild moderate terrain 0 0001 m m from mower county in minnesota to a us geological survey usgs outlet in cedar rapids iowa usgs 05464500 along its way downstream the main channel is fed by 11 major tributaries some of which are also divided into lower order upstream headwater reaches the bwr domain stretches approximately 15 km through a moderate slightly terrain 0 0003 m m in tuscaloosa county alabama with 15 adjoining tributaries the river networks used for flood simulation in both cases were obtained from nhdplus mckay et al 2012 the dominant land use in cr is agricultural whereas the bwr domain used in this study is mostly an urban landscape with some forested areas cr is relatively a natural landscape with least obstruction by man made hydraulic control structures in contrast the bwr domain has one levee and two lock dams in the main channel associated with two usgs gauge stations fig 2 the levee has been in operation since august 1999 construction date to reduce flooding damage in the city of northport according to the us army corps of engineers national levee database the approximate length and average crest elevation of the levee are 3 3 km and 47 5 m respectively the oliver lock and dam is located at the outlet of the study domain usgs 02465000 whereas the holt lock and dam usgs 02462961 defines the upstream boundary location for the main channel flood inundation is influenced by these dams levees due to their flow regulatory role and to possible backwater effects during extreme events incorporation of these man made control structures even in their simplest forms can supplement the limited hydrodynamic simulation capacity of an inundation mapping tool 2 2 model inputs to enable an even assessment the forcing data i e input streamflow topographic resolution land cover classification and the values of channel surface roughness parameters

data to force the inundation models were constructed while maintaining the hydrologic connectivity of the river network and therefore accounting for the contribution of tributaries for instance difference between monthly mean downstream and upstream streamflow in the bwr domain implies higher values in the downstream station 87 of the time fig 3 a fig 3b comparing daily streamflow data at the upstream and downstream gauge stations for 19 peak flow events during a past 40 year period 1976 2014 also validates this notion these findings help to realize two critical factors regarding the connectivity aspect mentioned above first amplification of flood magnitude while proceeding towards the outlet was due to the lateral flows from the tributaries attenuation of flood peak by some diffusion effects can be considered negligible discussed further in a later section secondly the flood peaks in the tributaries occurred at the same time as in the main channel these data driven assessments justified the approach adopted here to determine the input streamflow forcing data for the inundation models in this study input streamflow data for the three hypothetical flood events 10 100 and 500 year return periods were constructed by fusing nwm simulated outputs with usgs and fema estimates simulated hourly streamflow in all the associated nhdplus reaches were obtained from a pre operational offline repository of the nwm personal communications with the noaa national water center alabama for a recent flooding event in respective study domains september 25 october 1 2016 in cr buchmiller and eash 2010 also referenced as usgs 2010 in fig 5 and december 24 31 2015 in bwr hedgecock and feaster 2007 also referenced as usgs 2007 in fig 5 like other hydrologic models nwm outputs have some discrepancies relative to the observed data fig 4 since the use of nwm in this study was kept limited only to ensure hydrologic connectivity of river network bias in its streamflow simulations did not affect the relative accuracy of the inundation models hence further diagnostic evaluation of nwm s performance was not included here based on the statistical analyses of long term observations at the outlet of bwr peak flow values for different return periods were estimated by hedgecock and feaster 2007 accordingly an event specific scaling factor was calculated for the outlet of bwr being defined as the ratio of corresponding usgs estimated magnitude and the nwm peak flow usgs 02462951 fig 4 for all other nhdplus reaches including the main channel s upstream boundary location in bwr respective nwm streamflow hydrographs were multiplied by the outlet s event specific scaling factor to obtain three different sets of input forcing data similar approach was followed for cr except it was kept limited only for a 100 year flood event cr being a much larger domain with densified gauge network calculation of scaling factor for this case involved using usgs estimated peak flow at 14 upstream gauge stations addressed in buchmiller and eash 2010 in addition to that at the outlet for those reaches in cr with no usgs estimate the nearest downstream station was selected for scaling purposes fema 2008 2010 2013 2014 also estimates peak flows for different return periods leveraging some field studies and local expertise however such studies were available for five reaches in bwr and 16 reaches in cr dashed lines in fig 5 the fema suggested values were used in scaling factor calculation instead of usgs estimates wherever seemed appropriate i e specific reaches and flood return periods depending on availability effect of these scaling factors on the constructed input streamflow are presented in fig 5 in terms of relative channel thickness 2 2 2 inclusion of floodplain features as summarized in table 2 the terrain setups used for flood modeling in bwr include 1 ned without channel bathymetry or levee ned 2 ned with channel bathymetry ned bathymetry 3 ned with levee ned levee and 4 ned with both channel bathymetry and levee ned bathymetry levee however flood modeling for cr is conducted only with a single terrain setup based on ned without channel bathymetry or levee considering its large spatial extent 16 900 km2 compared to bwr s 62 km2 lack of continuous bathymetry data and least hydraulic controls the spatial resolution of ned was kept the same 10 m in every case hence plausible differences in simulated inundation depth and extent while using these different terrain setups evolve solely from the respective ability of the models to capture floodplain hydrodynamics although the fourth terrain setup i e ned bathymetry levee is the best case to closely represent river corridor floodplain others help to create insights on the sensitivity of a model to particular floodplain feature s the 10 m resolution of ned is not fine enough to identify abrupt topographical variability e g height width and location of a levee shape and thalweg of a channel let alone the persistent inaccuracy that might have induced from the acquisition of elevation data and associated interpolation techniques use of light detection and ranging lidar topography data significantly improves detection of land surface features such as levee but its inability to see through water surface and capture channel bathymetry is not unknown cook and merwade 2009 in case of bwr limited information on the longitudinal cross sectional dimensions and changes in elevation along the levee was obtained from a design inventory of the us army corps of engineers usace 2014 part of which were tentatively validated by the authors in a non exhaustive field survey using ground global positioning system gps equipment furthermore the main channel s water surface and bed elevation data were obtained from another field campaign obtained from the usace tuscaloosa field office at a spatial resolution of 2 10 m along and across the channel these are point elevation data which were transformed into raster format to mosaic with the 10 m ned producing the aforementioned terrain setups fig 6 shows the difference between the ned and ned bathymetry levee setups along a cross section and a longitudinal section of the main channel the effect of the dam locks was implicitly incorporated in the streamflow data section 2 2 1 2 2 3 land cover and surface channel roughness a common feature in hec ras 2d and autoroute also hand with some exceptions is the provision of spatially distributed values of surface and or channel roughness parameters in this study the same set of roughness values was used in each of the inundation models the 2011 national land cover database homer et al 2015 at a 30 m spatial resolution is selected as the input land use data for both test cases e g highlighted in fig 7 a as an example from bwr depending on the respective land use class a separate lookup table linked each grid cell of nlcd 2011 with a representative value of manning s roughness coefficient n manning s n values were selected based upon the suggestions from moore 2011 however the low roughness category was used considering the recommendation by follum et al 2017 all the 30 m nlcd grid cells classified as open water basically represent the river network hence they were assigned the roughness value of a natural channel n 0 03 unlike the hec ras 2d and autoroute models hand does not require assigning n for the land surface the current version of hand only uses channel n which was kept consistent with the other two models to enable an even comparison 2 3 flood inundation modeling 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model hec ras 2d hydrologic input to hec ras 2d refers to the streamflow hydrographs time series for each of the nhdplus reaches involved and a streamflow stage rating curve at the outlet location geospatial inputs include 1 terrain topography data and 2 spatially distributed gridded surface channel manning s n the model solves a 2d unsteady flow equation at hourly resolution using a diffusive wave approach although hec ras 2d can also employ a full momentum approach the saint venant equation it was avoided in this study as it does not produce substantial differences in simulated inundation in a fairly uniform terrain like bwr or cr despite the relatively intensive computational demand application of the saint venant equation in hec ras 2d would be more useful in simulating critical scenarios such as levee breach and design of hydraulic structures the simulation was performed on a heterogeneous mesh simultaneously having structured and un structured cells e g the mesh highlighted in fig 7 abrupt changes in the terrain e g river bank levee are delineated by breaklines and un structured cells up to nine faces and with different sizes while square cells 25 m are nested on the other parts of the landscape weighted average of elevation and roughness values respectively from all intersecting encompassing cells of the 10 m terrain and 30 m roughness grid nlcd being linked with the lookup table were poured on to a model cell regardless of its size shape in addition to capturing topographic details as precisely un structured cells and parsimoniously square cells as possible faces of these model cells work as virtual cross sections that regulate the propagation of flood wave although such a detailed model setup would enable enhanced simulation of floodplain channel s response in flooding conditions it requires substantial intervention from the modelers outputs from hec ras 2d are the time varying flood inundation extents and depths out of which only those at the time stamp of peak flow were extracted for comparison purposes running time is highly dependent on the amount of physical details imparted into the model e g mesh resolution number of boundary conditions 2 3 2 low complexity model autoroute unlike hec ras 2d autoroute uses peak flow not the time series hydrograph at each nhdplus reach other inputs to autoroute including topography data and distributed surface channel roughness values were the same as those used in hec ras 2d assuming 1d steady state flow autoroute uses manning s equation to calculate the normal flow depth over a high density number of cross sections while the cross section geometry and channel slope were automatically generated from topography data flood depth and inundation maps were simulated using a volume fill numerical method at each cross section follum et al 2017 provided more details on the setup rubrics and computational techniques of autoroute output from autoroute was a static set of inundation extent and depth corresponding to the peak flow used to force the model for each of the specific flood events table 2 although streamflow and other input data for autoroute were manually processed in this study supplementary tools have been developed for automatic pre processing to enable its execution in an operational setting snow 2016 autoroutepy 2 1 0 it should be noted that autoroute is currently closed source at the request of one of our military sponsors but may soon be open source due to this uncertainty the paper does not state whether it is open source the autoroute executable is publically available by sending an access request to michael follum michael l follum erdc dren mil 2 3 3 low complexity model hand hand is a hydrological terrain analysis approach which has been tested for reasonable functionality in producing flood inundation maps rodda 2005 rennó et al 2008 nobre et al 2011 in this approach vertical distance between a grid cell in topography data and the nearest cell along a stream that it drains into defines the hand value all cells on the landscape that have a hand value smaller than the specified stage water level are treated as inundated hand is entirely raster based and defines the inundated zone by a corresponding river segment therefore it does not require the creation of cross sections a user friendly seamless workflow for the hand model is currently under development however an executable prototype framework for us watersheds can be supported by xing zheng zhengxing utexas edu in this study 10 m hand rasters were created with different terrain setups four rasters for bwr and one for cr table 1 each with respect to the nhdplus river network e g liu et al 2016 these hand rasters were then used to estimate stage height channel hydraulic geometry relationships for each of the reaches e g zheng et al 2016 taking these relationships estimated channel length and average slope from the nhdplus database and predefined channel roughness value section 2 2 3 manning s equation was applied to generate streamflow stage rating curves for all the reaches using these rating curves input peak flow corresponding to a given return period was converted into a stage height finally the hand raster was used to create the inundation extents at these particular stage heights 2 4 model comparison metrics quantifying the differences in inundation extents and depths between two flood models and between flood models and the reference e g fema in bwr case study needs a mathematical scheme for the comparison of inundation extents an error matrix e g congalton and green 2008 was developed fig 8 using which kappa statistic and fitness statistic being denoted as κ and f respectively yu and lane 2006 were calculated to measure the degree of agreement or disagreement between two flood maps the κ statistic is a ratio between the actual agreement indicated by major diagonal of the error matrix of the two models and the chance of agreement expressed through marginal rows and columns of the error matrix eq 1 hence an impressive κ value is possible even with fewer matching wet cells for instance in the case of flood events where there are few number of conforming wet cells i e nw1 w2 relative to the large number of conforming dry cells i e nd1 d2 κ might be close to 1 1 κ n n w 1 w 2 n d 1 d 2 n w 1 d 1 w 2 n w 1 w 2 d 2 n w 1 d 1 d 2 n d 1 w 2 d 2 n 2 n w 1 d 1 w 2 n w 1 w 2 d 2 n w 1 d 1 d 2 n d 1 w 2 d 2 f reduces bias into results since it only considers the number of conforming wet cells predicted by both flood models eq 2 2 f n w 1 w 2 n w 1 w 2 d 2 n w 1 d 1 w 2 n w 1 w 2 where n is total number of cells n w 1 w 2 is number of cells predicted wet by both inundation models n d 1 d 2 is number of cells predicted dry by both inundation models n d 1 w 2 is number of cells predicted dry by model 1 but as wet by model 2 n w 1 d 2 is number of cells predicted wet by model 1 but as dry by model 2 n w 1 w 2 d 2 is number of cells where model 1 predicted them as wet while model 2 predicted either wet or dry n w 1 d 1 d 2 is number of cells where model 2 predicted them as dry while model 1 predicted either wet or dry n d 1 w 2 d 2 and n w 1 d 1 w 2 are being read in same fashion to n w 1 w 2 d 2 and n w 1 d 1 d 2 respectively both of these inundation metrics range from 0 to 1 denoting lowest and highest conformity respectively flood inundation depths were compared by calculating mean difference md and root mean squared difference rmsd between the simulated outputs from two models or between a model and a reference both md and rmsd were computed based upon an average of cell by cell difference and squared difference of two flood inundation depth layers 3 md 1 n i 1 n z 1 i z 2 i 4 rmsd 1 n i 1 n z 1 i z 2 i 2 where n is total number of raster cells z1 i and z2 i are depth values simulated respectively by flood model 1 and 2 at the ith cell md and rmsd need careful interpretation if used together lower md may not always come with lower rmsd for a constant md rmsd can increase as the variance associated with the frequency distribution of error magnitudes also increases accordingly the sole purpose of md was kept limited in this study only to evaluate a model s general overestimating underestimating tendency with respect to the other model or the fema reference while rmsd should be seen as a metric of models relative accuracy an r code rstudio 2017 was developed to perform one to one comparison of model products i e flood inundation extent and depth with the option of calculating a suite of conformity statistics as described above afshari 2016 2017 3 results and discussion this section presents the outcome of the study from three aspects 1 comparison among models for flood extents 2 comparison among models for flood depths and 3 comparison of the models with fema flood estimates for a specific flood magnitude only for bwr test case 3 1 comparison of flood extents 3 1 1 inter comparison of models for inundation extent for the cr test case hec ras 2d autoroute and hand were compared for flood extent and depth only for a 100 year flood only the most simplistic terrain setup without channel bathymetry or other possible floodplain features was considered in this case with a view to have a closer look on some critical aspects where flood models usually struggle over large spatial scales specifically the model comparisons on cr solicited a general assessment whether low complexity models behave in the same manner as the hydrodynamic model regardless of meandering main channel segments confluence and lower order headwater reaches in general hec ras 2d resulted in notably larger inundated area compared to autoroute and hand across the entire test case differences in inundated area between hec ras 2d and autoroute and between hec ras 2d and hand were respectively 382 and 229 km2 which made hand simulations closer to hec ras 2d although hand inundated a slightly larger area than autoroute spatial patterns of their respective inundation were nearly identical in each of the four cases a1 a4 highlighted in fig 9 this was also evident from κ and f as both of the low complexity models basically showed the same fitness scores against the inundation extent of hec ras 2d as indicated in section 2 4 concurrent occurrence of high κ and low f is quite possible κ shows conformity in the number and location of dry cells between the models not the conformity of their actual inundated extents still a κ value as high as one in cr strongly suggests that the low complexity models function very reasonably concerning the actual match of wet cells i e inundation obtaining a lower f value could be potentially misinterpreted it is likely for an uncalibrated low complexity model to show lower f values against a much more detailed hydrodynamic model especially when executed over a large area such as the cr nevertheless a relatively low fitness of inundated boundaries f values 0 5 in fig 9 cannot be undermined as the typical disagreement between the two models f values were found substantially higher when looked specifically into a3 or a4 portions of the test case this could also be supported by visually assessing the highlighted portions in cr fig 9 for example with respect to hec ras 2d low complexity models showed large differences along the main channel and its confluences with the tributaries a1 and a2 in fig 9 however such difference was found minimal in the lower order less meandering reaches in the upstream headwater catchments a3 and a4 in fig 9 a small scale yet more comprehensive comparison was deduced from the bwr test case focusing more on the models response to floodplain features such as bathymetry and levee hec ras 2d autoroute and hand were compared for flood extent using 10 100 and 500 year events and for four different terrain setups figs 10 12 the results suggest expansion of inundation extents when the return period increased from 10 year to 500 year for all the models however the percent change of extent between return periods was not identical when models were compared with one another for four terrain setups in hec ras 2d the average expansion of the flood extent was 25 and 11 from 10 year to 100 year and from 100 year to 500 year flood events respectively although autoroute is not a hydrodynamic model it closely mimics hec ras 2d in most parts of the study region autoroute showed an average expansion of flood extent by 20 between 10 year and 100 year and 10 between 100 year and 500 year event simulations compared to hec ras 2d a limitation in autoroute is the absence of any downstream boundary condition dam lock in bwr main channel accordingly difference in inundation extents between hec ras 2d and autoroute as observed in the first column of figs 10 12 might be due to autoroute s inability to capture the possible backwater effect during the higher magnitude events similar to autoroute representation of the wave propagation e g backwater effect is a limitation in hand moreover hand showed flooding in physically implausible locations which have similar elevation difference with respect to the nearest reach the main channel in this case as a result hand produced larger inundated area than autoroute when both were compared against hec ras 2d this is similar to what was observed in the case of cr test case for bwr hand showed an average expansion of flood extent by 31 between 10 year and 100 year events and 5 between 100 year and 500 year flood events among all the configurations regardless of terrain setup or flood event autoroute invariably showed better performance than hand in capturing the inundation extent of bwr in terms of κ and f 3 1 2 effect of terrain setups on inundation extent depending on the model effects of floodplain attributes e g levee and bathymetry on the simulated inundation extents can be noticeably different in the bwr test case hec ras 2d and autoroute showed reasonably good agreement irrespective of return periods even without the incorporation of channel bathymetry or levee e g f 0 71 0 75 incorporation of the levee ned levee setup could not mitigate hand s overestimating tendency as the relative elevation with respect to the nearest channel is a key determinant for hand the model essentially over laid the same over bank stage from the particular channel segment on both sides of the levee in reality spatial orientation of the levee acts as a confinement and thus controls the movement of flood wave which was relatively well captured by hec ras 2d and autoroute both autoroute and hand showed prominent overestimation of inundation extents relative to hec ras 2d throughout the entire length of the main channel once bathymetry was incorporated in the terrain more specifically hec ras 2d tended to retain more within bank water because of the deeper and wider channel in the ned bathymetry and ned bathymetry levee setups this phenomenon was vivid for 10 year and 100 year events figs 10 and 11 respectively accordingly the best model conformity in the ned levee setup i e highest κ and f does not necessarily mean that model simulated inundation extents were more accurate in this particular terrain setup considering ned bathymetry levee to be a relatively better realization of the floodplain compared to other terrain setups raises questions to why autoroute and hand are unable to leverage from this terrain setup and remains as an outstanding question needing further investigation looking into possible scopes of model re conceptualization regardless the ned bathymetry levee setup exemplified a crucial aspect regarding the effect of bathymetry in case of an extreme flood event e g 500 year fig 12 in that case flood water was found to have over topped the levee in the ned levee setup in all the models but hec ras 2d and autoroute did not allow over topping when bathymetry was included in the model configuration ned bathymetry levee this is a clear example of bathymetry being a controlling factor that determines the shape of flood inundation map except in hand here as well autoroute has relatively better capability than hand at least with current versions 3 2 comparison of flood depth inter comparison of simulated inundation depths as raster data layers was carried out only for the 100 year flood event in both cr and bwr test cases the common intersecting area of the inundation extents generated by two particular models was taken as the boundary within which flood depth comparison was carried out 3 2 1 inter comparison of models for inundation depth fig 13 demonstrates the comparison among hec ras 2d autoroute and hand for inundation depth in cr only for a 100 year flood event over the entire stream network of cr hec ras 2d produced 11 16 m md deeper floods than autoroute and hand which is in line with its overestimation of inundation extent fig 9 similarly both low complexity models had minimal difference 2 m in their respective simulated depths however hand produced a slightly deeper flood than autoroute as evident from md making the models behavior coherent with what was depicted in fig 9 for their flood extent simulation furthermore hand simulated depth had an rmsd of 9 m against hec ras 2d contrary to autoroute s 17 m this led to the notion that hand simulations were relatively more consistent with hec ras 2d at least in cr the meandering main channel a near outlet location and confluences a1 and a2 again appeared to be the hot spots where both autoroute and hand struggled but their performance to simulate flood depth is equivalent to hec ras 2d in the case of less meandering upstream headwater catchments a3 and a4 for the bwr test case inundation depth of a 100 year flood event for all terrain setups showed an average md of 0 8 m between hec ras 2d and autoroute with autoroute resulting in deeper inundation fig 14 hand produced even deeper inundation as its average md from hec ras 2d was about 4 m in general both autoroute and hand overestimated depth with respect to hec ras 2d which is opposite to what was detected from the cr test case analogous to the results shown for inundation extent section 3 1 1 bias in depth simulation was nearly 50 less in autoroute than that in hand in terms of their rmsd against hec ras 2d variability of depth along the main channel was found to be more consistent between hec ras 2d and autoroute in most parts of the river network on the other hand variability of depth simulated by hand was relatively more erratic hence may not be realistic in the 16 900 km2 380 km long cr test case the low complexity models generally showed an underestimating tendency to simulate inundation extent and depth while hand produced closer results to the hec ras 2d model the opposite was found in the 62 km2 15 km long bwr test case with autoroute being relatively accurate with respect to hec ras 2d here the scale is important for example there are specific locations with short reach segments within cr where the low complexity models behaved similarly as in the case of bwr hence the outcome from the bwr test case showing autoroute and hand overestimating inundation extent and depth is not an anomaly rather it is a very likely subset of possibilities that might have happened if a much larger domain along the black warrior river system was modeled in this study it could seem ambiguous why autoroute differs from hand even though both are based on manning s equation despite using manning s equation the procedure of generating flood maps is not similar in these models autoroute generates flood inundation map extent and depth vertically whereas hand does it laterally more specifically autoroute automatically generates cross sections calculates flood extent for user defined input streamflow values using iterative calculation of flow for every cross section follum et al 2017 the depth is incrementally increased from the lowest point in the reach until the calculated streamflow from manning s equation matches the input streamflow in the hand method first a synthetic stage discharge rating curve is generated for each nhdplus reach using manning s equation for a user defined input streamflow a corresponding depth value is extracted from such a rating curve liu et al 2016 all cells on the landscape with a hand value smaller than this depth will be considered as inundated hence this method does not require cross sections and it also does not have the direct incorporation of streamflow as in autoroute in this way use of manning s equation in hand does not produce similar results as in the autoroute model 3 2 2 effect of terrain setups on inundation depth similar to the multi model multi terrain assessment of inundation extent section 3 1 2 simulated flood depth in the bwr test case was also evaluated under four different terrain setups when the models were configured with the simplest terrain setups ned and ned levee autoroute showed the least bias for flood depth simulation with respect to hec ras 2d relevant rmsd values for a 100 year event fig 14 once bathymetry was incorporated autoroute showed signs of discrepancy as the rmsd value relative to hec ras 2d increased by more than 1 m exactly similar phenomenon was observed in the case of hand when it was compared with hec ras 2d middle column of fig 14 what is more interesting here is the remarkable similarity between autoroute and hand pertaining to their behavior in depth simulation in certain segments of the main channel contrary to their general depth overestimating tendency relative to hec ras 2d both autoroute and hand distinctly underestimated flood inundation depth in the middle and near outlet locations in the bathymetry informed terrain setups even when comparing hand and autoroute ned bathymetry levee showed the highest rmsd 7 64 m out of all terrain setups being modeled here overall this analysis resonates the insensitivity of these low complexity flood models to cope with hydrodynamics especially in meandering portions of the channel middle section the deeper portions in the near outlet location with a navigational dam lock and nearby levee not to mention their inability to capture back water effects however in such cases autoroute seemed to be better equipped than hand similar to the findings highlighted in section 3 1 2 for simulation of inundation extent 3 3 evaluation of model performance with fema reference estimates fig 15 compares model simulated inundation extent and depth for a 100 year flood event with the corresponding fema estimates this assessment was kept limited only on bwr test case as it has nearly all real life examples of floodplain features that often make flood models under perform the fema flood map i e inundation extent was obtained via flood map service center https msc fema gov portal which is the official public source for sharing flood hazard information in terms of flood maps and other related products the technical information from fema coordinated needs management strategy fema cnms platform as well as fema s r4 regional service center assured that channel bathymetry was not considered for developing the 100 year flood hazard map in bwr another considerable factor was that fema estimates on flood extent and depth were available only for the downstream portion of bwr encompassing the levee hence comparing the models with fema estimates seemed justified only for the ned levee terrain setup clearly hec ras 2d had the most conformity with fema estimates for flood extent fig 15 the κ and f scores were 0 94 and 0 74 respectively for the hec ras 2d versus fema case these scores were 0 93 and 0 69 when the flood extent generated by autoroute was compared with the fema flood map comparison of the hand and fema flood extents resulted in κ and f equal to 0 88 and 0 53 respectively in case of flood depths hec ras 2d quite expectedly produced the lowest rmsd 2 23 m while autoroute and hand had an rmsd of 3 33 m and 5 36 m respectively the average of differences md for fema flood depth against hec ras 2d autoroute and hand were respectively captured as 1 55 0 37 and 1 27 m the md values show that autoroute and fema are relatively similar whereas hand and hec ras 2d underestimate the flood depth derived by fema autoroute and fema both use similar methods manning equation which can explain similarity of md values since hec ras 2d applies the unsteady hydrodynamic 2d diffusion wave equation it might produce lower depth compared to the steady state approach this is due to the fact that the unsteady state equation factors in additional physically based terms may lower the simulated water stages compared to ones estimated by steady state approach being applied in fema and autoroute hand model shows overestimation of depth at upstream and abruptly underestimation of depth when a levee exists fig 15 which resulted in overall underestimation of depth with this model compared to the fema model 4 conclusion this paper inaugurates a new line of research to compare the sensitivity and suitability of new generation low complexity flood models with increasing flood hazards across the world it has been a burning question whether it is sustainable to employ computationally intensive yet supposedly better hydrodynamic models in large scale hyper resolution operational flood simulation against such concern a few models were developed with the fast computing capability due to simplified input requirements and process representations yet reasonably good in terms of prediction accuracy this paper compares two such genres of recently developed inundation models a hydrodynamic model i e hec ras 2d and two low complexity models i e autoroute and hand to the best of authors knowledge this is also the first flood inundation assessment using united states national water model nwm streamflow data the assessment presented in this study is based upon 39 model configurations involving three models three flood events four terrain setups and two test beds models were compared for two hydrologically different and geographically distant test cases in the united states including the 16 900 km2 cedar river cr watershed in state of iowa and a 62 km2 domain along the black warrior river bwr in state of alabama model comparison in cr was conducted using only one terrain setup i e national elevation dataset ned and a 100 year flood event with a view to focus on issues such as meandering channel segments and confluences where flood models usually struggle a much more detailed analysis was conducted over the bwr test case including moderate to extreme flood events at 10 100 and 500 year return periods and various terrain setups with levee and or bathymetry the streamflow time series from the pre operational offline repository of the nwm were used and processed to define inflow boundary conditions of the flood events for all nhdplus reaches in the test cases results showed hec ras 2d autoroute and hand can be ranked according to their model complexity and computational capability hec ras 2d is the most and hand is the least complex model the hand model results were relatively closer to hec ras 2d compared to the autoroute model for depth and flood extent in the cr study domain however in the relatively less meandering upstream headwater rivers both autoroute and hand behaved the same as hec ras 2d this can be attributed to the nature of low complexity models their inherent capabilities and limitation which might perform well in simple landscape results also showed that in complex conditions such as meandering main channels and confluences low complexity models struggle to generate results that are comparable to the hec ras 2d model in the bwr test case autoroute generally outperformed hand when compared to the hec ras 2d model when hydraulic controls such as dams and levee were incorporated one should note that both low complexity models demonstrated identical spatial variation of flood extents despite the difference between magnitudes of flood extent or flood depth considering model performance with different terrain setups hec ras 2d and autoroute models showed similar results for the ned levee terrain setup with hand showing some inconsistency in capturing the effect of any abrupt geophysical variation e g enforced by the levee contrarily terrain setups with bathymetry e g the ned bathymetry levee terrain setup showed prominent discrepancy between the low complexity models in comparison with the hydrodynamic model this behavior is speculated to be driven by assimilation of different river bed slope at each nhdplus reach i e channels with bathymetry versus channels having a flat bed as given by ned and thus resultant change in the vertical distance between a given cell on the floodplain and the nearest channel cell that it drains into in general the low complexity models should be set up with caution in flat and densely urbanized zones e g in the downstream regions of the bwr study domain since they do not capture the backwater effects created by existing hydraulic structures further study in different climate and land use conditions would be helpful to validate these findings despite the generally favorable results obtained in this study it is up to the users discretion whether a low complexity flood inundation mapping tool should be preferred or complex hydrodynamic models as a near future application low complexity models can provide a rapid first order estimate of flood inundation to prioritize evacuation areas during severe flood events furthermore the combination of both types of modeling approaches can be considered for instance the low complexity models can be used for flood mapping at the regional scale with a nested high fidelity model at the local scale where anthropogenic effects and topographic conditions need to be considered results of this study showed that low complexity tools can have nearly equal applicability while retaining the value of complex hydrodynamic models this notion is based upon a trade off between highest possible accuracy and computational efficiency which is permissible for operational needs moreover to provide operational hydrologic support in geographic areas where hydrologic data is sparse and because the assessments provided are time critical alternative approaches can be employed to develop terrain and bathymetry data for instance idealized power law hydraulic geometries which are derived based on bank full hydraulics of the channel can be established given measured basic hydraulics i e discharge water surface width average depth and average velocity and applied to generate asymptotic forms of the channel bed geometry application and deployment of this methodology in the low complexity models can be considered as a far future work acknowledgments this work was

7573,the objective of this study is to compare two new generation low complexity tools autoroute and height above the nearest drainage hand with a two dimensional hydrodynamic model hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras 2d the assessment was conducted on two hydrologically different and geographically distant test cases in the united states including the 16 900 km2 cedar river cr watershed in iowa and a 62 km2 domain along the black warrior river bwr in alabama for bwr twelve different configurations were set up for each of the models including four different terrain setups e g with and without channel bathymetry and a levee and three flooding conditions representing moderate to extreme hazards at 10 100 and 500 year return periods for the cr watershed models were compared with a simplistic terrain setup without bathymetry and any form of hydraulic controls and one flooding condition 100 year return period input streamflow forcing data representing these hypothetical events were constructed by applying a new fusion approach on national water model outputs simulated inundation extent and depth from autoroute hand and hec ras 2d were compared with one another and with the corresponding fema reference estimates irrespective of the configurations the low complexity models were able to produce inundation extents similar to hec ras 2d with autoroute showing slightly higher accuracy than the hand model among four terrain setups the one including both levee and channel bathymetry showed lowest fitness score on the spatial agreement of inundation extent due to the weak physical representation of low complexity models compared to a hydrodynamic model for inundation depth the low complexity models showed an overestimating tendency especially in the deeper segments of the channel based on such reasonably good prediction skills low complexity flood models can be considered as a suitable alternative for fast predictions in large scale hyper resolution operational frameworks without completely overriding hydrodynamic models efficacy keywords hyper resolution modeling autoroute hand hec ras 2d multi model comparison national water model 1 introduction with an increasing stress of climate and land use changes in recent times flood events are becoming more frequent and perhaps more disastrous hirabayashi et al 2013 in the past 30 years estimated costs of average annual flood damage is approximately 8 billion within the united states us national weather service hydrologic information center 2016 accordingly there is a growing interest in regional to continental scale high hyper resolution flood forecasting and risk assessment across various parts of the globe e g alfieri et al 2013 bierkens et al 2015 paiva et al 2011 pappenberger et al 2012 winsemius et al 2013 wood et al 2011 maidment 2015 proposed a modeling architecture to forecast streamflow in 2 7 million river reaches across the continental us which became operational in 2016 under the national water model nwm framework http water noaa gov about nwm despite these advancements translating streamflow forecasts into time varying flood inundation maps with reasonable accuracy and speed remains an outstanding concern hydrologic models contain a rainfall runoff estimator and a channel routing scheme therefore another model component is required to simulate the over bank conditions i e flood inundation many model applications for inundation mapping exist in literature table 1 out of these alternatives hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras with 1d flow simulation functionality has been the principal model used in us federal emergency management agency fema s national flood insurance program fema 2015 and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s advanced hydrologic prediction service noaa 2011 the ability of performing coupled 1d 2d analysis has been recently added to hec ras hereafter hec ras 2d table 1 which is still being tested under different geophysical settings with a few exceptions of the lisflood fp model e g alfieri et al 2014 rajib et al 2016 schumann et al 2013 most of the model applications listed in table 1 are limited to small spatial scales over either a single river reach or a low density river network executing most of the hydraulic hydrodynamic models requires modelers intervention to provide substantial spatial details e g channel and flood plain cross sections optimum parameter values which are often not readily available accordingly the majority of these modeling packages come with a black box configuration that can be executed only for research purposes in a stand alone desktop environment kauffeldt et al 2016 néelz 2009 these models also require considerable setup and computation time especially with high resolution river networks accordingly using a model that is as realistic as possible is not the panacea hunter et al 2007 the choice should be balanced against several other considerations when it comes to the question of integration into a continental scale operational system such as the nwm choice of a hydraulic hydrodynamic model as component of a large scale framework is determined less by the superior model physics and more by its suitability to be executed in cyber infrastructures computational overhead interoperability with the driver hydrologic model output retrieval and visualization capabilities rajib et al 2016 being driven by such constraints follum 2012 introduced autoroute table 1 as a rapid tool to create flood inundation mapping over large scales using the simulated streamflow outputs from tavakoly et al 2017 as an input forcing to the autoroute follum et al 2017 generated high resolution 10 m flood maps for the midwest us 230 000 km2 and the mississippi delta 109 500 km2 despite such intensive application computational overhead for executing autoroute was remarkably small liu et al 2016 adopted the concept of height above the nearest drainage hand nobre et al 2011 rennó et al 2008 and transformed 10 m national elevation dataset ned for the continental us into a hand raster this hand raster shows the relative height of a given location above the nearest reach in the nationally mapped river network national hydrography dataset plus maidment et al 2016 featured several case studies based upon the loose coupling of nwm streamflow outputs with this hand raster to generate near real time flood inundation maps considering these recent advancements it is timely to examine whether fast computing low complexity inundation mapping tools with simplified input requirements and process representations can be preferred from an operational standpoint particularly in time limited emergency response scenarios over computationally exhaustive input intensive physics based and presumably accurate hydraulic hydrodynamic models ability to capture natural floodplain processes and the influence of man made control structures is different in each model no model has the perfect realization of flooding hence simplification of the model physics may further undermine its already limited ability in this regard a multi model comparison can help measure relative accuracy of each model previous studies are heavily skewed towards the comparison of 1d versus 2d hydraulic hydrodynamic models cook and merwade 2009 alho and aaltonen 2008 benjankar et al 2014 horritt and bates 2002 leandro et al 2009 tayefi et al 2007 vojinovic and tutulic 2009 several studies have compared different 2d models

bates 2001 mason et al 2003 pappenberger et al 2005 effects of other geophysical and man made attributes including channel bathymetry levees and bridges on model simulated flood inundation has remained relatively unexplored e g cook and merwade 2009 pappenberger et al 2006 the new generation low complexity inundation mapping tools such as autoroute and hand have not been compared with each other or with advanced hydrodynamic models e g hec ras 2d although autoroute was compared with reference inundation extents follum et al 2017 hand s efficacy is yet to be tested this study developed upon the preliminary work of afshari et al 2016 attempts to fill this gap with a view to provide a practical yet reliable flood inundation modeling alternative to be coupled with continental scale hydrologic forecasting models the main objective of this study is to evaluate the relative accuracy between autoroute hand and hec ras 2d for different magnitudes of flooding events in terms of both inundation extents and depths the cedar river cr in iowa and black warrior river bwr in alabama in the us were considered as test cases to represent two different spatial scales terrain land use and hydro climatic conditions for one of the test cases bwr models are compared after incorporating geophysical and man made attributes e g channel bathymetry and levee such that the resultant difference in the outcomes invoke avenues of future refinement in their current structures 2 methodology the assessment presented in this study is based upon 39 model configurations involving three models three flood events four terrain setups and two test beds fig 1 summarizes the general design of this study showing that each model i e hec ras 2d autoroute and hand was executed over the bwr test case separately for three flood events 10 100 and 500 year return period and four different terrain setups e g with and without channel bathymetry and levee concerning the much larger test case i e cr only a single flood event 100 year return period and terrain setup without channel bathymetry and levee were considered the models were compared with one another for inundation extent and depth separately in each of the terrain flood configurations in one of the configurations of bwr fema estimated flood extents and depths were also used as a reference to compare with model simulations all these configurations are summarized in table 2 to keep the terminology obvious and self explanatory configurations were named in terms of the attributes in their respective terrain setups e g ned ned

area along the black warrior river bwr in alabama in the us the cr watershed stretches about 380 km in a mild moderate terrain 0 0001 m m from mower county in minnesota to a us geological survey usgs outlet in cedar rapids iowa usgs 05464500 along its way downstream the main channel is fed by 11 major tributaries some of which are also divided into lower order upstream headwater reaches the bwr domain stretches approximately 15 km through a moderate slightly terrain 0 0003 m m in tuscaloosa county alabama with 15 adjoining tributaries the river networks used for flood simulation in both cases were obtained from nhdplus mckay et al 2012 the dominant land use in cr is agricultural whereas the bwr domain used in this study is mostly an urban landscape with some forested areas cr is relatively a natural landscape with least obstruction by man made hydraulic control structures in contrast the bwr domain has one levee and two lock dams in the main channel associated with two usgs gauge stations fig 2 the levee has been in operation since august 1999 construction date to reduce flooding damage in the city of northport according to the us army corps of engineers national levee database the approximate length and average crest elevation of the levee are 3 3 km and 47 5 m respectively the oliver lock and dam is located at the outlet of the study domain usgs 02465000 whereas the holt lock and dam usgs 02462961 defines the upstream boundary location for the main channel flood inundation is influenced by these dams levees due to their flow regulatory role and to possible backwater effects during extreme events incorporation of these man made control structures even in their simplest forms can supplement the limited hydrodynamic simulation capacity of an inundation mapping tool 2 2 model inputs to enable an even assessment the forcing data i e input streamflow topographic resolution land cover classification and the values of channel surface roughness parameters were kept identical when the models were compared under the same configuration the following sub sections describe the model setups including the sources of these input data and details on how they were processed for this study 2 2 1 construction of input streamflow data the specific flood magnitudes used for model simulation for this study are not actual events the representative streamflow data to force the inundation models were constructed while maintaining the hydrologic connectivity of the river network and therefore accounting for the contribution of tributaries for instance difference between monthly mean downstream and upstream streamflow in the bwr domain implies higher values in the downstream station 87 of the time fig 3 a fig 3b comparing daily streamflow data at the upstream and downstream gauge stations for 19 peak flow events during a past 40 year period 1976 2014 also validates this notion these findings help to realize two critical factors regarding the connectivity aspect mentioned above first amplification of flood magnitude while proceeding towards the outlet was due to the lateral flows from the tributaries attenuation of flood peak by some diffusion effects can be considered negligible discussed further in a later section secondly the flood peaks in the tributaries occurred at the same time as in the main channel these data driven assessments justified the approach adopted here to determine the input streamflow forcing data for the inundation models in this study input streamflow data for the three hypothetical flood events 10 100 and 500 year return periods were constructed by fusing nwm simulated outputs with usgs and fema estimates simulated hourly streamflow in all the associated nhdplus reaches were obtained from a pre operational offline repository of the nwm personal communications with the noaa national water center alabama for a recent flooding event in respective study domains september 25 october 1 2016 in cr buchmiller and eash 2010 also referenced as usgs 2010 in fig 5 and december 24 31 2015 in bwr hedgecock and feaster 2007 also referenced as usgs 2007 in fig 5 like other hydrologic models nwm outputs have some discrepancies relative to the observed data fig 4 since the use of nwm in this study was kept limited only to ensure hydrologic connectivity of river network bias in its streamflow simulations did not affect the relative accuracy of the inundation models hence further diagnostic evaluation of nwm s performance was not included here based on the statistical analyses of long term observations at the outlet of bwr peak flow values for different return periods were estimated by hedgecock and feaster 2007 accordingly an event specific scaling factor was calculated for the outlet of bwr being defined as the ratio of corresponding usgs estimated magnitude and the nwm peak flow usgs 02462951 fig 4 for all other nhdplus reaches including the main channel s upstream boundary location in bwr respective nwm streamflow hydrographs were multiplied by the outlet s event specific scaling factor to obtain three different sets of input forcing data similar approach was followed for cr except it was kept limited only for a 100 year flood event cr being a much larger domain with densified gauge network calculation of scaling factor for this case involved using usgs estimated peak flow at 14 upstream gauge stations addressed in buchmiller and eash 2010 in addition to that at the outlet for those reaches in cr with no usgs estimate the nearest downstream station was selected for scaling purposes fema 2008 2010 2013 2014 also estimates peak flows for different return periods leveraging some field studies and local expertise however such studies were available for five reaches in bwr and 16 reaches in cr dashed lines in fig 5 the fema suggested values were used in scaling factor calculation instead of usgs estimates wherever seemed appropriate i e specific reaches and flood return periods depending on availability effect of these scaling factors on the constructed input streamflow are presented in fig 5 in terms of relative channel thickness 2 2 2 inclusion of floodplain features as summarized in table 2 the terrain setups used for flood modeling in bwr include 1 ned without channel bathymetry or levee ned 2 ned with channel bathymetry ned bathymetry 3 ned with levee ned levee and 4 ned with both channel bathymetry and levee ned bathymetry levee however flood modeling for cr is conducted only with a single terrain setup based on ned without channel bathymetry or levee considering its large spatial extent 16 900 km2 compared to bwr s 62 km2 lack of continuous bathymetry data and least hydraulic controls the spatial resolution of ned was kept the same 10 m in every case hence plausible differences in simulated inundation depth and extent while using these different terrain setups evolve solely from the respective ability of the models to capture floodplain hydrodynamics although the fourth terrain setup i e ned bathymetry levee is the best case to closely represent river corridor floodplain others help to create insights on the sensitivity of a model to particular floodplain feature s the 10 m resolution of ned is not fine enough to identify abrupt topographical variability e g height width and location of a levee shape and thalweg of a channel let alone the persistent inaccuracy that might have induced from the acquisition of elevation data and associated interpolation techniques use of light detection and ranging lidar topography data significantly improves detection of land surface features such as levee but its inability to see through water surface and capture channel bathymetry is not unknown cook and merwade 2009 in case of bwr limited information on the longitudinal cross sectional dimensions and changes in elevation along the levee was obtained from a design inventory of the us army corps of engineers usace 2014 part of which were tentatively validated by the authors in a non exhaustive field survey using ground global positioning system gps equipment furthermore the main channel s water surface and bed elevation data were obtained from another field campaign obtained from the usace tuscaloosa field office at a spatial resolution of 2 10 m along and across the channel these are point elevation data which were transformed into raster format to mosaic with the 10 m ned producing the aforementioned terrain setups fig 6 shows the difference between the ned and ned bathymetry levee setups along a cross section and a longitudinal section of the main channel the effect of the dam locks was implicitly incorporated in the streamflow data section 2 2 1 2 2 3 land cover and surface channel roughness a common feature in hec ras 2d and autoroute also hand with some exceptions is the provision of spatially distributed values of surface and or channel roughness parameters in this study the same set of roughness values was used in each of the inundation models the 2011 national land cover database homer et al 2015 at a 30 m spatial resolution is selected as the input land use data for both test cases e g highlighted in fig 7 a as an example from bwr depending on the respective land use class a separate lookup table linked each grid cell of nlcd 2011 with a representative value of manning s roughness coefficient n manning s n values were selected based upon the suggestions from moore 2011 however the low roughness category was used considering the recommendation by follum et al 2017 all the 30 m nlcd grid cells classified as open water basically represent the river network hence they were assigned the roughness value of a natural channel n 0 03 unlike the hec ras 2d and autoroute models hand does not require assigning n for the land surface the current version of hand only uses channel n which was kept consistent with the other two models to enable an even comparison 2 3 flood inundation modeling 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model hec ras 2d hydrologic input to hec ras 2d refers to the streamflow hydrographs time series for each of the nhdplus reaches involved and a streamflow stage rating curve at the outlet location geospatial inputs include 1 terrain topography data and 2 spatially distributed gridded surface channel manning s n the model solves a 2d unsteady flow equation at hourly resolution using a diffusive wave approach although hec ras 2d can also employ a full momentum approach the saint venant equation it was avoided in this study as it does not produce substantial differences in simulated inundation in a fairly uniform terrain like bwr or cr despite the relatively intensive computational demand application of the saint venant equation in hec ras 2d would be more useful in simulating critical scenarios such as levee breach and design of hydraulic structures the simulation was performed on a heterogeneous mesh simultaneously having structured and un structured cells e g the mesh highlighted in fig 7 abrupt changes in the terrain e g river bank levee are delineated by breaklines and un structured cells up to nine faces and with different sizes while square cells 25 m are nested on the other parts of the landscape weighted average of elevation and roughness values respectively from all intersecting encompassing cells of the 10 m terrain and 30 m roughness grid nlcd being linked with the lookup table were poured on to a model cell regardless of its size shape in addition to capturing topographic details as precisely un structured cells and parsimoniously square cells as possible faces of these model cells work as virtual cross sections that regulate the propagation of flood wave although such a detailed model setup would enable enhanced simulation of floodplain channel s response in flooding conditions it requires substantial intervention from the modelers outputs from hec ras 2d are the time varying flood inundation extents and depths out of which only those at the time stamp of peak flow were extracted for comparison purposes running time is highly dependent on the amount of physical details imparted into the model e g mesh resolution number of boundary conditions 2 3 2 low complexity model autoroute unlike hec ras 2d autoroute uses peak flow not the time series hydrograph at each nhdplus reach other inputs to autoroute including topography data and distributed surface channel roughness values were the same as those used in hec ras 2d assuming 1d steady state flow autoroute uses manning s equation to calculate the normal flow depth over a high density number of cross sections while the cross section geometry and channel slope were automatically generated from topography data flood depth and inundation maps were simulated using a volume fill numerical method at each cross section follum et al 2017 provided more details on the setup rubrics and computational techniques of autoroute output from autoroute was a static set of inundation extent and depth corresponding to the peak flow used to force the model for each of the specific flood events table 2 although streamflow and other input data for autoroute were manually processed in this study supplementary tools have been developed for automatic pre processing to enable its execution in an operational setting snow 2016 autoroutepy 2 1 0 it should be noted that autoroute is currently closed source at the request of one of our military sponsors but may soon be open source due to this uncertainty the paper does not state whether it is open source the autoroute executable is publically available by sending an access request to michael follum michael l follum erdc dren mil 2 3 3 low complexity model hand hand is a hydrological terrain analysis approach which has been tested for reasonable functionality in producing flood inundation maps rodda 2005 rennó et al 2008 nobre et al 2011 in this approach vertical distance between a grid cell in topography data and the nearest cell along a stream that it drains into defines the hand value all cells on the landscape that have a hand value smaller than the specified stage water level are treated as inundated hand is entirely raster based and defines the inundated zone by a corresponding river segment therefore it does not require the creation of cross sections a user friendly seamless workflow for the hand model is currently under development however an executable prototype framework for us watersheds can be supported by xing zheng zhengxing utexas edu in this study 10 m hand rasters were created with different terrain setups four rasters for bwr and one for cr table 1 each with respect to the nhdplus river network e g liu et al 2016 these hand rasters were then used to estimate stage height channel hydraulic geometry relationships for each of the reaches e g zheng et al 2016 taking these relationships estimated channel length and average slope from the nhdplus database and predefined channel roughness value section 2 2 3 manning s equation was applied to generate streamflow stage rating curves for all the reaches using these rating curves input peak flow corresponding to a given return period was converted into a stage height finally the hand raster was used to create the inundation extents at these particular stage heights 2 4 model comparison metrics quantifying the differences in inundation extents and depths between two flood models and between flood models and the reference e g fema in bwr case study needs a mathematical scheme for the comparison of inundation extents an error matrix e g congalton and green 2008 was developed fig 8 using which kappa statistic and fitness statistic being denoted as κ and f respectively yu and lane 2006 were calculated to measure the degree of agreement or disagreement between two flood maps the κ statistic is a ratio between the actual agreement indicated by major diagonal of the error matrix of the two models and the chance of agreement expressed through marginal rows and columns of the error matrix eq 1 hence an impressive κ value is possible even with fewer matching wet cells for instance in the case of flood events where there are few number of conforming wet cells i e nw1 w2 relative to the large number of conforming dry cells i e nd1 d2 κ might be close to 1 1 κ n n w 1 w 2 n d 1 d 2 n w 1 d 1 w 2 n w 1 w 2 d 2 n w 1 d 1 d 2 n d 1 w 2 d 2 n 2 n w 1 d 1 w 2 n w 1 w 2 d 2 n w 1 d 1 d 2 n d 1 w 2 d 2 f reduces bias into results since it only considers the number of conforming wet cells predicted by both flood models eq 2 2 f n w 1 w 2 n w 1 w 2 d 2 n w 1 d 1 w 2 n w 1 w 2 where n is total number of cells n w 1 w 2 is number of cells predicted wet by both inundation models n d 1 d 2 is number of cells predicted dry by both inundation models n d 1 w 2 is number of cells predicted dry by model 1 but as wet by model 2 n w 1 d 2 is number of cells predicted wet by model 1 but as dry by model 2 n w 1 w 2 d 2 is number of cells where model 1 predicted them as wet while model 2 predicted either wet or dry n w 1 d 1 d 2 is number of cells where model 2 predicted them as dry while model 1 predicted either wet or dry n d 1 w 2 d 2 and n w 1 d 1 w 2 are being read in same fashion to n w 1 w 2 d 2 and n w 1 d 1 d 2 respectively both of these inundation metrics range from 0 to 1 denoting lowest and highest conformity respectively flood inundation depths were compared by calculating mean difference md and root mean squared difference rmsd between the simulated outputs from two models or between a model and a reference both md and rmsd were computed based upon an average of cell by cell difference and squared difference of two flood inundation depth layers 3 md 1 n i 1 n z 1 i z 2 i 4 rmsd 1 n i 1 n z 1 i z 2 i 2 where n is total number of raster cells z1 i and z2 i are depth values simulated respectively by flood model 1 and 2 at the ith cell md and rmsd need careful interpretation if used together lower md may not always come with lower rmsd for a constant md rmsd can increase as the variance associated with the frequency distribution of error magnitudes also increases accordingly the sole purpose of md was kept limited in this study only to evaluate a model s general overestimating underestimating tendency with respect to the other model or the fema reference while rmsd should be seen as a metric of models relative accuracy an r code rstudio 2017 was developed to perform one to one comparison of model products i e flood inundation extent and depth with the option of calculating a suite of conformity statistics as described above afshari 2016 2017 3 results and discussion this section presents the outcome of the study from three aspects 1 comparison among models for flood extents 2 comparison among models for flood depths and 3 comparison of the models with fema flood estimates for a specific flood magnitude only for bwr test case 3 1 comparison of flood extents 3 1 1 inter comparison of models for inundation extent for the cr test case hec ras 2d autoroute and hand were compared for flood extent and depth only for a 100 year flood only the most simplistic terrain setup without channel bathymetry or other possible floodplain features was considered in this case with a view to have a closer look on some critical aspects where flood models usually struggle over large spatial scales specifically the model comparisons on cr solicited a general assessment whether low complexity models behave in the same manner as the hydrodynamic model regardless of meandering main channel segments confluence and lower order headwater reaches in general hec ras 2d resulted in notably larger inundated area compared to autoroute and hand across the entire test case differences in inundated area between hec ras 2d and autoroute and between hec ras 2d and hand were respectively 382 and 229 km2 which made hand simulations closer to hec ras 2d although hand inundated a slightly larger area than autoroute spatial patterns of their respective inundation were nearly identical in each of the four cases a1 a4 highlighted in fig 9 this was also evident from κ and f as both of the low complexity models basically showed the same fitness scores against the inundation extent of hec ras 2d as indicated in section 2 4 concurrent occurrence of high κ and low f is quite possible κ shows conformity in the number and location of dry cells between the models not the conformity of their actual inundated extents still a κ value as high as one in cr strongly suggests that the low complexity models function very reasonably concerning the actual match of wet cells i e inundation obtaining a lower f value could be potentially misinterpreted it is likely for an uncalibrated low complexity model to show lower f values against a much more detailed hydrodynamic model especially when executed over a large area such as the cr nevertheless a relatively low fitness of inundated boundaries f values 0 5 in fig 9 cannot be undermined as the typical disagreement between the two models f values were found substantially higher when looked specifically into a3 or a4 portions of the test case this could also be supported by visually assessing the highlighted portions in cr fig 9 for example with respect to hec ras 2d low complexity models showed large differences along the main channel and its confluences with the tributaries a1 and a2 in fig 9 however such difference was found minimal in the lower order less meandering reaches in the upstream headwater catchments a3 and a4 in fig 9 a small scale yet more comprehensive comparison was deduced from the bwr test case focusing more on the models response to floodplain features such as bathymetry and levee hec ras 2d autoroute and hand were compared for flood extent using 10 100 and 500 year events and for four different terrain setups figs 10 12 the results suggest expansion of inundation extents when the return period increased from 10 year to 500 year for all the models however the percent change of extent between return periods was not identical when models were compared with one another for four terrain setups in hec ras 2d the average expansion of the flood extent was 25 and 11 from 10 year to 100 year and from 100 year to 500 year flood events respectively although autoroute is not a hydrodynamic model it closely mimics hec ras 2d in most parts of the study region autoroute showed an average expansion of flood extent by 20 between 10 year and 100 year and 10 between 100 year and 500 year event simulations compared to hec ras 2d a limitation in autoroute is the absence of any downstream boundary condition dam lock in bwr main channel accordingly difference in inundation extents between hec ras 2d and autoroute as observed in the first column of figs 10 12 might be due to autoroute s inability to capture the possible backwater effect during the higher magnitude events similar to autoroute representation of the wave propagation e g backwater effect is a limitation in hand moreover hand showed flooding in physically implausible locations which have similar elevation difference with respect to the nearest reach the main channel in this case as a result hand produced larger inundated area than autoroute when both were compared against hec ras 2d this is similar to what was observed in the case of cr test case for bwr hand showed an average expansion of flood extent by 31 between 10 year and 100 year events and 5 between 100 year and 500 year flood events among all the configurations regardless of terrain setup or flood event autoroute invariably showed better performance than hand in capturing the inundation extent of bwr in terms of κ and f 3 1 2 effect of terrain setups on inundation extent depending on the model effects of floodplain attributes e g levee and bathymetry on the simulated inundation extents can be noticeably different in the bwr test case hec ras 2d and autoroute showed reasonably good agreement irrespective of return periods even without the incorporation of channel bathymetry or levee e g f 0 71 0 75 incorporation of the levee ned levee setup could not mitigate hand s overestimating tendency as the relative elevation with respect to the nearest channel is a key determinant for hand the model essentially over laid the same over bank stage from the particular channel segment on both sides of the levee in reality spatial orientation of the levee acts as a confinement and thus controls the movement of flood wave which was relatively well captured by hec ras 2d and autoroute both autoroute and hand showed prominent overestimation of inundation extents relative to hec ras 2d throughout the entire length of the main channel once bathymetry was incorporated in the terrain more specifically hec ras 2d tended to retain more within bank water because of the deeper and wider channel in the ned bathymetry and ned bathymetry levee setups this phenomenon was vivid for 10 year and 100 year events figs 10 and 11 respectively accordingly the best model conformity in the ned levee setup i e highest κ and f does not necessarily mean that model simulated inundation extents were more accurate in this particular terrain setup considering ned bathymetry levee to be a relatively better realization of the floodplain compared to other terrain setups raises questions to why autoroute and hand are unable to leverage from this terrain setup and remains as an outstanding question needing further investigation looking into possible scopes of model re conceptualization regardless the ned bathymetry levee setup exemplified a crucial aspect regarding the effect of bathymetry in case of an extreme flood event e g 500 year fig 12 in that case flood water was found to have over topped the levee in the ned levee setup in all the models but hec ras 2d and autoroute did not allow over topping when bathymetry was included in the model configuration ned bathymetry levee this is a clear example of bathymetry being a controlling factor that determines the shape of flood inundation map except in hand here as well autoroute has relatively better capability than hand at least with current versions 3 2 comparison of flood depth inter comparison of simulated inundation depths as raster data layers was carried out only for the 100 year flood event in both cr and bwr test cases the common intersecting area of the inundation extents generated by two particular models was taken as the boundary within which flood depth comparison was carried out 3 2 1 inter comparison of models for inundation depth fig 13 demonstrates the comparison among hec ras 2d autoroute and hand for inundation depth in cr only for a 100 year flood event over the entire stream network of cr hec ras 2d produced 11 16 m md deeper floods than autoroute and hand which is in line with its overestimation of inundation extent fig 9 similarly both low complexity models had minimal difference 2 m in their respective simulated depths however hand produced a slightly deeper flood than autoroute as evident from md making the models behavior coherent with what was depicted in fig 9 for their flood extent simulation furthermore hand simulated depth had an rmsd of 9 m against hec ras 2d contrary to autoroute s 17 m this led to the notion that hand simulations were relatively more consistent with hec ras 2d at least in cr the meandering main channel a near outlet location and confluences a1 and a2 again appeared to be the hot spots where both autoroute and hand struggled but their performance to simulate flood depth is equivalent to hec ras 2d in the case of less meandering upstream headwater catchments a3 and a4 for the bwr test case inundation depth of a 100 year flood event for all terrain setups showed an average md of 0 8 m between hec ras 2d and autoroute with autoroute resulting in deeper inundation fig 14 hand produced even deeper inundation as its average md from hec ras 2d was about 4 m in general both autoroute and hand overestimated depth with respect to hec ras 2d which is opposite to what was detected from the cr test case analogous to the results shown for inundation extent section 3 1 1 bias in depth simulation was nearly 50 less in autoroute than that in hand in terms of their rmsd against hec ras 2d variability of depth along the main channel was found to be more consistent between hec ras 2d and autoroute in most parts of the river network on the other hand variability of depth simulated by hand was relatively more erratic hence may not be realistic in the 16 900 km2 380 km long cr test case the low complexity models generally showed an underestimating tendency to simulate inundation extent and depth while hand produced closer results to the hec ras 2d model the opposite was found in the 62 km2 15 km long bwr test case with autoroute being relatively accurate with respect to hec ras 2d here the scale is important for example there are specific locations with short reach segments within cr where the low complexity models behaved similarly as in the case of bwr hence the outcome from the bwr test case showing autoroute and hand overestimating inundation extent and depth is not an anomaly rather it is a very likely subset of possibilities that might have happened if a much larger domain along the black warrior river system was modeled in this study it could seem ambiguous why autoroute differs from hand even though both are based on manning s equation despite using manning s equation the procedure of generating flood maps is not similar in these models autoroute generates flood inundation map extent and depth vertically whereas hand does it laterally more specifically autoroute automatically generates cross sections calculates flood extent for user defined input streamflow values using iterative calculation of flow for every cross section follum et al 2017 the depth is incrementally increased from the lowest point in the reach until the calculated streamflow from manning s equation matches the input streamflow in the hand method first a synthetic stage discharge rating curve is generated for each nhdplus reach using manning s equation for a user defined input streamflow a corresponding depth value is extracted from such a rating curve liu et al 2016 all cells on the landscape with a hand value smaller than this depth will be considered as inundated hence this method does not require cross sections and it also does not have the direct incorporation of streamflow as in autoroute in this way use of manning s equation in hand does not produce similar results as in the autoroute model 3 2 2 effect of terrain setups on inundation depth similar to the multi model multi terrain assessment of inundation extent section 3 1 2 simulated flood depth in the bwr test case was also evaluated under four different terrain setups when the models were configured with the simplest terrain setups ned and ned levee autoroute showed the least bias for flood depth simulation with respect to hec ras 2d relevant rmsd values for a 100 year event fig 14 once bathymetry was incorporated autoroute showed signs of discrepancy as the rmsd value relative to hec ras 2d increased by more than 1 m exactly similar phenomenon was observed in the case of hand when it was compared with hec ras 2d middle column of fig 14 what is more interesting here is the remarkable similarity between autoroute and hand pertaining to their behavior in depth simulation in certain segments of the main channel contrary to their general depth overestimating tendency relative to hec ras 2d both autoroute and hand distinctly underestimated flood inundation depth in the middle and near outlet locations in the bathymetry informed terrain setups even when comparing hand and autoroute ned bathymetry levee showed the highest rmsd 7 64 m out of all terrain setups being modeled here overall this analysis resonates the insensitivity of these low complexity flood models to cope with hydrodynamics especially in meandering portions of the channel middle section the deeper portions in the near outlet location with a navigational dam lock and nearby levee not to mention their inability to capture back water effects however in such cases autoroute seemed to be better equipped than hand similar to the findings highlighted in section 3 1 2 for simulation of inundation extent 3 3 evaluation of model performance with fema reference estimates fig 15 compares model simulated inundation extent and depth for a 100 year flood event with the corresponding fema estimates this assessment was kept limited only on bwr test case as it has nearly all real life examples of floodplain features that often make flood models under perform the fema flood map i e inundation extent was obtained via flood map service center https msc fema gov portal which is the official public source for sharing flood hazard information in terms of flood maps and other related products the technical information from fema coordinated needs management strategy fema cnms platform as well as fema s r4 regional service center assured that channel bathymetry was not considered for developing the 100 year flood hazard map in bwr another considerable factor was that fema estimates on flood extent and depth were available only for the downstream portion of bwr encompassing the levee hence comparing the models with fema estimates seemed justified only for the ned levee terrain setup clearly hec ras 2d had the most conformity with fema estimates for flood extent fig 15 the κ and f scores were 0 94 and 0 74 respectively for the hec ras 2d versus fema case these scores were 0 93 and 0 69 when the flood extent generated by autoroute was compared with the fema flood map comparison of the hand and fema flood extents resulted in κ and f equal to 0 88 and 0 53 respectively in case of flood depths hec ras 2d quite expectedly produced the lowest rmsd 2 23 m while autoroute and hand had an rmsd of 3 33 m and 5 36 m respectively the average of differences md for fema flood depth against hec ras 2d autoroute and hand were respectively captured as 1 55 0 37 and 1 27 m the md values show that autoroute and fema are relatively similar whereas hand and hec ras 2d underestimate the flood depth derived by fema autoroute and fema both use similar methods manning equation which can explain similarity of md values since hec ras 2d applies the unsteady hydrodynamic 2d diffusion wave equation it might produce lower depth compared to the steady state approach this is due to the fact that the unsteady state equation factors in additional physically based terms may lower the simulated water stages compared to ones estimated by steady state approach being applied in fema and autoroute hand model shows overestimation of depth at upstream and abruptly underestimation of depth when a levee exists fig 15 which resulted in overall underestimation of depth with this model compared to the fema model 4 conclusion this paper inaugurates a new line of research to compare the sensitivity and suitability of new generation low complexity flood models with increasing flood hazards across the world it has been a burning question whether it is sustainable to employ computationally intensive yet supposedly better hydrodynamic models in large scale hyper resolution operational flood simulation against such concern a few models were developed with the fast computing capability due to simplified input requirements and process representations yet reasonably good in terms of prediction accuracy this paper compares two such genres of recently developed inundation models a hydrodynamic model i e hec ras 2d and two low complexity models i e autoroute and hand to the best of authors knowledge this is also the first flood inundation assessment using united states national water model nwm streamflow data the assessment presented in this study is based upon 39 model configurations involving three models three flood events four terrain setups and two test beds models were compared for two hydrologically different and geographically distant test cases in the united states including the 16 900 km2 cedar river cr watershed in state of iowa and a 62 km2 domain along the black warrior river bwr in state of alabama model comparison in cr was conducted using only one terrain setup i e national elevation dataset ned and a 100 year flood event with a view to focus on issues such as meandering channel segments and confluences where flood models usually struggle a much more detailed analysis was conducted over the bwr test case including moderate to extreme flood events at 10 100 and 500 year return periods and various terrain setups with levee and or bathymetry the streamflow time series from the pre operational offline repository of the nwm were used and processed to define inflow boundary conditions of the flood events for all nhdplus reaches in the test cases results showed hec ras 2d autoroute and hand can be ranked according to their model complexity and computational capability hec ras 2d is the most and hand is the least complex model the hand model results were relatively closer to hec ras 2d compared to the autoroute model for depth and flood extent in the cr study domain however in the relatively less meandering upstream headwater rivers both autoroute and hand behaved the same as hec ras 2d this can be attributed to the nature of low complexity models their inherent capabilities and limitation which might perform well in simple landscape results also showed that in complex conditions such as meandering main channels and confluences low complexity models struggle to generate results that are comparable to the hec ras 2d model in the bwr test case autoroute generally outperformed hand when compared to the hec ras 2d model when hydraulic controls such as dams and levee were incorporated one should note that both low complexity models demonstrated identical spatial variation of flood extents despite the difference between magnitudes of flood extent or flood depth considering model performance with different terrain setups hec ras 2d and autoroute models showed similar results for the ned levee terrain setup with hand showing some inconsistency in capturing the effect of any abrupt geophysical variation e g enforced by the levee contrarily terrain setups with bathymetry e g the ned bathymetry levee terrain setup showed prominent discrepancy between the low complexity models in comparison with the hydrodynamic model this behavior is speculated to be driven by assimilation of different river bed slope at each nhdplus reach i e channels with bathymetry versus channels having a flat bed as given by ned and thus resultant change in the vertical distance between a given cell on the floodplain and the nearest channel cell that it drains into in general the low complexity models should be set up with caution in flat and densely urbanized zones e g in the downstream regions of the bwr study domain since they do not capture the backwater effects created by existing hydraulic structures further study in different climate and land use conditions would be helpful to validate these findings despite the generally favorable results obtained in this study it is up to the users discretion whether a low complexity flood inundation mapping tool should be preferred or complex hydrodynamic models as a near future application low complexity models can provide a rapid first order estimate of flood inundation to prioritize evacuation areas during severe flood events furthermore the combination of both types of modeling approaches can be considered for instance the low complexity models can be used for flood mapping at the regional scale with a nested high fidelity model at the local scale where anthropogenic effects and topographic conditions need to be considered results of this study showed that low complexity tools can have nearly equal applicability while retaining the value of complex hydrodynamic models this notion is based upon a trade off between highest possible accuracy and computational efficiency which is permissible for operational needs moreover to provide operational hydrologic support in geographic areas where hydrologic data is sparse and because the assessments provided are time critical alternative approaches can be employed to develop terrain and bathymetry data for instance idealized power law hydraulic geometries which are derived based on bank full hydraulics of the channel can be established given measured basic hydraulics i e discharge water surface width average depth and average velocity and applied to generate asymptotic forms of the channel bed geometry application and deployment of this methodology in the low complexity models can be considered as a far future work acknowledgments this work was

7574,quantifying precipitation p partition into evapotranspiration e and runoff q is of great importance for global and regional water availability assessment budyko framework serves as a powerful

hydroclimatic changes on water availability is critical for regional water resource management and planning on the catchment scale water availability is substantially determined by the partitioning of precipitation p into evapotranspiration e and runoff q however dominated by numerous factors chiefly consisting of natural e g climatic seasonality topography and anthropogenic factors e g agricultural development it is difficult to identify the partitioning process of p berghuijs et al 2014 greve et al 2015 there are two categories of approaches to assess the water partitioning under changing environments approaches based on detailed hydrologic models and simple conceptual model based on the budyko hypothesis guo et al 2015 with deterministic physical mechanisms approaches based on detailed hydrologic models can accurately describe the hydrological processes yet the reliability of the simulation is always limited due to the model structures and parameter uncertainties in practice determining the impacts of climate change on board scale water availability require long term estimation teng et al 2012 singh and kumar 2015 budyko framework prescribing the dependence of long term mean annual actual e on water supply p and demand potential evaporation e0 serves as a simple but effective tool to make transparent estimates of changes in water availability as well as to investigate the interactions between climate forcing and land surface characteristics on water and energy cycles roderick and farquhar 2011 williams et al 2012 li et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 greve et al 2015 fang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the original budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 is that natural watersheds follow the budyko curve which is entirely deterministic and non parametric in this context some non parametric budyko equations e g schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 budyko 1958 pike 1964 were developed however it should be acknowledged that variations around the curve can alter depending on land surface characteristics furthermore many subsequently derived formulations of the budyko curve are parametric e g mezentsev 1955 fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 porporato et al 2004 wang and tang 2014 compared with non parametric budyko equations single parameter budyko type equations are more flexible to adapt to complicated watershed characteristics xiong and guo 2012 playing the similar roles in controlling how much of the available water will be evaporated given the available energy the empirical dimensionless parameters of different budyko type equations determine the shape of the budyko curve and reflect the influences of basin characteristics xu et al 2013 consequently a simple estimating model with precise characterization of the empirical dimensionless parameters will be a good basis for the budyko framework application and water availability assessment previous studies have documented that single parameter in budyko type equations can be reflected by various climate and catchment characteristics such as climatic seasonality characteristics milly 1994 potter et al 2005 williams et al 2012 chen et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2014 soil properties porporato et al 2004 donohue et al 2012 vegetation zhang et al 2001 donohue et al 2007 yang et al 2009 gentine et al 2012 li et al 2013 wang and tang 2014 groundwater istanbulluoglu et al 2012 topographic controls shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 and relative area of ecological restoration liang et al 2015 moreover numerous models e g multiple stepwise regression neural network techniques have been proposed to estimate the parameters of budyko type equations for specific conditions e g yang et al 2007 2009 donohue et al 2012 shao et al 2012 li et al 2013 xu et al 2013 unfortunately those models are only based on climatic and catchment characteristics the impact of changing anthropogenic factors on the partitioning of p into e and q reflecting by the single parameter in budyko type equation has not been concerned in previous studies in fact with the developing of global modernization human activities e g cultivation irrigation afforestation deforestation and urban construction have already altered land use cover and evapotranspiration capacity these activities further have been revealed to have increased or enhanced impacts on instream flow changes in recent years by extensive literatures e g brown et al 2005 scanlon et al 2007 roderick and farquhar 2011 liu et al 2017 currently budyko hypothesis is usually used to quantify the impact of climate and humans on mean annual streamflow by the decomposition method or elasticity method e g wang and hejazi 2011 chen et al 2013 tan and gan 2015 liang et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 for example wang and hejazi 2011 used a decomposition method based on the budyko hypothesis to quantify the climate and direct human impact on mean annual streamflow mas for 413 watersheds in the contiguous united states they found that direct human impact decreased mean annual streamflow in some watersheds with urban areas and extensively irrigated agriculture globally the irrigation area occupies 20 of the arable land area and sustains about 40 of the food production furthermore the irrigation water diversion and consumption takes up respectively about 70 and 90 of the total human water diversion and consumption döll and siebert 2002 wisser et al 2008 the wide range activities of water diversion from rivers reservoirs and underground aquifers to the irrigation districts significantly influenced the natural hydrological cycle in some areas the impact of irrigation is on the same order of magnitude as the impact of climate change this is especially true in china a vast agricultural country in the world according to the statistics the cultivated land accounts for about 12 5 of china s total land and the irrigated land accounts for about 40 of china s total arable land and produces 75 of china s total food grain jin and young 2001 thus agricultural activities especially cultivation and irrigation which not only are vital for global food security but also constitute land use changes known to have strong effects on local hydrological and energy cycles de vrese et al 2016 hence the hydrologic impact of changes in agricultural activities as well as changes in climatic seasonality characteristics and catchment characteristics should be also incorporated into the framework by changing the value of budyko type equations parameters besides from the perspective of modelling precision inclusion of more influencing factors can eliminate the problem of biased sampling and reduce model uncertainty shao et al 2012 therefore in this work we will highlight changes in those agricultural activities to emphasize the point that changes in the specific basin parameter may be subtle not linearity related to the climatic seasonality characteristics and catchment characteristics in practice models like the least squares method li et al 2013 the multiple stepwise regression model zhang et al 2004 yang et al 2009 and the neural network model xu et al 2013 are often developed to estimate the budyko type equation parameter by taking the influence factors as independent inputs however the water partitioning process is resulted from the hybrids of various influence factors milly 1994 yokoo et al 2008 gentine et al 2012 shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 meanwhile the influencing factors i e climatic seasonality characteristics catchment characteristics and agricultural activities have been widely recognized to be interconnected dietrich and perron 2006 which tends to reduce the range and variability of model response gentine et al 2012 liang et al 2015 therefore investigation of the interactions between the influencing factors on the catchment specific model parameter under a changing climate should urgently emerge for many disciplines such as hydrology meteorology and ecology a nonparametric method the multivariate adaptive regression spline mars model proposed by friedman 1991 is a powerful tool to identify important factors and their interactions by determining statistically significant factors recently shao et al 2012 successfully applied the mars model to estimate the budyko parameter based on various climatic and catchment characteristics using 241 australian catchments where all the catchments have relatively small drainage areas without remarkable agricultural activities conversely china is a vast agricultural country with a plenty variety of catchments with cultivated and irrigated lands this unique condition has caused the complicated and interconnected relationship in the water energy controls of catchments however up to now deterministic estimation of budyko equation parameter based on various controls especially the agricultural activities and investigation of the interactions between influencing factors i e climate soil topography vegetation properties and agricultural activities across china are scarce given that agricultural activities can also reflect the water partitioning across china the ability of mars model in determining statistically significant factors and their interactions and the availability of selected 96 catchments data sets in this study the relationship between the basin specific budyko curves and their influencing factors the correlations between the influencing factors are firstly detected by pearson correlation analysis approach the significant factors and their interactions is investigated by mars model using data sets that span a wide range of climate regimes and spatial scales more specifically the influencing magnitudes of the interactions on the budyko parameter estimation in different catchments and the performances of mars model compared to the parametric model multiple stepwise regression model taken the influencing factors as independent inputs are also assessed 2 methodology 2 1 budyko type equation the dynamic water balance equation of a natural watersheds is 1 d dt s t p t e t q t where s t is the total stored water of the watershed p t e t and q t are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff respectively for a watershed with irrigation if the drainage area is large enough and there is no exchange between watersheds the irrigation i at time t can be taken as the water demand from the runoff at time t 1 accordingly the irrigation i at time t can be taken as the water supply as well as p at time t the dynamic water balance of a catchment with agricultural activities terms as 2 d dt s t d dt i t p t e t q t over a time interval t eq 2 can be obtained as 3 s t s 0 i t i 0 t p e q if t is long enough e g decades the storage and water utilization by irrigation terms which are all from the p of the catchment can be neglected and eq 3 becomes 4 0 p e q that is at the multi year scale the water utilization by agricultural activities in a catchment would not affect the water balance therefore budyko type equations can also be used to assess the impacts of anthropogenic modifications on instream flow changes several mathematical equations have been developed to represent the budyko framework and here the choudhury equation choudhury 1999 is used 5 e p e 0 p 1 e 0 p n 1 n where n is a catchment specific parameter which determines the evapotranspiration ratio e p for given e 0 p and modifies the partitioning of p between e and q daily e0 is calculated based on the penman equation that includes wind

adaptive regression splines mars is a form of regression analysis introduced by friedman 1991 it is a non parametric regression technique and can be seen as an extension of traditional linear regression models that automatically models nonlinearities and interactions between variables the objective of non parametric regression is to estimate the regression function f given by 7 n f x ε f x 1 x k ε where f is a function to be specified and x x 1 x k is the collection of potential variables affecting the budyko parameter n of eq 5 mars builds models of the form 8 f x j 1 j a j b j x where f x is the spline approximation of the function of interest f x a j is the coefficient of jth basis function b j x which can be considered weight that represents the importance of the jth variable each basis function b j x is consisted by 1 a constant there is only one such term called the intercept note that this constant represents the possible intercepts in other basis functions 2 a hinge function has the form of max 0 x knot or max 0 knot x mars automatically selects variable x and values of those variables for knots of the hinge functions 3 a product of two or more hinge functions in mathematics the basis functions of mars model 8 are in the form of 9 b j x i 1 k j u ij x v i j t ij where u ij 1 or u ij 1 z is a truncated function of z z if z 0 z 0 if z 0 x v i j represents a variable in x x 1 x k i e v i j 1 k which will be determined in mars tij give the corresponding knot points at which the basis functions change and kj is the number of interacting variables in the basis function the aim of mars is not only to adjust the coefficient values to best fit the data but also to derive a good set of basis functions based on the data the best model is determined by the generalized cross validation criterion gcv which is an alternative to having both training data sets and overfit checking data sets for model validation is given by 10 gcv λ i 1 n y i f λ x i 2 1 m λ n 2 where f λ is the estimate based on λ basis functions and m λ is a complexity cost function mars builds a model in two phases the forward and the backward pass the forward pass usually builds an overfit model the terms keep added until the maximum gcv value is reached that is any more term will reduce the gcv value the model after the forward selection is called the full model backward selection tends to eliminate the less important terms which reduce the gcv values the backward step starts from the full model and a term which is least important that is the gcv value will increase mostly without this term is then removed the terms keep removed until the maximum gcv value is reached the model after the backward selection is called the final model in this paper only the first order interaction is considered i e we limit the mars model to pairwise interactions in order that it is able to manifest the hydrological interpretations for the model components 2 4 measures of performance assessment performance of the mars model for estimating n is evaluated by comparing estimated n against n values calculated by eq 5 using the observations two statistics namely the correlation coefficient r and mean absolute errors mae are used to evaluate the performance of mars model and are defined in the form as 11 r i 1 m o i o s i s i 1 m o i o 2 0 5 i 1 m s i s 2 0 5 12 mae i 1 m s i o i m with o i 1 m o i m and s i 1 m s i m are the average of the observed variable o i and the average of the simulated variable s i i 1 2 m respectively where m is the number of space

detailed information for discharge control gauges from 96 catchments selected based on the data availability and quality including the longitude latitude and the drainage area that each gauge controlled are shown in table 2 to ensure each catchment has at least 10 complete years of unimpaired streamflow data we collected monthly streamflow data from most of the 96 discharge control gauges

for less than 1 of the total data and were processed using the 5 year moving average method daily meteorological data such as precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed and relative humidity were collected from 412 stations can be seen in fig 1 covering the same period as the observed streamflow data the meteorological data was obtained from the climatic data center national

areas was interpolated from the weather stations data 2 potential evaporation was estimated in each grid and 3 the catchment average values were calculated air temperature was interpolated using an inverse distance weighted technique that considers the effect of elevation other variables were interpolated using an inverse distance weighted technique for each of the catchments information about

e p versus dryness index e0 p for 96 catchments of different climatic conditions are plotted in fig 2 b it is evident that for certain dryness index e would increase with larger parameter n taking the middle reach of yellow river basin controlled by longmen gauge and nianchu river catchment controlled by jiangzi gauge as a paired example although the similar climatic conditions of the middle yellow river basin with e0 p 2 562 and the nianchu river catchment with e0 p 2 597 the evapotranspiration ratios e p are quite different with 0 896 and 0 156 respectively for the different parameters n values 1 690 and 0 301 fig 2 a and b also demonstrate that most n values of catchments range from 0 5 to 2 5 accounting 82 3 of all catchments 4 2 spatial distribution of influencing factors the distributions of catchment characteristics i e m rr and pawc are shown in fig 3 the pearl river basin southern catchments of china are covered by high vegetation cover while respectively low m values are located in the upper and middle reaches of yellow river basin hei river basin and brahmaputra river basin fig 3 a rr represents the topographic controls on parameter n of the catchment which ranges from 0 001 to 0 026 fig 3 b the most cliffy catchments are located in the tibetan plateau and yunnan guizhou plateau fig 3 c illustrates that high pawc values are distributed in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river basin pearl river basin as for the climatic seasonality characteristics the distributions are presented in fig 4 high asd and ci values are located on the southern catchments fig 4 a and b while high cv and si values are distributed on the northern catchments including songhua river basin liao river basin hai river basin northern yellow river basin and yalungzangbo river basin fig 4 c and d fig 4 e replays that low pdsi values are distributed on the yellow huai hai region most sim values are smaller than 3 while high sim values are located on the hei river basin and the middle region of yellow river fig 4 f fig 4 g depicts that lower pfe values are distributed on the hei river basin the source regions of yellow river and yangtze river the lancang river basin fig 5 demonstrates the spatial distributions of agricultural activities i e ia and ca density it can be concluded that ia and ca are subject to huge spatial heterogeneity within 96 catchments across china we found that the higher ia and ca ones are distributed on the hai river basin huai river basin xin an river basin ou river basin pearl river basin and the lower reaches of yellow river basin yangtze river basin overall the spatial variabilities in climate catchment characteristics and agricultural activities further confirms the heterogeneities in budyko curves between multiple catchments this may not be surprising as evapotranspiration is a very complex random processes influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors 4 3 correlation of budyko parameter and the influencing factors before employing the mars model to estimate the budyko parameter n the correlations between the budyko parameter n and influencing factors are investigated by pearson correlation analysis see table 3 it can be seen that except cv and pfe have insignificant correlation with budyko parameter n spatially change other factors especially soil properties i e pawc climatic seasonality characteristics i e asd ci si and pdsi and agricultural activities i e ia and ca have close relationships the absolute correlation coefficients over 0 3 with budyko parameter n spatially change furthermore the multiple stepwise regression msr model a widely used method to identify the dominant variables associated with the budyko parameter zhang et al 2004 yang et al 2009 was employed to possibly explain the underlying mechanisms of n spatially change by considering the budyko parameter n spatially series as a dependent variable and 12 influencing factors as independent variables a total of five out of 12 explanatory variables were selected in the final msr model for the 96 typical catchments the final model is as follows 13 n 2 100 ci 0 157 sim 0 284 pdsi 1 203 si 45 4 rr 1 299 this model explains 42 6 of observed variance with r of 0 653 mae of 5 47 and with ci explaining 18 0 sim 6 8 pdsi 7 7 si 5 2 and rr 4 9 of variance although the msr model eq 13 explains nearly half of the variance of the budyko parameter n the predictive capacity of n is weak particularly at the high end noticeably although some factors are insignificant variables for budyko parameter n spatially change the interactions between the influencing factors can also have potential influence on the catchment specific model parameter estimation 4 4 correlation between influencing factors the correlation between influencing factors were also examined by pearson correlation analysis and the results are given in table 4 except rr ci and pdsi all the other factors are significantly correlated with m most of these correlations are positive while climatic seasonality characteristics i e cv si and sim have negative correlation with m only ci has significant negative correlation with rr which represents that steep slopes tend to generate more concentrated rainfall the correlations of pawc with most factors are significant and positive only the correlations of cv and si with pawc are negative overall most of the correlations of climatic seasonality characteristics with catchment characteristics and agricultural activities factors are significant this phenomenon further confirms that these influencing factors are interconnected and potentially tend to affect the water partitioning process 4 5 interactions between variables identified by mars instead of making a subjective selection we kept all the 12 influencing factors and let the mars model determine the statistically significant ones 22 basis functions were initially selected as the full model after the forward selection when the relative change of mean square errors reaches to 0 001 but only 14 basis functions remained after the backward selection table 5 lists the final 14 basis functions given by their coefficients and knot points of the selected variables which are given by nonzero values the final model with mse 0 119 and gcv 0 213 the final 14 basis functions can be grouped into 8 sets of functional forms representing constant functions for single variable and functions for the interaction between variables detailed explanations are given below 1 the constant factor f x 1 721 described as the first term gives the baseline value of the budyko parameter n 2 the effect described by terms 2 and 3 is asd the spline function is given as 14 f asd 0 0372 asd 46 78 0 0061 asd 46 78 1 721 and is plotted together with observed values in fig 6 a it can be seen from fig 6 a that when asd 46 78 mm fasd 0 0372 46 78 asd mostly occurs in the northwestern arid catchments seen in fig 4 a this means higher asd across the northwestern arid region would have a higher evapotranspiration ratio this phenomenon illustrates that the rainfall is preferred to evaporate in the arid catchments in the semi humid and humid regions with larger asd 46 78 mm the rainfall will generate runoff first especially for some low lying and landlocked areas the intense rain cannot be quickly released to cause the excessive saturation of farmland water and soil moisture likely resulting in more geological disasters 3 the effect depicted by terms 4 and 5 is m and is given in fig 6 b the spline function is given as 15 f m 0 030 m 34 56 0 027 m 34 56 1 721 fig 6 b shows that when m 34 56 the catchments locating in the pearl river basin southern of china fig 3 a will have small budyko parameter value and tend to generate more runoff this result means that within a certain range vegetation has the effect of weakening peak in flood process fig 3 a reveals that the catchments with less than 34 56 vegetation cover are located in the upper and middle reaches of yellow river basin hei river basin and brahmaputra river basin with the dryness index greater than 2 0 and the budyko parameter value smaller than 1 0 4 the effect depicted by terms 6 and 7 is si and is given in fig 6 c the spline function is given as 16 f si 3 743 si 0 797 1 518 si 0 797 1 721 fig 6 c demonstrates that the threshold value is 0 797 here in the equation the budyko parameter will increase when si is less than 0 797 only on the catchments of the southeastern china which regions are covered by relatively low si values 0 797 would have increasing evapotranspiration ratios along with the increasing si fig 4 d while the northern catchments with relatively large si are favorable for runoff generation and this leads to lower evapotranspiration ratios si represents the uneven distribution index of monthly rainfall in annual rainfall see table 1 fig 6 c confirms that more decentralized rainfall can result more runoff generation we now investigate the interaction terms recognized by the mars model 5 the first interaction is between ca and asd by terms 8 and 9 the spline function is given as f ca asd 0 0013 ca 21 97 asd 46 78 17 0 0002 ca 21 97 asd 46 78 1 721 and is depicted in fig 7 a this interaction term suggests that crop area with higher asd tend to have higher evapotranspiration ratio especially when the ca is relatively small the correlation of ca and asd is 0 565 table 4 it also can be seen from figs 4 a and 5 d that the ca density will increase with large asd by jointly viewing figs 4 a and 7 a we can conclude that although the effect of higher asd 46 78 mm locating in the southeastern humid region is to reduce the budyko parameter value fig 6 a for catchments with crops planting this effect is undermined theoretically this reduction should be enhanced when the ca increases however the rising evapotranspiration ratio by the higher asd and smaller ca is found in fig 7 a this bias in the data set is a likely cause of the inconsistent relationship for the catchments with high asd and low ca 6 the second interaction is between pdsi and si by term 10 the spline function is given as 18 f pdsi si 0 918 pdsi 0 740 si 0 797 1 721 and is depicted in fig 7 b it can be seen that the interaction between pdsi and si is to reduce the budyko parameter n when the pdsi is less than 0 740 and the si is higher than 0 797 fig 4 d e and b suggest that catchments in the hai river basin the liao river basin and the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river basin with lower pdsi but greater si would have a low budyko parameter n and a small evapotranspiration ratio this result confirms that small pdsi i e large dryness index tends to enhance the budyko parameter reduction by si 7 the third interaction is between si and cv by terms 11 and 12 the spline function is given as f si cv 5 43 si 0 797 cv 0 140 19 3 74 si 0 797 cv 0 230 1 721 and is depicted in fig 7 c it can be seen that the budyko parameter n value is small when the si is less than 0 797 and the cv is less than 0 14 or when the si is larger than 0 797 and the cv is higher than 0 23 this interaction term suggests that catchments with relatively large si and cv or catchments with small si and cv are favorable for runoff generation and therefore have lower evapotranspiration ratio fig 4 c d and c suggest that catchments in the hai river basin the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river basin with high si and cv values or catchments in the lower reach of yangtze river basin and southeastern catchments have low si and cv values would have a lower budyko parameter n and generate more runoff the fourth interaction is between ia and m by terms 13 and 14 the spline function is given as f ia m 0 0079 ia 4 34 m 34 56 20 0 0037 ia 4 34 m 34 56 1 721 and is depicted in fig 7 d it can be seen that the budyko parameter n value is higher when the ia is lower than 4 34 and m is lower than 34 56 or when the ia is higher than 4 34 and m is lower than 34 56 this interaction term suggests that catchments with low ia 4 34 and m 34 56 tend to generate less runoff and therefore have higher evapotranspiration ratio by jointly viewing figs 6 b and 7 d we can conclude that low m enhances the rising effect on evapotranspiration ratio by the ia 4 6 assessment of mars model s performance fig 8 compares the calculated budyko parameter n values by eq 5 using the observations and estimated ones by the mars model for all the 96 catchments good agreement can be found with the correlation coefficient r is 0 817 and the mean absolute error mae is 4 09 the mars model performs better than the msr model in term of budyko parameter n with higher explained variance 66 7 relative to 42 6 and lower mae 4 09 relative to 5 47 the encouraging result provides confidence in the mars model to examine the interactions between climatic seasonality catchment characteristics and anthropogenic factors to variations in the hydrological regime 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of interactions between variables on budyko parameter estimating in our study pearson correlation shows that not only the soil properties i e pawc and climatic seasonality characteristics i e asd ci si and pdsi but also agricultural activities factors i e ia and ca have close relationship with budyko parameter n spatially change seen in table 3 most of the correlations between climatic seasonality characteristics and catchment characteristics agricultural activities are significant seen in table 4 these results show that the influencing factors are interconnected which potentially tend to affect the water partitioning process in addition ci sim pdsi rr and si were selected as the significant variables by the msr model eq 13 these influencing factors have also been proved to be useful for measuring climate changes and interventions in alteration of the water partitioning williams et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2014 monjo and marin vide 2016 however estimating the budyko parameter by the influencing factors as independent inputs can lead to incorrect conclusions on the relationship between budyko parameter n and its influencing factors milly 1994 yokoo et al 2008 gentine et al 2012 shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 in this context the mars model was employed to identify important factors with consideration of their interactions on budyko curves in the mars model process for our 96 collected catchments across china there are three significant factors and different directions of linear regressions on the budyko parameter including asd m and si respectively table 5 and fig 6 in the semi humid and humid regions with larger asd rain is preferred to generate runoff first especially for some low lying and landlocked areas the intense rain cannot be quickly released to cause the excessive saturation of farmland water and soil moisture likely resulting in more geological disasters within a certain range vegetation has the effect of weakening the runoff extremum si representing the uneven distribution index of monthly rainfall in annual rainfall confirms that more decentralized rainfall can result more runoff generation using 241 australian catchments shao et al 2012 found pfe is a significant term affecting the mean annual e and the functional relationship of e with pfe stated that closer phase between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can result in less streamflow however the seasonality effect on mean annual evapotranspiration cannot be adequately represented by phase difference between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration alone e g pfe hickel and zhang 2006 yokoo et al 2008 in our study asd m and si are identified as three statistically significant factors affecting the budyko parameter in 96 selected catchments across china noted that asd and si also are climatic seasonality characteristics these different results of these two studies maybe resulted from the climate differences in different regions and the influencing factors considered while the mars model also selected interactions affecting the budyko curves as follows 1 ca and asd 2 pdsi and si 3 si and cv 4 ia and m seen in fig 7 overall the ca can undermine the reducing effect of asd on the budyko parameter drought and uneven distribution of annual rainfall enhance the reduction of budyko parameter by si lower m enhance the rising effect on evapotranspiration ratio by the ia the interactions between climatic seasonality characteristics i e pdsi and si si and cv are very important and very subtle our simulations showed that the effects of climatic seasonality characteristics on water balance cannot be handled by means of total precipitation alone as in many conceptual budyko type models the role of climatic seasonality characteristics and their interactions on budyko parameter have been shown to be important in determining long term mean water balance these results confirm previous observations and model predictions of the critical role played by the frequency of rainfall events and seasonal variability of climate e g yokoo et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 in our study taking all 12 factors consisting of natural and anthropogenic factors into the mars model 7 factors are selected in the final model including asd si ia m cv pdsi and ca the budyko s n values estimated by the mars model reproduce the calculated ones by the observation well for the selected 96 catchments with r 0 817 mae 4 09 alternatively we also assess the performance of mars model in term of evapotranspiration with estimated parameter n the choudhury s equation reproduced mean annual e well for the 96 catchments with r of 0 917 and mae of 13 5 mm without considering the agricultural activities 4 factors are selected in the final model including m asd si and pdsi two pairs of interactions were identified by the mars 1 pdsi and si 2 asd and m while this mars model performs less well on the e calculation with r is 0 751 and mae is 38 4 mm five factors pfe asd cv rr and m were selected in the final mars model by shao et al 2012 using 241 australian catchments the performance of mars model in term of e was assessed with r of 0 911 and mae of 43 mm they revealed that the interaction between asd and cv can reduce the value of the budyko parameter the interaction between asd and rr can also lead to a smaller budyko parameter while the interaction between rr and m will lead to an increase in the budyko parameter mars model can reproduce e in 241 australian catchments better than 96 chinese catchments since the agricultural conditions affect water balance and cannot be ignored across china 5 2 agricultural activities factors effect on regional water availability assessment with the agricultural activities the mars model reproduces mean annual e well for the 96 catchments with the r is 0 917 and the mae is 13 5 mm without the agricultural activities the mars model performs the calculated e by the observation with the r is 0 751 and the mae is 38 4 mm it can be seen that agricultural activities have much effect on regional water availability assessment in particular the first interaction identified by the mars model affecting the budyko parameters is the cultivated land area and the average storm depth fig 7 a obviously cultivation can be affected by climate change due to the ongoing intensifications of regional hydrological cycles with the alterations of precipitation runoff infiltration groundwater flow evapotranspiration and soil moisture in many parts of the world during past century alan et al 2003 huntiugton 2006 wang et al 2017 yokoo et al 2008 explored the effects of seasonal variability of climatic inputs on mean annual and monthly water balances and the roles of climate soil properties and topography in modulating these impacts and found that the effects of seasonality are most important when the seasonal variabilities of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are out of phase and in arid climates in our study the ca was found to undermine the reducing effect of asd on the budyko parameter this general conclusion confirms and extends the results of the previous work done by yokoo et al 2008 shao et al 2012 and liang et al 2015 well known that the anthropogenic factors such as harvesting clearing and fertilization have been found to change both the vegetation and the evapotranspiration capacity ma et al 2008 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 li et al 2013 further affect the regional water availability and hydrological cycle moreover anthropogenic interventions tend to have increasing or enhancing influence on hydrological cycle because the increasing population expanding cultivation irrigation afforestation and enhancing deforestation scanlon et al 2007 roderick and farquhar 2011 liu et al 2017 de vrese et al 2016 confirmed that irrigation has a direct effect on regional atmospheric circulations and associated precipitation patterns such as the south and east asian monsoon cultivation and irrigation are not only affected by changing climate conditions and altering land cover use but in turn have a substantial effect on them our findings here enhance that changes in parameter n could be captured by interaction between the vegetation and effective irrigated area in the selected 96 catchments across china which have not been quantified assessing before land cover use for example vegetation cover is also an important factor in budyko parameter n estimation for it can directly influence rainfall redistribution e g vegetation coverage controls water interception and roots control infiltration uptake recharge and runoff donohue et al 2007 2010 gentine et al 2012 xu et al 2013 vegetation cover cannot be simply attributed to catchment characteristics or human activities which would overestimate the impact of local human activities on changes in q for that the vegetation information reflects the integrated landscape and climatic features donohue et al 2007 recent years many studies have investigated the role of vegetation in the budyko framework e g yang et al 2008 2009 indicated that the leaf area index have a high correlation with the budyko parameter they further parameterized the parameter using the variable ndvi and found that it is quite difficult to generalize the vegetation impact on the parameter donohue et al 2007 2010 declared that models considering the vegetation information can improve the performance of the budyko curve shao et al 2012 estimated the budyko parameter and observed large impact of forest coverage on budyko parameter li et al 2013 developed a simple parameterization for budyko parameter based solely on remotely sensed vegetation information xu et al 2013 indicated that the variance explained by ndvi seems low 11 and much lower than the result from li et al 2013 they evolved that this phenomenon is resulted from the cross correlations of ndvi with other factors wang and tang 2014 identified vegetation and rainfall are the dominant controlling factors on budyko parameter based on the approximately linearized relationship between the budyko parameter and vegetation cover greve et al 2014 assessed the trend in wetting and drying over land across the globe and singh and kumar 2015 quantified the vulnerability of water availability in india due to climate change subsequently liang et al 2015 reveals that changes in budyko parameter n could be captured by the relative area of the ecological restoration measures in the 14 catchments in china s loess plateau compared to the previous studies our results emphasize the importance of agricultural activities i e ca and ia in regulating ecohydrologic processes the results could provide a new idea to assess the budyko type equations parameters and facilitate a wider application of the budyko framework in investigating the interactions between the climate vegetation hydrologic cycle and agricultural activities 5 3 uncertainty of the interactions between influencing factors in this paper we considered 12 influencing factors for the collected 96 catchments across china although inclusion of more climatic factors and catchment characteristics can eliminate the problem of biased sampling and reduce model uncertainty shao et al 2012 only the first order interaction i e pairwise interactions identified by mars model were used to provide the hydrological interpretations for the model components indeed there exists a potential error meanwhile the model components can affect each other on multidimensional scale not only the pairwise interactions existed there are still some uncertainties in the identification analysis on the dominant interactions between climatic seasonality catchment characteristics and anthropogenic factors for budyko curves in our study four pairwise interactions were revealed by mars model i e ca and asd pdsi and si cv and si ia and m the interaction between ca and asd shows that the cultivation can weaken the reducing effect of high asd on the budyko parameter estimating however for catchments with crops planting this reducing effect tends to be weakened fig 7 a in principle this reduction should be enhanced when the ca increases fig 7 shows that there are some biases in two pairwise interactions comparing with the budyko parameter n calculated by observation for all 96 catchments in order to clearly investigate how large the uncertainties resulted from these two interactions fig 9 is plotted to show the biases of two pairwise interactions comparing to the budyko parameter n calculated by observation for all 96 catchments it can be seen that these large biases existed in the catchments with small budyko parameter values which is also verified by fig 7 a and d overall the relative errors of these two interactions i e asd and ca ia and m comparing to the budyko parameter n calculated by observation are 9 1 and 1 8 respectively these biases in the data set is a likely cause of the inconsistent relationship for the catchments with low asd ca ia and m values the identification of the partitioning process of p is difficult due to the fact that it is controlled by various controls and complex internal relations in the controls especially in the small catchments where the interaction between influencing factors and the hydrological cycle becomes more complex therefore these uncertainties requires further study especially focused on interactions differences spans small to large scale catchments furthermore the results and conclusions from this study are potentially useful for interpreting annual and seasonal water balances in different catchments and comparing catchments in different parts of the world on the basis of their dominant process controls although the current model was developed using long term average state variables multi years mean with results reflecting long term equilibrium conditions of water partitioning in basins specially deep insight into the interactions between climatic seasonality characteristics catchment characteristics and anthropogenic controls on long term average water balance gained in this study can help formulate new approaches to catchment classification and similarity analyses further study about this topic can go a long way towards assisting with predicting the hydrological responses of ungauged basins 6 conclusions in this paper 12 influencing factors including the catchment characteristics m rr pawc climatic seasonality characteristics asd ci cv si pdsi sim pfe and agricultural activities ia ca were identified to be related with budyko type equation parameter spatially change correlations between climatic seasonality characteristics and catchment characteristics agricultural activities are significant and these influencing factors are interconnected which potentially tend to affect the budyko type equation parameter estimation a non parametric regression technique the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars model was employed to identify the dominant interactions between climatic seasonality catchment characteristics and agricultural activities on budyko type equation parameter n i e budyko curve for specific basin estimation the mars model revealed that only seven factors are selected in the final model for our collected 96 catchments across china there are three significant factors i e asd m and si affecting the budyko parameter s estimation at different values ranges the selected factors interactions affecting the budyko parameter n can be summarized as follows 1 the budyko parameter value can be reduced when the asd is larger than 46 78 mm while catchments with cultivation can undermine the reducing effect of asd 2 the interaction of pdsi and si is to reduce the budyko parameter when the pdsi is less than 0 740 and the si is higher than 0 797 3 budyko parameter n is small when the si is less than 0 797 and the cv is less than 0 140 or when the si is larger than 0 797 and the cv is higher than 0 230 4 the interaction between the ia and m shows that the budyko parameter n value is larger when the ia is lower than 4 34 and the m is lower than 34 56 or when ia is higher than 4 34 and the m is lower than 34 56 noted that agricultural activities can change both the vegetation and the evapotranspiration capacity our study quantitatively assessed this effect and emphasized the importance of agricultural activities in regulating ecohydrologic processes the good performance of the mars model in the budyko parameter estimating was gained with the correlation coefficient r is 0 817 and the mean absolute error mae is 4 09 the uncertainties of the interactions are likely causes of the inconsistent relationship for the catchments with low asd ca ia and m values especially in the small catchments where the interaction between influencing factors and the hydrological cycle becomes more complex acknowledgments this work was jointly

7574,quantifying precipitation p partition into evapotranspiration e and runoff q is of great importance for global and regional water availability assessment budyko framework serves as a powerful tool to make simple and transparent estimation for the partition using a single parameter to characterize the shape of the budyko curve for a specific basin where the single parameter reflects the overall effect by not only climatic seasonality catchment characteristics e g soil topography and vegetation but also agricultural activities e g cultivation and irrigation at the regional scale these influencing factors are interconnected and the interactions between them can also affect the single parameter of budyko type equations estimating here we employ the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars model to estimate the budyko curve shape parameter n in the choudhury s equation one form of the budyko framework of the selected 96 catchments across china using a data set of long term averages for climatic seasonality catchment characteristics and agricultural activities results show average storm depth asd vegetation coverage m and seasonality index of precipitation si are three statistically significant factors affecting the budyko parameter more importantly four pairs of interactions are recognized by the mars model as the interaction between ca percentage of cultivated land area to total catchment area and asd shows that the cultivation can weaken the reducing effect of high asd 46 78 mm on the budyko parameter estimating drought represented by the value of palmer drought severity index 0 74 and uneven distribution of annual rainfall represented by the value of coefficient of variation of precipitation 0 23 tend to enhance the budyko parameter reduction by large si 0 797 low vegetation coverage 34 56 is likely to intensify the rising effect on evapotranspiration ratio by ia percentage of irrigation area to total catchment area the budyko n values estimated by the mars model reproduce the calculated ones by the observation well for the selected 96 catchments with r 0 817 mae 4 09 compared to the multiple stepwise regression model estimating the

hydroclimatic changes on water availability is critical for regional water resource management and planning on the catchment scale water availability is substantially determined by the partitioning of precipitation p into evapotranspiration e and runoff q however dominated by numerous factors chiefly consisting of natural e g climatic seasonality topography and anthropogenic factors e g agricultural development it is difficult to identify the partitioning process of p berghuijs et al 2014 greve et al 2015 there are two categories of approaches to assess the water partitioning under changing environments approaches based on detailed hydrologic models and simple conceptual model based on the budyko hypothesis guo et al 2015 with deterministic physical mechanisms approaches based on detailed hydrologic models can accurately describe the hydrological processes yet the reliability of the simulation is always limited due to the model structures and parameter uncertainties in practice determining the impacts of climate change on board scale water availability require long term estimation teng et al 2012 singh and kumar 2015 budyko framework prescribing the dependence of long term mean annual actual e on water supply p and demand potential evaporation e0 serves as a simple but effective tool to make transparent estimates of changes in water availability as well as to investigate the interactions between climate forcing and land surface characteristics on water and energy cycles roderick and farquhar 2011 williams et al 2012 li et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 greve et al 2015 fang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the original budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 is that natural watersheds follow the budyko curve which is entirely deterministic and non parametric in this context some non parametric budyko equations e g schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 budyko 1958 pike 1964 were developed however it should be acknowledged that variations around the curve can alter depending on land surface characteristics furthermore many subsequently derived formulations of the budyko curve are parametric e g mezentsev 1955 fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001

and guo 2012 playing the similar roles in controlling how much of the available water will be evaporated given the available energy the empirical dimensionless parameters of different budyko type equations determine the shape of the budyko curve and reflect the influences of basin characteristics xu et al 2013 consequently a simple estimating model with precise characterization of the empirical dimensionless parameters will be a good basis for the budyko framework application and water availability assessment previous studies have documented that single parameter in budyko type equations can be reflected by various climate and catchment characteristics such as climatic seasonality characteristics milly 1994 potter et al 2005 williams et al 2012 chen et al 2013 berghuijs et

neural network techniques have been proposed to estimate the parameters of budyko type equations for specific conditions e g yang et al 2007 2009 donohue et al 2012 shao et al 2012 li et al 2013 xu et al 2013 unfortunately those models are only based on climatic and catchment characteristics the impact of changing anthropogenic factors on the partitioning of p into e and q reflecting by the single parameter in budyko type equation has not been concerned in previous studies in fact with the developing of global modernization human activities e g cultivation irrigation afforestation deforestation and urban construction have already altered land use cover and evapotranspiration capacity these activities further have been revealed to have increased or enhanced impacts on instream flow changes in recent years by extensive literatures e g brown et al 2005 scanlon et al 2007 roderick and farquhar 2011 liu et al 2017 currently budyko hypothesis is usually used to quantify the impact of climate and humans on mean annual streamflow by the decomposition method or elasticity method e g wang and hejazi 2011 chen et al 2013 tan and gan 2015 liang et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 for example wang and hejazi 2011 used a decomposition method based on the budyko hypothesis to quantify the climate and direct human impact on mean annual streamflow mas for 413 watersheds in the contiguous united states they found that direct human impact decreased mean annual streamflow in some watersheds with urban areas and extensively irrigated agriculture globally the irrigation area occupies 20 of the arable land area and sustains about 40 of the food production furthermore the irrigation water diversion and consumption takes up respectively about 70 and 90 of the total human water diversion and consumption döll and siebert 2002 wisser et al 2008 the wide range activities of water diversion from rivers reservoirs and underground aquifers to the irrigation districts significantly influenced the natural hydrological cycle in some areas the impact of irrigation is on the same order of magnitude as the impact of climate change this is especially true in china a vast agricultural country in the world according to the statistics the cultivated land accounts for about 12 5 of china s total land and the irrigated land accounts for about 40 of china s total arable land and produces 75 of china s total food grain jin and young 2001 thus agricultural activities especially cultivation and irrigation which not only are vital for global food security but also constitute land use changes known to have strong effects on local hydrological and energy cycles de vrese et al 2016 hence the hydrologic impact of changes in agricultural activities as well as changes in climatic seasonality characteristics and catchment characteristics should be also incorporated into the framework by changing the value of budyko type equations parameters besides from the perspective of modelling precision inclusion of more influencing factors can eliminate the problem of biased sampling and reduce model uncertainty shao et al 2012 therefore in this work we will highlight changes in those agricultural activities to emphasize the point that changes in the specific basin parameter may be subtle not linearity related to the climatic seasonality characteristics and catchment characteristics in practice models like the least squares method li et al 2013 the multiple stepwise regression model zhang et al 2004 yang et al 2009 and the neural network model xu et al 2013 are often developed to estimate the budyko type equation parameter by taking the influence factors as independent inputs however the water partitioning process is resulted from the hybrids of various influence factors milly 1994 yokoo et al 2008 gentine et al 2012 shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 meanwhile the influencing factors i e climatic seasonality characteristics catchment characteristics and agricultural activities have been widely recognized to be interconnected dietrich and perron 2006 which tends to reduce the range and variability of model response gentine et al 2012 liang et al 2015 therefore investigation of the interactions between the influencing factors on the catchment specific model parameter under a changing climate should urgently emerge for many disciplines such as hydrology meteorology and ecology a nonparametric method the multivariate adaptive regression spline mars model proposed by friedman 1991 is a powerful tool to identify important factors and their interactions by determining statistically significant factors recently shao et al 2012 successfully applied the mars model to estimate the budyko parameter based on various climatic and catchment characteristics using 241 australian catchments where all the catchments have relatively small drainage areas without remarkable agricultural activities conversely china is a vast agricultural country with a plenty variety of catchments with cultivated and irrigated lands this unique condition has caused the complicated and interconnected relationship in the water energy controls of catchments however up to now deterministic estimation of budyko equation parameter based on various controls especially the agricultural activities and investigation of the interactions between influencing factors i e climate soil topography vegetation properties and agricultural activities across china are scarce given that agricultural activities can also reflect the water partitioning across china the ability of mars model in determining statistically significant factors and their interactions and the availability of selected 96 catchments data sets in this study the relationship between the basin specific budyko curves and their influencing factors the correlations between the influencing factors are firstly detected by pearson correlation analysis approach the significant factors and their interactions is investigated by mars model using data sets that span a wide range of climate regimes and spatial scales more specifically the influencing magnitudes of the interactions on the budyko parameter estimation in different catchments and the performances of mars model compared to the parametric model multiple stepwise regression model taken the influencing factors as independent inputs are also assessed 2 methodology 2 1 budyko type equation the dynamic water balance equation of a natural watersheds is 1 d dt s t p t e t q t where s t is the total stored water of the watershed p t e t and q t are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff respectively for a watershed with irrigation if the drainage area is large enough and there is no exchange between watersheds the irrigation i at time t can be taken as the water demand from the runoff at time t 1 accordingly the irrigation i at time t can be taken as the water supply as well as p at time t the dynamic water balance of a catchment with agricultural activities terms as 2 d dt s t d dt i t p t e t q t over a time interval t eq 2 can be obtained as 3 s t s 0 i t i 0 t p e q if t is long enough e g decades the storage and water utilization by irrigation terms which are all from the p of the catchment can be neglected and eq 3 becomes 4 0 p e q that is at the multi year scale the water utilization by agricultural activities in a catchment would not affect the water balance therefore budyko type equations can also be used to assess the impacts of anthropogenic modifications on instream flow changes several mathematical equations have been developed to represent the budyko framework and here the choudhury equation choudhury 1999 is used 5 e p e 0 p 1 e 0 p n 1 n where n is a catchment specific parameter which determines the evapotranspiration ratio e p for given e 0 p and modifies the partitioning of p between e and q daily e0 is calculated based on the penman equation that includes wind speed relative humidity air temperature and radiation the e0 calculation follows shuttleworth 1993 6 λ e 0 δ δ γ r n g γ γ 6 43 1 0 536 u 2 100 rh 100 e s where e 0 is the potential evapotranspiration

adaptive regression splines mars is a form of regression analysis introduced by friedman 1991 it is a non parametric regression technique and can be seen as an extension of traditional linear regression models that automatically models nonlinearities and interactions between variables the objective of non parametric regression is to estimate the regression function f given by 7 n f x ε f x 1 x k ε where f is a function to be specified and x x 1 x k is the collection of potential variables affecting the budyko parameter n of eq 5 mars builds models of the form 8 f x j 1 j a j b j x where f x is the spline approximation of the function of interest f x a j is the coefficient of jth basis function b j x which can be considered weight that represents the importance of the jth variable each basis function b j x is consisted by 1 a constant there is only one such term called the intercept note that this constant represents the possible intercepts in other basis functions 2 a hinge function has the form of max 0 x knot or max 0 knot x mars automatically selects variable x and values of those variables for knots of the hinge functions 3 a product of two or more hinge functions in mathematics the basis functions of mars model 8 are in the form of 9 b j x i 1 k j u ij x v i j t ij where u ij 1 or u ij 1 z is a truncated function of z z if z 0 z 0 if z 0 x v i j represents a variable in x x 1 x k i e v i j 1 k which will be determined in mars tij give the corresponding knot points at which the basis functions change and kj is the number of interacting variables in the basis function the aim of mars is not only to adjust the coefficient values to best fit the data but also to derive a good set of basis functions based on the data the best model is determined by the generalized cross validation criterion gcv which is an alternative to having both training data sets and overfit checking data sets for model validation is given by 10 gcv λ i 1 n y i f λ x i 2 1 m λ n 2 where f λ is the estimate based on λ basis functions and m λ is a complexity cost function mars builds a model in two phases the forward and the backward pass the forward pass usually builds an overfit model the terms keep added until the maximum gcv value is reached that is any more term will reduce the gcv value the model after the forward selection is called the full model backward selection tends to eliminate the less important terms which reduce the gcv values the backward step starts from the full model and a term which is least important that is the gcv value will increase mostly without this term is then removed the terms keep removed until the maximum gcv value is reached the model after the backward selection is called the final model in this paper only the first order interaction is considered i e we limit the mars model to pairwise interactions in order that it is able to manifest the hydrological interpretations for the model components 2 4 measures of performance assessment performance of the mars model for estimating n is evaluated by comparing estimated n against n values calculated by eq 5 using the observations two statistics namely the correlation coefficient r and mean absolute errors mae are used to evaluate the performance of mars model and are defined in the form as 11 r i 1 m o i o s i s i 1 m o i o 2 0 5 i 1 m s i s 2 0 5 12 mae i 1 m s i o i m with o i 1 m o i m and s i 1 m s i m are the average of the observed variable o i and the average of the simulated variable s i i 1 2 m respectively where m is the number of space steps 3 study area and data processing spanning different climatic conditions a total of 96 catchments including catchments in songhua river basin liao river basin hai river basin yellow river basin huai river basin yangtze river basin pearl river basin yalungzangbo river basin etc selected in this study are from china the location map of these selected catchments is given in fig 1 meanwhile the detailed information for discharge control gauges from 96 catchments selected based on the data availability and quality including the longitude latitude and the drainage area that each gauge controlled are shown in table 2 to ensure each catchment has at least 10 complete years of unimpaired streamflow data we collected monthly streamflow data from most of the 96 discharge control gauges covering the 1981 2000 period and the gauges in the tibet from the recorded year to 2010 period the streamflow data were collected from the ministry of water resources china the missing data accounts for less than 1 of the total data and were processed using the 5 year moving average method daily meteorological data such as precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed and relative humidity were collected from 412 stations can be seen in fig 1 covering the same period as the observed streamflow data the meteorological data was obtained from the climatic data center national meteorological information center china meteorological administration the procedure for calculating the catchment average climatic variables are as follows 1 a 10 km grid data set covering the study areas was interpolated from the weather stations data 2 potential evaporation was estimated in each grid and 3 the catchment average values were calculated air temperature was interpolated using an inverse distance weighted technique that considers the effect of elevation other variables were interpolated using an inverse distance weighted technique for each of the catchments information about land use topographic characteristics and soil properties was also obtained the topographic data came from 30 m resolution digital elevation maps the soil properties include upper and lower soil horizon soil moisture content soil types and depths of a and b horizons were from the ornl daac oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center https daac ornl gov soils ndvi 1981 2000 spatial resolution 0 073 data set was acquired from the gimms global inventory modeling and mapping studies http glcf umd edu data gimms in addition the agricultural activities i e ia and ca data were sourced from national bureau of statistics of china http data stats gov cn 4 results 4 1 basin specific budyko parameter using long term mean annual q p and e0 data budyko parameter n for specific basin was obtained by eq 5 fig 2 a presents the spatial distribution of budyko parameter n values the budyko curves with different n values range from 0 301 to 3 047 representing the complexity of the regional climate and catchment characteristics the distribution has a clear spatial structure with low n values in the western catchments upper reaches of yellow river and yangtze river catchments in tibet and high ones in the eastern catchments hai river basin huai river basin lower reaches of yellow river and yangtze river and pearl river delta the long term mean annual evapotranspiration ratio e p versus dryness index e0 p for 96 catchments of different climatic conditions are plotted in fig 2 b it is evident that for certain dryness index e would increase with larger parameter n taking the middle reach of yellow river basin controlled by longmen gauge and nianchu river catchment controlled by jiangzi gauge as a paired example although the similar climatic conditions of the middle yellow river basin with e0 p 2 562 and the nianchu river catchment with e0 p 2 597 the evapotranspiration ratios e p are quite different with 0 896 and 0 156 respectively for the different parameters n values 1 690 and 0 301 fig 2 a and b also demonstrate that most n values of catchments range from 0 5 to 2 5 accounting 82 3 of all catchments 4 2 spatial distribution of influencing factors the distributions of catchment characteristics i e m rr and pawc are shown in fig 3 the pearl river basin southern catchments of china are covered by high vegetation cover while respectively low m values are located in the upper and middle reaches of yellow river basin hei river basin and brahmaputra river basin fig 3 a rr represents the topographic controls on parameter n of the catchment which ranges from 0 001 to 0 026 fig 3 b the most cliffy catchments are located in the tibetan plateau and yunnan guizhou plateau fig 3 c illustrates that high pawc values are distributed in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river basin pearl river basin as for the climatic seasonality characteristics the distributions are presented in fig 4 high asd and ci values are located on the southern catchments fig 4 a and b while high cv and si values are distributed on the northern catchments including songhua river basin liao river basin hai river basin northern yellow river basin and yalungzangbo river basin fig 4 c and d fig 4 e replays that low pdsi values are distributed on the yellow huai hai region most sim values are smaller than 3 while high sim values are located on the hei river basin and the middle region of yellow river fig 4 f fig 4 g depicts that lower pfe values are distributed on the hei river basin the source regions of yellow river and yangtze river the lancang river basin fig 5 demonstrates the spatial distributions of agricultural activities i e ia and ca density it can be concluded that ia and ca are subject to huge spatial heterogeneity within 96 catchments across china we found that the higher ia and ca ones are distributed on the hai river basin huai river basin xin an river basin ou river basin pearl river basin and the lower reaches of yellow river basin yangtze river basin overall the spatial variabilities in climate catchment characteristics and agricultural activities further confirms the heterogeneities in budyko curves between multiple catchments this may not be surprising as evapotranspiration is a very complex random processes influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors 4 3 correlation of budyko parameter and the influencing factors before employing the mars model to estimate the budyko parameter n the correlations between the budyko parameter n and influencing factors are investigated by pearson correlation analysis see table 3 it can be seen that except cv and pfe have insignificant correlation with budyko parameter n spatially change other factors especially soil properties i e pawc climatic seasonality characteristics i e asd ci si and pdsi and agricultural activities i e ia and ca have close relationships the absolute correlation coefficients over 0 3 with budyko parameter n spatially change furthermore the multiple stepwise regression msr model a widely used method to identify the dominant variables associated with the budyko parameter zhang et al 2004 yang et al 2009 was employed to possibly explain the underlying mechanisms of n spatially change by considering the budyko parameter n spatially series as a dependent variable and 12 influencing factors as independent variables a total of five out of 12 explanatory variables were selected in the final msr model for the 96 typical catchments the final model is as follows 13 n 2 100 ci 0 157 sim 0 284 pdsi 1 203 si 45 4 rr 1 299 this model explains 42 6 of observed variance with r of 0 653 mae of 5 47 and with ci explaining 18 0 sim 6 8 pdsi 7 7 si 5 2 and rr 4 9 of variance although the msr model eq 13 explains nearly half of the variance of the budyko parameter n the predictive capacity of n is weak particularly at the high end noticeably although some factors are insignificant variables for budyko parameter n spatially change the interactions between the influencing factors can also have potential influence on the catchment specific model parameter estimation 4 4 correlation between influencing factors the correlation between influencing factors were also examined by pearson correlation analysis and the results are given in table 4 except rr ci and pdsi all the other factors are significantly correlated with m most of these correlations are positive while climatic seasonality characteristics i e cv si and sim have negative correlation with m only ci has significant negative correlation with rr which represents that steep slopes tend to generate more concentrated rainfall the correlations of pawc with most factors are significant and positive only the correlations of cv and si with pawc are negative overall most of the correlations of climatic seasonality characteristics with catchment characteristics and agricultural activities factors are significant this phenomenon further confirms that these influencing factors are interconnected and potentially tend to affect the water partitioning process 4 5 interactions between variables identified by mars instead of making a subjective selection we kept all the 12 influencing factors and let the mars model determine the statistically significant ones 22 basis functions were initially selected as the full model after the forward selection when the relative change of mean square errors reaches to 0 001 but only 14 basis functions remained after the backward selection table 5 lists the final 14 basis functions given by their coefficients and knot points of the selected variables which are given by nonzero values the final model with mse 0 119 and gcv 0 213 the final 14 basis functions can be grouped into 8 sets of functional forms representing constant functions for single variable and functions for the interaction between variables detailed explanations are given below 1 the constant factor f x 1 721 described as the first term gives the baseline value of the budyko parameter n 2 the effect described by terms 2 and 3 is asd the spline function is given as 14 f asd 0 0372 asd 46 78 0 0061 asd 46 78 1 721 and is plotted together with observed values in fig 6 a it can be seen from fig 6 a that when asd 46 78 mm fasd 0 0372 46 78 asd mostly occurs in the northwestern arid catchments seen in fig 4 a this means higher asd across the northwestern arid region would have a higher evapotranspiration ratio this phenomenon illustrates that the rainfall is preferred to evaporate in the arid catchments in the semi humid and humid regions with larger asd 46 78 mm the rainfall will generate runoff first especially for some low lying and landlocked areas the intense rain cannot be quickly released to cause the excessive saturation of farmland water and soil moisture likely resulting in more geological disasters 3 the effect depicted by terms 4 and 5 is m and is given in fig 6 b the spline function is given as 15 f m 0 030 m 34 56 0 027 m 34 56 1 721 fig 6 b shows that when m 34 56 the catchments locating in the pearl river basin southern of china fig 3 a will have small budyko parameter value and tend to generate more runoff this result means that within a certain range vegetation has the effect of weakening peak in flood process fig 3 a reveals that the catchments with less than 34 56 vegetation cover are located in the upper and middle reaches of yellow river basin hei river basin and brahmaputra river basin with the dryness index greater than 2 0 and the budyko parameter value smaller than 1 0 4 the effect depicted by terms 6 and 7 is si and is given in fig 6 c the spline function is given as 16 f si 3 743 si 0 797 1 518 si 0 797 1 721 fig 6 c demonstrates that the threshold value is 0 797 here in the equation the budyko parameter will increase when si is less than 0 797 only on the catchments of the southeastern china which regions are covered by relatively low si values 0 797 would have increasing evapotranspiration ratios along with the increasing si fig 4 d while the northern catchments with relatively large si are favorable for runoff generation and this leads to lower evapotranspiration ratios si represents the uneven distribution index of monthly rainfall in annual rainfall see table 1 fig 6 c confirms that more decentralized rainfall can result more runoff generation we now investigate the interaction terms recognized by the mars model 5 the first interaction is between ca and asd by terms 8 and 9 the spline function is given as f ca asd 0 0013 ca 21 97 asd 46 78 17 0 0002 ca 21 97 asd 46 78 1 721 and is depicted in fig 7 a this interaction term suggests that crop area with higher asd tend to have higher evapotranspiration ratio especially when the ca is relatively small the correlation of ca and asd is 0 565 table 4 it also can be seen from figs 4 a and 5 d that the ca density will increase with large asd by jointly viewing figs 4 a and 7 a we can conclude that although the effect of higher asd 46 78 mm locating in the southeastern humid region is to reduce the budyko parameter value fig 6 a for catchments with crops planting this effect is undermined theoretically this reduction should be enhanced when the ca increases however the rising evapotranspiration ratio by the higher asd and smaller ca is found in fig 7 a this bias in the data set is a likely cause of the inconsistent relationship for the catchments with high asd and low ca 6 the second interaction is between pdsi and si by term 10 the spline function is given as 18 f pdsi si 0 918 pdsi 0 740 si 0 797 1 721 and is depicted in fig 7 b it can be seen that the interaction between pdsi and si is to reduce the budyko parameter n when the pdsi is less than 0 740 and the si is higher than 0 797 fig 4 d e and b suggest that catchments in the hai river basin the liao river basin and the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river basin with lower pdsi but greater si would have a low budyko parameter n and a small evapotranspiration ratio this result confirms that small pdsi i e large dryness index tends to enhance the budyko parameter reduction by si 7 the third interaction is between si and cv by terms 11 and 12 the spline function is given as f si cv 5 43 si 0 797 cv 0 140 19 3 74 si 0 797 cv 0 230 1 721 and is depicted in fig 7 c it can be seen that the budyko parameter n value is small when the si is less than 0 797 and the cv is less than 0 14 or when the si is larger than 0 797 and the cv is higher than 0 23 this interaction term suggests that catchments with relatively large si and cv or catchments with small si and cv are favorable for runoff generation and therefore have lower evapotranspiration ratio fig 4 c d and c suggest that catchments in the hai river basin the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river basin with high si and cv values or catchments in the lower reach of yangtze river basin and southeastern catchments have low si and cv values would have a lower budyko parameter n and generate more runoff the fourth interaction is between ia and m by terms 13 and 14 the spline function is given as f ia m 0 0079 ia 4 34 m 34 56 20 0 0037 ia 4 34 m 34 56 1 721 and is depicted in fig 7 d it can be seen that the budyko parameter n value is higher when the ia is lower than 4 34 and m is lower than 34 56 or when the ia is higher than 4 34 and m is lower than 34 56 this interaction term suggests that catchments with low ia 4 34 and m 34 56 tend to generate less runoff and therefore have higher evapotranspiration ratio by jointly viewing figs 6 b and 7 d we can conclude that low m enhances the rising effect on evapotranspiration ratio by the ia 4 6 assessment of mars model s performance fig 8 compares the calculated budyko parameter n values by eq 5 using the observations and estimated ones by the mars model for all the 96 catchments good agreement can be found with the correlation coefficient r is 0 817 and the mean absolute error mae is 4 09 the mars model performs better than the msr model in term of budyko parameter n with higher explained variance 66 7 relative to 42 6 and lower mae 4 09 relative to 5 47 the encouraging result provides confidence in the mars model to examine the interactions between climatic seasonality catchment characteristics and anthropogenic factors to variations in the hydrological regime 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of interactions between variables on budyko parameter estimating in our study pearson correlation shows that not only the soil properties i e pawc and climatic seasonality characteristics i e asd ci si and pdsi but also agricultural activities factors i e ia and ca have close relationship with budyko parameter n spatially change seen in table 3 most of the correlations between climatic seasonality characteristics and catchment characteristics agricultural activities are significant seen in table 4 these results show that the influencing factors are interconnected which potentially tend to affect the water partitioning process in addition ci sim pdsi rr and si were selected as the significant variables by the msr model eq 13 these influencing factors have also been proved to be useful for measuring climate changes and interventions in alteration of the water partitioning williams et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2014 monjo and marin vide 2016 however estimating the budyko parameter by the influencing factors as independent inputs can lead to incorrect conclusions on the relationship between budyko parameter n and its influencing factors milly 1994 yokoo et al 2008 gentine et al 2012 shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 in this context the mars model was employed to identify important factors with consideration of their interactions on budyko curves in the mars model process for our 96 collected catchments across china there are three significant factors and different directions of linear regressions on the budyko parameter including asd m and si respectively table 5 and fig 6 in the semi humid and humid regions with larger asd rain is preferred to generate runoff first especially for some low lying and landlocked areas the intense rain cannot be quickly released to cause the excessive saturation of farmland water and soil moisture likely resulting in more geological disasters within a certain range vegetation has the effect of weakening the runoff extremum si representing the uneven distribution index of monthly rainfall in annual rainfall confirms that more decentralized rainfall can result more runoff generation using 241 australian catchments shao et al 2012 found pfe is a significant term affecting the mean annual e and the functional relationship of e with pfe stated that closer phase between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can result in less streamflow however the seasonality effect on mean annual evapotranspiration cannot be adequately represented by phase difference between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration alone e g pfe hickel and zhang 2006 yokoo et al 2008 in our study asd m and si are identified as three statistically significant factors affecting the budyko parameter in 96 selected catchments across china noted that asd and si also are climatic seasonality characteristics these different results of these two studies maybe resulted from the climate differences in different regions and the influencing factors considered while the mars model also selected interactions affecting the budyko curves as follows 1 ca and asd 2 pdsi and si 3 si and cv 4 ia and m seen in fig 7 overall the ca can undermine the reducing effect of asd on the budyko parameter drought and uneven distribution of annual rainfall enhance the reduction of budyko parameter by si lower m enhance the rising effect on evapotranspiration ratio by the ia the interactions between climatic seasonality characteristics i e pdsi and si si and cv are very important and very subtle our simulations showed that the effects of climatic seasonality characteristics on water balance cannot be handled by means of total precipitation alone as in many conceptual budyko type models the role of climatic seasonality characteristics and their interactions on budyko parameter have been shown to be important in determining long term mean water balance these results confirm previous observations and model predictions of the critical role played by the frequency of rainfall events and seasonal variability of climate e g yokoo et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 in our study taking all 12 factors consisting of natural and anthropogenic factors into the mars model 7 factors are selected in the final model including asd si ia m cv pdsi and ca the budyko s n values estimated by the mars model reproduce the calculated ones by the observation well for the selected 96 catchments with r 0 817 mae 4 09 alternatively we also assess the performance of mars model in term of evapotranspiration with estimated parameter n the choudhury s equation reproduced mean annual e well for the 96 catchments with r of 0 917 and mae of 13 5 mm without considering the agricultural activities 4 factors are selected in the final model including m asd si and pdsi two pairs of interactions were identified by the mars 1 pdsi and si 2 asd and m while this mars model performs less well on the e calculation with r is 0 751 and mae is 38 4 mm five factors pfe asd cv rr and m were selected in the final mars model by shao et al 2012 using 241 australian catchments the performance of mars model in term of e was assessed with r of 0 911 and mae of 43 mm they revealed that the interaction between asd and cv can reduce the value of the budyko parameter the interaction between asd and rr can also lead to a smaller budyko parameter while the interaction between rr and m will lead to an increase in the budyko parameter mars model can reproduce e in 241 australian catchments better than 96 chinese catchments since the agricultural conditions affect water balance and cannot be ignored across china 5 2 agricultural activities factors effect on regional water availability assessment with the agricultural activities the mars model reproduces mean annual e well for the 96 catchments with the r is 0 917 and the mae is 13 5 mm without the agricultural activities the mars model performs the calculated e by the observation with the r is 0 751 and the mae is 38 4 mm it can be seen that agricultural activities have much effect on regional water availability assessment in particular the first interaction identified by the mars model affecting the budyko parameters is the cultivated land area and the average storm depth fig 7 a obviously cultivation can be affected by climate change due to the ongoing intensifications of regional hydrological cycles with the alterations of precipitation runoff infiltration groundwater flow evapotranspiration and soil moisture in many parts of the world during past century alan et al 2003 huntiugton 2006 wang et al 2017 yokoo et al 2008 explored the effects of seasonal variability of climatic inputs on mean annual and monthly water balances and the roles of climate soil properties and topography in modulating these impacts and found that the effects of seasonality are most important when the seasonal variabilities of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are out of phase and in arid climates in our study the ca was found to undermine the reducing effect of asd on the budyko parameter this general conclusion confirms and extends the results of the previous work done by yokoo et al 2008 shao et al 2012 and liang et al 2015 well known that the anthropogenic factors such as harvesting clearing and fertilization have been found to change both the vegetation and the evapotranspiration capacity ma et al 2008 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 li et al 2013 further affect the regional water availability and hydrological cycle moreover anthropogenic interventions tend to have increasing or enhancing influence on hydrological cycle because the increasing population expanding cultivation irrigation afforestation and enhancing deforestation scanlon et al 2007 roderick and farquhar 2011 liu et al 2017 de vrese et al 2016 confirmed that irrigation has a direct effect on regional atmospheric circulations and associated precipitation patterns such as the south and east asian monsoon cultivation and irrigation are not only affected by changing climate conditions and altering land cover use but in turn have a substantial effect on them our findings here enhance that changes in parameter n could be captured by interaction between the vegetation and effective irrigated area in the selected 96 catchments across china which have not been quantified assessing before land cover use for example vegetation cover is also an important factor in budyko parameter n estimation for it can directly influence rainfall redistribution e g vegetation coverage controls water interception and roots control infiltration uptake recharge and runoff donohue et al 2007 2010 gentine et al 2012 xu et al 2013 vegetation cover cannot be simply attributed to catchment characteristics or human activities which would overestimate the impact of local human activities on changes in q for that the vegetation information reflects the integrated landscape and climatic features donohue et al 2007 recent years many studies have investigated the role of vegetation in the budyko framework e g yang et al 2008 2009 indicated that the leaf area index have a high correlation with the budyko parameter they further parameterized the parameter using the variable ndvi and found that it is quite difficult to generalize the vegetation impact on the parameter donohue et al 2007 2010 declared that models considering the vegetation information can improve the performance of the budyko curve shao et al 2012 estimated the budyko parameter and observed large impact of forest coverage on budyko parameter li et al 2013 developed a simple parameterization for budyko parameter based solely on remotely sensed vegetation information xu et al 2013 indicated that the variance explained by ndvi seems low 11 and much lower than the result from li et al 2013 they evolved that this phenomenon is resulted from the cross correlations of ndvi with other factors wang and tang 2014 identified vegetation and rainfall are the dominant controlling factors on budyko parameter based on the approximately linearized relationship between the budyko parameter and vegetation cover greve et al 2014 assessed the trend in wetting and drying over land across the globe and singh and kumar 2015 quantified the vulnerability of water availability in india due to climate change subsequently liang et al 2015 reveals that changes in budyko parameter n could be captured by the relative area of the ecological restoration measures in the 14 catchments in china s loess plateau compared to the previous studies our results emphasize the importance of agricultural activities i e ca and ia in regulating ecohydrologic processes the results could provide a new idea to assess the budyko type equations parameters and facilitate a wider application of the budyko framework in investigating the interactions between the climate vegetation hydrologic cycle and agricultural activities 5 3 uncertainty of the interactions between influencing factors in this paper we considered 12 influencing factors for the collected 96 catchments across china although inclusion of more climatic factors and catchment characteristics can eliminate the problem of biased sampling and reduce model uncertainty shao et al 2012 only the first order interaction i e pairwise interactions identified by mars model were used to provide the hydrological interpretations for the model components indeed there exists a potential error meanwhile the model components can affect each other on multidimensional scale not only the pairwise interactions existed there are still some uncertainties in the identification analysis on the dominant interactions between climatic seasonality catchment characteristics and anthropogenic factors for budyko curves in our study four pairwise interactions were revealed by mars model i e ca and asd pdsi and si cv and si ia and m the interaction between ca and asd shows that the cultivation can weaken the reducing effect of high asd on the budyko parameter estimating however for catchments with crops planting this reducing effect tends to be weakened fig 7 a in principle this reduction should be enhanced when the ca increases fig 7 shows that there are some biases in two pairwise interactions comparing with the budyko parameter n calculated by observation for all 96 catchments in order to clearly investigate how large the uncertainties resulted from these two interactions fig 9 is plotted to show the biases of two pairwise interactions comparing to the budyko parameter n calculated by observation for all 96 catchments it can be seen that these large biases existed in the catchments with small budyko parameter values which is also verified by fig 7 a and d overall the relative errors of these two interactions i e asd and ca ia and m comparing to the budyko parameter n calculated by observation are 9 1 and 1 8 respectively these biases in the data set is a likely cause of the inconsistent relationship for the catchments with low asd ca ia and m values the identification of the partitioning process of p is difficult due to the fact that it is controlled by various controls and complex internal relations in the controls especially in the small catchments where the interaction between influencing factors and the hydrological cycle becomes more complex therefore these uncertainties requires further study especially focused on interactions differences spans small to large scale catchments furthermore the results and conclusions from this study are potentially useful for interpreting annual and seasonal water balances in different catchments and comparing catchments in different parts of the world on the basis of their dominant process controls although the current model was developed using long term average state variables multi years mean with results reflecting long term equilibrium conditions of water partitioning in basins specially deep insight into the interactions between climatic seasonality characteristics catchment characteristics and anthropogenic controls on long term average water balance gained in this study can help formulate new approaches to catchment classification and similarity analyses further study about this topic can go a long way towards assisting with predicting the hydrological responses of ungauged basins 6 conclusions in this paper 12 influencing factors including the catchment characteristics m rr pawc climatic seasonality characteristics asd ci cv si pdsi sim pfe and agricultural activities ia ca were identified to be related with budyko type equation parameter spatially change correlations between climatic seasonality characteristics and catchment characteristics agricultural activities are significant and these influencing factors are interconnected which potentially tend to affect the budyko type equation parameter estimation a non parametric regression technique the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars model was employed to identify the dominant interactions between climatic seasonality catchment characteristics and agricultural activities on budyko type equation parameter n i e budyko curve for specific basin estimation the mars model revealed that only seven factors are selected in the final model for our collected 96 catchments across china there are three significant factors i e asd m and si affecting the budyko parameter s estimation at different values ranges the selected factors interactions affecting the budyko parameter n can be summarized as follows 1 the budyko parameter value can be reduced when the asd is larger than 46 78 mm while catchments with cultivation can undermine the reducing effect of asd 2 the interaction of pdsi and si is to reduce the budyko parameter when the pdsi is less than 0 740 and the si is higher than 0 797 3 budyko parameter n is small when the si is less than 0 797 and the cv is less than 0 140 or when the si is larger than 0 797 and the cv is higher than 0 230 4 the interaction between the ia and m shows that the budyko parameter n value is larger when the ia is lower than 4 34 and the m is lower than 34 56 or when ia is higher than 4 34 and the m is lower than 34 56 noted that agricultural activities can change both the vegetation and the evapotranspiration capacity our study quantitatively assessed this effect and emphasized the importance of agricultural activities in regulating ecohydrologic processes the good performance of the mars model in the budyko parameter estimating was gained with the correlation coefficient r is 0 817 and the mean absolute error mae is 4 09 the uncertainties of the interactions are likely causes of the inconsistent relationship for the catchments with low asd ca ia and m values especially in the small catchments where the interaction between influencing factors and the hydrological cycle becomes more complex acknowledgments this work was jointly
