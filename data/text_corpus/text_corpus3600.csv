18000,microalgae mediated biodegradation of antibiotics has recently gained increased attention from international scientific community however limited information is available regarding microalgae mediated biodegradation of smx in a co metabolic system here we investigated the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole smx by five algal species pseudokirchneriella subcapitata scenedesmus quadricauda scenedesmus obliquus scenedesmus acuminatus and chlorella pyrenoidosa and its transformation pathways by c pyrenoidosa in a sodium acetate 3 mm co metabolic system the results showed that the highest smx dissipation 14 9 was detected by c pyrenoidosa after 11 days of cultivation among the five tested algal species in the absence of other carbon sources the addition of sodium acetate 0 8 mm significantly enhanced the dissipation efficiency of smx 0 4 μm from 6 05 to 99 3 by c pyrenoidosa after 5 days of cultivation and the dissipation of smx followed the first order kinetic model with apparent rate constants k ranging from 0 0107 to 0 9811 d 1 based on the results of mass balance analysis biodegradation by c pyrenoidosa was the main mechanism for the dissipation of smx in the culture medium fifteen phase i and phase ii metabolites were identified and subsequently the transformation pathway was proposed including oxidation hydroxylation formylation and side chain breakdown as well as pterin related conjugation the majority of metabolites of smx were only observed in the culture medium and varied with cultivation time the findings of the present study showed effective co metabolism of a sulfonamide by microalgae and it may be applied in the aquatic environment remediation and wastewater treatment in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae antibiotic sulfamethoxazole co metabolism transformation products biodegradation 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx is one of the most widely used drugs for human and veterinary medicine due to its ability to inhibit bacteria and protozoa ying et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 following treatment in animals and human a considerable proportion of sulfonamides could be excreted with unchanged or metabolized forms through feces and urine due to their poor absorbability and degradability in vivo zhang et al 2015 the extensive application of smx and the low removal efficiency of smx in wastewater treatment plants wwtps has resulted in its frequent detection in surface water and groundwater with the concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l kummerer 2009 wang and wang 2018 the occurrence of smx in the aquatic environment could exhibit adverse effects on the growth of microorganisms aquatic plants and fish and even affect the structure and function of microbial communities boxall et al 2012 xiong et al 2019a moreover there is an increasing evidence showing that the residual smx would pose potential risks to human health by inducing the development and spread of antibiotic resistance he et al 2016 therefore it is of great importance to explore sustainable methods to remove smx from the aquatic environment previous studies revealed that the removal of sulfonamides by conventional activated sludge treatment in wwtps is usually incomplete chen and xie 2018 while biodegradation by pure bacteria isolated from activated sludge can enhance the dissipation of smx and some species can even completely mineralize smx wang and wang 2018 the main concern related to these approaches is the potential for bacteria to develop antibiotic resistance and transfer antibiotic resistance genes he et al 2016 recently microalgae mediated biodegradation has received scientific interests and is proved to be an ecofriendly effective and safe technology to remove antibiotics xiong et al 2018 it has been verified that mixotrophic microalgae have varied capacities to dissipate antibiotics from wastewater or synthetic wastewater through bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation processes xiong et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 in a recent study by xiong et al 2019b the removal kinetics of sulfamethazine smz and smx by s obliquus was investigated and the dissipation ratios for smz 1 mg l and smx 1 mg l were calculated as 15 7 and 29 3 respectively after 14 days of cultivation the removal efficiency of smx and triclosan by nannochloris sp was found to be 32 and 72 respectively bai and acharya 2016 our previous study has also found that four freshwater green microalgal species exhibited capacity for simultaneous removal of total nitrogen total phosphorus metals and some organic compounds in wastewater zhou et al 2014 furthermore recent studies have demonstrated that augmenting wastewater with organic substrates e g glucose and sodium acetate or other nutrient substrates e g nitrogen and phosphorus sources to form a co metabolic system would be an effective strategy to enhance the biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants lu et al 2019 xiong et al 2017b 2018 the biodegradation of ciprofloxacin by chlamydomonas mexicana was obviously increased from 13 to 56 with the addition of sodium acetate as co metabolic organic substrate xiong et al 2017b additional exogenous carbon glucose sodium acetate or methanol could also significantly accelerate the biodegradation of some acidic drugs e g diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen by pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 lu et al 2019 the additional organic substrates not only serve to sustain biomass production but also act as an electron donor for the co metabolism of the non growth substrate xiong et al 2018 to our knowledge however the co metabolism of smx by microalgae remains unknown so far moreover the transformation mechanism and proposed pathways of smx involved in the co metabolic system need to be further studied as it is essential to understand the environmental fate and the risk assessment of smx in the aquatic environment common freshwater green microalgae such as pseudokirchneriella subcapitata scenedesmus quadricauda scenedesmus obliquus scenedesmus acuminatus and chlorella pyrenoidosa have been employed for the removal of various contaminants considering their potential capability for removing various pollutants and potential use as feedstock for bioenergy production or other high value added products xiong et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 the objectives of this study were to test and compare five microalgal species as mentioned above for their capacity to dissipate smx and then to investigate degradation of smx with the selected algal species c pyrenoidosa under various co metabolic conditions the influence of sodium acetate as a co metabolic organic substrate on the dissipation of smx by c pyrenoidosa was further assessed and the intermediates of smx were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms and the possible transformation pathways of biodegradation were proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical agents sulfamethoxazole smx purity 99 5 table s1 was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh germany acetonitrile and methanol hplc grade were acquired from merck

subcapitata fachb 271 scenedesmus quadricauda fachb 1468 scenedesmus obliquus fachb 12 scenedesmus acuminatus fachb 1221 and chlorella pyrenoidosa fachb 9 used in the experiment were obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences the microalgal strains were individually inoculated in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 150 ml blue green medium bg11 amended with 1 ml microalgal suspension od680 1 in an illumination incubator for 10 days and under the following conditions 4000 lx 25 1 c 12 12 h light dark photoperiod and humidity 60 xiong et al 2019c to achieve the desired optical density od for further experiments the microalgal suspension cultivated for 10 days was diluted using sterilized bg11 with a visible spectrophotometer yoke instrument china 2 3 batch experiments 2 3 1 microalgal screening and optimization of initial biomass a pre experiment was conducted to screen five microalgal species p subcapitata s quadricauda s obliquus s acuminatus and c pyrenoidosa for their capacity of dissipating smx five microalgal species were respectively cultivated for 11 days in 250 ml capacity erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml sterilized bg11 amended with 1 ml microalgal suspension od680 1 and 0 4 μm smx subsequently the effects of the microalgal initial biomass different initial biomass with od680 of 0 006 0 012 0 018 0 06 and 0 12 on the dissipation of 0 4 μm smx were also investigated samples were collected on day 0 2 4 7 and 11 respectively 2 3 2 effects of organic substrates owing to its highest dissipation capacity for smx in the screening experiment c pyrenoidosa was selected in further experiments it was cultivated with an initial od680 of 0 06 to screen the most suitable organic substrate for the co metabolic biodegradation of smx the biodegradation of smx 0 4 μm was investigated in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml sterilized bg11 with the addition of glucose 1 mm sodium acetate 1 mm or sodium formate 1 mm for 11 days sodium acetate was selected for further experiments as it produced the highest dissipation of smx the dissipation of smx 0 4 μm exposed to different sodium acetate concentrations 0 1 2 3 4 and 8 mm was investigated in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml sterilized bg11 inoculated with the initial od680 of 0 06 all the flasks were incubated in an illumination incubator for microalgal cultivation the biodegradation kinetics experiments with the addition of sodium acetate were conducted for 5 d with sampling on every 0 5 d and all treatments were carried out in triplicate to assess the chemical effects on algal growth the biotic controls were conducted with absence of smx abiotic controls were also included with 0 4 μm smx but without algae in the medium under light and darkness conditions respectively to measure the abiotic losses photolysis and hydrolysis of the target compound from the culture medium 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 measurement of cell growth the dry cell weight dcw in each treatment was measured according to our previous study peng et al 2014 a linear correlation between od680 and dcw of c pyrenoidosa g l 1 was obtained as follows dcw 0 3781 o d 680 0 0021 r 2 0 9905 the specific growth rate μ was calculated using the following equation μ l n n t l n n 0 t t t 0 where n t is the dcw at time t t and n 0 is the dcw at the beginning of the test t 0 0 d 2 4 2 sampling and pretreatment exactly 2 ml microalgal suspension was sampled at each sampling time and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 5 min to separate microalgal cells and then 1 ml of the supernatant was filtered with a 0 22 syringe filter anpel laboratory technologies china for analysis of residual concentrations of smx in the bg11 medium meanwhile 50 ml microalgal sample was gathered to evaluate the bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation of smx by c pyrenoidosa the harvested microalgal cell pellets were re suspended in distilled water 2 ml and shaken for 2 min to obtain the smx absorbed on the cell walls xiong et al 2017a the sample solution was centrifuged again and the supernatant was recovered for analysis of the concentration of smx adsorbed onto the cell surface the rest cell pellets were frozen 20 c over night to breakdown the cell walls and then re suspended by adding 2 ml of dichloromethane methanol 1 2 v v followed by sonication for 20 min 40 khz 2 2 kw the extraction was repeated three times the supernatant recovered by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 5 min was used to determine the concentration of bioaccumulated smx by c pyrenoidosa biomass 2 4 3 instrumental analysis of smx and its transformation products the quantification of smx was achieved by using an agilent 1260 infinity lc system equipped with a diode array detector agilent technologies usa set at 270 nm and an agilent eclipse xdb c18 chromatographic column 150 4 6 mm 5 μm the mobile phase consisted of 60 40 water acidified by 0 1 formic acid acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the injection volume was 100 μl the transformation products for smx were identified by using an agilent 1290 infinity lc system equipped with an agilent 6545 quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer uplc qtof ms the injection volume was 3 μl separation was accomplished using an agilent eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 150 mm 1 8 μm a gradient program was used with two mobile phases a 0 1 formic acid in water b acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the gradient elution started with 10 b and increased to 20 b within 5 min and then increased to 25 b at 10 min followed by a linear gradient to 30 b at 15 min 40 b at 20 min and then back to the initial conditions 10 b for 5 min the agilent 6545 system was operated with dual ajs source in positive and negative electrospray ionization esi mode using the following operation parameters capillary voltage 3500 v esi 4000 v esi nebulizer pressure 40 psi drying gas flow rate 9 0 l min 1 gas temperature 325 c sheath gas flow rate 11 l min 1 sheath gas temperature 350 c skimmer voltage 65 v octapole 1 rf 750 v fragmentor voltage 175 v lc ms accurate mass spectra were recorded across the range 50 750 m z in both positive and negative ion mode samples were first screened using ms1 scan mode at a rate of 2 5 spectra s and then 4 spectra s for auto ms ms mode with three collision energy values 10 20 and 40 v for confirmation when ms ms spectra were missing additional injections in targeted ms ms mode with selected precursor ions were conducted to obtain fragmentation spectra for some metabolites the identification of transformation products can refer to baduel et al 2019 with details being presented in the supporting information text s1 2 5 data analysis in the present study all experiments were carried out in triplicate and samples were stored at 20 c prior to analysis one way analysis of variance anova with tukey kramer multiple comparison test was conducted to analyze statistical differences among data with graph pad prism 5 software p 0 05 the dissipation p b of smx by c pyrenoidosa in culture medium was calculated using a previously reported equation xiong et al 2017a as follows p b a t a r a d a a a c 100 a t where a t is the initial concentration of smx added into the medium a r is the residual quantity of smx in the medium a d is the amount of smx adsorbed by microalgal cells a a is the amount of smx dissipated by abiotic processes and a c is the amount of smx accumulated in the microalgal cells the smx biodegradation kinetics of c pyrenoidosa were assessed according to the first order model as follows peng et al 2014 c t c 0 exp k t where c 0 is the initial concentration of smx at time zero c t is the concentration of smx at time t and k is the biodegradation rate constant d 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgal screening the dissipation capacity for smx 0 4 μm of the five microalgal strains p subcapitata s quadricauda s obliquus s acuminatus and c pyrenoidosa is listed in table s2 among the five species c pyrenoidosa showed the highest growth rate and dissipation efficiency for smx 14 9 0 22 fig 1 a and b consequently c pyrenoidosa was chosen for the subsequent biodegradation experiments in this study previous studies have demonstrated that chlorella genus has the potential to dissipate various kinds of xenobiotics gao et al 2011 song et al 2019 xiong et al 2017a zhou et al 2014 c vulgaris was found to be the most effective strain among six wild species for the biodegradation of 1 mg l levofloxacin xiong et al 2017a and chlorella sp l38 exhibited the potential for accelerating the dissipation of florfenicol from different water sources song et al 2019 it is surprising to find that s quadricauda achieved the highest dcw with 0 35 g l 1 after 11 days of cultivation whilst it showed the lowest smx dissipation among the five algal strains in the present study fig 1c these results suggested that cellular composition and structure rather than cell biomass would be responsible for the capability of freshwater algae to biodegrade organic pollutants gao et al 2011 besides metabolic and enzymatic activities should be taken into consideration however there is a complex enzyme system in microalgae the exact role of these enzymes in biodegradation requires further investigation xiong et al 2018 a non linear relationship between the initial biomass of microalgae and the corresponding dissipation efficiency of contaminants has been found in a previous study xiong et al 2017a therefore the effects of initial biomass on the dissipation efficiency of smx was investigated in the present study the dissipation efficiency of smx by c pyrenoidosa was enhanced with od680 ranged from 0 006 to 0 06 and then decreased with the increasing of od680 until 0 12 fig s1a thus the optimal initial biomass concentration for c pyrenoidosa was selected at od680 0 06 as it showed the highest dissipation efficiency fig s1a similar results have been found in the study by xiong et al 2017a where the dissipation efficiency of levofloxacin by c vulgaris decreased with the increasing of initial biomass concentration od680 2 0 3 0 and 5 0 the dcw of c pyrenoidosa increased with the increase of initial biomass concentration assessed by od680 values whereas the specific growth rate of c pyrenoidosa increased until od680 0 06 and then decreased with the increase of od680 figs s1b and s1c 3 2 enhancement effect of sodium acetate as the co metabolic substrate the addition of organic substrates or other nutrients has shown the potential for accelerating the biodegradation of antibiotics by microalgae xiong et al 2018 in the present study three organic substrates glucose 1 mm sodium formate 1 mm and sodium acetate 1 mm which had been proved to be easily biodegradable and thus frequently used as co substrate liang et al 2019 xiong et al 2017b were applied to evaluate their effects on the dissipation of smx by c pyrenoidosa the results indicated that the dissipation of smx significantly decreased p 0 05 with the addition of sodium formate fig 1d which was in accordance to those in a previous study that the dissipation of ciprofloxacin by chlamydomonas mexicana was inhibited with the addition of sodium formate xiong et al 2017b this negative effect could be related to the catabolite repression as sodium formate would inhibit the synthesis of enzymes involved in catabolism of carbon sources kurade et al 2011 the dissipation of smx by c pyrenoidosa was slightly increased from 12 6 to 14 9 in the treatment with glucose as co metabolic substrate whilst it significantly increased to 34 6 with sodium acetate as co metabolic substrate fig 1d moreover with the presence of sodium formate glucose and sodium acetate the dcw of c pyrenoidosa cultivated for 11 days was increased by 20 7 85 9 and 49 5 respectively fig 1e and f indicating that glucose was the best option for improving the growth of c pyrenoidosa it was possible that c pyrenoidosa preferred to consume readily degradable carbon source leading to increased algal growth in the presence of glucose without a corresponding increase in smx dissipation similar results have been observed in a previous study of pseudomonas aeruginosa larcher and yargeau 2012 the addition of an easily degradable carbon source such as glucose might result in competitive inhibition and consequently weakened the degradation of the target compound abtahi et al 2018 it should be noted that sodium acetate can not only serve as carbon source to sustain algal growth but also act as an electron donor for co metabolic degradation of the non growth substrate xiong et al 2017b 2018 as a result sodium acetate was selected as the co metabolic substrate for the degradation of smx in the subsequent experiment the dissipation of smx 0 4 μm was significantly p 0 05 promoted with addition of sodium acetate comparing to the control group 6 05 after 5 days of cultivation the dissipation rate of smx by c pyrenoidosa achieved to 36 1 89 1 93 1 98 8 and 99 3 at 1 2 3 4 and 8 mm of sodium acetate respectively fig 2 a as shown in table 1 an assumed first order reaction kinetic model was applied to explain the dissipation of smx 0 4 μm at different sodium acetate concentrations considering the lag phase the second day of cultivation was set as the initial day of degradation the apparent dissipation rate constant k and the half lives t1 2 of smx 0 4 μm at each concentration of sodium acetate ranged in 0 0107 0 9811 d 1 and 0 71 65 08 d respectively these results indicated that the dissipation of smx was increased with the dose of sodium acetate this was in agreement with the results of a previous study liang et al 2019 that the co metabolism of some pharmaceuticals such as venlafaxine tramadol and ciprofloxacin were dependent on the dose of carbon source in the present study the dissipation of smx by c pyrenoidosa was initiated on the second day during the cultivation for all treatments which may be related to the lag phenomenon in algal growth in a previous study an adaptation phase for microorganism was observed with the addition of high concentrations of xenobiotics leading to a lag phase or change of the kinetics el taliawy et al 2018 the maximum dissipation rate of smx occurred on the third day and subsequently the consumption of smx by c pyrenoidosa turned to slow down even reached a plateau on the 4th and 5th day with the treatment of 1 mm sodium acetate as shown in fig 2a and b a similar trend was found for the dissipation rate of smx and the growth rate of c pyrenoidosa implying their potential positive correlation however the specific growth rate and dcw of c pyrenoidosa were observed to be inhibited with a high concentration of sodium acetate 4 or 8 mm fig 2b and c liang et al 2019 found that the influence of acetate on the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals was dose and compound dependent inducing differences in some enzymes involved in the biodegradation however further research is still needed to reveal the complex co metabolism relationship between the dissipation of smx and dose of sodium acetate the mass balance of smx dissipation by c pyrenoidosa table 2 was calculated to reveal the potential enhancing mechanisms of sodium acetate including biodegradation bioaccumulation and bioadsorption xiong et al 2018 as shown in table 2 the dissipation of smx via abiotic processes was 4 08 this result was consistent with that found in a previous study in which insignificant dissipation of smx by s obliquus was found by abiotic processes xiong et al 2019b these observations suggested that the dissipation of smx from medium was mediated by the biotic processes of c pyrenoidosa based on the results that bioaccumulation was not observed in any group biomass uptake and biodegradation were supposed as the main dissipation mechanisms of smx in the present study generally biomass uptake consisted of an initial rapid and passive adsorption and subsequently slow active absorption wang et al 2018 however surface adsorption caused by c pyrenoidosa was accounted for only a small part in the dissipation of smx table 2 the amount of smx detected on the surface of c pyrenoidosa was not enough to compensate for the depletion of smx from culture medium meanwhile majority metabolites of smx fig 3 were detected in culture medium and varied over time during the 5 days of cultivation therefore it was postulated that biotransformation would be the main process responsible for the loss of smx in culture medium combining our results with those in previous studies wang et al 2018 it can be concluded that smx was adsorbed by c pyrenoidosa and then biotransformed into other metabolites which were subsequently released into medium 3 3 identified products and proposed transformation pathways potential transformation products tps of smx were identified based on the accurate mass to charge ratios m z and possible molecular formulas and their chemical structures were subsequently confirmed by the characteristic fragment ions the mass spectra information and proposed structures of smx and its main tps are summarized in table s3 while extracted ion chromatograms and the high resolution mass spectra are shown in fig s2 and fig s3 respectively to obtain more information about the actual biotransformation pathways the area time trends of smx and its tps are presented in fig 3 based on these results the transformation pathways for smx are proposed in fig 4 the algal transformation of smx was divided into two major pathways a α β γ δ and ε cleavage and b reactions of the amine group on the benzene ring including oxidation and hydroxylation as well as pterin related conjugation under the analytical conditions applied to the uplc qtof ms smx was detected at 7 360 min with the molecular ion m h of m z 254 0599 and exhibited characteristic fragmentation patterns of sulfonamide antibiotics consistent with a previous study huynh and reinhold 2019 three common characteristic product ions originating from the 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide moiety m z 92 0498 108 0446 and 156 0116 and additional product ions characteristic for smx m z 99 0555 were observed with 20 v collision energy in pathway a the cleavage of the s n bond was observed resulting in the generation of products tp157 4 amino benzenesulfinic acid 4absa and tp98 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole 3a5mi a previous study found that s atom of the sulfonamide group was the most vulnerable site which could be attacked to break down the functional groups yin et al 2017 similar tps were identified in the biodegradation of smx by s obliquus as reported in a previous study xiong et al 2019b 3a5mi was one of the most frequently detected tps in smx biodegradation chen and xie 2018 it was suggested that tp157 would further undergo a reaction from the loss of so2 group tp93 followed by addition of hydroxyl group on the benzene ring and then oxidation tp107 a similar pathway was proposed in the catalytic oxidation of smx by peroxymonosulfate activation bao et al 2019 a previous study indicated that formylation was one of the main biotransformation reactions of smx majewsky et al 2015 although formyl smx was not observed in the present study two related tps tp200 and tp137 were found with the cleavage of n c bond sulfanilamide would originate followed by the formylation of amine group to generate tp200 and tp137 might generate from tp200 with the cleavage of c s bond and subsequent oxidation as shown in fig 3a the abundance of tp107 tp98 tp93 and tp157 showed an increasing trend with the extending of cultivation time the abundance of tp200 increased rapidly in the first 2 days and then decreased whilst tp137 reached a top level on the third day implying the formation of tp137 from tp200 in pathway b tps marked in blue were mainly from the reaction of amine group on the benzene ring fig 4 the n atom on the benzene ring was the most susceptible sites to be attacked to form nitroso or nitro group adducted smx yin et al 2018 nitro smx tp283 was detected in the present study and an increasing trend for its abundance was observed with extension of cultivation time fig 3b however nitroso smx was absent in the present study implying further reactions might have occurred as nitroso smx might be further oxidized to generate tp299 nitroso dihydroxy smx via the substitution of hydrogen with hydroxyl group on the benzene ring tp254 hydroxy smx could be generated from smx by the substitution of amine group with hydroxyl group and subsequently into tp238 desamino smx via dehydroxylation smx could also be transformed into tp238 via deamination which has been found in the biodegradation of smx by ammonia oxidizing bacteria kassotaki et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that nitration nitrosation hydroxylation and deamination of the amine group on the benzene ring were the main biotransformation reactions for sulfonamides deng et al 2016 majewsky et al 2015 which was in line with the results in the present study as presented in fig 3b the four tps generated from the reactions of amine group on the benzene ring showed increasing trends from day 2 to the final sampling point moreover five conjugated tps marked in orange were identified in pathway b fig 4 tp429 m z 430 0923 rt 7 226 min was initially thought to be a glucuronide conjugation product while its ms2 spectrum could not correspond with the glucuronide conjugation found in arabidopsis thaliana cell dudley et al 2018 a second tp with m z 429 1086 tp428 rt 6 539 min exhibited fragments at m z 176 0651 267 0982 283 0930 331 0594 and 349 0723 under the collision energy of 20 v fig s2 which have been previously identified as characteristic fragments of a pterin smx conjugate richter et al 2013 stravs et al 2017 the tp429 pto smx could then be explained as a product of pterin smx where the primary amine has been transformed to a keto group the formation of pterin sulfonamide conjugates has been found in the biotransformation of sulfonamides with bacteria richter et al 2013 and microalgae stravs et al 2017 and even in activate sludge achermann et al 2018 which was relevant to the mode of action of sulfonamides sulfonamides act as inhibitors of dihydropteroate synthase dhps which catalyzes the formation of dihydropteroate from dihydropterin pyrophosphate and p aminobenzoic acid paba in addition to inhibiting dhps sulfonamides can also act as an alternative enzyme substrate promoting the formation pterin sulfonamide conjugates richter et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 another related product tp430 dihydropterin smx m z 431 1235 was observed at 6 332 min which was the dihydro form of pterin smx theoretically dihydropterin sulfonamides were originated during the enzymatic reaction between sulfonamides and dhps zhao et al 2016 in accordance with the studies of richter et al 2013 and stravs et al 2017 dihydropterin smx appeared prior to pterin smx and pto smx but disappeared before the final sampling point fig 3c with spiking of pterin sulfathiazole into activated sludge achermann et al 2018 further demonstrated the pathway of pterin related biotransformation from the present study and previous studies it revealed that pterin smx was the stable form of dihydropterin smx and it could lead to further formation of pto smx meanwhile another one pterin related conjugation tp hydroxy pterin smx tp446 m z 447 1210 rt 3 262 min was observed additionally tp592 eluted at a retention time of 7 004 with the accurate mass of m z 591 1651 with loss of one anhydroglucoe moiety during 20 v collision energy fragmentation revealing pterin smx and its five signature fragments consequently tp592 was determined to be a pterin glycosyl conjugate of smx which likely formed from pterin smx tp428 glycosylated metabolites have been commonly observed in plants as a detoxifying mechanism for xenobiotic exposed huynh and reinhold 2019 tps formed from glycosylate conjugation were also detected in the biotransformation of triclosan by three different microalgal species wang et al 2018 unlike the other three pterin related tps the abundance of tp446 and tp592 spiked on day 2 5 and subsequently disappeared as shown in fig 3c as shown in fig 4 biodegradation of smx might undergo phase i reactions including oxidation and hydroxylation reactions of the amine group which was followed by phase ii reactions through formylation and conjugation the metabolites generated from phase i reactions would increase the polarity and hydrophilicity of the xenobiotics and thus facilitate the excretion of the toxic compounds moreover products of phase i might conjugate with large and polar compounds e g sugars and amino acids in phase ii reactions to further increase the water solubility of xenobiotics dudley et al 2018 torres et al 2008 the formation of transformation products might be catalyzed by the species specific enzyme systems of algae for detoxification in response to the toxic pollutants wang et al 2018 the detoxification metabolisms carried out by cytochrome p450 cyp450 might be responsible for the biotransformation of xenobiotics torres et al 2008 some products were reported for the first time in the present study indicating different transformation mechanisms of smx by c pyrenoidosa in a co metabolic system though majority products detected in the present study have been frequently reported in previous studies compared to the study of xiong et al 2019b more tps were found in our study especially those from phase ii reactions the addition of sodium acetate might have effects on the parent compounds transformation products and transformation pathways liang et al 2019 metabolism of smx by microalgae stravs et al 2017 xiong et al 2019b and plants chen et al 2017 dudley et al 2018 huynh and reinhold 2019 has been reported in recent studies although accumulation of smx was universal results as to its metabolic fate in biota drastically differ huynh and reinhold 2019 for instance several metabolites of smx were observed in a thaliana cells dudley et al 2018 while no metabolites were detected in chinese cabbage and water spinach exposed to 100 μg ml smx chen et al 2017 in the present study accumulation of smx was not observed in algal cells and contributions from bioadsorption and abiotic processes accounted for a small part of smx loss thus biotransformation would be the main mechanism for the dissipation of smx in culture medium subsequently tps from phase i and ii reactions were observed in culture medium and varied with cultivation time which might be attributed to algal excretion similarly it was demonstrated that triclosan was adsorbed by algal cells then biotransformed into some metabolites and subsequently released into the medium wang et al 2018 based on these findings a growing body of evidence indicates that algal excretion of metabolites may be an additional defense mechanism against the toxicity of xenobiotics khan et al 2016 4 conclusions in this study c pyrenoidosa showed the highest capacity of smx dissipation among five green freshwater microalgae species the dissipation of smx was significantly enhanced with the addition of sodium acetate as co metabolic substrate it is concluded that biotransformation was the predominant mechanism for the depletion of smx by c pyrenoidosa the co metabolic pathway of smx by c pyrenoidosa was firstly proposed involving the breakdown of side chain reactions of the amine group on the benzene ring oxidation and hydroxylation and pterin related conjugation although no obviously adverse effects were observed on the growth of c pyrenoidosa the formation of pterin smx conjugation might potentially impair folate biosynthesis thus future studies are needed to investigate the fate and toxicity of transformation products of smx notes the authors declare no competing financial interest declaration of competing

18000,microalgae mediated biodegradation of antibiotics has recently gained increased attention from international scientific community however limited information is available regarding microalgae mediated biodegradation of smx in a co metabolic system here we investigated the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole smx by five algal species pseudokirchneriella subcapitata scenedesmus quadricauda scenedesmus obliquus scenedesmus acuminatus and chlorella pyrenoidosa and its transformation pathways by c pyrenoidosa in a sodium acetate 3 mm co metabolic system the results showed that the highest smx dissipation 14 9 was detected by c pyrenoidosa after 11 days of cultivation among the five tested algal species in the absence of other carbon sources the addition of sodium acetate 0 8 mm significantly enhanced the dissipation efficiency of smx 0 4 μm from 6 05 to 99 3 by c pyrenoidosa after 5 days of cultivation and the dissipation of smx followed the first order kinetic model with apparent rate constants k ranging from 0 0107 to 0 9811 d 1 based on the results of mass balance analysis biodegradation by c pyrenoidosa was the main mechanism for the dissipation of smx in the culture medium fifteen phase i and phase ii metabolites were identified and subsequently the transformation pathway was proposed including oxidation hydroxylation formylation and side chain breakdown as well as pterin related conjugation the majority of metabolites of smx were only observed in the culture medium and varied with cultivation time the findings of the present study showed effective co metabolism of a sulfonamide by microalgae and it may be applied in the aquatic environment remediation and wastewater treatment in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae antibiotic sulfamethoxazole co metabolism transformation products biodegradation 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx is one of the most widely used drugs for human and veterinary medicine due to its ability to inhibit bacteria and protozoa ying et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 following treatment in animals and human a considerable proportion of sulfonamides could be excreted with unchanged or metabolized forms through feces and urine due to their poor absorbability and degradability in vivo zhang et al 2015 the extensive application of smx and the low removal efficiency of smx in wastewater treatment plants wwtps has resulted in its frequent detection in surface water and groundwater with the concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l kummerer 2009 wang and wang 2018 the occurrence of smx in the aquatic environment could exhibit adverse effects on the growth of microorganisms aquatic plants and fish and even affect the structure and function of microbial communities boxall et al 2012 xiong et al 2019a moreover there is an increasing evidence showing that the residual smx would pose potential risks to human health by inducing the development and spread of antibiotic resistance he et al 2016 therefore it is of great importance to explore sustainable methods to remove smx from the aquatic environment previous studies revealed that the removal of sulfonamides by conventional activated sludge treatment in wwtps is usually incomplete chen and xie 2018 while biodegradation by pure bacteria isolated from activated sludge can enhance the dissipation of smx and some species can even completely mineralize smx wang and wang 2018 the main concern related to these approaches is the potential for bacteria to develop antibiotic resistance and transfer antibiotic resistance genes he et al 2016 recently microalgae mediated biodegradation has received scientific interests and is proved to be an ecofriendly effective and safe technology to remove antibiotics xiong et al 2018 it has been verified that mixotrophic microalgae have varied capacities to dissipate antibiotics from wastewater or synthetic wastewater through bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation processes xiong et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 in a recent study by xiong et al 2019b the removal kinetics of sulfamethazine smz and smx by s obliquus was investigated and the dissipation ratios for smz 1 mg l and smx 1 mg l were calculated as 15 7 and 29 3 respectively after 14 days of cultivation the removal efficiency of smx and triclosan by nannochloris sp was found to be 32 and 72 respectively bai and acharya 2016 our previous study has also found that four freshwater green microalgal species exhibited capacity for simultaneous removal of total nitrogen total phosphorus metals and some organic compounds in wastewater zhou et al 2014 furthermore recent studies have demonstrated that augmenting wastewater with organic substrates e g glucose and sodium acetate or other nutrient substrates e g nitrogen and phosphorus sources to form a co metabolic system would be an effective strategy to enhance the biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants lu et al 2019 xiong et al 2017b 2018 the biodegradation of ciprofloxacin by chlamydomonas mexicana was obviously increased from 13 to 56 with the addition of sodium acetate as co metabolic organic substrate xiong et al 2017b additional exogenous carbon glucose sodium acetate or methanol could also significantly accelerate the biodegradation of some acidic drugs e g diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen by pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 lu et al 2019 the additional organic substrates not only serve to sustain biomass production but also act as an electron donor for the co metabolism of the non growth substrate xiong et al 2018 to our knowledge however the co metabolism of smx by microalgae remains unknown so far moreover the transformation mechanism and proposed pathways of smx involved in the co metabolic system need to be further studied as it is essential to understand the environmental fate and the risk assessment of smx in the aquatic environment common freshwater green microalgae such as pseudokirchneriella subcapitata scenedesmus quadricauda scenedesmus obliquus scenedesmus acuminatus and chlorella pyrenoidosa have been employed for the removal of various contaminants considering their potential capability for removing various pollutants and potential use as feedstock for bioenergy production or other high value added products xiong et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 the objectives of this study were to test and compare five microalgal species as mentioned above for their capacity to dissipate smx and then to investigate degradation of smx with the selected algal species c pyrenoidosa under various co metabolic conditions the influence of sodium acetate as a co metabolic organic substrate on the dissipation of smx by c pyrenoidosa was further assessed and the intermediates of smx were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms and the possible transformation pathways of biodegradation were proposed 2

freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences the microalgal strains were individually inoculated in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 150 ml blue green medium bg11 amended with 1 ml microalgal suspension od680 1 in an illumination incubator for 10 days and under the following conditions 4000 lx 25 1 c 12 12 h light dark photoperiod and humidity 60 xiong et al 2019c to achieve the desired optical density od for further experiments the microalgal suspension cultivated for 10 days was diluted using sterilized bg11 with a visible spectrophotometer yoke instrument china 2 3 batch experiments 2 3 1 microalgal screening and optimization of initial biomass a pre experiment was conducted to screen five microalgal species p subcapitata s quadricauda s obliquus s acuminatus and c pyrenoidosa for their capacity of dissipating smx five microalgal species were respectively cultivated for 11 days in 250 ml capacity erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml sterilized bg11 amended with 1 ml microalgal suspension od680 1 and 0 4 μm smx subsequently the effects of the microalgal initial biomass different initial biomass with od680 of 0 006 0 012 0 018 0 06 and 0 12 on the dissipation of 0 4 μm smx were also investigated samples were collected on day 0 2 4 7 and 11 respectively 2 3 2 effects of organic substrates owing to its highest dissipation capacity for smx in the screening experiment c pyrenoidosa was selected in further experiments it was cultivated with an initial od680 of 0 06 to screen the most suitable organic substrate for the co metabolic biodegradation of smx the biodegradation of smx 0 4 μm was investigated in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml sterilized bg11 with the addition of glucose 1 mm sodium acetate 1 mm or sodium formate 1 mm for 11 days sodium acetate was selected for further experiments as it produced the highest dissipation of smx the dissipation of smx 0 4 μm exposed to different sodium acetate concentrations 0 1 2 3 4 and 8 mm was investigated in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml sterilized bg11 inoculated with the initial od680 of 0 06 all the flasks were incubated in an illumination incubator for microalgal cultivation the biodegradation kinetics experiments with the addition of sodium acetate were conducted for 5 d with sampling on every 0 5 d and all treatments were carried out in triplicate to assess the chemical effects on algal growth the biotic controls were conducted with absence of smx abiotic controls were also included with 0 4 μm smx but without algae in the medium under light and darkness conditions respectively to measure the abiotic losses photolysis and hydrolysis of the target compound from the culture medium 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 measurement of cell growth the dry cell weight dcw in each treatment was measured according to our previous study peng et al 2014 a linear correlation between od680 and dcw of c pyrenoidosa g l 1 was obtained as follows dcw 0 3781 o d 680 0 0021 r 2 0 9905 the specific growth rate μ was calculated using the following equation μ l n n t l n n 0 t t t 0 where n t is the dcw at time t t and n 0 is the dcw at the beginning of the test t 0 0 d 2 4 2 sampling and pretreatment exactly 2 ml microalgal suspension was sampled at each sampling time and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 5 min to separate microalgal cells and then 1 ml of the supernatant was filtered with a 0 22 syringe filter anpel laboratory technologies china for analysis of residual concentrations of smx in the bg11 medium meanwhile 50 ml microalgal sample was gathered to evaluate the bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation of smx by c pyrenoidosa the harvested microalgal cell pellets were re suspended in distilled water 2 ml and shaken for 2 min to obtain the smx absorbed on the cell walls xiong et al 2017a the sample solution was centrifuged again and the supernatant was recovered for analysis of the concentration of smx adsorbed onto the cell surface the rest cell pellets were frozen 20 c over night to breakdown the cell walls and then re suspended by adding 2 ml of dichloromethane methanol 1 2 v v followed by sonication for 20 min 40 khz 2 2 kw the extraction was repeated three times the supernatant recovered by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 5 min was used to determine the concentration of bioaccumulated smx by c pyrenoidosa biomass 2 4 3 instrumental analysis of smx and its transformation products the quantification of smx was achieved by using an agilent 1260 infinity lc system equipped with a diode array detector agilent technologies usa set at 270 nm and an agilent eclipse xdb c18 chromatographic column 150 4 6 mm 5 μm the mobile phase consisted of 60 40 water acidified by 0 1 formic acid acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the injection volume was 100 μl the transformation products for smx were identified by using an agilent 1290 infinity lc system equipped with an agilent 6545 quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer uplc qtof ms the injection volume was 3 μl separation was accomplished using an agilent eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 150 mm 1 8 μm a gradient program was used with two mobile phases a 0 1 formic acid in water b acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the gradient elution started with 10 b and increased to 20 b within 5 min and then increased to 25 b at 10 min followed by a linear gradient to 30 b at 15 min 40 b at 20 min and then back to the initial conditions 10 b for 5 min the agilent 6545 system was operated with dual ajs source in positive and negative electrospray ionization esi mode using the following operation parameters capillary voltage 3500 v esi 4000 v esi nebulizer

ms accurate mass spectra were recorded across the range 50 750 m z in both positive and negative ion mode samples were first screened using ms1 scan mode at a rate of 2 5 spectra s and then 4 spectra s for auto ms ms mode with three collision energy values 10 20 and 40 v for confirmation when ms ms spectra were missing additional injections in targeted ms ms mode with selected precursor ions were conducted to obtain fragmentation spectra for some metabolites the identification of transformation products can refer to baduel et al 2019 with details being presented in the supporting information text s1 2 5 data analysis in the present study all experiments were carried out in triplicate and samples were stored at 20 c prior to analysis one way analysis of variance anova with tukey kramer multiple comparison test was conducted to analyze statistical differences among data with graph pad prism 5 software p 0 05 the dissipation p b of smx by c pyrenoidosa in culture medium was calculated using a previously reported equation xiong et al 2017a as follows p b a t a r a d a a a c 100 a t where a t is the initial concentration of smx added into the medium a r is the residual quantity of smx in the medium a d is the amount of smx adsorbed by microalgal cells a a is the amount of smx dissipated by abiotic processes and a c is the amount of smx accumulated in the microalgal cells the smx biodegradation kinetics of c pyrenoidosa were assessed according to the first order model as follows peng et al 2014 c t c 0 exp k t where c 0 is the initial concentration of smx at time zero c t is the concentration of smx at time t and k is the biodegradation rate constant d 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgal screening the dissipation capacity for smx 0 4 μm of the five microalgal strains p subcapitata s quadricauda s obliquus s acuminatus and c pyrenoidosa is listed in table s2 among the five species c pyrenoidosa showed the highest growth rate and dissipation efficiency for smx 14 9 0 22 fig 1 a and b consequently c pyrenoidosa was chosen for the subsequent biodegradation experiments in this study previous studies have demonstrated that chlorella genus has the potential to dissipate various kinds of xenobiotics gao et al 2011 song et al 2019 xiong et al 2017a zhou et al 2014 c vulgaris was found to be the most effective strain among six wild species for the biodegradation of 1 mg l levofloxacin xiong et al 2017a and chlorella sp l38 exhibited the potential for accelerating the dissipation of florfenicol from different water sources song et al 2019 it is surprising to find that s quadricauda achieved the highest dcw with 0 35 g l 1 after 11 days of cultivation whilst it showed the lowest smx dissipation among the five algal strains in the present study fig 1c these results suggested that cellular composition and structure rather than cell biomass would be responsible for the capability of freshwater algae to biodegrade organic pollutants gao et al 2011 besides metabolic and enzymatic activities should be taken into consideration however there is a complex enzyme system in microalgae the exact role of these enzymes in biodegradation requires further investigation xiong et al 2018 a non linear relationship between the initial biomass of microalgae and the corresponding dissipation efficiency of contaminants has been found in a previous study xiong et al 2017a therefore the effects of initial biomass on the dissipation efficiency of smx was investigated in the present study the dissipation efficiency of smx by c pyrenoidosa was enhanced with od680 ranged from 0 006 to 0 06 and then decreased with the increasing of od680 until 0 12 fig s1a thus the optimal initial biomass concentration for c pyrenoidosa was selected at od680 0 06 as it showed the highest dissipation efficiency fig s1a similar results have been found in the study by xiong et al 2017a where the dissipation efficiency of levofloxacin by c vulgaris decreased with the increasing of initial biomass concentration od680 2 0 3 0 and 5 0 the dcw of c pyrenoidosa increased with the increase of initial biomass concentration assessed by od680 values whereas the specific growth rate of c pyrenoidosa increased until od680 0 06 and then decreased with the increase of od680 figs s1b and s1c 3 2 enhancement effect of sodium acetate as the co metabolic substrate the addition of organic substrates or other nutrients has shown the potential for accelerating the biodegradation of antibiotics by microalgae xiong et al 2018 in the present study three organic substrates glucose 1 mm sodium formate 1 mm and sodium acetate 1 mm which had been proved to be easily biodegradable and thus frequently used as co substrate liang et al 2019 xiong et al 2017b were applied to evaluate their effects on the dissipation of smx by c pyrenoidosa the results indicated that the dissipation of smx significantly decreased p 0 05 with the addition of sodium formate fig 1d which was in accordance to those in a previous study that the dissipation of ciprofloxacin by chlamydomonas mexicana was inhibited with the addition of sodium formate xiong et al 2017b this negative effect could be related to the catabolite repression as sodium formate would inhibit the synthesis of enzymes involved in catabolism of carbon sources kurade et al 2011 the dissipation of smx by c pyrenoidosa was slightly increased from 12 6 to 14 9 in the treatment with glucose as co metabolic substrate whilst it significantly increased to 34 6 with sodium acetate as co metabolic substrate fig 1d moreover with the presence of sodium formate glucose and sodium acetate the dcw of c pyrenoidosa cultivated for 11 days was increased by 20 7 85 9 and 49 5 respectively fig 1e and f indicating that glucose was the best option for improving the growth of c pyrenoidosa it was possible that c pyrenoidosa preferred to consume readily degradable carbon source leading to increased algal growth in the presence of glucose without a corresponding increase in smx dissipation similar results have been observed in a previous study of pseudomonas aeruginosa larcher and yargeau 2012 the addition of an easily degradable carbon source such as glucose might result in competitive inhibition and consequently weakened the degradation of the target compound abtahi et al 2018 it should be noted that sodium acetate can not only serve as carbon source to sustain algal growth but also act as an electron donor for co metabolic degradation of the non growth substrate xiong et al 2017b 2018 as a result sodium acetate was selected as the co metabolic substrate for the degradation of smx in the subsequent experiment the dissipation of smx 0 4 μm was significantly p 0 05 promoted with addition of sodium acetate comparing to the control group 6 05 after 5 days of cultivation the dissipation rate of smx by c pyrenoidosa achieved to 36 1 89 1 93 1 98 8 and 99 3 at 1 2 3 4 and 8 mm of sodium acetate respectively fig 2 a as shown in table 1 an assumed first order reaction kinetic model was applied to explain the dissipation of smx 0 4 μm at different sodium acetate concentrations considering the lag phase the second day of cultivation was set as the initial day of degradation the apparent dissipation rate constant k and the half lives t1 2 of smx 0 4 μm at each concentration of sodium acetate ranged in 0 0107 0 9811 d 1 and 0 71 65 08 d respectively these results indicated that the dissipation of smx was increased with the dose of sodium acetate this was in agreement with the results of a previous study liang et al 2019 that the co metabolism of some pharmaceuticals such as venlafaxine tramadol and ciprofloxacin were dependent on the dose of carbon source in the present study the dissipation of smx by c pyrenoidosa was initiated on the second day during the cultivation for all treatments which may be related to the lag phenomenon in algal growth in a previous study an adaptation phase for microorganism was observed with the addition of high concentrations of xenobiotics leading to a lag phase or change of the kinetics el taliawy et al 2018 the maximum dissipation rate of smx occurred on the third day and subsequently the consumption of smx by c pyrenoidosa turned to slow down even reached a plateau on the 4th and 5th day with the treatment of 1 mm sodium acetate as shown in fig 2a and b a similar trend was found for the dissipation rate of smx and the growth rate of c pyrenoidosa implying their potential positive correlation however the specific growth rate and dcw of c pyrenoidosa were observed to be inhibited with a high concentration of sodium acetate 4 or 8 mm fig 2b and c liang et al 2019 found that the influence of acetate on the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals was dose and compound dependent inducing differences in some enzymes involved in the biodegradation however further research is still needed to reveal the complex co metabolism relationship between the dissipation of smx and dose of sodium acetate the mass balance of smx dissipation by c pyrenoidosa table 2 was calculated to reveal the potential enhancing mechanisms of sodium acetate including biodegradation bioaccumulation and bioadsorption xiong et al 2018 as shown in table 2 the dissipation of smx via abiotic processes was 4 08 this result was consistent with that found in a previous study in which insignificant dissipation of smx by s obliquus was found by abiotic processes xiong et al 2019b these observations suggested that the dissipation of smx from medium was mediated by the biotic processes of c pyrenoidosa based on the results that bioaccumulation was not observed in any group biomass uptake and biodegradation were supposed as the main dissipation mechanisms of smx in the present study generally biomass uptake consisted of an initial rapid and passive adsorption and subsequently slow active absorption wang et al 2018 however surface adsorption caused by c pyrenoidosa was accounted for only a small part in the dissipation of smx table 2 the amount of smx detected on the surface of c pyrenoidosa was not enough to compensate for the depletion of smx from culture medium meanwhile majority metabolites of smx fig 3 were detected in culture medium and varied over time during the 5 days of cultivation therefore it was postulated that biotransformation would be the main process responsible for the loss of smx in culture medium combining our results with those in previous studies wang et al 2018 it can be concluded that smx was adsorbed by c pyrenoidosa and then biotransformed into other metabolites which were subsequently released into medium 3 3 identified products and proposed transformation pathways potential transformation products tps of smx were identified based on the accurate mass to charge ratios m z and possible molecular formulas and their chemical structures were subsequently confirmed by the characteristic fragment ions the mass spectra information and proposed structures of smx and its main tps are summarized in table s3 while extracted ion chromatograms and the high resolution mass spectra are shown in fig s2 and fig s3 respectively to obtain more information about the actual biotransformation pathways the area time trends of smx and its tps are presented in fig 3 based on these results the transformation pathways for smx are proposed in fig 4 the algal transformation of smx was divided into two major pathways a α β γ δ and ε cleavage and b reactions of the amine group on the benzene ring including oxidation and hydroxylation as well as pterin related conjugation under the analytical conditions applied to the uplc qtof ms smx was detected at 7 360 min with the molecular ion m h of m z 254 0599 and exhibited characteristic fragmentation patterns of sulfonamide antibiotics consistent with a previous study huynh and reinhold 2019 three common characteristic product ions originating from the 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide moiety m z 92 0498 108 0446 and 156 0116 and additional product ions characteristic for smx m z 99 0555 were observed with 20 v collision energy in pathway a the cleavage of the s n bond was observed resulting in the generation of products tp157 4 amino benzenesulfinic acid 4absa and tp98 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole 3a5mi a previous study found that s atom of the sulfonamide group was the most vulnerable site which could be attacked to break down the functional groups yin et al 2017 similar tps were identified in the biodegradation of smx by s obliquus as reported in a previous study xiong et al 2019b 3a5mi was one of the most frequently detected tps in smx biodegradation chen and xie 2018 it was suggested that tp157 would further undergo a reaction from the loss of so2 group tp93 followed by addition of hydroxyl group on the benzene ring and then oxidation tp107 a similar pathway was proposed in the catalytic oxidation of smx by peroxymonosulfate activation bao et al 2019 a previous study indicated that formylation was one of the main biotransformation reactions of smx majewsky et al 2015 although formyl smx was not observed in the present study two related tps tp200 and tp137 were found with the cleavage of n c bond sulfanilamide would originate followed by the formylation of amine group to generate tp200 and tp137 might generate from tp200 with the cleavage of c s bond and subsequent oxidation as shown in fig 3a the abundance of tp107 tp98 tp93 and tp157 showed an increasing trend with the extending of cultivation time the abundance of tp200 increased rapidly in the first 2 days and then decreased whilst tp137 reached a top level on the third day implying the formation of tp137 from tp200 in pathway b tps marked in blue were mainly from the reaction of amine group on the benzene ring fig 4 the n atom on the benzene ring was the most susceptible sites to be attacked to form nitroso or nitro group adducted smx yin et al 2018 nitro smx tp283 was detected in the present study and an increasing trend for its abundance was observed with extension of cultivation time fig 3b however nitroso smx was absent in the present study implying further reactions might have occurred as nitroso smx might be further oxidized to generate tp299 nitroso dihydroxy smx via the substitution of hydrogen with hydroxyl group on the benzene ring tp254 hydroxy smx could be generated from smx by the substitution of amine group with hydroxyl group and subsequently into tp238 desamino smx via dehydroxylation smx could also be transformed into tp238 via deamination which has been found in the biodegradation of smx by ammonia oxidizing bacteria kassotaki et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that nitration nitrosation hydroxylation and deamination of the amine group on the benzene ring were the main biotransformation reactions for sulfonamides deng et al 2016 majewsky et al 2015 which was in line with the results in the present study as presented in fig 3b the four tps generated from the reactions of amine group on the benzene ring showed increasing trends from day 2 to the final sampling point moreover five conjugated tps marked in orange were identified in pathway b fig 4 tp429 m z 430 0923 rt 7 226 min was initially thought to be a glucuronide conjugation product while its ms2 spectrum could not correspond with the glucuronide conjugation found in arabidopsis thaliana cell dudley et al 2018 a second tp with m z 429 1086 tp428 rt 6 539 min exhibited fragments at m z 176 0651 267 0982 283 0930 331 0594 and 349 0723 under the collision energy of 20 v fig s2 which have been previously identified as characteristic fragments of a pterin smx conjugate richter et al 2013 stravs et al 2017 the tp429 pto smx could then be explained as a product of pterin smx where the primary amine has been transformed to a keto group the formation of pterin sulfonamide conjugates has been found in the biotransformation of sulfonamides with bacteria richter et al 2013 and microalgae stravs et al 2017 and even in activate sludge achermann et al 2018 which was relevant to the mode of action of sulfonamides sulfonamides act as inhibitors of dihydropteroate synthase dhps which catalyzes the formation of dihydropteroate from dihydropterin pyrophosphate and p aminobenzoic acid paba in addition to inhibiting dhps sulfonamides can also act as an alternative enzyme substrate promoting the formation pterin sulfonamide conjugates richter et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 another related product tp430 dihydropterin smx m z 431 1235 was observed at 6 332 min which was the dihydro form of pterin smx theoretically dihydropterin sulfonamides were originated during the enzymatic reaction between sulfonamides and dhps zhao et al 2016 in accordance with the studies of richter et al 2013 and stravs et al 2017 dihydropterin smx appeared prior to pterin smx and pto smx but disappeared before the final sampling point fig 3c with spiking of pterin sulfathiazole into activated sludge achermann et al 2018 further demonstrated the pathway of pterin related biotransformation from the present study and previous studies it revealed that pterin smx was the stable form of dihydropterin smx and it could lead to further formation of pto smx meanwhile another one pterin related conjugation tp hydroxy pterin smx tp446 m z 447 1210 rt 3 262 min was observed additionally tp592 eluted at a retention time of 7 004 with the accurate mass of m z 591 1651 with loss of one anhydroglucoe moiety during 20 v collision energy fragmentation revealing pterin smx and its five signature fragments consequently tp592 was determined to be a pterin glycosyl conjugate of smx which likely formed from pterin smx tp428 glycosylated metabolites have been commonly observed in plants as a detoxifying mechanism for xenobiotic exposed huynh and reinhold 2019 tps formed from glycosylate conjugation were also detected in the biotransformation of triclosan by three different microalgal species wang et al 2018 unlike the other three pterin related tps the abundance of tp446 and tp592 spiked on day 2 5 and subsequently disappeared as shown in fig 3c as shown in fig 4 biodegradation of smx might undergo phase i reactions including oxidation and hydroxylation reactions of the amine group which was followed by phase ii reactions through formylation and conjugation the metabolites generated from phase i reactions would increase the polarity and hydrophilicity of the xenobiotics and thus facilitate the excretion of the toxic compounds moreover products of phase i might conjugate with large and polar compounds e g sugars and amino acids in phase ii reactions to further increase the water solubility of xenobiotics dudley et al 2018 torres et al 2008 the formation of transformation products might be catalyzed by the species specific enzyme systems of algae for detoxification in response to the toxic pollutants wang et al 2018 the detoxification metabolisms carried out by cytochrome p450 cyp450 might be responsible for the biotransformation of xenobiotics torres et al 2008 some products were reported for the first time in the present study indicating different transformation mechanisms of smx by c pyrenoidosa in a co metabolic system though majority products detected in the present study have been frequently reported in previous studies compared to the study of xiong et al 2019b more tps were found in our study especially those from phase ii reactions the addition of sodium acetate might have effects on the parent compounds transformation products and transformation pathways liang et al 2019 metabolism of smx by microalgae stravs et al 2017 xiong et al 2019b and plants chen et al 2017 dudley et al 2018 huynh and reinhold 2019 has been reported in recent studies although accumulation of smx was universal results as to its metabolic fate in biota drastically differ huynh and reinhold 2019 for instance several metabolites of smx were observed in a thaliana cells dudley et al 2018 while no metabolites were detected in chinese cabbage and water spinach exposed to 100 μg ml smx chen et al 2017 in the present study accumulation of smx was not observed in algal cells and contributions from bioadsorption and abiotic processes accounted for a small part of smx loss thus biotransformation would be the main mechanism for the dissipation of smx in culture medium subsequently tps from phase i and ii reactions were observed in culture medium and varied with cultivation time which might be attributed to algal excretion similarly it was demonstrated that triclosan was adsorbed by algal cells then biotransformed into some metabolites and subsequently released into the medium wang et al 2018 based on these findings a growing body of evidence indicates that algal excretion of metabolites may be an additional defense mechanism against the toxicity of xenobiotics khan et al 2016 4 conclusions in this study c pyrenoidosa showed the highest capacity of smx dissipation among five green freshwater microalgae species the dissipation of smx was significantly enhanced with the addition of sodium acetate as co metabolic substrate it is concluded that biotransformation was the predominant mechanism for the depletion of smx by c pyrenoidosa the co metabolic pathway of smx by c pyrenoidosa was firstly proposed involving the breakdown of side chain reactions of the amine group on the benzene ring oxidation and hydroxylation and pterin related conjugation although no obviously adverse effects were observed on the growth of c pyrenoidosa the formation of pterin smx conjugation might potentially impair folate biosynthesis thus future studies are needed to investigate the fate and toxicity of transformation products of smx notes the authors declare no competing financial interest declaration of competing

18001,the effective removal of organophosphorus compounds ops effectively from water environment remains an important but challenging task in this study a resin based nanocomposite of hydrated iron oxide hd1 was used as fenton like catalyst for effectively catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to degrade tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep the results showed that hd1 was successfully prepared which had great versatility catalytic performance and adsorption capacity besides hd1 h2o2 was capable of degrading tcep completely with less than 0 2 mg l of inorganic phosphorus ip in the effluent at the initial tcep of 38 mg l ph 4 h2o2 dosage of 20 mm and the k obs could result in about 1 0530 min 1 under identical conditions more attractively inorganic ions i e clˉ co3 2ˉ so4 2ˉ no3ˉ hco3ˉ ca2 and mg2 exhibited moderate effect on tcep degradation the negative effect of natural organic matters nom i e ha on the degradation of tcep was responsible for competition for the active oxygen species combined with electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and other analytical methods and radical quenching experiments the possible removal process of tcep was discussed including two processes of oxidative degradation and immobilization of ip besides hydroxyl radicals oh was the key active species that contributed to tcep degradation through hydroxylation oxidation and c o bond cracking and specificity adsorption of hfo on ip was revealed furthermore the results showed that hd1 had desirable acid and alkali resistance in the continuous running fixed bed column experiment hd1 showed a satisfactory performance in cycle operations this work proposed a new enhanced process for removing tcep in water environment by hd1 h2o2 and the multi functional material hd1 was promising in treatment of water containing organic phosphorus pollutants this will be believed that this study will provide new ideas and new materials for the treatment of organic phosphorus based organic pollutants and lay the foundation for further deepening and expanding the application of adsorption resins in the field of water pollution control graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton like catalytic oxidation tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate adsorption inorganic phosphorus 1 introduction organophosphorus flame retardants opfrs are rapidly growing as important alternatives to brominated flame retardants moser et al 2015 as a typical opfr organophosphorus compounds ops are widely used in building materials chemicals upholstered furniture electronics and other industries lian et al 2019 wei et al 2015 for example tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep is widely used as a flame retardant and plasticizer for rigid polyurethane foams in china and other developing countries grieco and ramarao 2013 the annual use of ops is estimated to reach tens of thousands of tons and its presence in urban sewage river water groundwater and drinking water range from several thousands to tens of thousands ng l ren et al 2019 previous reports state that ops detected in various environmental media and human bodies threaten human health and environmental systems fabianska et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 therefore solving the environmental pollution problem caused by ops is necessary most of the detected ops were stable especially if the biodegradability of chlorinated substances is poor wang et al 2018 conventional water treatments physical membrane separation and biochemical methods often fail to achieve effective removal therefore the development of effective pollution control for opfrs is important as an in situ chemical oxidation technology advanced oxidation processes have been widely used to remove stubborn organic pollutants in wastewater including ozonation votruba 2013 ultraviolet uv and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 watts and linden 2008 and fenton oxidation pignatello et al 2006 the ozone oxidation process is slow and has difficulty in achieving the complete mineralization of contaminants ozone oxidation can only partially remove chlorinated organic compounds even at high ozone doses e g tcep nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 yuan et al 2015 the degradation effect of tcep in the uv h2o2 system with high oh production is consistent with that of the ozonation process and both have relatively poor reactivity to chlorinated ops in addition the photocatalytic oxidation technology is still in the laboratory research scale and thus its practical application is insufficient cristale et al 2016 h2o2 activation of with fenton s reagent fe ii produces high standard reduction potential of oh e0 2 8 v which has been widely used in soil remediation and groundwater treatment however this method highly depends on ph easily produces a considerable amount of iron mud and increases the inefficiency and cost of wastewater treatments hasan et al 2012 pan et al 2019 the purification of ops in water remains restricted by factors such as a narrow ph range large amount of mud production and or energy intensiveness the heterogeneous fenton system not only improves the ph critical requirements and secondary pollution of the traditional fenton method but also presents the advantage of mineralizing organic pollutants into inorganic substances bokare and choi 2014 dutta et al 2001 although the oxidation of ops into inorganic phosphorus ip can improve the removal efficiency of op pollutants in the entire system excessive ip in water can still cause environmental problems such as eutrophication peräniemi et al 1992 rott et al 2017 therefore the removal of residual ip through subsequent treatments such as adsorption and fe iii coagulation is necessary and undoubtedly increases the complexity of op removal you et al 2018 as such economically and conveniently enhancing the removal of ops in water is a difficult problem at present researchers have proposed various methods for removing ip in water bodies of which adsorption is one of the most widely used mullan et al 2006 wilsenach et al 2007 the core of adsorption technology lies in the development of adsorbents iron hydrogen oxide hfo exhibits high selectivity to anionic contaminants through ligand exchanges due to the rich hydroxyl groups such as phosphates and arsenates on the surface li et al 2016a miao et al 2014 however this separation treatment is difficult to implement thereby limiting its application an effective method is the hfo loading in or on a large sized solid carrier to obtain a composite adsorbent resin is an ideal carrier for nanocomposite adsorbents e g hfo due to its good mechanical strength surface chemistry and adjustable pore structure cai et al 2016 pan et al 2012 in addition hfo is widely used in fenton like systems qian et al 2017 shuai et al 2019b hfo activates h2o2 and the formation of feii eq 1 and 2 and then generates a large amount of oh eq 3 to degrade organic pollutants given that h eq 1 and 2 can be formed during the reaction the initial ph requirements of the reaction are not critical thus compared with fe ii h2o2 hfo h2o2 can exhibit excellent oxidation performance over a wider ph range wang et al 2016 h2o2 reaction with feii eq 3 is beneficial to the recycling of feii feiii and reduces the production of iron mud barreiro et al 2007 matta et al 2007 moreover a large amount of accumulated iron ions may be converted into hfo to adsorb ip with the high efficiency of interception filtration and donnan membrane effect the resin can pre enrich the contaminants and improve the process and efficiency of the hfo based fenton like oxidation reaction shan et al 2019 zhang et al 2008a therefore the resin based nanocomposite adsorbent combines the unique adsorption properties of metal hydrogen oxides with phosphates and the excellent hydraulic and mechanical properties of host materials on the basis of the immobilization of nano adsorbents the adsorption capacity of composites and catalytic properties of hfo are applied in the fenton like system the realization of an adsorbent of multifunctional environment nanocomposite under nanoconfinement has practical value in the purification of ops in water bodies 1 f e i i i h 2 o 2 f e i i i h 2 o 2 2 f e i i i h 2 o 2 f e i i o 2 2 h 3 f e i i h 2 o 2 f e i i i o h o h 4 o h t c e p o x i d a t i o n p r o d u c t s therefore this study uses tcep which is a typical opfr as the treatment target tcep is removed using the nanocomposite hd1 in a fenton like system which presents the advantages of wide ph range and low yield of iron containing chemical sludge in this system the active component hfo on the surface of the multifunctional nanocomposite hd1 can catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 to form oh and op pollutants are degraded into ip thereby realizing the complete mineralization of pollutants eq 4 however the environmental problems caused by ip cannot be ignored therefore the dual function of the host d201 and hfo nanoparticles can be used to immobilize ip in the same system and effectively avoid secondary pollution in the hd1 h2o2 system the purification of op containing wastewater is enhanced in one step and therefore increases efficiency in addition the heterogeneous material hd1 has the following advantages 1 easy to recycle and reuse 2 expected to reduce the dosage of catalysts and the production of iron containing chemical sludge in wastewater treatment 3 reduces the additional disposal cost of sludge treatment 4 effectively reduces operating costs and 5 has good application prospects in this study macroporous anion exchange resin d201 is used as the carrier for hfo to synthesize hd1 nanocomposites and serve as a fenton like catalyst to degrade tcep first the physical and chemical properties of hd1 are analyzed second the effects of key factors such as ph0 and h2o2 dosages and coexisting substances on the degradation of tcep using hd1 h2o2 are systematically investigated besides the potential removal mechanism of tcep via hd1 h2o2 including the identification of major reactive free radicals and the degradation pathway of tecp is also explored finally the system reusability and preliminary application in simulating actual wastewater are studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials types and sources of materials were provided in the supporting materials text s1 2 2 hd1 preparation before use the d201 beads which are a new strong alkaline anion exchange resin were first soaked in 4 naoh solution for 5 h and then in deionized water until the ph was almost neutral then the beads were soaked for 5 h with 5 hcl solution rinsed with distilled water until the ph was approximately 6 and finally dried at 333 k the main steps for resin based nanocomposites hd1 preparation were based on other studies pan et al 2009 yang et al 2015 some preparation steps were reasonably adjusted in brief the pretreated d201 beads were placed in a ternary fecl3 hcl nacl mixed solution 1 5 m fecl3 1 0 m hcl and 2 0 m nacl and electrically stirred at 303 k for 24 h the resin was separated via filtration rapidly immersed in a naoh nacl mixed solution 1 m naoh and 0 6 m nacl and electrically stirred at 303 k for 24 h fecl4ˉ was preloaded on d201 and converted to fe oh 3 with in situ precipitation under alkaline conditions finally the synthetic material was washed with deionized water until the effluent was neutral the hd1 beads were dried at 333 k for 12 h and stored in sealed brown glass vials 2 3 catalytic oxidation experiment via hd1 h2o2 all the experimental data of catalytic oxidation were analyzed in three parallel groups except for fixed bed column experiments the experimental data obtained in this study were reliable firstly 400 mg of the catalyst hd1 was placed in an erlenmeyer flask containing 200 ml of a certain concentration of tcep c0 38 mg l tp 4 mg l and then 0 40 mm h2o2 was mixed into the reaction flask the mixture was shaken at 250 rpm at a constant temperature 298 k for 4 h in a thermostatic shaker thermo shka 4000 6c usa quantitative etoh was only used to remove the unreacted reactive oxygen species in the experiment and was added during the specified sampling interval to remove the generated hydroxyl radicals the effects of different reaction systems initial ph and h2o2 concentration on the degradation of tcep were investigated and the dissolution of iron after reaction at different initial ph was monitored at the same time the pseudo first order kinetic model was used to fit the degradation of tcep under different ph0 and h2o2 concentrations the k obs value was obtained via the linear regression of ln c c 0 versus t under different conditions eq 5 5 ln c c 0 k o b s t where c 0 mg l represents the initial concentration of tcep at t 0 0 c mg l denotes the concentration of tcep at time t the proportional coefficient k obs min 1 refers to the reaction rate constant k obs 0 t min indicates the reaction time the ph of the reaction solution was adjusted with 0 1 m naoh and hcl solution the effects of other common competing substances in actual water environment on the purification of tcep were investigated by adding mgcl2 cacl2 nacl nano3 na2so4 na2co3 and nahco3 to the reaction flask the introduced magnesium calcium concentration 0 120 mg l and chloride nitrate sulfate carbonate bicarbonate concentration 0 4 mm acted as the competitive ion and ha concentration 0 40 mg l represented a natural organic matter besides the decomposition efficiency and kinetics of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ha were investigated the concentration of h2o2 was determined by spectrophotometric determinate method with titanium oxalate which has low detection limit and high sensitivity the maximum absorption wavelength was 430 nm tcep was quantified through the liquid phase tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms2 tsq quanyum thermo fisher usa before applying mass spectrometry the sample was separated by liquid phase lc 30ad using a water based c18 column 2 1 mm 150 mm the column temperature was maintained at 40 c liquid mobile phase of a 0 1 formic acid ultrapure aqueous solution and b acetonitrile other specific operating parameters can be referenced ou et al 2017 xu et al 2017 amounts of ip and total phosphorus tp in the reaction solution were determined using mo sb ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu japan the total organic carbon toc in the degradation of tcep was determined using an analyzer toc l shimadzu japan in the experiment different dosages of etoh and tba 0 40 mm were added as quenchers and preferentially reacted with free radicals to achieve quenching dmpo 10 mm was added to the reaction solution to capture the generated free radicals and the resonance signal was detected by using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr emx microx bruker germany epr spectrometer operating conditions microwave frequency of 9 83 ghz microwave power of 25 18 mw modulation frequency of 100 khz modulation amplitude of 1 g sweep width of 200 g and time constant of 40 96 ms in the continuous regeneration and reuse experiments the reacted hd1 beads were stirred with a binary mixed solution 5 wt naoh nacl at 273 k for 4 h washed twice in etoh and deionized water and recycled 10 times the stability experiment of hd1 was an important indicator on its application to actual scenarios hd1 500 mg was added to the deionized water 250 ml at ph 1 and ph 13 and allowed to stand at normal temperature sampling was performed at specified times 6 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 and 96 h to determine the concentration of iron ions in the solution the solubility of metal iron in an acid or alkali solution mg g as an index to evaluate hd1 resistance the concentration of iron ions in the solution was determined via spectrometry of flame atomic absorption z 8000 hitachi japan the fixed bed column experiments were carried out in glass columns 30 mm diameter 130 mm length with water bath to maintain the temperature at 298 k firstly a column was filled with 5 ml wet hd1 and the mixed feed solution containing tcep tp 2 mg l and other coexisting substances clˉ no3ˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ ha ca2 mg2 were added from the top of the fixed bed h2o2 was added from the top of the bed in a separate line the initial solution flowed down at a constant feeding rate of 6 bv h and thereby the empty bed contact time ebct was maintained at 10 min by using a peristaltic pump bt01 40 lange china the effluent samples were collected by an automatic sampler after exceeding the breakthrough point the used hd1 was regenerated with a binary 5 wt naoh nacl solution as the eluent ebct 60 min and deionized water in sequence until the ph of effluent reached near neutrality and then subjected to the next cycle column experiment secondly in order to further investigate the application performance of hd1 in the actual wastewater environment the actual effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in nanjing was selected as the feed solvent some water quality indicators of the actual wastewater were shown in the related figures other hydraulic conditions were as described above 2 4 characterization of materials and analysis of water matrix characterization of materials and analysis methods of water matrix were provided in the supporting materials text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 hd1 characterization table s1 lists the physical and chemical properties of d201 and hd1 and fig 1 shows certain features by comparing fig 1 a and b the color of the resin beads changed from white to dark brown due to the hfo loading the surface profile of d201 beads was smooth and the surface of hd1 remained unchanged as shown in fig 2 a and b the fe load on hd1 was 9 8 the average pore diameter of the material before and after modification decreased from 3 49 nm to 2 98 nm and the average pore size of hd1 was reduced due to the partial pore blockage caused by hfo loading the latter result was further confirmed by the comparison of sem images before and after loading fig 2 d and e the hfo nanoparticles with large specific surface areas might increase the total specific surface area of the composite hd1 pan et al 2009 in this study the specific surface area of the host d201 increased from 14 55 m2 g to 29 08 m2 g of hd1 the fe sem eds scan of the hd1 cross section showed that most of the hfo was distributed in the outer region of the sphere fig 2 c which might be beneficial to the adsorption of anionic pollutants zhang et al 2016 according to the xrd pattern fig 1 c both d201 and hd1 have amorphous structures compared with goethite and hematite amorphous hfo may be more beneficial to the adsorption of phosphate and arsenate zhang et al 2008b to further determine the chemical form of iron loaded on hd1 xps was performed and the results are shown in fig 1 d and e the full spectrum analysis of hd1 showed that fe o c and n were the main elemental compositions this finding indicated the effectiveness of the abovementioned method for preparing hd1 fe 2p was divided into two peaks at 711 0 ev and 724 6 ev which corresponded to the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 and indicated the existence of fe iii caused by the hfo loaded on hd1 bukhtiyarova et al 2000 li et al 2016b 3 2 degradation effect of tcep using hd1 h2o2 3 2 1 effect of fenton like catalysts on the degradation of tcep fig 3 shows the effect of different oxidation systems on the degradation of tcep the removal efficiency of tcep using d201 or hd1 was less than 2 after introducing h2o2 into both systems the degradation efficiency of tcep increased in varying degrees the removal efficiency of tcep with d201 h2o2 increased to 15 which was similar to the effect of removing tcep via h2o2 by contrast the degradation efficiency of tcep using hd1 h2o2 obviously improved and the removal efficiency reached 95 5 after 4 h the surface of the styrene ion exchange resin d201 covered a large number of positively charged groups quaternary amine groups and the modified hd1 surface was rich in hfo nanoparticles the amine group could bind to the anion in the solution and undergo ion exchange and the hd1 surface could specifically bind to several anions the d201 and hd1 materials clearly failed to remove molecular tcep besides d201 could not activate h2o2 therefore both systems of d201 h2o2 and h2o2 showed poor removal efficiency of tcep because h2o2 in the system could only produce a small amount of hydroxyl radicals through self decomposition and the structure of a very small amount of pollutants was destroyed however the introduction of hd1 greatly improved the efficiency to almost complete degradation of tcep this finding indicated that hfo support on d201 could effectively activate h2o2 to produce oh and efficiently degrade the pollutants thus hfo was crucial in this catalytic degradation process ip in the effluent of each oxidation system is shown in fig s1 the residual ip in both systems of only d201 and only hd1 was less than 0 01 mg l indicating that almost no ip was available in the liquid phase the absence of oxidants further confirmed that d201 and hd1 themselves could not destroy the chemical structure of tcep which still existed in the liquid phase in stable molecular form and thus further indicating ineffective degradation the residual ip in the systems of only h2o2 and hd1 h2o2 were 0 03 and 0 16 mg l respectively by comparison residual phosphate in the hd1 h2o2 system clearly increased which further confirmed that h2o2 could be effectively activated using hd1 to form oh to degrade tcep to ip despite the increase of ip generated the total concentration of ip remained at a low level 0 2 mg l likely because the conversion of tcep to ip was accompanied with the adsorption of ip via hd1 these findings show that hd1 played an important role in the catalytic degradation of tcep and the adsorption process of ip in the fenton like system 3 2 2 effect of initial ph on the degradation of tcep according to the haber weiss cycle the key to the oxidative degradation reaction involved in the liquid phase interface is oh for which ph has an important influence on the production haber et al 1934 therefore the effects of different initial ph values 3 4 5 6 7 9 on the degradation of tcep were investigated fig 4 a showed the results and fig 4 b showed the trend of k obs under different conditions the degradation of tcep was optimal at ph 4 0 degradation efficiency was 95 5 and k obs was 1 0530 min 1 fig 4 a and b ph increased or decreased affected the degradation efficiency and rate of tcep in varying degrees when the ph was lower than 4 0 the degradation efficiency of tcep declined by 30 and k obs decreased to 0 4164 min 1 as the ph gradually increased the degradation of tcep was markedly inhibited and the removal efficiency decreased from 95 ph 4 to 58 ph 9 this result corresponded to the k obs reduction from 1 0532 min 1 to 0 3586 min 1 respectively in this study when ph was equal to 4 0 k obs clearly reached the maximum along with the highest degradation rate and when the ph increased from 4 to 9 the k obs value reduced three times with the decline in tcep degradation efficiency in addition the amount of iron dissolution under different ph conditions was detected as shown in fig s2 b the dissolution of iron gradually increased with the decrease of ph but it was still at a lower level 4 5 mg g it was worth noting that the purification efficiency of tcep was desirable at ph 4 and the amount of metal dissolution was low which can be ignored obviously secondary pollution was not easy to be triggered in the hd1 h2o2 system in the strong acidic system the excess h in the solution reacted with oh to form h2o consumed a portion of oh and directly led to the decrease in degradation efficiency of tcep in the neutral system the decomposition rate of h2o2 was slower than that of the weak alkaline system as the concentration of h decreased the decrease in fe3 concentration led to the decrease in oh content and the oxidation potential of oh thereby reducing the degradation efficiency of tcep in the fenton like system hd1 enables the advantages of host d201 and active component hfo to achieve the adsorption and immobilization of ip however the h content was an important factor affecting the adsorption performance therefore investigating the effect of different initial ph values on the adsorption of ip using hd1 is necessary ip in the effluent at different ph0 are shown in fig s2 a the results demonstrate that ip in the effluent gradually increased from 0 14 mg l to 0 2 mg l with the gradual increase in ph0 compared with the strong acidic system ip in the effluent slightly increased under weak alkaline conditions the adsorption of ip using hd1 mainly consisted of two functions namely nonspecific electrostatic adsorption and specific inner layer complexation under strong acidic conditions the hfo surface was positively charged due to protonation eq 6 and promoted the electrostatic interaction with anionic ip this phenomenon is beneficial to the adsorption of ip with low concentration of h in the system the hfo surface deprotonated and became negatively charged eq 7 the adsorption of ip generated by hd1 was suppressed due to electrostatic repulsion similar to results of previous research guo et al 2019 in addition hydroxide was released in the process of ligand exchange eqs 8 and 9 the competitive adsorption of ohˉ gradually increased as the ph increased from 4 0 to 9 0 thereby the removal effect of ip showed a decline deprotonation occurred on the surface of hd1 due to the enhancement of the alkalinity of the solution resulting in a decrease in the amount of positive charges further the selectivity of hd1 for anionic ip became poor which in turn leaded to a decrease in the removal efficiency of ip you et al 2016 6 f e o h h f e o h 2 7 f e o h f e o h 8 f e o h p o 4 3 f e p o 4 3 o h 9 f e o h h p o 4 2 f e o p o 2 o h o h 3 2 3 effect of h2o2 dosage on the degradation of tcep fig 5 a and b respectively show that the removal efficiency of tcep was only 5 3 and k obs only reached 0 0104 in the absence of h2o2 these findings indicated that most of tcep remained as the concentration of h2o2 increased the degradation efficiency of tcep increased gradually therefore h2o2 was crucial in the degradation of tcep when the concentration of h2o2 changed in the range of 2 20 mm the degradation efficiency of tcep increased from 45 9 to 95 5 and k obs increased from 0 2167 min 1 1 0532 min 1 when the concentration of h2o2 was 20 mm k obs reached the maximum and the degradation rate of tcep was the highest and achieved the best removal effect when the h2o2 dosage continuously increased to 40 mm the removal efficiency of tcep reached over 92 after 4 h k obs decreased slightly to 0 9811 min 1 and the degradation efficiency of tcep did not increase markedly the results clearly show that the degradation efficiency of tcep did not increase continuously after the dosage of h2o2 reaches a certain value the amount of oh generated in the system was mainly dependent on the concentration of h2o2 increasing the low h2o2 concentration could directly promote the production of oh however when the concentration of h2o2 reached a certain value the degradation efficiency of tcep no longer increased and even decreased with the increase in h2o2 concentration excessive h2o2 dosage generated a large amount of oh and considerable side reactions in the system and the oxidation potentials of the generated ho2 and o2ˉ were much lower than oh which led to the decrease in degradation efficiency of ip fig s3 shows the ip in the effluent under different h2o2 concentrations when no oxidant was available in the system the residual ip was almost zero meanwhile the removal efficiency of tcep was only 5 3 which indicated ineffective degradation and confirmed again that h2o2 played a key role in the degradation of tcep the effect of different h2o2 concentrations on ip in the effluent was unclear as the dosage of h2o2 increased from 2 mm to 40 mm the residual ip slightly increased by 0 03 mg l likely due to the ability of excess h2o2 to hinder the inner layer complexation between hfo and ip subsequently immobilization of ip was inhibited 3 2 4 effect of coexisting substances on the degradation of tcep to investigate the practical application of hd1 h2o2 for purifying tcep exploring the effects of common substances in natural water on the degradation efficiency of tcep and the adsorption of ip as degradation products is important fig 6 showed such effects of several common anions clˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ co3 2ˉ no3ˉ mg2 and ca2 and natural organic matter nom as shown in fig 6 a several common anions clˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ co3 2ˉ no3ˉ have a minimal effect on the degradation of tcep as the concentration of ions increased from 0 mm to 4 mm the degradation efficiency of tcep ranged from 93 0 to 95 5 respectively in the presence of other coexisting ions ca2 and mg2 as the cation concentration increased from 0 mg l to 120 mg l the degradation efficiency of tcep in the system containing ca2 and mg2 ranged from 94 to 95 5 and 94 2 95 5 respectively fig 6 b these results show that the hd1 h2o2 system used for the degradation of tcep has high stability under different ionic strengths as a natural organic matter ha is commonly found in surface water li et al 2002 and thus investigating its effect on the degradation efficiency of tcep in the hd1 h2o2 system is necessary fig 6 c showed the results as the ha concentration increased the degradation efficiency of tcep substantially reduced this decrease was consistent with the findings in xue et al 2011 besides the decomposition kinetic of h2o2 was detected simultaneously under different coexisting concentrations of ha as shown in figs s5 a and b the removal effect of tcep decreased obviously the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 decreased slightly with k obs from 1 249 min 1 to 0 835 min 1 with the ha dosage increasing from 0 to 40 mg l ha can compete with tcep for active species resulting in a lower probability of free radical attack on tcep which affect negatively the removal of tcep in addition it can be found that the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 did not change intensely when ha concentration in the system was kept at low level as the concentration of ha increased it may occupy adsorption sites on the surface of the material which inhibit the effective decomposition of h2o2 a competitive effect on the adsorption of ip occurs when common coexisting ions are present in water bodies you et al 2016 therefore the effects of the strength of common anions and cations on the adsorption process of ip were investigated as given in fig s4 a as the concentration of ions increased from 0 mm to 4 mm ip in the effluent slightly increased but was always in the range of 0 16 0 17 mg l the results showed that clˉ hco3ˉ co3 2ˉ and no3ˉ had no evident effect on the immobilization of ip as the so4 2 dosage increased from 0 mm to 4 mm ip in the effluent increased by 0 1 mg l when ca2 and mg2 were separately introduced into the system the change trend of residual ip was similar fig s4 b as the ca2 dosage increased from 0 mg l to 120 mg l the residual ip dropped from 0 16 mg l to 0 04 mg l when the mg2 concentration in the system reached 120 mg l ip in the effluent reduced to 0 1 mg l as previously mentioned in section 3 2 2 the two mechanisms of the adsorption of ip using hd1 were the electrostatic interaction between ip and the tertiary amine group of d201 host and the internal layer interaction between hfo nanoparticles and ip eqs 8 10 as the concentration of anions clˉ and no3ˉ increased from 0 mm to 4 mm ip in the effluent only slightly changed because of a weak outer layer interaction with hd1 compared with other coexisting ions so4 2ˉ had a great effect on the adsorption of ip the electrostatic interaction was nonspecific and the introduced sulfate could compete with ip for the ion exchange site of the host s quaternary amine group meanwhile so4 2ˉ could form complex with hfo under the condition of ph 4 as described by eqs 11 12 and inhibited the adsorption of ip the species distribution of feoh groups of supported hfo particles on hd1 in aqueous phase and in the background of so4 2ˉ under different ph was given in fig s6 mononuclear inner layer complex could be formed by the coordination between so4 2ˉ and feoh2 on the hd1 surface which was believed to be the reason that the existence of so4 2ˉ inhibited the immobilization process of ip although hco3ˉ and co3 2ˉ could form an inner layer complex with fe iii oxide the affinity was weaker than that of ip therefore continuously increasing the hco3ˉ and co3 2ˉ concentrations results in unclear changes of ip in the effluent appelo et al 2002 fig s4 b showed the effect of ca2 and mg2 on the adsorption of ip with the increase in ion concentration ca2 and the addition of mg2 showed a positive effect on the adsorption of ip this result was similar to that of reported studies antelo et al 2015 gao and mucci 2003 the possible reasons were as follows i when ca2 was introduced into the system the form of ip in the solution changed and allowed for the formation of a binary complex with calcium ions such as cahpo4 0 compared with ip the molecular ca p complexes were more easily adsorbed by hfo and fe p ca multicomposites might form on the hd1 surface the trapped ca2 might further enhance the ip chelation to form fe p ca p complexes which promote the removal of ip zhang et al 2019 to further confirm the above inference the additional characterization of exhausted hd1 surface in ca2 free and in the background of 120 mg l ca2 was carried out fig s7 showed the crystal evolution profile of hd1 after different treatment the obvious difference can be observed the new peaks appearing at 25 84 31 74 39 82 46 72 32 90 34 06 49 16 could be well indexed to hydroxyapatite ca p oh pdf 09 0432 further suggesting the formation of fe p ca multicomposites on the surface of hd1 in the presence of ca2 the ligand exchange process between hd1 and ip could be described by eqs 13 14 ii as the ca2 concentration in the solution increased the solid solution interface potential might change and promote the removal of ip to a certain extent lin et al 2017 10 f e o h 2 h 2 p o 4 f e o p o 2 o h 2 h 2 o 11 f e o h 2 s o 4 2 f e o h s o 4 2 h 12 f e o h 2 s o 4 2 f e s o 4 h 2 o 13 f e o h c a h p o 4 0 f e o p o 3 c a h 2 o 14 f e o p o 2 o h c a 2 f e o p o 3 c a h 3 3 mechanism of the degradation of tcep using hd1 h2o2 3 3 1 identification of major free radicals according to eqs 1 3 the activation of h2o2 via hd1 generated a variety of reactive oxygen species superoxide o2 ˉ and peroxy ho2 radicals could be generated in the feii feiii cycle and further generate oh therefore the quenching experiments of free radicals were performed under optimum conditions to determine the important role of free radicals in the system given that the reaction rates of etoh and tba with oh were 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 and 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 etoh could be used as the scavenger for oh and other free radicals respectively while tba was used as the scavenger for oh therefore etoh and tba were used as free radical quenchers to determine the dominating degradation of free radicals of tcep using hd1 h2o2 as shown in fig 7 a and b etoh and tba demonstrated marked inhibition on the degradation of tcep with hd1 h2o2 it was worth noting that the removal kinetics of tcep almost overlapped after 20 mm and 40 mm tba addition both reaching about 22 6 removal within 1 h similarly the removal kinetics of tcep also remained consistent after adding 20 mm and 40 mm etoh and the tcep removal within 1 h was almost completely suppressed with only 5 5 removal therefore it was concluded that the removal of tcep mainly depended on the action of free radicals in the hd1 h2o2 system meanwhile 20 mm tba was sufficient to scavenge all hydroxyl radicals in the system as mentioned in section 3 2 1 hd1 showed the poor adsorption capacity to tcep thereby the removal of tcep was mainly mediated by other active species with low redox potential in this case the quenching experiment results showed that the contribution rate of free radicals to the tcep degradation process reached 94 2 table s2 thus ca and cb could be used to explain that oh was crucial in the degradation process although ca cb because of the higher reaction rate between oh and etoh compared with that of tba in addition when oh in the system was completely quenched tcep was continuously degraded this finding indicated that other free radicals continued to participate in this degradation to further confirm the above conclusions epr was used to determine the presence of free radicals in the system dmpo was used to capture these free radicals e g oh and the detection spectrums are shown in fig 7 c the epr spectra of dmpo and dmpo h2o2 systems were unclear the dmpo r adduct signal only appeared in the epr spectrum of hd1 h2o2 in which the dmpo oh signal 1 2 2 1 was highly evident and much higher than the peaks contributed by other free radicals in addition as shown in fig 7 d it can be seen clearly that the epr spectra obtained from different quenching systems were different the dmpo oh signal peak was almost invisible when quantitative tba was added to the hd1 h2o2 system but there were still weak signal peaks contributed by dmpo r this phenomenon once again indicated that hd1 could activate h2o2 to produce various active free radicals the results of epr spectra can further confirmed the above point that oh was the important active species that dominated the degradation of tcep which was similar to the findings of shuai et al 2019a 3 3 2 possible degradation pathways of tcep using hd1 h2o2 to clarify the possible degradation of tcep using hd1 h2o2 the corresponding absorption spectra of contaminants in the system were determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer fig s8 showed the results the uv absorption peak of tcep appeared between 190 and 220 nm and as the oxidation time increased the peak and peak areas became smaller this reduced size proved that the chemical structure of tcep was gradually destroyed during the reaction and the amount of residual tcep in the system was also reduced when the reaction time reached 4 h the peak and peak area of tcep reduced the most thereby indicating that tcep in the liquid phase was almost completely degraded lc ms and ic were used to analyze the degradation products of tcep via hd1 h2o2 qualitatively table s3 lists the data of mass spectrometry m z analysis and fig s9 showed the ion chromatograms of different oxidation times comparison of the ion chromatograms of tcep under different oxidation times showed that a new peak appeared and the relative intensity changed evidently these features indicated that new substances were generated during the reaction in the system including formic acid acetic acid chloride ions and phosphate as shown by the order of peaks as the reaction time prolonged these peaks gradually increased and then decreased this finding also confirmed that tcep could be effectively degraded into small molecular acids and hd1 could adsorb existing and generated ip during the reaction lc ms analysis was performed using an esi source m h m h and the three stable degradation intermediates c4h9cl2o4p product 1 mw222 99 c6h13cl2o5p product 2 mw267 04 and c2h6clo4p product 3 mw160 49 were determined on the basis of the identification of products and confirmation of free radicals two possible degradation pathways of tcep via hd1 h2o2 were proposed fig 8 illustrates the results the tcep molecule consists of a phosphorus backbone and three branches of ethyl chloride the high activity of oh produced in the hd1 h2o2 system may attack the two sites of tcep namely the phosphorus center and the c cl bond at the end of the branch in route 1 as shown in fig 8 oh attacked the phosphorus center of the tcep molecule to cause hydroxyl addition and then electron transfer occurred and resulted in the c o bond cleavage these three steps produced product 1 and chlorohydrin product 4 product 1 converted into other substances after several cycle repetitions and might eventually be converted to chloride and phosphate chloroethanol could be directly oxidized to form the product formic acid product 7 acetic acid product 10 and chloride ion route 2 was dominated by the hydroxylation oxidation process the branch ends of the tcep molecule was attacked by oh and the hydroxyl group replaced the terminal chlorine group to form product 2 with was then oxidized product 5 may then be converted to product 11 via a cyclic hydroxylation oxidation process product 5 product 9 product 11 or the process of c o bond cleavage product 5 product 8 product 11 to further form acetic acid and product 12 therefore tcep can be degraded into chloride ions phosphates and other low molecular organic substances through a series of chain reactions in the hd1 h2o2 system this result is similar to the conclusions in previous research liu et al 2018 ye et al 2017 several intermediate degradation products were difficult to measure due to the rapid reaction process however with the prolongation of oxidation time low molecular intermediates were likely mineralized into co2 and h2o to further speculate the degradation pathway and mineralization degree of tcep in the hd1 h2o2 system toc during the reaction was investigated fig s10 showed the results toc decreased continuously during oxidation and the removal efficiency reached 47 after 4 h this result further indicated that most of tcep was successfully converted and the intermediate products were also degraded into low molecular organic substances which may eventually be completely mineralized to co2 and h2o 3 3 3 modification at the hd1 surface after reaction in this study hd1 was used as a fenton like catalyst and adsorbent to achieve enhanced removal of specific coexisting pollutants in water environment by one step h2o2 can be effectively catalyzed by hd1 to generate active species e g oh thereby mineralizing tcep into inorganic products e g ip the ip in the effluent was liable to cause secondary pollution therefore the adsorption of ip by hd1 was also one of the keys to achieving enhanced removal of organic phosphorus containing in this study the mechanism for ip adsorption onto hd1 in the hd1 h2o2 system was further investigated as given in fig 9 a it was clearly observed that the peak of c 1s o 1s n 1s cl 2p fe 2p appeared in the wide scan xps spectra of fresh hd1 and exhausted hd1 while a new peak of p 2p was observed in the wide scan xps spectra of exhausted hd1 as well as the conclusion mentioned in sec 3 2 1 which was that hd1 showed poorer adsorption capacity of tcep it can be believed that the ip was successfully adsorbed on to the hd1 characteristic fe 2p xps spectra obtained for hd1 before and after reaction are reported in fig 10 fe 2p spectra showed a maximum at 711 0 ev for fe 2p3 2 core level and the other characteristic peak at 724 6 ev as was commonly displayed for fe iii species in hfo a careful comparison of the positions of the characteristic fe 2p peaks of hd1 before and after the reaction seemed to indicate that the peak shifted slightly to higher binding energy suggesting that the inner layer complex fe o p may be formed to close binding energies the assumption agreed well with the study of mallet et al 2013 the o 1s xps spectra of fresh hd1 and exhausted hd1 are shown in fig 9 c respectively o 1s spectra of samples were fitted with three speaks by using xpspeak41 software including oxide oxygen m o hydroxyl group bonded to metal m oh and adsorbed water h2o the fitting parameters were reported in table s4 it was shown that the m oh percentage of fresh hd1 was 53 90 indicating great numbers of oh on the hd1 surface and the m oh percentage was decreased to 49 34 after adsorption process due to the fact that the ligand position of the oh groups were replaced by ip in addition the peak of m oh shifted slightly to higher binding energy which may be due to the existence of o p bond on the hfo surface mallet et al 2013 this phenomenon thus undoubtedly reflected ip adsorption on the hd1 surface furthermore it was found in fig 9 d that the binding energy of the p 2p3 2 in the exhausted hd1 was at 133 67 ev which was much higher than that of the p 2p3 2 in the nah2po4 2h2o reference salt 132 6 ev these results suggested that the ip had been adsorbed on the hd1 surface after the degradation of tcep and the fact that the inner sphere complexes between ip and hfo was further confirmed 3 4 stability experiments of hd1 fig 10 a and b illustrate the tolerance of hd1 under strong acid and alkali conditions respectively and the iron leaching amount is regarded as an evaluation index in the strong acid environment fig 10 a as the leaching time increased the amount of iron ions leaching increased gradually because the form of hfo existing in the solution tended to free ionic materials in the presence of a large amount of h after immersion in acid for 96 h the leaching rate of iron was less than 7 in the strong alkali environment fig 10 b the leaching rate of iron was less than 2 which indicated that hd1 had good acid and alkali resistance efficient regeneration performance and recycling capacity are key indicators for evaluating the practical application of materials the reusability experiments of hd1 were carried out using a binary naoh nacl 5 wt mixed solution as the eluent for regeneration fig 10 c showed that during the 10 degradation regeneration cycles the ability of hd1 to degrade tcep decreased slightly in the fenton like system and the removal efficiency decreased from 95 5 to 91 2 whereas the desorption efficiency was higher than 96 this finding indicated that hd1 could be effectively desorbed and achieve sustainable degradation of tcep in the fenton like system moreover the degradation efficiency only reduced slightly fig s11 showed the ip in the effluent in the recycling experiments the results showed even after repeated use hd1 still maintained a strong capacity to adsorb ip the atomic ratio at of fresh hd1 exhausted hd1 after reused 10 cycles determined by xps was shown in table s5 it was clearly found that the active component was slightly consumed hd1 had the practicality of engineering applications 3 5 fixed bed column experiments for degrading tcep in the hd1 h2o2 system the purification process of tcep can be divided into the i oxidative degradation of op and ii immobilization of ip the continuous fixed bed column was used to investigate the ability of hd1 to purify the simulated wastewater containing op in the fenton like system and tp was selected as the indicator to evaluate the potential of the system in purifying tcep according to the comprehensive wastewater discharge standard gb8978 1996 the breakthrough point of tp was set to 0 5 mg l yuan et al 2015 the degradation of tcep was based on the activation of h2o2 with hd1 to generate active free radicals the immobilization of ip was based on the adsorption process with hd1 when the breakthrough point was exceeded the experimental operation of bed column was stopped then hd1 was treated with a binary solution of 5 wt naoh nacl solution as the elution reagent and the regeneration process was sequentially started firstly the simulated wastewater contained tcep and common coexisting substances was used as feed solution fig 11 a and fig s12 a showed the continuous purification effect and desorption regeneration curve respectively the results showed that the highest effective treatment volume for hd1 purification of tcep was 960 bv in the fenton like system after two cycles the effective treatment volume decreased to 880 and 710 bv the effective volume after regeneration showed a decrease due to friction damage on the surface of the hd1 beads during the long term operation of the fixed bed column after subjecting to the fixed bed column hd1 can be effectively desorbed and the desorption efficiency can reach 95 8 in addition as mentioned in section 3 4 hd1 had better stability in fenton like system in particular fig s2 b has shown that the amount of iron dissolution can be ignored under the conditions of ph 4 in fenton like system this further emphasized the advantages of hd1 as a fenton like catalyst secondly in order to investigate the performance of hd1 as fenton like catalyst in actual wastewater environment the actual effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in nanjing was selected as the feed solvent for fixed bed column experiments fig 11 b showed the highest effective treatment volume of purifying phosphorus containing pollutants by hd1 h2o2 in actual wastewater environments was 700 bv which was slightly lower than that in the simulated wastewater for fixed bad column experiments and after two cycles the effective treatment volume decreased to 620 bv and 480 bv the efficiency of hd1 h2o2 in purifying phosphorus containing pollutants was affected by many factors due to the complexity of the components in the actual wastewater many low molecular weight organic compounds in the actual effluent water competed for non selective oh with tcep therefore the selective removal effect of specific pollutants was slightly reduced but the effective treatment volume remained at a high level 700 bv the above results showed that the multifunctional nanocomposite hd1 had good long term application prospects 4 conclusions in this study hd1 nanocomposites were successfully synthesized and used as a heterogeneous fenton like catalyst to effectively remove tcep in an aqueous solution under the conditions of 298 k ph 4 h2o2 20 mm and hd1 2 g l the removal efficiency of tcep after 4 h via hd1 h2o2 reached 95 5 and ip in the effluent was less than 0 2 mg l oh was crucial in the degradation of tcep which could eventually be mineralized effectively into co2 h2o chloride and ip meanwhile hd1 achieved the immobilization of ip during the reaction through electrostatic interaction and internal layer complexation the results of the application experiments in simulated actual water a competing effect was found between ha and tcep that could obviously reduce its degradation efficiency whereas the common coexisting ions in water showed less influence on the degradation the results showed that the introduction of so4 2ˉ inhibited the removal of ip whereas the addition of ca2 and mg2 promoted the immobilization of ip the important role of oh in the degradation of tcep was also confirmed and purification involved the two processes of oxidative degradation and immobilization of ip specifically catalytic oxidation was achieved with the two reaction processes of hydroxylation oxidation and c o bond cleavage dominated by oh ip was mainly removed by processes of electrostatic interaction and inner layer complexation hd1 demonstrated good acid and alkali resistance and performance of reuse and had the desirable ability of purifying pollutants after repeated regeneration in addition fixed bed column experiments further demonstrated that hd1 was applicable to remove phosphorus containing organic pollutants with high working capacity therefore the multifunctional nanocomposite hd1 has a considerable application potential in efficiently purifying op containing wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18001,the effective removal of organophosphorus compounds ops effectively from water environment remains an important but challenging task in this study a resin based nanocomposite of hydrated iron oxide hd1 was used as fenton like catalyst for effectively catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to degrade tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep the results showed that hd1 was successfully prepared which had great versatility catalytic performance and adsorption capacity besides hd1 h2o2 was capable of degrading tcep completely with less than 0 2 mg l of inorganic phosphorus ip in the effluent at the initial tcep of 38 mg l ph 4 h2o2 dosage of 20 mm and the k obs could result in about 1 0530 min 1 under identical conditions more attractively inorganic ions i e clˉ co3 2ˉ so4 2ˉ no3ˉ hco3ˉ ca2 and mg2 exhibited moderate effect on tcep degradation the negative effect of natural organic matters nom i e ha on the degradation of tcep was responsible for competition for the active oxygen species combined with electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and other analytical methods and radical quenching experiments the possible removal process of tcep was discussed including two processes of oxidative degradation and immobilization of ip besides hydroxyl radicals oh was the key active species that contributed to tcep degradation through hydroxylation oxidation and c o bond cracking and specificity adsorption of hfo on ip was revealed furthermore the results showed that hd1 had desirable acid and alkali resistance in the continuous running fixed bed column experiment hd1 showed a satisfactory performance in cycle operations this work proposed a new enhanced process for removing tcep in water environment by hd1 h2o2 and the multi functional material hd1 was promising in treatment of water containing organic phosphorus pollutants this will be believed that this study will provide new ideas and new materials for the treatment of organic phosphorus based organic pollutants and lay the foundation for further deepening and expanding the application of adsorption resins in the field of water pollution control graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton like catalytic oxidation tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate adsorption inorganic phosphorus 1 introduction organophosphorus flame retardants opfrs are rapidly growing as important alternatives to brominated flame retardants moser et al 2015 as a typical opfr organophosphorus compounds ops are widely used in building materials chemicals upholstered furniture electronics and other industries lian et al 2019 wei et al 2015 for example tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep is widely used as a flame retardant and plasticizer for rigid polyurethane foams in china and other developing countries grieco and ramarao 2013 the annual use of ops is estimated to reach tens of thousands of tons and its presence in urban sewage river water groundwater and drinking water range from several thousands to tens of thousands ng l ren et al 2019 previous reports state that ops detected in various environmental media and human bodies threaten human health and environmental systems fabianska et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 therefore solving the environmental pollution problem caused by ops is necessary most of the detected ops were stable especially if the biodegradability of chlorinated substances is poor wang et al 2018 conventional water treatments physical membrane separation and biochemical methods often fail to achieve effective removal therefore the development of effective pollution control for opfrs is important as an in situ chemical oxidation technology advanced oxidation processes have been widely used to remove stubborn organic pollutants in wastewater including ozonation votruba 2013 ultraviolet uv and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 watts and linden 2008 and fenton oxidation pignatello et al 2006 the ozone oxidation process is slow and has difficulty in achieving the complete mineralization of contaminants ozone oxidation can only partially remove chlorinated organic compounds even at high ozone doses e g tcep nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 yuan et al 2015 the degradation effect of tcep in the uv h2o2 system with high oh production is consistent with that of the ozonation process and both have relatively poor reactivity to chlorinated ops in addition the photocatalytic oxidation technology is still in the laboratory research scale and thus its practical application is insufficient cristale et al 2016 h2o2 activation of with fenton s reagent fe ii produces high standard reduction potential of oh e0 2 8 v which has been widely used in soil remediation and groundwater treatment however this method highly depends on ph easily produces a considerable amount of iron mud and increases the inefficiency and cost of wastewater treatments hasan et al 2012 pan et al 2019 the purification of ops in water remains restricted by factors such as a narrow ph range large amount of mud production and or energy intensiveness the heterogeneous fenton system not only improves the ph critical requirements and secondary pollution of the traditional fenton method but also presents the advantage of mineralizing organic pollutants into inorganic substances bokare and choi 2014 dutta et al 2001 although the oxidation of ops into inorganic phosphorus ip can improve the removal efficiency of op pollutants in the entire system excessive ip in water can still cause environmental problems such as eutrophication peräniemi et al 1992 rott et al 2017 therefore the removal of residual ip through subsequent treatments such as adsorption and fe iii coagulation is necessary and undoubtedly increases the complexity of op removal you et al 2018 as such economically and conveniently enhancing the removal of ops in water is a difficult problem at present researchers have proposed various methods for removing ip in water bodies of which adsorption is one of the most widely used mullan et al 2006 wilsenach et al 2007 the core of adsorption technology lies in the development of adsorbents iron hydrogen oxide hfo exhibits high selectivity to anionic contaminants through ligand exchanges due to the rich hydroxyl groups such as phosphates and arsenates on the surface li et al 2016a miao et al 2014 however this separation treatment is difficult to implement thereby limiting its application an effective method is the hfo loading in or on a large sized solid carrier to obtain a composite adsorbent resin is an ideal carrier for nanocomposite adsorbents e g hfo due to its good mechanical strength surface chemistry and adjustable pore structure cai et al 2016 pan et al 2012 in addition hfo is widely used in fenton like systems qian et al 2017 shuai et al 2019b hfo activates h2o2 and the formation of feii eq 1 and 2 and then generates a large amount of oh eq 3 to degrade organic pollutants given that h eq 1 and 2 can be formed during the reaction the initial ph requirements of the reaction are not critical thus compared with fe ii h2o2 hfo h2o2 can exhibit excellent oxidation performance over a wider ph range wang et al 2016 h2o2 reaction with feii eq 3 is beneficial to the recycling of feii feiii and reduces the production of iron mud barreiro et al 2007 matta et al 2007 moreover a large amount of accumulated iron ions may be converted into hfo to adsorb ip with the high efficiency of interception filtration and donnan membrane effect the resin can pre enrich the contaminants and improve the process and efficiency of the hfo based fenton like oxidation reaction shan et al 2019 zhang et al 2008a therefore the resin based nanocomposite adsorbent combines the unique adsorption properties of metal hydrogen oxides with phosphates and the excellent hydraulic and mechanical properties of host materials on the basis of the immobilization of nano adsorbents the adsorption capacity of composites and catalytic properties of hfo are applied in the fenton like system the realization of an adsorbent of multifunctional environment nanocomposite under nanoconfinement has practical value in the purification of ops in water bodies 1 f e i i i h 2 o 2 f e i i i h 2 o 2 2 f e i i i h 2 o 2 f e i i o 2 2 h 3 f e i i h 2 o 2 f e i i i o h o h 4 o h t c e p o x i d a t i o n p r o d u c t s therefore this study uses tcep which is a typical opfr as the treatment target tcep is removed using the nanocomposite hd1 in a fenton like system which presents the advantages of wide ph range and low yield of iron containing chemical sludge in this system the active component hfo on the surface of the multifunctional nanocomposite hd1 can catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 to form oh and op pollutants are degraded into ip thereby realizing the complete mineralization of pollutants eq 4 however the environmental problems caused by ip cannot be ignored therefore the dual function of the host d201 and hfo nanoparticles can be used to immobilize ip in the same system and effectively avoid secondary pollution in the hd1 h2o2 system the purification of op containing wastewater is enhanced in one step and therefore increases efficiency in addition the heterogeneous material hd1 has the following advantages 1 easy to recycle and reuse 2 expected to reduce the dosage of catalysts and the production of iron containing chemical sludge in wastewater treatment 3 reduces the additional disposal cost of sludge treatment 4 effectively reduces operating costs and 5 has good application prospects in this study macroporous anion exchange resin d201 is used as the carrier for hfo to synthesize hd1 nanocomposites and serve as a fenton like catalyst to degrade tcep first the physical and chemical properties of hd1 are analyzed second the effects of key factors such as ph0 and h2o2 dosages and coexisting substances on the degradation of tcep using hd1 h2o2 are systematically investigated besides the potential removal mechanism of tcep via hd1 h2o2 including the identification of major reactive free radicals and the degradation pathway of tecp is also explored finally the system reusability and preliminary application in simulating actual wastewater are studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials types and sources of materials were provided in the supporting materials text s1 2 2 hd1 preparation before use the d201 beads which are a new strong alkaline anion exchange resin were first soaked in 4 naoh solution for 5 h and then in deionized water until the ph was almost neutral then the beads were soaked for 5 h with 5 hcl solution rinsed with distilled water until the ph was approximately 6 and finally dried at 333 k the main steps for resin based nanocomposites hd1 preparation were based on other studies pan et al 2009 yang et al 2015 some preparation steps were reasonably adjusted in brief the pretreated d201 beads were placed in a ternary fecl3 hcl nacl mixed solution 1 5 m fecl3 1 0 m hcl and 2 0 m nacl and electrically stirred at 303 k for 24 h the resin was separated via filtration rapidly immersed in a naoh nacl mixed solution 1 m naoh and 0 6 m nacl and electrically stirred at 303 k for 24 h fecl4ˉ was preloaded on d201 and converted to fe oh 3 with in situ precipitation under alkaline conditions finally the synthetic material was washed with deionized water until the effluent was neutral the hd1 beads were dried at 333 k for 12 h and stored in sealed brown glass vials 2 3 catalytic oxidation experiment via hd1 h2o2 all the experimental data of catalytic oxidation were analyzed in three parallel groups except for fixed bed column experiments the experimental data obtained in this study were reliable firstly 400 mg of the catalyst hd1 was placed in an erlenmeyer flask containing 200 ml of a certain concentration of tcep c0 38 mg l tp 4 mg l and then 0 40 mm h2o2 was mixed into the reaction flask the mixture was shaken at 250 rpm at a constant temperature 298 k for 4 h in a thermostatic shaker thermo shka 4000 6c usa quantitative etoh was only used to remove the unreacted reactive oxygen species in the experiment and was added during the specified sampling interval to remove the generated hydroxyl radicals the effects of different reaction systems initial ph and h2o2 concentration on the degradation of tcep were investigated and the dissolution of iron after reaction at different initial ph was monitored at the same time the pseudo first order kinetic model was used to fit the degradation of tcep under different ph0 and h2o2 concentrations the k obs value was obtained via the linear regression of ln c c 0 versus t under different conditions eq 5 5 ln c c 0 k o b s t where c 0 mg l represents the initial concentration of tcep at t 0 0 c mg l denotes the concentration of tcep at time t the proportional coefficient k obs min 1 refers to the reaction rate constant k obs 0 t min indicates the reaction time the ph of the reaction solution was adjusted with 0 1 m naoh and hcl solution the effects of other common competing substances in actual water environment on the purification of tcep were investigated by adding mgcl2 cacl2 nacl nano3 na2so4 na2co3 and nahco3 to the reaction flask the introduced magnesium calcium concentration 0 120 mg l and chloride nitrate

reuse experiments the reacted hd1 beads were stirred with a binary mixed solution 5 wt naoh nacl at 273 k for 4 h washed twice in etoh and deionized water and recycled 10 times the stability experiment of hd1 was an important indicator on its application to actual scenarios hd1 500 mg was added to the deionized water 250 ml at ph 1 and ph 13 and allowed to stand at normal temperature

carried out in glass columns 30 mm diameter 130 mm length with water bath to maintain the temperature at 298 k firstly a column was filled with 5 ml wet hd1 and the mixed feed solution containing tcep tp 2 mg l and other coexisting substances clˉ no3ˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ ha ca2 mg2 were added from the top of the fixed bed h2o2 was added from the top of the bed in a separate line the initial solution

until the ph of effluent reached near neutrality and then subjected to the next cycle column experiment secondly in order to further investigate the application performance of hd1 in the actual wastewater environment the actual effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in nanjing was selected as the feed solvent some water quality indicators of the actual wastewater were shown in the related figures other hydraulic conditions were as described above 2 4 characterization of materials and analysis of water matrix characterization of materials and analysis methods of water matrix were provided in the supporting materials text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 hd1 characterization table s1 lists the physical and chemical properties of d201 and hd1 and fig 1 shows certain features by comparing fig 1 a and b the color of the resin beads changed from white to dark brown due to the hfo loading the surface profile of d201 beads was smooth and the surface of hd1 remained unchanged as shown in fig 2 a and b the fe load on hd1 was 9 8 the average pore diameter of the material before and after modification decreased from 3 49 nm to 2 98 nm and the average pore size of hd1 was reduced due to the partial pore blockage caused by hfo loading the latter result was further confirmed by the comparison of sem images before and after loading fig 2 d and e the hfo nanoparticles with large specific surface areas might increase the total specific surface area of the composite hd1 pan et al 2009 in this study the specific surface area of the host d201 increased from 14 55 m2 g to 29 08 m2 g of hd1 the fe sem eds scan of the hd1 cross section showed that most of the hfo was distributed in the outer region of the sphere fig 2 c which might be beneficial to the adsorption of anionic pollutants zhang et al 2016 according to the xrd pattern fig 1 c both d201 and hd1 have amorphous structures compared with goethite and hematite amorphous hfo may be more beneficial to the adsorption of phosphate and arsenate zhang et al 2008b to further determine the chemical form of iron loaded on hd1 xps was performed and the results are shown in fig 1 d and e the full spectrum analysis of hd1 showed that fe o c and n were the main elemental compositions this finding indicated the effectiveness of the abovementioned method for preparing hd1 fe 2p was divided into two peaks at 711 0 ev and 724 6 ev which corresponded to the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 and indicated the existence of fe iii caused by the hfo loaded on hd1 bukhtiyarova et al 2000 li et al 2016b 3 2 degradation effect of tcep using hd1 h2o2 3 2 1 effect of fenton like catalysts on the degradation of tcep fig 3 shows the effect of different oxidation systems on the degradation of tcep the removal efficiency of tcep using d201 or hd1 was less than 2 after introducing h2o2 into both systems the degradation efficiency of tcep increased in varying degrees the removal efficiency of tcep with d201 h2o2 increased to 15 which was similar to the effect of removing tcep via h2o2 by contrast the degradation efficiency of tcep using hd1 h2o2 obviously improved and the removal efficiency reached 95 5 after 4 h the surface of the styrene ion exchange resin d201 covered a large number of positively charged groups quaternary amine groups and the modified hd1 surface was rich in hfo nanoparticles the amine group could bind to the anion in the solution and undergo ion exchange and the hd1 surface could specifically bind to several anions the d201 and hd1 materials clearly failed to remove molecular tcep besides d201 could not activate h2o2 therefore both systems of d201 h2o2 and h2o2 showed poor removal efficiency of tcep because h2o2 in the system could only produce a small amount of hydroxyl radicals through self decomposition and the structure of a very small amount of pollutants was destroyed however the introduction of hd1 greatly improved the efficiency to almost complete degradation of tcep this finding indicated that hfo support on d201 could effectively activate h2o2 to produce oh and efficiently degrade the pollutants thus hfo was crucial in this catalytic degradation process ip in the effluent of each oxidation system is shown in fig s1 the residual ip in both systems of only d201 and only hd1 was less than 0 01 mg l indicating that almost no ip was available in the liquid phase the absence of oxidants further confirmed that d201 and hd1 themselves could not destroy the chemical structure of tcep which still existed in the liquid phase in stable molecular form and thus further indicating ineffective degradation the residual ip in the systems of only h2o2 and hd1 h2o2 were 0 03 and 0 16 mg l respectively by comparison residual phosphate in the hd1 h2o2 system clearly increased which further confirmed that h2o2 could be effectively activated using hd1 to form oh to degrade tcep to ip despite the increase of ip generated the total concentration of ip remained at a low level 0 2 mg l likely because the conversion of tcep to ip was accompanied with the adsorption of ip via hd1 these findings show that hd1 played an important role in the catalytic degradation of tcep and the adsorption process of ip in the fenton like system 3 2 2 effect of initial ph on the degradation of tcep according to the haber weiss cycle the key to the oxidative degradation reaction involved in the liquid phase interface is oh for which ph has an important influence on the production haber et al 1934 therefore the effects of different initial ph values 3 4 5 6 7 9 on the degradation of tcep were investigated fig 4 a showed the results and fig 4 b showed the trend of k obs under different conditions the degradation of tcep was optimal at ph 4 0 degradation efficiency was 95 5 and k obs was 1 0530 min 1 fig 4 a and b ph increased or decreased affected the degradation efficiency and rate of tcep in varying degrees when the ph was lower than 4 0 the degradation efficiency of tcep declined by 30 and k obs decreased to 0 4164 min 1 as the ph gradually increased the degradation of tcep was markedly inhibited and the removal efficiency decreased from 95 ph 4 to 58 ph 9 this result corresponded to the k obs reduction from 1 0532 min 1 to 0 3586 min 1 respectively in this study when ph was equal to 4 0 k obs clearly reached the maximum along with the highest degradation rate and when the ph increased from 4 to 9 the k obs value reduced three times with the decline in tcep degradation efficiency in addition the amount of iron dissolution under different ph conditions was detected as shown in fig s2 b the dissolution of iron gradually increased with the decrease of ph but it was still at a lower level 4 5 mg g it was worth noting that the purification efficiency of tcep was desirable at ph 4 and the amount of metal dissolution was low which can be ignored obviously secondary pollution was not easy to be triggered in the hd1 h2o2 system in the strong acidic system the excess h in the solution reacted with oh to form h2o consumed a portion of oh and directly led to the decrease in degradation efficiency of tcep in the neutral system the decomposition rate of h2o2 was slower than that of the weak alkaline system as the concentration of h decreased the decrease in fe3 concentration led to the decrease in oh content and the oxidation potential of oh thereby reducing the degradation efficiency of tcep in the fenton like system hd1 enables the advantages of host d201 and active component hfo to achieve the adsorption and immobilization of ip however the h content was an important factor affecting the adsorption performance therefore investigating the effect of different initial ph values on the adsorption of ip using hd1 is necessary ip in the effluent at different ph0 are shown in fig s2 a the results demonstrate that ip in the effluent gradually increased from 0 14 mg l to 0 2 mg l with the gradual increase in ph0 compared with the strong acidic system ip in the effluent slightly increased under weak alkaline conditions the adsorption of ip using hd1 mainly consisted of two functions namely nonspecific electrostatic adsorption and specific inner layer complexation under strong acidic conditions the hfo surface was positively charged due to protonation eq 6 and promoted the electrostatic interaction with anionic ip this phenomenon is beneficial to the adsorption of ip with low concentration of h in the system the hfo surface deprotonated and became negatively charged eq 7 the adsorption of ip generated by hd1 was suppressed due to electrostatic repulsion similar to results of previous research guo et al 2019 in addition hydroxide was released in the process of ligand exchange eqs 8 and 9 the competitive adsorption of ohˉ gradually increased as the ph increased from 4 0 to 9 0 thereby the removal effect of ip showed a decline deprotonation occurred on the surface of hd1 due to the enhancement of the alkalinity of the solution resulting in a decrease in the amount of positive charges further the selectivity of hd1 for anionic ip became poor which in turn leaded to a decrease in the removal efficiency of ip you et al 2016 6 f e o h h f e o h 2 7 f e o h f e o h 8 f e o h p o 4 3 f e p o 4 3 o h 9 f e o h h p o 4 2 f e o p o 2 o h o h 3 2 3 effect of h2o2 dosage on the degradation of tcep fig 5 a and b respectively show that the removal efficiency of tcep was only 5 3 and k obs only reached 0 0104 in the absence of h2o2 these findings indicated that most of tcep remained as the concentration of h2o2 increased the degradation efficiency of tcep increased gradually therefore h2o2 was crucial in the degradation of tcep when the concentration of h2o2 changed in the range of 2 20 mm the degradation efficiency of tcep increased from 45 9 to 95 5 and k obs increased from 0 2167 min 1 1 0532 min 1 when the concentration of h2o2 was 20 mm k obs reached the maximum and the degradation rate of tcep was the highest and achieved the best removal effect when the h2o2 dosage continuously increased to 40 mm the removal efficiency of tcep reached over 92 after 4 h k obs decreased slightly to 0 9811 min 1 and the degradation efficiency of tcep did not increase markedly the results clearly show that the degradation efficiency of tcep did not increase continuously after the dosage of h2o2 reaches a certain value the amount of oh generated in the system was mainly dependent on the concentration of h2o2 increasing the low h2o2 concentration could directly promote the production of oh however when the concentration of h2o2 reached a certain value the degradation efficiency of tcep no longer increased and even decreased with the increase in h2o2 concentration excessive h2o2 dosage generated a large amount of oh and considerable side reactions in the system and the oxidation potentials of the generated ho2 and o2ˉ were much lower than oh which led to the decrease in degradation efficiency of ip fig s3 shows the ip in the effluent under different h2o2 concentrations when no oxidant was available in the system the residual ip was almost zero meanwhile the removal efficiency of tcep was only 5 3 which indicated ineffective degradation and confirmed again that h2o2 played a key role in the degradation of tcep the effect of different h2o2 concentrations on ip in the effluent was unclear as the dosage of h2o2 increased from 2 mm to 40 mm the residual ip slightly increased by 0 03 mg l likely due to the ability of excess h2o2 to hinder the inner layer complexation between hfo and ip subsequently immobilization of ip was inhibited 3 2 4 effect of coexisting substances on the degradation of tcep to investigate the practical application of hd1 h2o2 for purifying tcep exploring the effects of common substances in natural water on the degradation efficiency of tcep and the adsorption of ip as degradation products is important fig 6 showed such effects of several common anions clˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ co3 2ˉ no3ˉ mg2 and ca2 and natural organic matter nom as shown in fig 6 a several common anions clˉ so4 2ˉ hco3ˉ co3 2ˉ no3ˉ have a minimal effect on the degradation of tcep as the concentration of ions increased from 0 mm to 4 mm the degradation efficiency of tcep ranged from 93 0 to 95 5 respectively in the presence of other coexisting ions ca2 and mg2 as the cation concentration increased from 0 mg l to 120 mg l the degradation efficiency of tcep in the system containing ca2 and mg2 ranged from 94 to 95 5 and 94 2 95 5 respectively fig 6 b these results show that the hd1 h2o2 system used for the degradation of tcep has high stability under different ionic strengths as a natural organic matter ha is commonly found in surface water li et al 2002 and thus investigating its effect on the degradation efficiency of tcep in the hd1 h2o2 system is necessary fig 6 c showed the results as the ha concentration increased the degradation efficiency of tcep substantially reduced this decrease was consistent with the findings in xue et al 2011 besides the decomposition kinetic of h2o2 was detected simultaneously under different coexisting concentrations of ha as shown in figs s5 a and b the removal effect of tcep decreased obviously the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 decreased slightly with k obs from 1 249 min 1 to 0 835 min 1 with the ha dosage increasing from 0 to 40 mg l ha can compete with tcep for active species resulting in a lower probability of free radical attack on tcep which affect negatively the removal of tcep in addition it can be found that the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 did not change intensely when ha concentration in the system was kept at low level as the concentration of ha increased it may occupy adsorption sites on the surface of the material which inhibit the effective decomposition of h2o2 a competitive effect on the adsorption of ip occurs when common coexisting ions are present in water bodies you et al 2016 therefore the effects of the strength of common anions and cations on the adsorption process of ip were investigated as given in fig s4 a as the concentration of ions increased from 0 mm to 4 mm ip in the effluent slightly increased but was always in the range of 0 16 0 17 mg l the results showed that clˉ hco3ˉ co3 2ˉ and no3ˉ had no evident effect on the immobilization of ip as the so4 2 dosage increased from 0 mm to 4 mm ip in the effluent increased by 0 1 mg l when ca2 and mg2 were separately introduced into the system the change trend of residual ip was similar fig s4 b as the ca2 dosage increased from 0 mg l to 120 mg l the residual ip dropped from 0 16 mg l to 0 04 mg l when the mg2 concentration in the system reached 120 mg l ip in the effluent reduced to 0 1 mg l as previously mentioned in section 3 2 2 the two mechanisms of the adsorption of ip using hd1 were the electrostatic interaction between ip and the tertiary amine group of d201 host and the internal layer interaction between hfo nanoparticles and ip eqs 8 10 as the concentration of anions clˉ and no3ˉ increased from 0 mm to 4 mm ip in the effluent only slightly changed because of a weak outer layer interaction with hd1 compared with other coexisting ions so4 2ˉ had a great effect on the adsorption of ip the electrostatic interaction was nonspecific and the introduced sulfate could compete with ip for the ion exchange site of the host s quaternary amine group meanwhile so4 2ˉ could form complex with hfo under the condition of ph 4 as described by eqs 11 12 and inhibited the adsorption of ip the species distribution of feoh groups of supported hfo particles on hd1 in aqueous phase and in the background of so4 2ˉ under different ph was given in fig s6 mononuclear inner layer complex could be formed by the coordination between so4 2ˉ and feoh2 on the hd1 surface which was believed to be the reason that the existence of so4 2ˉ inhibited the immobilization process of ip although hco3ˉ and co3 2ˉ could form an inner layer complex with fe iii oxide the affinity was weaker than that of ip therefore continuously increasing the hco3ˉ and co3 2ˉ concentrations results in unclear changes of ip in the effluent appelo et al 2002 fig s4 b showed the effect of ca2 and mg2 on the adsorption of ip with the increase in ion concentration ca2 and the addition of mg2 showed a positive effect on the adsorption of ip this result was similar to that of reported studies antelo et al 2015 gao and mucci 2003 the possible reasons were as follows i when ca2 was introduced into the system the form of ip in the solution changed and allowed for the formation of a binary complex with calcium ions such as cahpo4 0 compared with ip the molecular ca p complexes were more easily adsorbed by hfo and fe p ca multicomposites might form on the hd1 surface the trapped ca2 might further enhance the ip chelation to form fe p ca p complexes which promote the removal of ip zhang et al 2019 to further confirm the above inference the additional characterization of exhausted hd1 surface in ca2 free and in the background of 120 mg l ca2 was carried out fig s7 showed the crystal evolution profile of hd1 after different treatment the obvious difference can be observed the new peaks appearing at 25 84 31 74 39 82 46 72 32 90 34 06 49 16 could be well indexed to hydroxyapatite ca p oh pdf 09 0432 further suggesting the formation of fe p ca multicomposites on the surface of hd1 in the presence of ca2 the ligand exchange process between hd1 and ip could be described by eqs 13 14 ii as the ca2 concentration in the solution increased the solid solution interface potential might change and promote the removal of ip to a certain extent lin et al 2017 10 f e o h 2 h 2 p o 4 f e o p o 2 o h 2 h 2 o 11 f e o h 2 s o 4 2 f e o h s o 4 2 h 12 f e o h 2 s o 4 2 f e s o 4 h 2 o 13 f e o h c a h p o 4 0 f e o p o 3 c a h 2 o 14 f e o p o 2 o h c a 2 f e o p o 3 c a h 3 3 mechanism of the degradation of tcep using hd1 h2o2 3 3 1 identification of major free radicals according to eqs 1 3 the activation of h2o2 via hd1 generated a variety of reactive oxygen species superoxide o2 ˉ and peroxy ho2 radicals could be generated in the feii feiii cycle and further generate oh therefore the quenching experiments of free radicals were performed under optimum conditions to determine the important role of free radicals in the system given that the reaction rates of etoh and tba with oh were 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 and 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 etoh could be used as the scavenger for oh and other free radicals respectively while tba was used as the scavenger for oh therefore etoh and tba were used as free radical quenchers to determine the dominating degradation of free radicals of tcep using hd1 h2o2 as shown in fig 7 a and b etoh and tba demonstrated marked inhibition on the degradation of tcep with hd1 h2o2 it was worth noting that the removal kinetics of tcep almost overlapped after 20 mm and 40 mm tba addition both reaching about 22 6 removal within 1 h similarly the removal kinetics of tcep also remained consistent after adding 20 mm and 40 mm etoh and the tcep removal within 1 h was almost completely suppressed with only 5 5 removal therefore it was concluded that the removal of tcep mainly depended on the action of free radicals in the hd1 h2o2 system meanwhile 20 mm tba was sufficient to scavenge all hydroxyl radicals in the system as mentioned in section 3 2 1 hd1 showed the poor adsorption capacity to tcep thereby the removal of tcep was mainly mediated by other active species with low redox potential in this case the quenching experiment results showed that the contribution rate of free radicals to the tcep degradation process reached 94 2 table s2 thus ca and cb could be used to explain that oh was crucial in the degradation process although ca cb because of the higher reaction rate between oh and etoh compared with that of tba in addition when oh in the system was completely quenched tcep was continuously degraded this finding indicated that other free radicals continued to participate in this degradation to further confirm the above conclusions epr was used to determine the presence of free radicals in the system dmpo was used to capture these free radicals e g oh and the detection spectrums are shown in fig 7 c the epr spectra of dmpo and dmpo h2o2 systems were unclear the dmpo r adduct signal only appeared in the epr spectrum of hd1 h2o2 in which the dmpo oh signal 1 2 2 1 was highly evident and much higher than the peaks contributed by other free radicals in addition as shown in fig 7 d it can be seen clearly that the epr spectra obtained from different quenching systems were different the dmpo oh signal peak was almost invisible when quantitative tba was added to the hd1 h2o2 system but there were still weak signal peaks contributed by dmpo r this phenomenon once again indicated that hd1 could activate h2o2 to produce various active free radicals the results of epr spectra can further confirmed the above point that oh was the important active species that dominated the degradation of tcep which was similar to the findings of shuai et al 2019a 3 3 2 possible degradation pathways of tcep using hd1 h2o2 to clarify the possible degradation of tcep using hd1 h2o2 the corresponding absorption spectra of contaminants in the system were determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer fig s8 showed the results the uv absorption peak of tcep appeared between 190 and 220 nm and as the oxidation time increased the peak and peak areas became smaller this reduced size proved that the chemical structure of tcep was gradually destroyed during the reaction and the amount of residual tcep in the system was also reduced when the reaction time reached 4 h the peak and peak area of tcep reduced the most thereby indicating that tcep in the liquid phase was almost completely degraded lc ms and ic were used to analyze the degradation products of tcep via hd1 h2o2 qualitatively table s3 lists the data of mass spectrometry m z analysis and fig s9 showed the ion chromatograms of different oxidation times comparison of the ion chromatograms of tcep under different oxidation times showed that a new peak appeared and the relative intensity changed evidently these features indicated that new substances were generated during the reaction in the system including formic acid acetic acid chloride ions and phosphate as shown by the order of peaks as the reaction time prolonged these peaks gradually increased and then decreased this finding also confirmed that tcep could be effectively degraded into small molecular acids and hd1 could adsorb existing and generated ip during the reaction lc ms analysis was performed using an esi source m h m h and the three stable degradation intermediates c4h9cl2o4p product 1 mw222 99 c6h13cl2o5p product 2 mw267 04 and c2h6clo4p product 3 mw160 49 were determined on the basis of the identification of products and confirmation of free radicals two possible degradation pathways of tcep via hd1 h2o2 were proposed fig 8 illustrates the results the tcep molecule consists of a phosphorus backbone and three branches of ethyl chloride the high activity of oh produced in the hd1 h2o2 system may attack the two sites of tcep namely the phosphorus center and the c cl bond at the end of the branch in route 1 as shown in fig 8 oh attacked the phosphorus center of the tcep molecule to cause hydroxyl addition and then electron transfer occurred and resulted in the c o bond cleavage these three steps produced product 1 and chlorohydrin product 4 product 1 converted into other substances after several cycle repetitions and might eventually be converted to chloride and phosphate chloroethanol could be directly oxidized to form the product formic acid product 7 acetic acid product 10 and chloride ion route 2 was dominated by the hydroxylation oxidation process the branch ends of the tcep molecule was attacked by oh and the hydroxyl group replaced the terminal chlorine group to form product 2 with was then oxidized product 5 may then be converted to product 11 via a cyclic hydroxylation oxidation process product 5 product 9 product 11 or the process of c o bond cleavage product 5 product 8 product 11 to further form acetic acid and product 12 therefore tcep can be degraded into chloride ions phosphates and other low molecular organic substances through a series of chain reactions in the hd1 h2o2 system this result is similar to the conclusions in previous research liu et al 2018 ye et al 2017 several intermediate degradation products were difficult to measure due to the rapid reaction process however with the prolongation of oxidation time low molecular intermediates were likely mineralized into co2 and h2o to further speculate the degradation pathway and mineralization degree of tcep in the hd1 h2o2 system toc during the reaction was investigated fig s10 showed the results toc decreased continuously during oxidation and the removal efficiency reached 47 after 4 h this result further indicated that most of tcep was successfully converted and the intermediate products were also degraded into low molecular organic substances which may eventually be completely mineralized to co2 and h2o 3 3 3 modification at the hd1 surface after reaction in this study hd1 was used as a fenton like catalyst and adsorbent to achieve enhanced removal of specific coexisting pollutants in water environment by one step h2o2 can be effectively catalyzed by hd1 to generate active species e g oh thereby mineralizing tcep into inorganic products e g ip the ip in the effluent was liable to cause secondary pollution therefore the adsorption of ip by hd1 was also one of the keys to achieving enhanced removal of organic phosphorus containing in this study the mechanism for ip adsorption onto hd1 in the hd1 h2o2 system was further investigated as given in fig 9 a it was clearly observed that the peak of c 1s o 1s n 1s cl 2p fe 2p appeared in the wide scan xps spectra of fresh hd1 and exhausted hd1 while a new peak of p 2p was observed in the wide scan xps spectra of exhausted hd1 as well as the conclusion mentioned in sec 3 2 1 which was that hd1 showed poorer adsorption capacity of tcep it can be believed that the ip was successfully adsorbed on to the hd1 characteristic fe 2p xps spectra obtained for hd1 before and after reaction are reported in fig 10 fe 2p spectra showed a maximum at 711 0 ev for fe 2p3 2 core level and the other characteristic peak at 724 6 ev as was commonly displayed for fe iii species in hfo a careful comparison of the positions of the characteristic fe 2p peaks of hd1 before and after the reaction seemed to indicate that the peak shifted slightly to higher binding energy suggesting that the inner layer complex fe o p may be formed to close binding energies the assumption agreed well with the study of mallet et al 2013 the o 1s xps spectra of fresh hd1 and exhausted hd1 are shown in fig 9 c respectively o 1s spectra of samples were fitted with three speaks by using xpspeak41 software including oxide oxygen m o hydroxyl group bonded to metal m oh and adsorbed water h2o the fitting parameters were reported in table s4 it was shown that the m oh percentage of fresh hd1 was 53 90 indicating great numbers of oh on the hd1 surface and the m oh percentage was decreased to 49 34 after adsorption process due to the fact that the ligand position of the oh groups were replaced by ip in addition the peak of m oh shifted slightly to higher binding energy which may be due to the existence of o p bond on the hfo surface mallet et al 2013 this phenomenon thus undoubtedly reflected ip adsorption on the hd1 surface furthermore it was found in fig 9 d that the binding energy of the p 2p3 2 in the exhausted hd1 was at 133 67 ev which was much higher than that of the p 2p3 2 in the nah2po4 2h2o reference salt 132 6 ev these results suggested that the ip had been adsorbed on the hd1 surface after the degradation of tcep and the fact that the inner sphere complexes between ip and hfo was further confirmed 3 4 stability experiments of hd1 fig 10 a and b illustrate the tolerance of hd1 under strong acid and alkali conditions respectively and the iron leaching amount is regarded as an evaluation index in the strong acid environment fig 10 a as the leaching time increased the amount of iron ions leaching increased gradually because the form of hfo existing in the solution tended to free ionic materials in the presence of a large amount of h after immersion in acid for 96 h the leaching rate of iron was less than 7 in the strong alkali environment fig 10 b the leaching rate of iron was less than 2 which indicated that hd1 had good acid and alkali resistance efficient regeneration performance and recycling capacity are key indicators for evaluating the practical application of materials the reusability experiments of hd1 were carried out using a binary naoh nacl 5 wt mixed solution as the eluent for regeneration fig 10 c showed that during the 10 degradation regeneration cycles the ability of hd1 to degrade tcep decreased slightly in the fenton like system and the removal efficiency decreased from 95 5 to 91 2 whereas the desorption efficiency was higher than 96 this finding indicated that hd1 could be effectively desorbed and achieve sustainable degradation of tcep in the fenton like system moreover the degradation efficiency only reduced slightly fig s11 showed the ip in the effluent in the recycling experiments the results showed even after repeated use hd1 still maintained a strong capacity to adsorb ip the atomic ratio at of fresh hd1 exhausted hd1 after reused 10 cycles determined by xps was shown in table s5 it was clearly found that the active component was slightly consumed hd1 had the practicality of engineering applications 3 5 fixed bed column experiments for degrading tcep in the hd1 h2o2 system the purification process of tcep can be divided into the i oxidative degradation of op and ii immobilization of ip the continuous fixed bed column was used to investigate the ability of hd1 to purify the simulated wastewater containing op in the fenton like system and tp was selected as the indicator to evaluate the potential of the system in purifying tcep according to the comprehensive wastewater discharge standard gb8978 1996 the breakthrough point of tp was set to 0 5 mg l yuan et al 2015 the degradation of tcep was based on the activation of h2o2 with hd1 to generate active free radicals the immobilization of ip was based on the adsorption process with hd1 when the breakthrough point was exceeded the experimental operation of bed column was stopped then hd1 was treated with a binary solution of 5 wt naoh nacl solution as the elution reagent and the regeneration process was sequentially started firstly the simulated wastewater contained tcep and common coexisting substances was used as feed solution fig 11 a and fig s12 a showed the continuous purification effect and desorption regeneration curve respectively the results showed that the highest effective treatment volume for hd1 purification of tcep was 960 bv in the fenton like system after two cycles the effective treatment volume decreased to 880 and 710 bv the effective volume after regeneration showed a decrease due to friction damage on the surface of the hd1 beads during the long term operation of the fixed bed column after subjecting to the fixed bed column hd1 can be effectively desorbed and the desorption efficiency can reach 95 8 in addition as mentioned in section 3 4 hd1 had better stability in fenton like system in particular fig s2 b has shown that the amount of iron dissolution can be ignored under the conditions of ph 4 in fenton like system this further emphasized the advantages of hd1 as a fenton like catalyst secondly in order to investigate the performance of hd1 as fenton like catalyst in actual wastewater environment the actual effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in nanjing was selected as the feed solvent for fixed bed column experiments fig 11 b showed the highest effective treatment volume of purifying phosphorus containing pollutants by hd1 h2o2 in actual wastewater environments was 700 bv which was slightly lower than that in the simulated wastewater for fixed bad column experiments and after two cycles the effective treatment volume decreased to 620 bv and 480 bv the efficiency of hd1 h2o2 in purifying phosphorus containing pollutants was affected by many factors due to the complexity of the components in the actual wastewater many low molecular weight organic compounds in the actual effluent water competed for non selective oh with tcep therefore the selective removal effect of specific pollutants was slightly reduced but the effective treatment volume remained at a high level 700 bv the above results showed that the multifunctional nanocomposite hd1 had good long term application prospects 4 conclusions in this study hd1 nanocomposites were successfully synthesized and used as a heterogeneous fenton like catalyst to effectively remove tcep in an aqueous solution under the conditions of 298 k ph 4 h2o2 20 mm and hd1 2 g l the removal efficiency of tcep after 4 h via hd1 h2o2 reached 95 5 and ip in the effluent was less than 0 2 mg l oh was crucial in the degradation of tcep which could eventually be mineralized effectively into co2 h2o chloride and ip meanwhile hd1 achieved the immobilization of ip during the reaction through electrostatic interaction and internal layer complexation the results of the application experiments in simulated actual water a competing effect was found between ha and tcep that could obviously reduce its degradation efficiency whereas the common coexisting ions in water showed less influence on the degradation the results showed that the introduction of so4 2ˉ inhibited the removal of ip whereas the addition of ca2 and mg2 promoted the immobilization of ip the important role of oh in the degradation of tcep was also confirmed and purification involved the two processes of oxidative degradation and immobilization of ip specifically catalytic oxidation was achieved with the two reaction processes of hydroxylation oxidation and c o bond cleavage dominated by oh ip was mainly removed by processes of electrostatic interaction and inner layer complexation hd1 demonstrated good acid and alkali resistance and performance of reuse and had the desirable ability of purifying pollutants after repeated regeneration in addition fixed bed column experiments further demonstrated that hd1 was applicable to remove phosphorus containing organic pollutants with high working capacity therefore the multifunctional nanocomposite hd1 has a considerable application potential in efficiently purifying op containing wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18002,as phosphorus is a non renewable resource mainly used to produce fertilizers and helps to provide food all over the world the proper management of its reserves is a global concern since it is expected to become scarcer in the near future in this work we assessed two different sludge line configurations aiming for p extraction and recovery before anaerobic digestion and compared them with the classical configuration this study has been performed by simulation with the model bnrm2 integrated in the software package desass 7 1 configuration 1 was based on the production of a po4 enriched stream from sludge via elutriation in the primary thickeners while configuration 2 was based on the wasstrip process and its po4 enriched stream was mechanically obtained with dynamic thickeners in both alternatives recovery was enhanced by promoting poly phosphate poly p extraction under anaerobic conditions for which both configurations were fully evaluated in a full scale wwtp both were also optimized to maximize phosphorus extraction their costs and life cycles were also analysed the novelty of this research lies in the lack of literature about the integral evaluation of pre anaerobic digestion p recovery from wastewaters this study included a holistic approach and an optimization study of both alternatives plus their economic and environmental aspects in configuration 1 the po4 p load in the recovery stream reached 43 1 of the total influent p load and reduced uncontrolled p precipitation in the sludge line up to 52 9 in configuration 2 extraction was 48 2 of the influent p load and it reduced precipitation by up to 60 0 despite configuration 1 s lower phosphorus recovery efficiency it had a 23 0 lower life cycle cost and a 14 2 lower global warming impact per hm3 of treated influent than configuration 2 configuration 1 also reduced the taec by 17 6 and global warming impact by 2 0 less than configuration 0 graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus recovery extraction elutriation sludge management mathematical modelling waste water 1 introduction in nature phosphorus p is directly linked to life and biological activity as it provides energy to cells and is present in genetic material bones and other structures smit et al 2009 van dijk et al 2016 p causes pollution in aquatic ecosystems after excessive use of p fertilizers and the discharge of untreated wastewaters inducing algal blooms reducing the dissolved oxygen in the water column and triggering the formation of p deposits in sediments kroiss et al 2011 these issues are avoided by proper crop management and removing p in wastewater treatment plants wwtps p is currently removed in wwtps biologically enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr chemically or a combination of both methods cornel and schaum 2009 the combination of ebpr in the water line and anaerobic digestion in the sludge line is a triggering factor for the uncontrolled precipitation of p compounds inside and downstream digesters causing pipe blockages and deposits on the walls of pipelines reactors and other equipment martí et al 2017 the main use of p is in the food supply as more than 80 of the mined product is used in the food industry an increase in its demand is expected in the near future as living standards and the global population increase but also the depletion of its reserves ciéslik and konieczka 2017 robles et al 2020 p and phosphate rock are thus included in the list of critical raw materials ec 2017 around 90 of the highest quality reserves occur in western sahara and morocco china south africa jordan and the usa which adds extra complexity to its future supply of food as the resource has geopolitical interests and is subject to market fluctuations guedes et al 2014 several initiatives are now under way in an attempt to alleviate its scarcity including reuse and recovery within its cycle egle et al 2016 considered that implementing recovery techniques in wwtps could reduce central europe s dependence on external p supplies by up to a 40 these techniques contribute to the evolution from the wwtp to the wastewater resource recovery facility concept in which wastewater is not considered as a mixture of pollutants whose discharge into surface waters has to be avoided but a rich source of valuable products p forms organic or inorganic compounds in wwtps the organic fraction being up to 60 of total p in the sludge le corre et al 2009 its mineralization requires long retention times and takes place quantitatively in anaerobic sludge digestion inorganic p appears as i orthophosphate po4 which is easily separated and afterwards assimilated by plants and ii polyphosphate poly p the solid compound that some organisms poly p accumulating organisms pao store after po4 uptake the main p recovery product is struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o map which is considered a slow release fertilizer with low solubility and high p content 13 by mass map crystallizes at a ph of 7 5 when the molar ratio mg nh4 po4 is around 1 3 4 1 shih et al 2017 peng et al 2018 other recovered products as calcium phosphates have lower fertilizing potential robles et al 2020 direct application of p enriched sludge after stabilization involves a simple recovery technique however it is forbidden in many countries due to the likely presence of heavy metals persistent organic pollutants and pathogens harrison et al 2006 this together with the emergence of p recovery awareness has triggered the research development and full scale implementation of a wide variety of p recovery techniques from different streams after anaerobic digestion from sludge such as airprex nuresys and elophos or centrifuge centrate such as naskeo ostara pearl phospaq or struvia under acidic conditions more p can be recovered as a part of the organic matter is mineralized and the precipitated compounds re dissolve after anaerobic digestion seaborne and stuttgart processes nevertheless the potential of these processes is limited as they cannot avoid the uncontrolled precipitation of the previously indicated p compounds egle et al 2016 other configurations such as that described in pastor et al 2008 martí et al 2017 or the wasstrip process cullen et al 2013 aim to overcome this limitation by recovering p before anaerobic digestion life cycle assessment lca can quantify and compare the environmental impacts related to the process per functional unit iso 2006 and makes possible its comparison its use has been promoted by the united nations environmental program however it is rarely employed by decision makers despite its high potential guérin schneider et al 2018 post digestion processes have already been compared by different approaches and methods in a number of studies rodriguez garcia et al 2014 bradford hartke et al 2015 remy and jossa 2015 sena and hicks 2018 however none have compared pre digestion p recovery technologies also few studies have been carried out on the life cycle costing lcc of p recovery and these only deal with costs for post digestion technologies the existing literature is based on assessing the costs related to infrastructure energy chemicals personnel maintenance products by products and waste egle et al 2016 nättorp et al 2017 the novelty of this paper lies in its holistic assessment of technical economic and environmental aspects of three different p recovery strategies from sludge one after anaerobic digestion and two before anaerobic digestion for this purpose it is necessary to calibrate the model of the wwtp in order to obtain reliable results of the different p recovery strategies required for the lca and lcc analysis the post anaerobic digestion strategy is based on classical p recovery from the centrates produced during the dewatering process while the pre anaerobic digestion strategies are based on enhancing p extraction and separation by means of a novel elutriation process and a process based on the wasstrip 2 materials and methods both sludge line configurations assessed had the same goal to increase p recovery and reduce uncontrolled p precipitation during anaerobic digestion this can be achieved by enhancing poly p release from sludge and separating it before anaerobic digestion the first configuration c1 evaluated the potential to recover p by mixing both thickened sludges under anaerobic conditions in a mixing chamber and pumping the mixed sludge to the primary thickener to obtain a liquid po4 enriched stream to subsequently crystallize map fig 1 left the second configuration c2 was based on the wasstrip process the fermented primary sludge was separated in the primary thickeners to obtain a vfa enriched liquid stream which was added to the waste activated sludge was in a release tank a po4 enriched stream can then be mechanically separated from sludge and finally recovered by crystallizing map fig 1 right in both configurations vfa uptake and po4 release by pao took place under the anaerobic conditions in the mixing chamber c1 and release tank c2 for comparison purposes both configurations were assessed technically economically and environmentally in the murcia este wwtp spain the first step was the calibration of the biological nutrients removal model no 2 barat et al 2013 bnrm2 with information from three complete analytical campaigns to characterize the whole wwtp performance the different sludge line management strategies were then simulated on dessas 7 1 software ferrer et al 2008 to stablish the optimal operating conditions and finally were environmentally and economically evaluated 2 1 current murcia este wwtp configuration the murcia este wwtp mainstream consists of primary settling an a2o biological reactor with a total volume of 41 405 m3 3 9 of the volume is anaerobic 23 3 anoxic and 72 8 aerobic and secondary settling the sludge line configuration is made up of two primary gravity thickeners and two dissolved air flotation thickeners daf for waste activated sludge was however only one daf thickener is currently being used the thickened was is electromagnetically hydrolysed and mixed with the primary sludge in a 79 2 m3 chamber and then digested and dewatered to a final concentration of 20 25 of tss fig 2 shows the layout of the murcia este wwtp with the different streams characterized for model calibration 2 2 layout of the sludge line configurations evaluated the determining factor for the implementation of both configurations was extracting as much poly p as possible with the minimum investment cost by using as many elements of the current wwtp layout as possible c1 was based on the elutriation of mixed sludge in the primary thickeners and increasing the mixing chamber volume from 79 m3 to 609 m3 fig 3 with one of the secondary thickeners in this alternative the following effects were tested 1 different elutriation flows qelut from 0 to 1000 m3 d 1 2 reduced primary sludge flows from the current qps of 5685 m3 d 1 to 1500 m3 d 1 3 reduced sludge digestion flow qdig from the current operation flow 787 m3d 1 to 500 m3 d 1 c2 was based on the wasstrip configuration fig 4 in c2 the primary sludge was fermented in the primary thickeners and the vfa concentration in the overflow stream was increased by elutriation of the thickened sludge in the primary thickeners the vfa enriched primary thickener overflow was mixed with the was in the secondary thickeners which were converted into anaerobic p release tanks vtot 1060 m3 the next step was the separation of an enriched po4 p stream with a dynamic thickener the effect of increasing qelut from 0 to 1000 m3d 1 while reducing qps from 5685 to 1500 m3d 1 were tested in this configuration 2 3 analytical method total and volatile suspended solids tss vss total and soluble chemical oxygen demand codtot codsol total and soluble biological demand bodtot bodsol total and soluble phosphorus ptot psol total and soluble nitrogen ntot nsol orthophosphate po4 ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and soluble metals mgsol casol ksol analyses were carried out following standard methods apha 2012 alkalinity and vfa were analysed as described in moosbrugger et al 1992 2 4 assessing precipitation sludge line precipitation was estimated following the method described in martí et al 2008 by applying mass balances for volatile solids orthophosphate magnesium and potassium in the mixing chamber anaerobic digestion secondary digester and centrifuge for the current configuration plus primary thickener for c1 and the p release tanks and dynamic thickeners for c2 2 5 calibration and simulations the model calibration and all simulations were carried out on desass 7 1 software ferrer et al 2008 which runs the bnrm2 barat et al 2013 which includes all the equations parameters and components to accurately reproduce the biological and chemical processes in a wwtp for calibration purposes three intensive analytical campaigns where carried out at different points of the water and sludge lines under normal operating conditions these included an exhaustive characterization of different parameters see section 2 3 in the streams indicated in fig 2 a total of 15 samples were analysed in each campaign with between 16 and 18 parameters in each sample all the samples were composite for 24 h continuous sampling in the water line and manual composite samples in the sludge line the model was calibrated by tuning the different parameters to minimize the differences between the analytical results of three analytical campaigns and their respective simulations after which it was used to simulate the configurations above mentioned 2 6 life cycle cost the life cycle cost was assessed for each configuration calculating the annual cost considering the sludge line differential elements it was considered the opex cost associated to chemicals sludge disposal and energy consumption for operation and maintenance of thickening digestion including the maintenance cost associated to the uncontrolled precipitation dewatering and combined heating and power chp the capex considered for c1 and c2 were valves pumps variable frequency drives stirrers flow indicators and sludge blanket height controller indicators and transducers pipelines po4 analysers and dynamic thickeners see tables 1 and 2 capex were calculated at a 10 annual discount rate r and a project lifetime of 20 years t according with pretel et al 2016 the cost analysis is given in tables 3 and 4 maintenance included replacement of pumps valves stirrers blowers anti scaling investment and other differential elements all the sludge was assumed to be used for agricultural applications energy production was estimated at a methane calorific power of 38 000 kj m 3 and 35 efficiency seco et al 2018 as the same personnel were assumed to run the infrastructure after implementing both configurations this item was excluded from the lcc calculation as it was not a differential element maintenance costs were related to the replacement of equipment after its lifetime based on information retrieved from wwtp operators equipment providers and the cost of associated operations to reduce the effects of uncontrolled p precipitation the total annual equivalent cost taec was calculated as the sum of the annual capital expenses capex and operational requirements opex according to eq 1 ferrer et al 2015 1 t a e c r 1 r t 1 r t 1 c a p e x o p e x return on investment roi was calculated assuming a 95 map crystallization efficiency and a market value of between 55 and 300 tmmap 1 de vries et al 2017 2 7 life cycle assessment the life cycle assessment lca was performed according to une en iso 14040 iso 2006 the inventory of materials and processes which lists the volumes of inflows from the natural environment and the outflows released into it was compiled using the ecoinvent database v3 via simapro 8 5 pré consultants the netherlands the hierarchist recipe h v 1 02 midpoint method was employed to carry out the assessment of global warming gw quantified as kgco2 eq the three scenarios were evaluated with functional units of 1 t of po4 p in the recovery stream and a treated wastewater inflow of 1 hm3 only the differential elements were considered different authors consider that the infrastructure s contribution to the lca is negligible in comparison to the operational impacts bradford hartke et al 2015 remy and jossa 2015 kjerstadius et al 2017 in the present study minimum modifications of the current sludge line configuration c0 were required to set up the c1 and c2 configurations neither configuration required new reactors existing elements were used such as secondary thickeners not used in the current sludge management configuration only pumping pipes and new dynamic thickeners for c2 being necessary for these reasons and due to the lack of reliable information the environmental impact related to the infrastructure were omitted focusing on the operation of the three p recovery configurations 3 results 3 1 characterization table 5 shows the average values of the different parameters analysed during the three analytical campaigns together with standard deviations it is important to note the significant fermentation in the primary thickener which raised the vfa concentration from 95 mg cod l to 794 mgcod l this fermentation is a key aspect of the study since the mix of vfa and secondary sludge before the anaerobic digestion in the mixing chamber in c1 and in the release tank in c2 see fig 1 triggered poly p release also important is the increased ammonium concentration during anaerobic digestion due to hydrolysis and the reduced phosphate concentration which confirmed the high level of phosphorus precipitation see section 3 4 different mass balances were applied for phosphate magnesium and potassium in the mixing chamber anaerobic digestion secondary digester and centrifuge following martí et al 2008 to quantify uncontrolled p precipitation the analytical values determined the content of p mg and k in organic matter with values of 1 7 mgp 100 mgvss 1 0 5 mgmg 100 mgvss 1 1 1 mgk 100 mgvss 1 considering 32 7 of primary and 67 3 of secondary sludge uncontrolled p precipitation in the sludge line was 577 9 kgp d 1 anaerobic digestion being the hot spot as 95 7 of the precipitation took place there under the current wwtp configuration only 7 4 of the influent p load was present as po4 p in the primary and secondary thickening overflows and centrates from centrifuges 3 6 available only from centrates this low p availability confirmed that the classical recovery of phosphorus from centrates drastically reduces the potential recoverable p due to its precipitation 3 2 calibration the bnrm2 model was calibrated to fit the simulated results with the three analytical characterizations of the murcia este wwtp under steady state conditions as can be seen in figs s1 s4 the model was able to reproduce the biological and physical processes that took place in the entire wwtp which was fitted with the default values of the model parameters proposed in bnrm2 with the exception of some parameters related to biological phosphorus removal hydrolysis and fermentation the modified parameters are listed in table 6 the model simulations revealed significant differences in the behaviour of the bacteria responsible for biological p removal pao and organic matter hydrolysis and fermentation acidogenic bacteria before and after the mixing chamber probably due to electromagnetic hydrolysis of the biological sludge before the mixing chamber see fig 2 between streams 7 and 7 which probably reduced the bacteria s metabolism and performance it is remarkable the small volume of the anaerobic zone in the biological reactor 3 9 of the biological reactor which contrasts with the ability of the pao bacteria developed in the reactor to reach high p removal efficiencies around 97 for this reason different parameters involved in the pao metabolism were modified such as pha accumulation rate qpha and volatile fatty acids half saturation constants ka and kpro acidogenic activity μacid was modified in order to reproduce the high degree of fermentation observed at the bottom of the primary thickeners hydrolytic activity kh was changed in order to fit the experimentally measured soluble cod balance in the gravity thickeners this parameter was increased in the mixing chamber to simulate the effect of the electromagnetic hydrolyser after secondary thickening 3 3 phosphorus extraction evaluation 3 3 1 current configuration the three analytical campaigns established the baseline of the current wwtp under the current sludge line configuration c0 the po4 p concentration in the overflows of the primary and the secondary thickener were 5 2 and 3 0 mg l 1 which represents 3 8 of the influent p load the nh4 n concentration in the primary and secondary thickener overflows were 53 4 and 5 8 mg l 1 respectively 29 5 of the stored poly p was released in the mixing chamber and po4 p concentration in the centrifuge centrate was 49 2 mg l 1 3 6 of the influent p with a nh4 n concentration of 921 1 mg l 1 the sludge blanket height in the primary thickener was 0 80 m and 8301 nm3 d 1 of biogas was produced under the current configuration p recovered as map from the centrifuge centrate would give a production of 91 5 tmap year 1 assuming 95 crystallizer efficiency it is important to note that the po4 p concentration in this recovery stream was 3 6 of the influent p load 3 3 2 alternative configurations c1 and c2 the proposed configurations see figs 3 and 4 were optimized by modifying different operating conditions figs 5 and 6 show the simulation results in terms of potential p recovery from the p enriched streams and phosphate concentration under different operational conditions figs s5 and s6 show the p mass balances in the optimized scenario for each configuration as can be seen in fig 5 reducing qps from 5685 to 1500 m3 d 1 increased po4 concentration in the recovery stream from 82 6 to 250 2 mgp l 1 however as shown fig 6 the influent extraction efficiency was reduced from 50 7 to 36 7 while the sludge blanket height rose from 0 65 to 1 15 m data not shown according to the specifications of the crystallization process it was necessary to achieve as high a phosphate concentration as possible in the recovery stream and to keep it above 80 mgp l 1 as the operational limitations of the primary settlers in the murcia este wwtp did not allow reducing qps below 2500 m3 d 1 it was decided to fix qps around 2500 m3 d 1 in this condition the phosphate concentration was 169 1 mgp l 1 with an extraction efficiency of 43 1 raising qelut to 1000 m3 d 1 increased po4 p concentration in the recovery stream by about 3 the negligible effect of qelut on p extraction was due to the mixing chamber volume and its high hydraulic retention time around 24 h promoted fermentation and extraction of the pao internal poly p so that it was not necessary to mix primary and secondary sludge in the mixing chamber these results indicate that the optimal c1 operational conditions were qps 2500 m3 d 1 with no elutriation flow considering a 95 efficiency of p recovery as map the annual production after crystallizing map would be 1053 3 tmap year 1 the reduction of qdig from the current value of 787 m3 d 1 to 500 m3 d 1 increased the extraction efficiency from 43 1 to 48 3 however this reduction of the sludge digestion flow was not considered due to a drastic rise in sludge blanket height up to 1 57 m which compromised overall c1 performance due to the risk of the overflow of the primary thickeners changing qps and qelut in the c2 simulations showed that reducing qps from 5685 to 1500 m3 d 1 without elutriation did not significantly increase the po4 p concentration in the recovery stream from 46 2 to 56 9 mgp l 1 raising qelut up to 1000 m3 d 1 increased the concentration in the recovery stream reaching up to 104 2 mgp l 1 for qps 2500 m3 d 1 and 135 2 mgp l 1 for 1500 m3 d 1 the recovery efficiencies were 44 2 48 2 and 47 4 for qps of 1500 m3 d 1 2500 m3 d 1 and 5685 m3 d 1 respectively qps 2500 m3 d 1 with qelut 1000 m3 d 1 was considered the optimal operating conditions for this configuration figs 5 and 6 the annual map production increased by up to 1176 8 t year 1 with the same crystallization efficiency as in c1 regarding anaerobic digestion performance biogas production increased by around 1 5 in c1 and 7 4 in c2 due to the higher organic load in the anaerobic digesters due to the increase of the cod load in the digesters see table 7 3 4 reduction of uncontrolled p precipitation the implementation of both sludge line configurations significantly reduced uncontrolled precipitation in relation to the current configuration c0 of around 52 9 in c1 and 60 0 in c2 the digesters remained as the main p sink in the sludge line with around 90 of total precipitation the available po4 in the overflows and centrates increased from 65 8 kgp d 1 7 4 of the influent p load in the original configuration c0 to 421 4 kgp d 1 for c1 and 476 1 kgp d 1 for c2 fig 7 considering all the overflows and centrates which represent 47 4 and 53 6 of the influent p load respectively 3 5 life cycle costs taec per ton of po4 p in the recovery stream and per hm3 of treated wastewater are shown in fig 8 a and b respectively for each configuration the cost was divided into opex and capex considering 10 depreciation for 20 years considering the differential elements in the sludge line and its operation between the three studied configurations regarding the results normalized per ton of po4 p fig 8a taec for c0 was 22 565 and was reduced by 92 8 in c1 and 91 7 in c2 these reductions were clearly due to the large amount of phosphorus recovered in the alternatives focused on phosphorus extraction and recovery before anaerobic digestion c1 and c2 compared to the current configuration which recovers phosphorus after anaerobic digestion c0 however normalizing the cost with a conventional functional unit i e the influent flowrate of treated wastewater in hm3 the taec changed drastically obtaining values of 7696 hm 3 6341 hm 3 and 8236 hm 3 for c0 c1 and c2 respectively fig 8b in this case c1 again obtained the lowest taec 17 6 lower than c0 due to the significant reduction of maintenance costs to mitigate uncontrolled p precipitation in the sludge line and higher biogas production despite the slight increase in the energy requirements around 3 2 increase from c0 to c1 mainly due to the thickening process and mixing chamber agitation despite the greater reduction in maintenance costs and higher biogas production c2 obtained the highest teac due to higher energy and chemical consumption and the acquisition cost of new dynamic thickeners capex was 6 9 of taec for c1 and 13 2 for c2 this difference was mainly due to the cost associated with the dynamic thickeners to obtain the po4 enriched stream c2 required the acquisition of 4 dynamic thickeners to treat 4530 m3 d 1 of sludge c1 did not need any specific equipment to obtain this po4 enriched stream this configuration employed the existing primary thickeners to separate the soluble po4 p in a specific stream assuming 95 efficiency in the subsequent crystallization phase and a map market price between 55 and 300 tmap 1 the investment in the sludge line would be recovered in between 5 and 27 months for c1 and from 11 to 61 months for c2 the results obtained in the lcc analysis confirmed that the sludge management configuration based on the elutriation in the primary thickeners c1 presented the lowest cost per ton of po4 p in the recovery stream and per hm3 of treated wastewater 3 6 life cycle assessment simapro 8 5 was used to compare the differential elements in operating the different configurations fig 9 a shows the global warming gw impact of the three approaches per t of po4 p in the recovery stream for c0 gw was the highest 46 007 kg co2eq tpo4 p 1 gw for c1 and c2 was very similar 3917 kg co2eq tpo4 p 1 and 4088 kg co2eq tpo4 p 1 respectively despite the higher p recovery in c2 the gw impact of this configuration is similar to the one obtained in c1 due to its higher emissions associated to the increase in the energy and chemicals consumption however using the influent flowrate of treated wastewater hm3 as the functional unit to normalize the impacts fig 9b c2 emissions increased up to 14 2 over c0 and its gw impact was 15 690 kg co2eq hm 3 whilst for c1 it was reduced by up to 2 0 fig 9b despite the fact that c1 produced less biogas it required substantially less energy for sludge pumping and thickening the lower impact of c1 was mainly related to higher biogas production a similar behaviour between alternatives was observed in other impact categories such as terrestrial acidification freshwater eutrophication and mineral resource scarcity further information on other environmental indicators can be found in figs s7 s20 and table s1 same as in the cost analysis the results obtained in the lca confirmed that the sludge management configuration based on the elutriation in the primary thickeners c1 presented the lowest impacts per ton of po4 p in the recovery stream and per hm3 of treated wastewater 4 discussion currently most studies on recovering phosphorus as struvite from wastewater focus on crystallization of the centrates after the digestion process egle et al 2016 nättorp et al 2017 sena and hicks 2018 and disregard the enormous amount of phosphorus that is lost due to uncontrolled precipitation during and after anaerobic digestion only a few studies have explored new sludge management strategies to minimize this phosphorus loss for example those based on phosphorus extraction and separation in a specific stream before the anaerobic digesters lizarralde et al 2019 martí et al 2017 these strategies have been evaluated in different studies bouzas et al 2019 cullen et al 2013 but have never been compared to a real case study under technical economic and environmental criteria the present work tested both configurations jointly with the classical system using the centrates from anaerobic digesters lizarralde et al 2019 simulated different phosphorus management strategies in the sur wwtp madrid spain including among others a wasstrip based process and achieved 23 8 of the influent phosphorus present as phosphate in the extraction stream this is lower than the one obtained in the present work 48 5 mainly due to the lower efficiency of the biological phosphorus removal in the water line 73 in the sur wwtp and 96 in the murcia este wwtp which considerably reduced potential phosphorus recovery however the results obtained in the present study are in agreement with those obtained by gysin et al 2018 who found that the potential recovery of the wasstrip process was between 45 and 60 of the influent p load bouzas et al 2019 evaluated the overall performance of the

confirms that the implementation of any of the proposed configurations to modify sludge management before anaerobic digestion is economically viable and highly efficient in comparison with the currently widespread post digestion recovery technologies optimal c1 operation increased po4 concentration in the recovery stream by up to 169 1 mgp l 1 corresponding to 43 1 of the influent p load and reduced uncontrolled p precipitation by 53 in comparison to c0 on the other hand the optimal operation of c2 was able to recover 48 2 of the influent p load with a concentration of 104 2 mgp l 1 reducing uncontrolled precipitation by up to 60 in comparison to c0 despite its slightly lower recovery potential c1 shows a significantly lower capex and opex mainly because this configuration does not require the acquisition of dynamic thickeners to obtain the po4 enriched stream from sludge and has lower sludge pumping flows and a smaller environmental impact the analysis of the implementation of both alternatives in the murcia este wwtp showed c1 has a lower taec roi and environmental footprint and is therefore considered the most favourable sludge line configuration for p recovery these

18002,as phosphorus is a non renewable resource mainly used to produce fertilizers and helps to provide food all over the world the proper management of its reserves is a global concern since it is expected to become scarcer in the near future in this work we assessed two different sludge line configurations aiming for p extraction and recovery before anaerobic digestion and compared them with the classical configuration this study has been performed by simulation with the model bnrm2 integrated in the software package desass 7 1 configuration 1 was based on the production of a po4 enriched stream from sludge via elutriation in the primary thickeners while configuration 2 was based on the wasstrip process and its po4 enriched stream was mechanically obtained with dynamic thickeners in both alternatives recovery was enhanced by promoting poly phosphate poly p extraction under anaerobic conditions for which both configurations were fully evaluated in a full scale wwtp both were also optimized to maximize phosphorus extraction their costs and life cycles were also analysed the novelty of this research lies in the lack of literature about the integral evaluation of pre anaerobic digestion p recovery from wastewaters this study included a holistic approach and an optimization study of both alternatives plus their economic and environmental aspects in configuration 1 the po4 p load in the recovery stream reached 43 1 of the total influent p load and reduced uncontrolled p precipitation in the sludge line up to 52 9 in configuration 2 extraction was 48 2 of the influent p load and it reduced precipitation by up to 60 0 despite configuration 1 s lower phosphorus recovery efficiency it had a 23 0 lower life cycle cost and a 14 2 lower global warming impact per hm3 of treated influent than configuration 2 configuration 1 also reduced the taec by 17 6 and global warming impact by 2 0 less than configuration 0 graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus recovery extraction elutriation sludge management mathematical modelling waste water 1 introduction in nature phosphorus p is directly linked to life and biological activity as it provides energy to cells and is present in genetic material bones and other structures smit et al 2009 van dijk et al 2016 p causes pollution in aquatic ecosystems after excessive use of p fertilizers and the discharge of untreated wastewaters inducing algal blooms reducing the dissolved oxygen in the water column and triggering the formation of p deposits in sediments kroiss et al 2011 these issues are avoided by proper crop management and removing p in wastewater treatment plants wwtps p is currently removed in wwtps biologically enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr chemically or a combination of both methods cornel and schaum 2009 the combination of ebpr in the water line and anaerobic digestion in the sludge line is a triggering factor for the uncontrolled precipitation of p compounds inside and downstream digesters causing pipe blockages and deposits on the walls of pipelines reactors and other equipment martí et al 2017 the main use of p is in the food supply as more than 80 of the mined product is used in the food industry an increase in its demand is expected in the near future as living standards and the global population increase but also the depletion of its reserves ciéslik and konieczka 2017 robles et al 2020 p and phosphate rock are thus included in the list of critical raw materials ec 2017 around 90 of the highest quality reserves occur in western sahara and morocco china south africa jordan and the usa which adds extra complexity to its future supply of food as the resource has geopolitical interests and is subject to market fluctuations guedes et al 2014 several initiatives are now under way in an attempt to alleviate its scarcity including reuse and recovery within its cycle egle et al 2016 considered that implementing recovery techniques in wwtps could reduce central europe s dependence on external p supplies by up to a 40 these techniques contribute to the evolution from the wwtp to the wastewater resource recovery facility concept in which wastewater is not considered as a mixture of pollutants whose discharge into surface waters has to be avoided but a rich source of valuable products p forms organic or inorganic compounds in wwtps the organic fraction being up to 60 of total p in the sludge le corre et al 2009 its mineralization requires long retention times and takes place quantitatively in anaerobic sludge digestion inorganic p appears as i orthophosphate po4 which is easily separated and afterwards assimilated by plants and ii polyphosphate poly p the solid compound that some organisms poly p accumulating organisms pao store after po4 uptake the main p recovery product is struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o map which is considered a slow release fertilizer with low solubility and high p content 13 by mass map crystallizes at a ph of 7 5 when the molar ratio mg nh4 po4 is around 1 3 4 1 shih et al 2017 peng et al 2018 other recovered products as calcium phosphates have lower fertilizing potential robles et al 2020 direct application of p enriched sludge after stabilization involves a simple recovery technique however it is forbidden in many countries due to the likely presence of heavy metals persistent organic pollutants and pathogens harrison et al 2006 this together with the emergence of p recovery awareness has triggered the research development and full scale implementation of a wide variety of p recovery techniques from different streams after anaerobic digestion from sludge such as airprex nuresys and elophos or centrifuge centrate such as naskeo ostara pearl phospaq or struvia under acidic conditions more p can be recovered as a part of the organic matter is mineralized and the precipitated compounds re dissolve after anaerobic digestion seaborne and stuttgart processes nevertheless the potential of these processes is limited as they cannot avoid the uncontrolled precipitation of the previously indicated p compounds egle et al 2016 other configurations such as that described in pastor et al 2008 martí et al 2017 or the wasstrip process cullen et al 2013 aim to overcome this limitation by recovering p before anaerobic digestion life cycle assessment lca can quantify and compare the environmental impacts related to the process per functional unit iso 2006 and makes possible its comparison its use has been promoted by the united nations environmental program however it is rarely employed by decision makers despite its high potential guérin schneider et al 2018 post digestion processes have already been compared by different approaches and methods in a number of studies rodriguez garcia et al 2014 bradford hartke et al 2015 remy and jossa 2015 sena and hicks 2018 however none have compared pre digestion p recovery technologies also few studies have been carried out on the life cycle costing lcc of p recovery and these only deal with costs for post digestion technologies the existing literature is based on assessing the costs related to infrastructure energy chemicals personnel maintenance products by products and waste egle et al 2016 nättorp et al 2017 the novelty of this paper lies in its holistic assessment of technical economic and environmental aspects of three different p recovery strategies from sludge one after anaerobic digestion and two before anaerobic digestion for this purpose it is necessary to calibrate the model of the wwtp in order to obtain reliable results of the different p recovery strategies required for the lca and lcc analysis the post anaerobic digestion strategy is based on classical p recovery from the centrates produced during the dewatering process while the pre anaerobic digestion strategies are based on enhancing p extraction and separation by means of a novel elutriation process and a process based on the wasstrip 2 materials and methods both sludge line configurations assessed had the same goal to increase p recovery and reduce uncontrolled p precipitation during anaerobic digestion this can be achieved by enhancing poly p release from sludge and separating it before anaerobic digestion the first configuration c1 evaluated the potential to recover p by mixing both thickened sludges under anaerobic conditions in a mixing chamber and pumping the mixed sludge to the primary thickener to obtain a liquid po4 enriched stream to subsequently crystallize map fig 1 left the second configuration c2 was based on the wasstrip process the fermented primary sludge was separated in the primary thickeners to obtain a vfa enriched liquid stream which was added to the waste activated sludge was in a release tank a po4 enriched stream can then be mechanically separated from sludge and finally recovered by crystallizing map fig 1 right in both configurations vfa uptake and po4 release by pao took place under the anaerobic conditions in the mixing chamber c1 and release tank c2 for comparison purposes both configurations were assessed technically economically and environmentally in the murcia este wwtp spain the first step was the calibration of the biological nutrients removal model no 2 barat et al 2013 bnrm2 with information from three complete analytical campaigns to characterize the whole wwtp performance the different sludge line management strategies were then simulated on dessas 7 1 software ferrer et al 2008 to stablish the optimal operating conditions and finally were environmentally and economically evaluated 2 1 current murcia este wwtp configuration the murcia este wwtp mainstream consists of primary settling an a2o biological reactor with a total volume of 41 405 m3 3 9 of the volume is anaerobic 23 3 anoxic and 72 8 aerobic and secondary settling the sludge line configuration is made up of two primary gravity thickeners and two dissolved air flotation thickeners daf for waste activated sludge was however only one daf thickener is currently being used the thickened was is electromagnetically hydrolysed and mixed with the primary sludge in a 79 2 m3 chamber and then digested and dewatered to a final concentration of 20 25 of tss fig 2 shows the layout of the murcia este wwtp with the different streams characterized for model calibration 2 2 layout of the sludge line configurations evaluated the determining factor for the implementation of both configurations was extracting as much poly p as possible with the minimum investment cost by using as many elements of the current wwtp layout as possible c1 was based on the elutriation of mixed sludge in the primary thickeners and increasing the mixing chamber volume from 79 m3 to 609 m3 fig 3 with one of the secondary thickeners in this alternative the following effects were tested 1 different elutriation flows qelut from 0 to 1000 m3 d 1 2 reduced primary sludge flows from the current qps of 5685 m3 d 1 to 1500 m3 d 1 3 reduced sludge digestion flow qdig from the current operation flow 787 m3d 1 to 500 m3 d 1 c2 was based on the wasstrip configuration fig 4 in c2 the primary sludge was fermented in the primary thickeners and the vfa concentration in the overflow stream was increased by elutriation of the thickened sludge in the primary thickeners the vfa enriched primary thickener overflow was mixed with the was in the secondary thickeners which were converted into anaerobic p release tanks vtot 1060 m3 the next step was the separation of an enriched po4 p stream with a dynamic thickener the effect of increasing qelut from 0 to 1000 m3d 1 while reducing qps from 5685 to 1500 m3d 1 were tested in this configuration 2 3 analytical method total and volatile suspended solids tss vss total and soluble chemical oxygen demand codtot codsol total and soluble biological demand bodtot bodsol total and soluble phosphorus ptot psol total and soluble nitrogen ntot nsol orthophosphate po4 ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and soluble metals mgsol casol ksol analyses were carried out following standard methods apha 2012 alkalinity and vfa were analysed as described in moosbrugger et al 1992 2 4 assessing precipitation sludge line precipitation was estimated following the method described in martí et al 2008 by applying mass balances for volatile solids orthophosphate magnesium and potassium in the mixing chamber anaerobic digestion secondary digester and centrifuge for the current configuration plus primary thickener for c1 and the p release tanks and dynamic thickeners for c2 2 5 calibration and simulations the model calibration and all simulations were carried out on desass 7 1 software ferrer et al 2008 which runs the bnrm2 barat et al 2013 which includes all the equations parameters and components to accurately reproduce the biological and chemical processes in a wwtp for calibration purposes three intensive analytical campaigns where carried out at different points of the water and sludge lines under normal operating conditions these included an exhaustive characterization of different parameters see section 2 3 in the streams indicated in fig 2 a total of 15 samples were analysed in each campaign with between 16 and 18 parameters in each sample all the samples were composite for 24 h continuous sampling in the water line and manual composite samples in the sludge line the model was calibrated by tuning the different parameters to minimize the differences between the analytical results of three analytical campaigns and their respective simulations after which it was used to simulate the configurations above mentioned 2 6 life cycle cost the life cycle cost was assessed for each configuration calculating the annual cost considering the sludge line differential elements it was considered the opex cost associated to chemicals sludge disposal and energy consumption for operation and maintenance of thickening digestion including the maintenance cost associated to the uncontrolled precipitation dewatering and combined heating and power chp the capex considered for c1 and c2 were valves pumps variable frequency drives stirrers flow indicators and sludge blanket height controller indicators and transducers pipelines po4 analysers and dynamic thickeners see tables 1 and 2 capex were calculated at a 10 annual discount rate r and a project lifetime of 20 years t according with pretel et al 2016 the cost analysis is given in tables 3 and 4 maintenance included replacement of pumps valves stirrers blowers anti scaling investment and other differential elements all the sludge was assumed to be used for agricultural applications energy production was estimated at a methane calorific power of 38 000 kj m 3 and 35 efficiency seco et al 2018 as the same personnel were assumed to run the infrastructure after implementing both configurations this item was excluded from the lcc calculation as it was not a differential element maintenance costs were related to the replacement of equipment after its lifetime based on information retrieved from wwtp operators equipment providers and the cost of associated operations to reduce the effects of uncontrolled p precipitation the total annual equivalent cost taec was calculated as the sum of the annual capital expenses capex and operational requirements opex according to eq 1 ferrer et al 2015 1 t a e c r 1 r t 1 r t 1 c a p e x o p e x return on investment roi was calculated assuming a 95 map crystallization efficiency and a market value of between 55 and 300 tmmap 1 de vries et al 2017 2 7 life cycle assessment the life cycle assessment lca was performed according to une en iso 14040 iso 2006 the inventory of materials and processes which lists the volumes of inflows from the natural environment and the outflows released into it was compiled using the ecoinvent database v3 via simapro 8 5 pré consultants the netherlands the hierarchist recipe h v 1 02 midpoint method was employed to carry out the assessment of global warming gw quantified as kgco2 eq the three scenarios were evaluated with functional units of 1 t of po4 p in the recovery stream and a treated wastewater inflow of 1 hm3 only the differential elements were considered different authors consider that the infrastructure s contribution to the lca is negligible in comparison to the operational impacts bradford hartke et al 2015 remy and jossa 2015 kjerstadius et al 2017 in the present study minimum modifications of the current sludge line configuration c0 were required to set up the c1 and c2 configurations neither configuration required new reactors existing elements were used such as secondary thickeners not used in the current sludge management configuration only pumping pipes and new dynamic thickeners for c2 being necessary for these reasons and due to the lack of reliable information the environmental impact related to the infrastructure were omitted focusing on the operation of the three p recovery configurations 3 results 3 1 characterization table 5 shows the average values of the different parameters analysed during the three analytical campaigns together with standard deviations it is important to note the significant fermentation in the primary thickener which raised the vfa concentration from 95 mg cod l to 794 mgcod l this fermentation is a key aspect of the study since the mix of vfa and secondary sludge before the anaerobic digestion in the mixing chamber in c1 and in the release tank in c2 see fig 1 triggered poly p release also important is the increased ammonium concentration during anaerobic digestion due to hydrolysis and the reduced phosphate concentration which confirmed the high level of phosphorus precipitation see section 3 4 different mass balances were applied for phosphate magnesium and potassium in the mixing chamber anaerobic digestion secondary digester and centrifuge following martí et al 2008 to quantify uncontrolled p precipitation the analytical values determined the content of p mg and k in organic matter with values of 1 7 mgp 100 mgvss 1 0 5 mgmg 100 mgvss 1 1 1 mgk 100 mgvss 1 considering 32 7 of primary and 67 3 of secondary sludge uncontrolled p precipitation in the sludge line was 577 9 kgp d 1 anaerobic digestion being the hot spot as 95 7 of the precipitation took place there under the current wwtp configuration only 7 4 of the influent p load was present as po4 p in the primary and secondary thickening overflows and centrates from centrifuges 3 6 available only from centrates this low p availability confirmed that the classical recovery of phosphorus from centrates drastically reduces the potential recoverable p due to its precipitation 3 2 calibration the bnrm2 model was calibrated to fit the simulated results with the three analytical characterizations of the murcia este wwtp under steady state conditions as can be seen in figs s1 s4 the model was able to reproduce the biological and physical processes that took place in the entire wwtp which was fitted with the default values of the model parameters proposed in bnrm2 with the exception of some parameters related to biological phosphorus removal hydrolysis and fermentation the modified parameters are listed in table 6 the model simulations revealed significant differences in the behaviour of the bacteria responsible for biological p removal pao and organic matter hydrolysis and fermentation acidogenic bacteria before and after the mixing chamber probably due to electromagnetic hydrolysis of the biological sludge before the mixing chamber see fig 2 between streams 7 and 7 which probably reduced the bacteria s metabolism and performance it is remarkable the small volume of the anaerobic zone in the biological reactor 3 9 of the biological reactor which contrasts with the ability of the pao bacteria developed in the reactor to reach high p removal efficiencies around 97 for this reason different parameters involved in the pao metabolism were modified such as pha accumulation rate qpha and volatile fatty acids half saturation constants ka and kpro acidogenic activity μacid was modified in order to reproduce the high degree of fermentation observed at the bottom of the primary thickeners hydrolytic activity kh was changed in order to fit the experimentally measured soluble cod balance in the gravity thickeners this parameter was increased in the mixing chamber to simulate the effect of the electromagnetic hydrolyser after secondary thickening 3 3 phosphorus extraction evaluation 3 3 1 current configuration the three analytical campaigns established the baseline of the current wwtp under the current sludge line configuration c0 the po4 p concentration in the overflows of the primary and the secondary thickener were 5 2 and 3 0 mg l 1 which represents 3 8 of the influent p load the nh4 n concentration in the primary and secondary thickener overflows were 53 4 and 5 8 mg l 1 respectively 29 5 of the stored poly p was released in the mixing chamber and po4 p concentration in the centrifuge centrate was 49 2 mg l 1 3 6 of the influent p with a nh4 n concentration of 921 1 mg l 1 the sludge blanket height in the primary thickener was 0 80 m and 8301 nm3 d 1 of biogas was produced under the current configuration p recovered as map from the centrifuge centrate would give a production of 91 5 tmap year 1 assuming 95 crystallizer efficiency it is important to note that the po4 p concentration in this recovery stream was 3 6 of the influent p load 3 3 2 alternative configurations c1 and c2 the proposed configurations see figs 3 and 4 were optimized by modifying different operating conditions figs 5 and 6 show the simulation results in terms of potential p recovery from the p enriched streams and phosphate concentration under different operational conditions figs s5 and s6 show the p mass balances in the optimized scenario for each configuration as can be seen in fig 5 reducing qps from 5685 to 1500 m3 d 1 increased po4 concentration in the recovery stream from 82 6 to 250 2 mgp l 1 however as shown fig 6 the influent extraction efficiency was reduced from 50 7 to 36 7 while the sludge blanket height rose from 0 65 to 1 15 m data not shown according to the specifications of the crystallization process it was necessary to achieve as high a phosphate concentration as possible in the recovery stream and to keep it above 80 mgp l 1 as the operational limitations of the primary settlers in the murcia este wwtp did not allow reducing qps below 2500 m3 d 1 it was decided to fix qps around 2500 m3 d 1 in this condition the phosphate concentration was 169 1 mgp l 1 with an extraction efficiency of 43 1 raising qelut to 1000 m3 d 1 increased po4 p concentration in the recovery stream by about 3 the negligible effect of qelut on p extraction was due to the mixing chamber volume and its high hydraulic retention time around 24 h promoted fermentation and extraction of the pao internal poly p so that it was not necessary to mix primary and secondary sludge in the mixing chamber these results indicate that the optimal c1 operational conditions were qps 2500 m3 d 1 with no elutriation flow considering a 95 efficiency of p recovery as map the annual production after crystallizing map would be 1053 3 tmap year 1 the reduction of qdig from the current value of 787 m3 d 1 to 500 m3 d 1 increased the extraction efficiency from 43 1 to 48 3 however this reduction of the sludge digestion flow was not considered due to a drastic rise in sludge blanket height up to 1 57 m which compromised overall c1 performance due to the risk of the overflow of the primary thickeners changing qps and qelut in the c2 simulations showed that reducing qps from 5685 to 1500 m3 d 1 without elutriation did not significantly increase the po4 p concentration in the recovery stream from 46 2 to 56 9 mgp l 1 raising qelut up to 1000 m3 d 1 increased the concentration in the recovery stream reaching up to 104 2 mgp l 1 for qps 2500 m3 d 1 and 135 2 mgp l 1 for 1500 m3 d 1 the recovery efficiencies were 44 2 48 2 and 47 4 for qps of 1500 m3 d 1 2500 m3 d 1 and 5685 m3 d 1 respectively qps 2500 m3 d 1 with qelut 1000 m3 d 1 was considered the optimal operating conditions for this configuration figs 5 and 6 the annual map production increased by up to 1176 8 t year 1 with the same crystallization efficiency as in c1 regarding anaerobic digestion performance biogas production increased by around 1 5 in c1 and 7 4 in c2 due to the higher organic load in the anaerobic digesters due to the increase of the cod load in the digesters see table 7 3 4 reduction of uncontrolled p precipitation the implementation of both sludge line configurations significantly reduced uncontrolled precipitation in relation to the current configuration c0 of around 52 9 in c1 and 60 0 in c2 the digesters remained as the main p sink in the sludge line with around 90 of total precipitation the available po4 in the overflows and centrates increased from 65 8 kgp d 1 7 4 of the influent p load in the original configuration c0 to 421 4 kgp d 1 for c1 and 476 1 kgp d 1 for c2 fig 7 considering all the overflows and centrates which represent 47 4 and 53 6 of the influent p load respectively 3 5 life cycle costs taec per ton of po4 p in the recovery stream and per hm3 of treated wastewater are shown in fig 8 a and b respectively for each configuration the cost was divided into opex and capex considering 10 depreciation for 20 years considering the differential elements in the sludge line and its operation between the three studied configurations regarding the results normalized per ton of po4 p fig 8a taec for c0 was 22 565 and was reduced by 92 8 in c1 and 91 7 in c2 these reductions were clearly due to the large amount of phosphorus recovered in the alternatives focused on phosphorus extraction and recovery before anaerobic digestion c1 and c2 compared to the current configuration which recovers phosphorus after anaerobic digestion c0 however normalizing the cost with a conventional functional unit i e the influent flowrate of treated wastewater in hm3 the taec changed drastically obtaining values of 7696 hm 3 6341 hm 3 and 8236 hm 3 for c0 c1 and c2 respectively fig 8b in this case c1 again obtained the lowest taec 17 6 lower than c0 due to the significant reduction of maintenance costs to mitigate uncontrolled p precipitation in the sludge line and higher biogas production despite the slight increase in the energy requirements around 3 2 increase from c0 to c1 mainly due to the thickening process and mixing chamber agitation despite the greater reduction in maintenance costs and higher biogas production c2 obtained the highest teac due to higher energy and chemical consumption and the acquisition cost of new dynamic thickeners capex was 6 9 of taec for c1 and 13 2 for c2 this difference was mainly due to the cost associated with the dynamic thickeners to obtain the po4 enriched stream c2 required the acquisition of 4 dynamic thickeners to treat 4530 m3 d 1 of sludge c1 did not need any specific equipment to obtain this po4 enriched stream this configuration employed the existing primary thickeners to separate the soluble po4 p in a specific stream assuming 95 efficiency in the subsequent crystallization phase and a map market price between 55 and 300 tmap 1 the investment in the sludge line would be recovered in between 5 and 27 months for c1 and from 11 to 61 months for c2 the results obtained in the lcc analysis confirmed that the sludge management configuration based on the elutriation in the primary thickeners c1 presented the lowest cost per ton of po4 p in the recovery stream and per hm3 of treated wastewater 3 6 life cycle assessment simapro 8 5 was used to compare the differential elements in operating the different configurations fig 9 a shows the global warming gw impact of the three approaches per t of po4 p in the recovery stream for c0 gw was the highest 46 007 kg co2eq tpo4 p 1 gw for c1 and c2 was very similar 3917 kg co2eq tpo4 p 1 and 4088 kg co2eq tpo4 p 1 respectively despite the higher p recovery in c2 the gw impact of this configuration is similar to the one obtained in c1 due to its higher emissions associated to the increase in the energy and chemicals consumption however using the influent flowrate of treated wastewater hm3 as the functional unit to normalize the impacts fig 9b c2 emissions increased up to 14 2 over c0 and its gw impact was 15 690 kg co2eq hm 3 whilst for c1 it was reduced by up to 2 0 fig 9b despite the fact that c1 produced less biogas it required substantially less energy for sludge pumping and thickening the lower impact of c1 was mainly related to higher biogas production a similar behaviour between alternatives was observed in other impact categories such as terrestrial acidification freshwater eutrophication and mineral resource scarcity further information on other environmental indicators can be found in figs s7 s20 and table s1 same as in the cost analysis the results obtained in the lca confirmed that the sludge management configuration based on the elutriation in the primary thickeners c1 presented the lowest impacts per ton of po4 p in the recovery stream and per hm3 of treated wastewater 4 discussion currently most studies on recovering phosphorus as struvite from wastewater focus on crystallization of the centrates after the digestion process egle et al 2016 nättorp et al 2017 sena and hicks 2018 and disregard the enormous amount of phosphorus that is lost due to uncontrolled precipitation during and after anaerobic digestion only a few studies have explored new sludge management strategies to minimize this phosphorus loss for example those based on phosphorus extraction and separation in a specific stream before the anaerobic digesters lizarralde et al 2019 martí et al 2017 these strategies have been evaluated in different studies bouzas et al 2019 cullen et al 2013 but have never been compared to a real case study under technical economic and environmental criteria the present work tested both configurations jointly with the classical system using the centrates from anaerobic digesters lizarralde et al 2019 simulated different phosphorus management strategies in the sur wwtp madrid spain including among others a wasstrip based process and achieved 23 8 of the influent phosphorus present as phosphate in the extraction stream this is lower than the one obtained in the present work 48 5 mainly due to the lower efficiency of the biological phosphorus removal in the water line 73 in the sur wwtp and 96 in the murcia este wwtp which considerably reduced potential phosphorus recovery however the results obtained in the present study are in agreement with those obtained by gysin et al 2018 who found that the potential recovery of the wasstrip process was between 45 and 60 of the influent p load bouzas et al 2019 evaluated the overall performance of the calahorra wwtp spain after the implementation of the new sludge management based on the phosphorus extraction by elutriation in the primary thickeners equivalent to the c1 in the present work and found that this sludge management system reduced uncontrolled precipitation by 43 in agreement with the present study 52 9 however there are significant discrepancies in the amount of phosphate present in the extraction stream bouzas et al 2019 obtained 19 of influent phosphorus in the extraction stream as phosphate while this was 43 1 in the present study these discrepancies could be attributed to the low capacity of the primary thickener of the calahorra wwtp to admit more solids in the elutriation stream and the lower phosphorus removal efficiency than in murcia este wwtp between 80 and 92 in the former and 96 in the latter however further research is needed in a full scale experiment to confirm the simulated results of the present work 5 conclusions this study confirms that the implementation of any of the proposed configurations to modify sludge management before anaerobic digestion is economically viable and highly efficient in comparison with the currently widespread post digestion recovery technologies optimal c1 operation increased po4 concentration in the recovery stream by up to 169 1 mgp l 1 corresponding to 43 1 of the influent p load and reduced uncontrolled p precipitation by 53 in comparison to c0 on the other hand the optimal operation of c2 was able to recover 48 2 of the influent p load with a concentration of 104 2 mgp l 1 reducing uncontrolled precipitation by up to 60 in comparison to c0 despite its slightly lower recovery potential c1 shows a significantly lower capex and opex mainly because this configuration does not require the acquisition of dynamic thickeners to obtain the po4 enriched stream from sludge and has lower sludge pumping flows and a smaller environmental impact the analysis of the implementation of both alternatives in the murcia este wwtp showed c1 has a lower taec roi and environmental footprint and is therefore considered the most favourable sludge line configuration for p recovery these results show how performing complete holistic studies for each situation are essential to differentiate between apparently similar options can make substantial progress towards a new paradigm and

18003,a novel wastewater treatment process which couples chemically enhanced primary sedimentation ceps of sewage with acidogenic fermentation of sludge in tandem has recently been developed to improve the removal of pollutants and nutrients and recover valuable resources such as phosphorus and organics this study represented the first laboratory based examination on the level and removal of the emerging contaminants including retinoids i e retinoic acids ras and their metabolites and oestrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs e g 4 nonylphenol bisphenol a etc in sewage sludge and its supernatant during this novel wastewater treatment process the results showed that 65 of retinoids and 73 of edcs were removed from sewage after aluminum al based ceps while 80 of retinoids and 72 of edcs were removed after iron fe based ceps after acidogenic fermentation of the ceps sludge 50 and 58 of retinoids and 50 and 47 of edcs were further removed in the supernatants of al sludge and fe sludge respectively while there were comparable removals for these two classes of emerging contaminants during al and fe based ceps and sludge fermentation fe based ceps of sewage and sludge fermentation should be preferentially considered given the relatively lower production of fe sludge and lower accumulation of retinoids in fe sludge the levels of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge changed during acidogenic fermentation of fe sludge the removals of at 4 oxo ra i e the dominant retinoid and bisphenol a i e the dominant edc in the supernatant followed the pseudo first order reaction model with a half life of 1 62 days in the first two days and 1 55 days in the whole experiment of seven days respectively the results demonstrated the effective removal of emerging contaminants from the sewage and the supernatant during the ceps and acidogenic sludge fermentation graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging contaminants sewage sludge chemically enhanced primary sedimentation acidogenic fermentation 1 introduction due to its simple operation and large treatment capacity chemically enhanced primary sedimentation ceps has been increasingly applied for wastewater treatment in mega cities including hong kong los angeles mexico city and shanghai dsd 2009 harleman and murcott 1999 li et al 2018 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2019 this process that usually employs polyaluminum chloride pacl or ferric chloride fecl3 as the chemical coagulants for wastewater treatment can significantly enhance the removals of nutrients and chemical oxygen demand cod compared to conventional primary sedimentation poon and chu 1999 wang et al 2009 as a result the ceps process would produce a large amount of ceps sludge containing valuable resources like phosphorus and organics acidogenic fermentation of ceps sludge was thus proposed to recover these resources and reduce the waste sludge e g chen et al 2019 lin et al 2017b however little information was available about the effects of sewage ceps and sludge fermentation on the removal of emerging contaminants in sewage and sludge which may pose adverse effects to aquatic organisms even at ng l levels e g vajda et al 2008 yeung et al 2020 in recent years there has been an increasing concern regarding the presence of trace emerging contaminants such as retinoids and oestrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in aquatic environments xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 retinoids such as retinoic acids ras and their metabolites 4 oxo ras which are the derivatives of vitamin a are reported to lead to abnormal morphological development in amphibian and zebrafish embryos and trigger imposex development in females of the marine gastropod reishia clavigera at elevated levels yeung et al 2020 while oestrogenic edcs like alkylphenols and bisphenol a bpa are known as a class of chemicals that have an ability to induce oestrogen like responses to vertebrates e g fish intersex and male fish feminization vajda et al 2008 conventional sewage treatment works stws were designed for the removals of suspended solids cod and nutrients without consideration of the removal of emerging contaminants like retinoids and edcs as a result discharge of wastewater effluent from stws is a significant source for the continuous input of these contaminants into the aquatic environment zhou et al 2019 thus understanding of the levels and removals of retinoids and edcs during the novel wastewater treatment process which couples ceps with acidogenic sludge fermentation has noteworthy environmental implications on improving their removals and reducing their ecological risks to aquatic organisms hong kong has the largest ceps plant in the world i e stonecutters island sewage treatment works scistw which is currently treating 2 2 million m3 d of sewage and generating 630 tons d of dewatered sludge water 70 ju et al 2016 the removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs in wastewater during the short ceps process in scistw were shown to be comparable to those conventional stws with secondary biological treatment zhou et al 2019 the additional application of sludge acidogenic fermentation is expected to further reduce the levels of the contaminants in the supernatant due to the metabolisms by microorganisms given the removal of emerging contaminants by microorganisms is usually time dependent there is a need to determinate the optimal time for achieving the maximum removal efficiencies for retinoids and edcs in the supernatants using a laboratory based pilot scale treatment system this study aimed to 1 determine and compare the removal efficiencies of retinoids ras and 4 oxo ras and typical edcs e g 4 nonylphenol bisphenol a etc during the novel wastewater treatment process coupling al or fe based ceps with acidogenic sludge fermentation 2 determine the optimal time for acidogenic fermentation with the maximum removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge and 3 estimate the mass loss of retinoids and edcs in supernatant and sludge during treatment by acidogenic fermentation of the actual ceps sludge from the scistw it was hypothesized that retinoids and edcs in sewage could be significantly reduced by ceps due to chemical flocculation and sedimentation as well as by fermentation of the ceps sludge due to the metabolic activities of microorganisms to our knowledge this is the first systematic laboratory based examination of the removals of retinoids and edcs by the ceps based wastewater treatment process the study will provide useful information for the design and optimization of the treatment process with consideration of removing emerging environmental contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up 2 1 1 ceps of sewage and acidogenic fermentation of sludge raw sewage was collected from the stanley stw of hong kong and used in this experimental study like many other parts of the world this stw receives freshwater based wastewater and undergoes secondary biological treatment with activated sludge the examination on the removal of emerging contaminants from the sewage of this stw by the novel wastewater treatment process therefore can provide relevant information for many stws across the globe the average physiochemical parameters for the sewage influents are as follows ph 7 3 total chemical oxygen demand tcod 270 mg l soluble chemical oxygen demand scod 82 mg l total phosphorus tp 1 1 mg l orthophosphate phosphorus po4 p 0 45 mg l and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 17 mg l under the laboratory conditions chemical based ceps tests were conducted on fresh sewage samples with polyaluminum chloride pacl and ferric chloride fecl3 as the coagulants the simple sedimentation of 30 min for sewage without the coagulant addition was also conducted in comparison with the ceps treatment the sewage 4 5 l was dosed with 16 mg al l of pacl or 20 mg fe l of fecl3 as suggested by the previous study lin et al 2017b after the addition of the coagulants mechanical mixing was applied at 200 rpm for 1 min and then 30 rpm for 15 min followed by sedimentation for 60 min the supernatant was then siphoned off and the sediment sludge 250 ml each being 18 times reduced in volume compared to raw sewage was retained as the ceps sludge al sludge and fe sludge for the following sludge fermentation experiment for fermentation experiment 150 ml al sludge or fe sludge was filled into three 50 ml autoclaved glass bottles n 3 which were used as the anaerobic reactors these glass bottles were placed in a shaker at 37 c and 150 rpm given that the fermentation process can be largely completed in seven days lin et al 2017b here the fermentation experiment was carried out for seven days and then the sludge samples were collected for analysis 2 1 2 effect of time on fermentation of fe sludge actual fe sludge was collected from the scistw which is a large scale ceps treatment plant in hong kong the average physiochemical parameters for the sludge are as follows ph 6 0 suspended solids ss 20 g l volatile solids vs 16 g l tcod 32000 mg l scod 1700 mg l tp 310 mg l po4 p 66 mg l and nh4 n 150 mg l the fermentation experiments were carried out using 15 autoclaved glass bottles as anaerobic reactors each filled with 250 ml sludge these glass bottles were placed in a shaker at 37 c and 150 rpm for sludge acidogenic fermentation for seven days samples were collected at day 1 2 3 5 and 7 respectively for each day of sampling three bottles n 3 were taken to determine the concentrations of retinoids edcs and physiochemical parameters 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 extraction and analysis of retinoids and edcs a total of six retinoids and six edcs were analysed with seven isotope labelled compounds as the internal standards the retinoids include all trans ra at ra 13 cis ra 13c ra 9 cis ra 9c ra all trans 4 oxo ra at 4 oxo ra 13 cis 4 oxo ra 13c 4 oxo ra 9 cis 4 oxo ra 9c 4 oxo ra and the edcs include 4 nonylphenol 4 np bisphenol a bpa estrone e1 diethylstilbestrol des triclosan tcs triclocarban tcc extraction of samples and instrumental analyses were carried out following the previous method described by zhou et al 2019 briefly wastewater samples 20 50 ml each were extracted by solid phase extraction spe using waters oasis hlb cartridges 500 mg 6 ml while sludge samples 0 06 0 1 g each were freeze dried and extracted by ultrasonication with ethyl acetate all extracts were further purified by silica gel columns before injection to the hplc ms ms for the analysis of target compounds the target compounds were analysed using an agilent 1290 hplc coupled to a 3200 qtrap mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization esi source chromatographic separation of retinoids and edcs was performed on an agilent zorbax rrhd eclipse plus c 18 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm with its corresponding guard column 5 mm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min at 40 c the mass spectrometry was carried out in negative ion mode and the quantitative analysis of the target compounds was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode the relative recoveries for retinoids in wastewater and sludge samples varied from 65 to 160 and 70 158 respectively and those for edcs varied from 100 to 154 and 63 182 respectively please refer to zhou et al 2019 for more details about the analytical methodology 2 2 2 analysis of sewage and sludge for the physiochemical parameters the sewage and sludge ph were measured with a mettler toledo fg2 kit fivego portable ph meter switzerland sewage samples were filtered with glass fibre filters whatman gf f 0 7 μm uk and the filtrate was used to determine scod po4 p and nh4 n sludge samples from the reactors were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solids from supernatant for analysis of ss and vs the determination of ss vs tcod scod tp po4 p and nh4 n followed the standard methods apha 2005 2 3 mass balance analysis mass balance analysis was employed to estimate the mass flow of retinoids and edcs that enter and leave the treatment systems in wastewater supernatant and sludge forms during the ceps of sewage the loss mass mloss ng of a compound was calculated according to the following equation 1 mloss minfluent meffluent msupernatant msludge where minfluent meffluent msupernatant and msludge are the mass loads ng of the compound in the influent effluent supernatant and sludge respectively during the fermentation of sludge the loss mass mloss ng of a compound was calculated according to the following equation 2 mloss msupernatant msludge 0 msupernatant msludge t where msupernatant and msludge are the mass loads ng of the compound in the supernatant and sludge respectively the t represents the day of fermentation of sludge and 0 is the beginning of fermentation 3 results and discussion 3 1 removals of retinoids and edcs during the ceps treatment and fermentation of the ceps sludge 3 1 1 removals of retinoids and edcs from sewage by ceps during ceps treatment of the sewage pacl and fecl3 were usually employed as coagulants to remove suspended particles and particulate pollutants via coagulation flocculation and sedimentation dsd 2009 wang et al 2009 in this study 76 and 75 of tcod and 91 and 90 of tp were removed by al and fe based ceps treatment respectively which were obviously higher than the removals of tcod 32 removal and tp 14 removal by simple sedimentation table s1 these results together with the recent studies lin et al 2017a 2017b 2018 further confirmed the effectiveness of the rapid ceps process in removing conventional pollutants from domestic wastewater a similar removal pattern was also found for the emerging contaminants i e retinoids and edcs the total concentrations of retinoids and edcs in wastewater influent were 100 ng l and 1100 ng l respectively fig 1 a b after simple sedimentation only 8 of retinoids and 24 of edcs were removed from the sewage fig 1a b however 65 of retinoids and 73 of edcs were removed from the sewage after al based ceps treatment while 80 of retinoids and 72 of edcs were removed after fe based ceps treatment fig 1a b thus simple sedimentation contributed little to the removals of retinoids and edcs while al and fe based ceps resulted in significant removal of these emerging contaminants over two thirds removals from the sewage during the treatment process the retinoids were always dominated by at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra in wastewater accounting for 88 94 of total retinoid contents fig s1 the edcs were dominated by tcs in wastewater accounting for 45 48 of total edc contents followed by bpa 19 41 fig s1 the removal efficiency of micropollutants during coagulation flocculation is usually related with their physiochemical properties such as the octanol water partition coefficient log k ow luo et al 2014 the hydrophobic compounds with high log k ow values were more efficiently removed during the coagulation and flocculation process luo et al 2014 matamoros and salvadó 2013 suarez et al 2009 for example obvious removal 80 for organic musks was found in treatment of hospital wastewater by coagulation flocculation probably due to their strong lipophilic characteristics that promote their attachment to solid particles suarez et al 2009 in this study the dominant edcs i e tcs log k ow 4 7 71 74 removal 4 np log k ow 5 76 97 99 removal and tcc log k ow 4 9 87 90 removal exhibited better removals than bpa with a lower log k ow of 3 32 40 42 removal only a previous study reported that 90 of np in leachate was removed by treatment of coagulation and sedimentation with fecl3 but only 20 of bpa was removed during this treatment process due to most bpa partitioning in the supernatant asakura and matsuto 2009 which is consistent with the finding of this study it was also reported that coagulation with pacl could remove 30 of bpa for most of the cases ma et al 2009 according to the mass balance al and fe based ceps treatments removed 52 and 59 of retinoids respectively but only removed 30 and 21 of edcs respectively in the present experimental systems figs s2a and s2b their removal in the systems should be attributed mainly to the attachment and accumulation in sludge for tcc and tcs and possible destruction caused by the addition of pacl or fecl3 for 4 np bpa at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra figs s2a and s2b for example fecl3 might react with the phenol of some edcs like bpa via redox or complexation reactions park et al 2016 resulting in the decrease of their levels in the system based on the mass loads at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra were dominant retinoids in the systems accounting for 69 94 of the retinoid contents while tcs and tcc were dominant edcs accounting for 57 79 of the edc contents fig s3 lin et al 2017b reported that pacl exhibited about 20 higher removal efficiency than fecl3 in removing the conventional pollutants e g suspended solids by the ceps comparable removal efficiencies for the emerging contaminants i e retinoids and edcs were obtained for al and fe based ceps in the current study suggesting a high effectiveness of both coagulants i e pacl and fecl3 in removing these emerging contaminants probably due to their similar removal mechanisms i e coagulation flocculation and sedimentation for retinoids and edcs overall the removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs obtained from this laboratory study were somewhat higher than those 41 removal for retinoids and 53 removal for edcs from sewage in the scistw that employs fe based ceps process zhou et al 2019 suggesting that the unknown factors e g source of the sewage might affect the removal of emerging contaminants during actual operation of full scale sewage treatment works 3 1 2 retinoids and edcs during fermentation of sludge during the fermentation process the ceps sludge underwent hydrolysis from particulate organics to soluble organics i e scod and subsequent acidogenesis to produce volatile fatty acids as valuable resources lin and li 2018a 2018b acidogenic fermentation decreased the solution ph from 6 6 to 5 5 for al sludge and 6 5 to 5 9 for fe sludge fig s4 acidogenic fermentation increased the scod level in supernatant from 170 to 590 mg l for al sludge and from 160 to 990 mg l for fe sludge table s2 after 7 d acidogenic sludge fermentation 50 and 58 of retinoids and 50 and 47 of edcs were removed in the supernatants of the al sludge and fe sludge respectively fig 1c d however the concentrations of retinoids and edcs in the solid phase of sludge increased after fermentation fig 1e f suggesting that these chemicals were mainly transferred and accumulated in sludge in particular after acidogenic fermentation 13c ra showed a dramatic increase from 19 to 140 ng g dw in al sludge and from 25 to 97 ng g dw in fe sludge fig 1e the mass loads of retinoids mainly for at ra and 13c ra increased while edcs showed little change in mass loads during acidogenic fermentation of sludge figs s2c and s2d these results suggested that acidogenic fermentation stimulated the transformation of retinoic acids from their precursors or metabolites e g 4 oxo ras to retinoic acids in the anaerobic sludge but had little effect on the degradation of edcs especially for tcc and tcs the results of the mass balance analysis also confirmed that these chemicals were mainly transferred and accumulated in the sludge from supernatant this anaerobic fermentation process was closely associated with the activities of microbial communities ju et al 2016 2017 lin and li 2018a lin et al 2018 fe sludge would more easily undergo organic hydrolysis and acidogenesis than al sludge lin et al 2017b probably due to the different microbial community structures during the fermentation of al sludge and fe sludge ju et al 2016 in this study the removal and transformation of retinoic acids and their metabolites are highly likely attributed to the microbial activities during acidogenic fermentation while the microbial communities in al sludge may be able to accumulate more retinoids than those in fe sludge fig s2c more studies are warranted to investigate the species and abundance of microbial communities that account for the removal of retinoids in al and fe sludge in the future jang et al 2017 also reported that microbial communities were accountable for the removal of antibiotic resistance genes args during anaerobic digestion of the ceps sludge in the present study the sludge amount was 4 5 and 4 3 g l in terms of the mixed liquid suspended solid mlss for al and fe based ceps treatments respectively and they were reduced to 4 1 and 3 6 g l of mlss after acidogenic fermentation respectively fig s5 considering the relatively lower production of fe sludge and lower accumulation of retinoids in fe sludge when compared to that of al sludge fig 1e f it is proposed that fe based ceps should be preferentially considered for wastewater treatment it was reported that edcs like np and tcc in sludge could facilitate solubilisation and acidogenesis for the anaerobic fermentation process via improved microbial community diversities and activities duan et al 2016 wang et al 2017 in the meanwhile acidogenic bacteria had the abilities to degrade np during anaerobic fermentation of activated sludge duan et al 2018 which was also demonstrated with the ceps sludge in this study however our study showed that microbial activities in the fermentation systems had limited abilities to remove the dominant edcs i e tcc and tcs both chemicals are known as antibacterial agents wang et al 2017 yan et al 2019a after fermentation tcc and tcs were still accumulated in the sludge wang et al 2017 also reported that little removal of tcc was found during the anaerobic fermentation of activated sludge which is consistent with the results of ceps sludge fermentation in this study therefore the fermentation process does not likely to reduce the risks of tcc and tcs in the sludge mixture thus more effective strategies that can degrade tcc and tcs are needed to reduce their risks before the sludge disposal as at ra and 13c ra obviously increased in the sludge during its fermentation studies regarding the effects of retinoic acids on the microbial activities hydrolysis and acidogenesis of the sludge are warranted to better understand the fermentation process 3 2 changes and removals of retinoids and edcs during the fermentation of actual fe sludge to further determine the optimal time for acidogenic fermentation with the maximum removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge actual fe sludge was collected from the scistw and then used to investigate the time dependent removal of these two classes of emerging contaminants during acidogenic fermentation under laboratory conditions the ph value was time dependent during the acidogenic fermentation of fe sludge collected from the scistw fig 2 a the ph decreased from 6 0 to 5 4 in the first three days and then almost kept unchanged in the next four days a similar declining trend occurred for the amount of sludge mlss during fermentation fig 2a and a highly significant correlation was found between the sludge amount and ph value r 0 917 p 0 001 fig 2b the decrease of sludge amount was due to the hydrolysis of fe sludge from particulate organics to soluble organics while the decrease of ph was the result of the subsequent acidogenesis to produce volatile fatty acids lin and li 2018a 2018b during the acidogenic fermentation scod and po4 p were released into the supernatant fig s6 which could be recovered as valuable resources as described by lin et al 2017a 2018 the ph could markedly affect hydrolysis acidogenesis and the production of volatile fatty acids via its effect on microbial communities during the sludge fermentation lin and li 2018a maspolim et al 2015 yuan et al 2015 ju et al 2016 2017 similarly the levels of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge also changed with the time period of fermentation figs 3 s7 s8 during the fermentation of fe sludge the concentration of retinoids in the supernatant decreased with time fig 3 a which should be attributed to the reduction of at 4 oxo ra in the first two days fig s7 the concentrations of other retinoids i e at ra 13c ra and 13c 4 oxo ra in supernatant kept almost unchanged during the fermentation process fig s7 the concentration of retinoids in the solid phase of sludge increased with time fig 3a attributing mainly to the increase of 13c ra and at ra since the third day fig s7 the retinoids were dominated with at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra in supernatant 81 88 while at ra and 13c ra were the two dominant retinoids in sludge accounting for 75 95 of the total fig 3c this is partly due to the fact that retinoic acids are easily metabolized to the oxidative metabolites in the aqueous phase yeung et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 while the metabolites are relatively unstable in the anaerobic sludge and or the oxidation of retinoic acids is inhibited in the anaerobic sludge zhou et al 2019 it was reported that no oxidative metabolites were found in the dewatered sludge collected from scistw zhou et al 2019 suggesting that the fraction of retinoic acids in the sludge would further increase with the period of the anaerobic fermentation process like retinoids a similar trend was found for edcs during the acidogenic fermentation of fe sludge the concentration of edcs in supernatant decreased with time while it increased slightly in sludge fig 3b 4 np and bpa were the dominant edcs accounting for 89 97 in supernatant while in sludge the edcs were dominated by tcc and tcs accounting for 85 92 of the total fig 3d the results are in good agreement with our previous study zhou et al 2019 that 4 np and bpa are easily partitioned to the aqueous phase due to their relatively high water solubility whilst tcc and tcs are more accumulated in the sludge due to strong sorption to the solid phase the concentration of 4 np in supernatant increased in the first two days and then decreased in the following five days while the concentration of bpa decreased continuously during the fermentation fig s8 the fluctuation of 4 np concentration might be due to the degradation of their alkylphenol ethoxylates apes parent compounds johnson and sumpter 2001 the removal of at 4 oxo ra i e the dominant retinoid was biphasic with a faster phase i e following pseudo first order kinetics with a half life of 1 62 days in the first two days while its level kept almost unchanged in the following five days fig 4 a however the removal of bpa i e the dominant edc followed the pseudo first order reaction model during the whole experiment of seven days with a half life of 1 55 days fig 4b the mass loads of retinoids in the system fluctuated during sludge fermentation with the maximum value occurring on the fifth day fig s9a at ra and 13c ra were the two dominant retinoids accounting for 68 94 of the total fig s9c little of at ra and 13c ra 4 was partitioned to the supernatant phase fig s10 but for at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra the ratio partitioning to the supernatant accounted for over 20 fig s10 the mass loads of edcs in the system kept almost unchanged during fermentation fig s9b even though the levels of bpa in supernatant and sludge clearly decreased figs s8 and s11 the fraction of bpa partitioning to the supernatant accounted for 6 22 fig s11 a quick sorption of bpa on the sludge via binding to extracellular polymeric substances yan et al 2019b and subsequent biodegradation should be the key removal mechanisms in this regard zhao et al 2008 tcc was the dominant edc compound in the system accounting for 50 60 of the total followed by tcs 26 37 and bpa 8 16 fig s9d no degradation of tcc and tcs was found during acidogenic fermentation almost all of tcc and tcs were partitioned to the sludge fig s11 which is consistent with the previous findings e g zhou et al 2019 a recent study reported that extracellular polymeric substances the main interfacial components of activated sludge also played a crucial role in the binding of tcs in sludge yan et al 2019a 3 3 estimation of mass loss of retinoids and edcs when adding sludge fermentation in scistw we further estimated the mass loss of retinoids and edcs in supernatant and sludge during acidogenic fermentation of the actual ceps sludge collected from the world s largest ceps plant i e scistw based on the mass analysis method of zhou et al 2019 the mass loads of retinoids and edcs in the wastewater influent 2 2 million m3 d of scistw were about 39 g d and 14 000 g d respectively about 41 and 53 of retinoids and edcs were removed from the sewage after the ceps in scistw zhou et al 2019 considering the sludge treatment costs and the relatively low concentrations of retinoids and edcs in this study we calculated the change of mass loads of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge after one day of acidogenic sludge fermentation the volume of supernatant accounted for about 1 30 of volume of the influent in scistw table 1 the additional acidogenic sludge fermentation process 1 d could further remove 1 3 g d retinoids and 190 g d edcs from the supernatant phase table 1 accounting for about 3 3 and 1 4 of the mass loads of retinoids and edcs in the influent thus the sludge fermentation process would contribute relatively little to the removal of emerging contaminants in the whole treatment process that couples ceps of sewage with acidogenic fermentation of sludge in tandem nonetheless it should be noted that acidogenic sludge fermentation can effectively decrease the level of emerging contaminants in the supernatant of the sludge which is favourable to the utilization of the supernatant liquor for resource recovery and other beneficial uses lin et al 2017a further research studies are warranted to develop innovative technologies for improving the removal efficiency of edcs from the solid phase of sludge to reduce the ecological and public health risks of the sludge 3 4 environmental implications sewage treatment processes in stws play an important role in removing conventional pollutants and emerging contaminants using a laboratory based pilot setup this study compared the removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs during two commonly used ceps processes i e al and fe based the results demonstrated that the two processes had comparable removal efficiencies for these emerging contaminants when compared with the widely used activated sludge process zhou et al 2019 further studies are needed to optimize the treatment process by altering the environmental parameters e g temperature and ph so that the removal of emerging contaminants can be enhanced thereby minimizing their ecological risks to aquatic organisms given that acidogenic fermentation of the ceps sludge could further reduce the levels of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant while the supernatant is to be processed for resource recovery lin et al 2017a 2018 this ceps based novel treatment process is expected to be increasingly applied for wastewater treatment in megacities worldwide in the future the ceps process is shown to be more cost effective than and highly competitive with the conventional wastewater treatment process for example the scistw that uses ceps has a hydraulic retention time hrt of less than 1 5 h which is much shorter than the hrts of the activated sludge based secondary treatment in the two reported stws 20 h for shatin stw and 13 6 h for stanley stw zhou et al 2019 overall the costs of ceps for wastewater treatment are much less than half of that of the secondary wastewater treatment chagnon and harleman 2002 acidogenic fermentation of ceps sludge can further reduce the treatment cost by recovering the organic carbon resources from the sludge lin et al 2017a 2018 whilst the removal of emerging contaminants in the supernatant during sludge fermentation is an additional achievement 4 conclusions this study represented the first comprehensive comparison regarding the removals of retinoids and edcs from the sewage by the al and fe based ceps treatments the results showed that these two processes exhibited the comparable removal efficiencies for the two classes of emerging contaminants over two thirds removals the removals were contributable mainly to the chemical sorption and accumulation in the ceps sludge investigation was also conducted on the levels and removals of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge during the acidogenic fermentation of al and fe based ceps sludge about half of retinoids and edcs was further removed from the supernatant during acidogenic fermentation of the ceps sludge while the amount of the chemicals in the solid phase of sludge increased fe based ceps coupled with fermentation of the sludge is preferentially recommended for wastewater treatment considering the relatively lower production of fe sludge and the lower accumulation of retinoids in fe sludge when compared to that of al sludge the levels of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge changed with time during the fermentation of actual fe sludge by applying sludge fermentation retinoids and edcs in the supernatant would decrease which is beneficial to the resource recovery and utilization of the supernatant while the chemicals will be concentrated into the solid phase of the sludge for disposal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18003,a novel wastewater treatment process which couples chemically enhanced primary sedimentation ceps of sewage with acidogenic fermentation of sludge in tandem has recently been developed to improve the removal of pollutants and nutrients and recover valuable resources such as phosphorus and organics this study represented the first laboratory based examination on the level and removal of the emerging contaminants including retinoids i e retinoic acids ras and their metabolites and oestrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs e g 4 nonylphenol bisphenol a etc in sewage sludge and its supernatant during this novel wastewater treatment process the results showed that 65 of retinoids and 73 of edcs were removed from sewage after aluminum al based ceps while 80 of retinoids and 72 of edcs were removed after iron fe based ceps after acidogenic fermentation of the ceps sludge 50 and 58 of retinoids and 50 and 47 of edcs were further removed in the supernatants of al sludge and fe sludge respectively while there were comparable removals for these two classes of emerging contaminants during al and fe based ceps and sludge fermentation fe based ceps of sewage and sludge fermentation should be preferentially considered given the relatively lower production of fe sludge and lower accumulation of retinoids in fe sludge the levels of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge changed during acidogenic fermentation of fe sludge the removals of at 4 oxo ra i e the dominant retinoid and bisphenol a i e the dominant edc in the supernatant followed the pseudo first order reaction model with a half life of 1 62 days in the first two days and 1 55 days in the whole experiment of seven days respectively the results demonstrated the effective removal of emerging contaminants from the sewage and the supernatant during the ceps and acidogenic sludge fermentation graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging contaminants sewage sludge chemically enhanced primary sedimentation acidogenic fermentation 1 introduction due to its simple operation and large treatment capacity chemically enhanced primary sedimentation ceps has been increasingly applied for wastewater treatment in mega cities including hong kong los angeles mexico city and shanghai dsd 2009 harleman and murcott 1999 li et al 2018 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2019 this process that usually employs polyaluminum chloride pacl or ferric chloride fecl3 as the chemical coagulants for wastewater treatment can significantly enhance the removals of nutrients and chemical oxygen demand cod compared to conventional primary sedimentation poon and chu 1999 wang et al 2009 as a result the ceps process would produce a large amount of ceps sludge containing valuable resources like phosphorus and organics acidogenic fermentation of ceps sludge was thus proposed to recover these resources and reduce the waste sludge e g chen et al 2019 lin et al 2017b however little information was available about the effects of sewage ceps and sludge fermentation on the removal of emerging contaminants in sewage and sludge which may pose adverse effects to aquatic organisms even at ng l levels e g vajda et al 2008 yeung et al 2020 in recent years there has been an increasing concern regarding the presence of trace emerging contaminants such as retinoids and oestrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in aquatic environments xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 retinoids such as retinoic acids ras and their metabolites 4 oxo ras which are the derivatives of vitamin a are reported to lead to abnormal morphological development in amphibian and zebrafish embryos and trigger imposex development in females of the marine gastropod reishia clavigera at elevated levels yeung et al 2020 while oestrogenic edcs like alkylphenols and bisphenol a bpa are known as a class of chemicals that have an ability to induce oestrogen like responses to vertebrates e g fish intersex and male fish feminization vajda et al 2008 conventional sewage treatment works stws were designed for the removals of suspended solids cod and nutrients without consideration of the removal of emerging contaminants like retinoids and edcs as a result discharge of wastewater effluent from stws is a significant source for the continuous input of these contaminants into the aquatic environment zhou et al 2019 thus understanding of the levels and removals of retinoids and edcs during the novel wastewater treatment process which couples ceps with acidogenic sludge fermentation has noteworthy environmental implications on improving their removals and reducing their ecological risks to aquatic organisms hong kong has the largest ceps plant in the world i e stonecutters island sewage treatment works scistw which is currently treating 2 2 million m3 d of sewage and generating 630 tons d of dewatered sludge water 70 ju et al 2016 the removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs in wastewater during the short ceps process in scistw were shown to be comparable to those conventional stws with secondary biological treatment zhou et al 2019 the additional application of sludge acidogenic fermentation is expected to further reduce the levels of the contaminants in the supernatant due to the metabolisms by microorganisms given the removal of emerging contaminants by microorganisms is usually time dependent there is a need to determinate the optimal time for achieving the maximum removal efficiencies for retinoids and edcs in the supernatants using a laboratory based pilot scale treatment system this study aimed to 1 determine and compare the removal efficiencies of retinoids ras and 4 oxo ras and typical edcs e g 4 nonylphenol bisphenol a etc during the novel wastewater treatment process coupling al or fe based ceps with acidogenic sludge fermentation 2 determine the optimal time for acidogenic fermentation with the maximum removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge and 3 estimate the mass loss of retinoids and edcs in supernatant and sludge during treatment by acidogenic fermentation of the actual ceps sludge from the scistw it was hypothesized that retinoids and edcs in sewage could be significantly reduced by ceps due to chemical flocculation and sedimentation as well as by fermentation of the ceps sludge due to the metabolic activities of microorganisms to our knowledge this is the first systematic laboratory based examination of the removals of retinoids and edcs by the ceps based wastewater treatment process the study will provide useful information for the design and optimization of the treatment process with consideration of removing emerging environmental contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up 2 1 1 ceps of sewage and acidogenic fermentation of sludge raw sewage was collected from the stanley stw of hong kong and used in this experimental study like many other parts of the world this stw receives freshwater based wastewater and undergoes secondary biological treatment with activated sludge the examination on the removal of emerging contaminants from the sewage of

17 mg l under the laboratory conditions chemical based ceps tests were conducted on fresh sewage samples with polyaluminum chloride pacl and ferric chloride fecl3 as the coagulants the simple sedimentation of 30 min for sewage without the coagulant addition was also conducted in comparison with the ceps treatment the sewage 4 5 l was dosed with 16 mg al l of pacl or 20 mg fe l of fecl3 as suggested by the previous study lin et al 2017b after the addition of the coagulants mechanical mixing was applied at 200 rpm for 1 min and then 30 rpm for 15 min followed by sedimentation for 60 min the supernatant was then siphoned off and the sediment sludge 250 ml each being 18 times reduced in volume compared to raw sewage was retained as the ceps sludge al sludge and fe sludge for the following sludge fermentation experiment for fermentation experiment 150 ml al sludge or fe sludge was filled into three 50 ml autoclaved glass bottles n 3 which were used as the anaerobic reactors these glass bottles were placed in a shaker at 37 c and 150 rpm given that the fermentation process can be largely completed in seven days lin et al 2017b here the fermentation experiment was carried out for seven days and then the sludge samples were collected for analysis 2 1 2 effect of time on fermentation of fe sludge actual fe sludge was collected from the scistw which is a large scale ceps

po4 p 66 mg l and nh4 n 150 mg l the fermentation experiments were carried out using 15 autoclaved glass bottles as anaerobic reactors each filled with 250 ml sludge these glass bottles were placed in a shaker at 37 c and 150 rpm for sludge acidogenic fermentation for seven days samples were collected at day 1 2 3 5 and 7 respectively for each day of sampling three bottles n 3 were taken to determine the concentrations of retinoids edcs and physiochemical parameters 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 extraction and analysis of retinoids and edcs a total of six retinoids and six edcs were analysed with seven isotope labelled compounds as the internal standards the retinoids include all trans ra at ra 13 cis ra 13c ra 9 cis ra 9c ra all trans 4 oxo ra at 4 oxo ra 13 cis 4 oxo ra 13c 4 oxo ra 9 cis 4 oxo ra 9c 4 oxo ra and the edcs include 4 nonylphenol 4 np bisphenol a bpa estrone e1 diethylstilbestrol des triclosan tcs triclocarban tcc extraction of samples and instrumental analyses were carried out following the previous method described by zhou et al 2019 briefly wastewater samples 20 50 ml each were extracted by solid phase extraction spe using waters oasis hlb cartridges 500 mg 6 ml while sludge samples 0 06 0 1 g each were freeze dried and extracted by ultrasonication with ethyl acetate all extracts were further purified by silica gel columns before injection to the hplc ms ms for the analysis of target compounds the target compounds were analysed using an agilent 1290 hplc coupled to a 3200 qtrap mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization esi source chromatographic separation of retinoids and edcs was performed on an agilent zorbax rrhd eclipse plus c 18 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm with its corresponding guard column 5 mm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min at 40 c the mass spectrometry was carried out in negative ion mode and the quantitative analysis of the target compounds was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode the relative recoveries for retinoids in wastewater and sludge samples varied from 65 to 160 and 70 158 respectively and those for edcs varied from 100 to 154 and 63 182 respectively please refer to zhou et al 2019 for more details about the analytical methodology 2 2 2 analysis of sewage and sludge for the physiochemical parameters the sewage and sludge ph were measured with a mettler toledo fg2 kit fivego portable ph meter switzerland sewage samples were filtered with glass fibre filters whatman gf f 0 7 μm uk and the filtrate was used to determine scod po4 p and nh4 n sludge samples from the reactors were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solids from supernatant for analysis of ss and vs the determination of ss vs tcod scod tp po4 p and nh4 n followed the standard methods apha 2005 2 3 mass balance analysis mass balance analysis was employed to estimate the mass flow of retinoids and edcs that enter and leave the treatment systems in wastewater supernatant and sludge forms during the ceps of sewage the loss mass mloss ng of a compound was calculated according to the following equation 1 mloss minfluent meffluent msupernatant msludge where minfluent meffluent msupernatant and msludge are the mass loads ng of the compound in the influent effluent supernatant and sludge respectively during the fermentation of sludge the loss mass mloss ng of a compound was calculated according to the following equation 2 mloss msupernatant msludge 0 msupernatant msludge t where msupernatant and msludge are the mass loads ng of the compound in the supernatant and sludge respectively the t represents the day of fermentation of sludge and 0 is the beginning of fermentation 3 results and discussion 3 1 removals of retinoids and edcs during the ceps treatment and fermentation of the ceps sludge 3 1 1 removals of retinoids and edcs from sewage by ceps during ceps treatment of the sewage pacl and fecl3 were usually employed as coagulants to remove suspended particles and particulate pollutants via coagulation flocculation and sedimentation dsd 2009 wang et al 2009 in this study 76 and 75 of tcod and 91 and 90 of tp were removed by al and fe based ceps treatment respectively which were obviously higher than the removals of tcod 32 removal and tp 14 removal by simple sedimentation table s1 these results together with the recent studies lin et al 2017a 2017b 2018 further confirmed the effectiveness of the rapid ceps process in removing conventional pollutants from domestic wastewater a similar removal pattern was also found for the emerging contaminants i e retinoids and edcs the total concentrations of retinoids and edcs in wastewater influent were 100 ng l and 1100 ng l respectively fig 1 a b after simple sedimentation only 8 of retinoids and 24 of edcs were removed from the sewage fig 1a b however 65 of retinoids and 73 of edcs were removed from the sewage after al based ceps treatment while 80 of retinoids and 72 of edcs were removed after fe based ceps treatment fig 1a b thus simple sedimentation contributed little to the removals of retinoids and edcs while al and fe based ceps resulted in significant removal of these emerging contaminants over two thirds removals from the sewage during the treatment process the retinoids were always dominated by at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra in wastewater accounting for 88 94 of total retinoid contents fig s1 the edcs were dominated by tcs in wastewater accounting for 45 48 of total edc contents followed by bpa 19 41 fig s1 the removal efficiency of micropollutants during coagulation flocculation is usually related with their physiochemical properties such as the octanol water partition coefficient log k ow luo et al 2014 the hydrophobic compounds with high log k ow values were more efficiently removed during the coagulation and flocculation process luo et al 2014 matamoros and salvadó 2013 suarez et al 2009 for example obvious removal 80 for organic musks was found in treatment of hospital wastewater by coagulation flocculation probably due to their strong lipophilic characteristics that promote their attachment to solid particles suarez et al 2009 in this study the dominant edcs i e tcs log k ow 4 7 71 74 removal 4 np log k ow 5 76 97 99 removal and tcc log k ow 4 9 87 90 removal exhibited better removals than bpa with a lower log k ow of 3 32 40 42 removal only a previous study reported that 90 of np in leachate was removed by treatment of coagulation and sedimentation with fecl3 but only 20 of bpa was removed during this treatment process due to most bpa partitioning in the supernatant asakura and matsuto 2009 which is consistent with the finding of this study it was also reported that coagulation with pacl could remove 30 of bpa for most of the cases ma et al 2009 according to the mass balance al and fe based ceps treatments removed 52 and 59 of retinoids respectively but only removed 30 and 21 of edcs respectively in the present experimental systems figs s2a and s2b their removal in the systems should be attributed mainly to the attachment and accumulation in sludge for tcc and tcs and possible destruction caused by the addition of pacl or fecl3 for 4 np bpa at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra figs s2a and s2b for example fecl3 might react with the phenol of some edcs like bpa via redox or complexation reactions park et al 2016 resulting in the decrease of their levels in the system based on the mass loads at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra were dominant retinoids in the systems accounting for 69 94 of the retinoid contents while tcs and tcc were dominant edcs accounting for 57 79 of the edc contents fig s3 lin et al 2017b reported that pacl exhibited about 20 higher removal efficiency than fecl3 in removing the conventional pollutants e g suspended solids by the ceps comparable removal efficiencies for the emerging contaminants i e retinoids and edcs were obtained for al and fe based ceps in the current study suggesting a high effectiveness of both coagulants i e pacl and fecl3 in removing these emerging contaminants probably due to their similar removal mechanisms i e coagulation flocculation and sedimentation for retinoids and edcs overall the removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs obtained from this laboratory study were somewhat higher than those 41 removal for retinoids and 53 removal for edcs from sewage in the scistw that employs fe based ceps process zhou et al 2019 suggesting that the unknown factors e g source of the sewage might affect the removal of emerging contaminants during actual operation of full scale sewage treatment works 3 1 2 retinoids and edcs during fermentation of sludge during the fermentation process the ceps sludge underwent hydrolysis from particulate organics to soluble organics i e scod and subsequent acidogenesis to produce volatile fatty acids as valuable resources lin and li 2018a 2018b acidogenic fermentation decreased the solution ph from 6 6 to 5 5 for al sludge and 6 5 to 5 9 for fe sludge fig s4 acidogenic fermentation increased the scod level in supernatant from 170 to 590 mg l for al sludge and from 160 to 990 mg l for fe sludge table s2 after 7 d acidogenic sludge fermentation 50 and 58 of retinoids and 50 and 47 of edcs were removed in the supernatants of the al sludge and fe sludge respectively fig 1c d however the concentrations of retinoids and edcs in the solid phase of sludge increased after fermentation fig 1e f suggesting that these chemicals were mainly transferred and accumulated in sludge in particular after acidogenic fermentation 13c ra showed a dramatic increase from 19 to 140 ng g dw in al sludge and from 25 to 97 ng g dw in fe sludge fig 1e the mass loads of retinoids mainly for at ra and 13c ra increased while edcs showed little change in mass loads during acidogenic fermentation of sludge figs s2c and s2d these results suggested that acidogenic fermentation stimulated the transformation of retinoic acids from their precursors or metabolites e g 4 oxo ras to retinoic acids in the anaerobic sludge but had little effect on the degradation of edcs especially for tcc and tcs the results of the mass balance analysis also confirmed that these chemicals were mainly transferred and accumulated in the sludge from supernatant this anaerobic fermentation process was closely associated with the activities of microbial communities ju et al 2016 2017 lin and li 2018a lin et al 2018 fe sludge would more easily undergo organic hydrolysis and acidogenesis than al sludge lin et al 2017b probably due to the different microbial community structures during the fermentation of al sludge and fe sludge ju et al 2016 in this study the removal and transformation of retinoic acids and their metabolites are highly likely attributed to the microbial activities during acidogenic fermentation while the microbial communities in al sludge may be able to accumulate more retinoids than those in fe sludge fig s2c more studies are warranted to investigate the species and abundance of microbial communities that account for the removal of retinoids in al and fe sludge in the future jang et al 2017 also reported that microbial communities were accountable for the removal of antibiotic resistance genes args during anaerobic digestion of the ceps sludge in the present study the sludge amount was 4 5 and 4 3 g l in terms of the mixed liquid suspended solid mlss for al and fe based ceps treatments respectively and they were reduced to 4 1 and 3 6 g l of mlss after acidogenic fermentation respectively fig s5 considering the relatively lower production of fe sludge and lower accumulation of retinoids in fe sludge when compared to that of al sludge fig 1e f it is proposed that fe based ceps should be preferentially considered for wastewater treatment it was reported that edcs like np and tcc in sludge could facilitate solubilisation and acidogenesis for the anaerobic fermentation process via improved microbial community diversities and activities duan et al 2016 wang et al 2017 in the meanwhile acidogenic bacteria had the abilities to degrade np during anaerobic fermentation of activated sludge duan et al 2018 which was also demonstrated with the ceps sludge in this study however our study showed that microbial activities in the fermentation systems had limited abilities to remove the dominant edcs i e tcc and tcs both chemicals are known as antibacterial agents wang et al 2017 yan et al 2019a after fermentation tcc and tcs were still accumulated in the sludge wang et al 2017 also reported that little removal of tcc was found during the anaerobic fermentation of activated sludge which is consistent with the results of ceps sludge fermentation in this study therefore the fermentation process does not likely to reduce the risks of tcc and tcs in the sludge mixture thus more effective strategies that can degrade tcc and tcs are needed to reduce their risks before the sludge disposal as at ra and 13c ra obviously increased in the sludge during its fermentation studies regarding the effects of retinoic acids on the microbial activities hydrolysis and acidogenesis of the sludge are warranted to better understand the fermentation process 3 2 changes and removals of retinoids and edcs during the fermentation of actual fe sludge to further determine the optimal time for acidogenic fermentation with the maximum removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge actual fe sludge was collected from the scistw and then used to investigate the time dependent removal of these two classes of emerging contaminants during acidogenic fermentation under laboratory conditions the ph value was time dependent during the acidogenic fermentation of fe sludge collected from the scistw fig 2 a the ph decreased from 6 0 to 5 4 in the first three days and then almost kept unchanged in the next four days a similar declining trend occurred for the amount of sludge mlss during fermentation fig 2a and a highly significant correlation was found between the sludge amount and ph value r 0 917 p 0 001 fig 2b the decrease of sludge amount was due to the hydrolysis of fe sludge from particulate organics to soluble organics while the decrease of ph was the result of the subsequent acidogenesis to produce volatile fatty acids lin and li 2018a 2018b during the acidogenic fermentation scod and po4 p were released into the supernatant fig s6 which could be recovered as valuable resources as described by lin et al 2017a 2018 the ph could markedly affect hydrolysis acidogenesis and the production of volatile fatty acids via its effect on microbial communities during the sludge fermentation lin and li 2018a maspolim et al 2015 yuan et al 2015 ju et al 2016 2017 similarly the levels of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge also changed with the time period of fermentation figs 3 s7 s8 during the fermentation of fe sludge the concentration of retinoids in the supernatant decreased with time fig 3 a which should be attributed to the reduction of at 4 oxo ra in the first two days fig s7 the concentrations of other retinoids i e at ra 13c ra and 13c 4 oxo ra in supernatant kept almost unchanged during the fermentation process fig s7 the concentration of retinoids in the solid phase of sludge increased with time fig 3a attributing mainly to the increase of 13c ra and at ra since the third day fig s7 the retinoids were dominated with at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra in supernatant 81 88 while at ra and 13c ra were the two dominant retinoids in sludge accounting for 75 95 of the total fig 3c this is partly due to the fact that retinoic acids are easily metabolized to the oxidative metabolites in the aqueous phase yeung et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 while the metabolites are relatively unstable in the anaerobic sludge and or the oxidation of retinoic acids is inhibited in the anaerobic sludge zhou et al 2019 it was reported that no oxidative metabolites were found in the dewatered sludge collected from scistw zhou et al 2019 suggesting that the fraction of retinoic acids in the sludge would further increase with the period of the anaerobic fermentation process like retinoids a similar trend was found for edcs during the acidogenic fermentation of fe sludge the concentration of edcs in supernatant decreased with time while it increased slightly in sludge fig 3b 4 np and bpa were the dominant edcs accounting for 89 97 in supernatant while in sludge the edcs were dominated by tcc and tcs accounting for 85 92 of the total fig 3d the results are in good agreement with our previous study zhou et al 2019 that 4 np and bpa are easily partitioned to the aqueous phase due to their relatively high water solubility whilst tcc and tcs are more accumulated in the sludge due to strong sorption to the solid phase the concentration of 4 np in supernatant increased in the first two days and then decreased in the following five days while the concentration of bpa decreased continuously during the fermentation fig s8 the fluctuation of 4 np concentration might be due to the degradation of their alkylphenol ethoxylates apes parent compounds johnson and sumpter 2001 the removal of at 4 oxo ra i e the dominant retinoid was biphasic with a faster phase i e following pseudo first order kinetics with a half life of 1 62 days in the first two days while its level kept almost unchanged in the following five days fig 4 a however the removal of bpa i e the dominant edc followed the pseudo first order reaction model during the whole experiment of seven days with a half life of 1 55 days fig 4b the mass loads of retinoids in the system fluctuated during sludge fermentation with the maximum value occurring on the fifth day fig s9a at ra and 13c ra were the two dominant retinoids accounting for 68 94 of the total fig s9c little of at ra and 13c ra 4 was partitioned to the supernatant phase fig s10 but for at 4 oxo ra and 13c 4 oxo ra the ratio partitioning to the supernatant accounted for over 20 fig s10 the mass loads of edcs in the system kept almost unchanged during fermentation fig s9b even though the levels of bpa in supernatant and sludge clearly decreased figs s8 and s11 the fraction of bpa partitioning to the supernatant accounted for 6 22 fig s11 a quick sorption of bpa on the sludge via binding to extracellular polymeric substances yan et al 2019b and subsequent biodegradation should be the key removal mechanisms in this regard zhao et al 2008 tcc was the dominant edc compound in the system accounting for 50 60 of the total followed by tcs 26 37 and bpa 8 16 fig s9d no degradation of tcc and tcs was found during acidogenic fermentation almost all of tcc and tcs were partitioned to the sludge fig s11 which is consistent with the previous findings e g zhou et al 2019 a recent study reported that extracellular polymeric substances the main interfacial components of activated sludge also played a crucial role in the binding of tcs in sludge yan et al 2019a 3 3 estimation of mass loss of retinoids and edcs when adding sludge fermentation in scistw we further estimated the mass loss of retinoids and edcs in supernatant and sludge during acidogenic fermentation of the actual ceps sludge collected from the world s largest ceps plant i e scistw based on the mass analysis method of zhou et al 2019 the mass loads of retinoids and edcs in the wastewater influent 2 2 million m3 d of scistw were about 39 g d and 14 000 g d respectively about 41 and 53 of retinoids and edcs were removed from the sewage after the ceps in scistw zhou et al 2019 considering the sludge treatment costs and the relatively low concentrations of retinoids and edcs in this study we calculated the change of mass loads of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge after one day of acidogenic sludge fermentation the volume of supernatant accounted for about 1 30 of volume of the influent in scistw table 1 the additional acidogenic sludge fermentation process 1 d could further remove 1 3 g d retinoids and 190 g d edcs from the supernatant phase table 1 accounting for about 3 3 and 1 4 of the mass loads of retinoids and edcs in the influent thus the sludge fermentation process would contribute relatively little to the removal of emerging contaminants in the whole treatment process that couples ceps of sewage with acidogenic fermentation of sludge in tandem nonetheless it should be noted that acidogenic sludge fermentation can effectively decrease the level of emerging contaminants in the supernatant of the sludge which is favourable to the utilization of the supernatant liquor for resource recovery and other beneficial uses lin et al 2017a further research studies are warranted to develop innovative technologies for improving the removal efficiency of edcs from the solid phase of sludge to reduce the ecological and public health risks of the sludge 3 4 environmental implications sewage treatment processes in stws play an important role in removing conventional pollutants and emerging contaminants using a laboratory based pilot setup this study compared the removal efficiencies of retinoids and edcs during two commonly used ceps processes i e al and fe based the results demonstrated that the two processes had comparable removal efficiencies for these emerging contaminants when compared with the widely used activated sludge process zhou et al 2019 further studies are needed to optimize the treatment process by altering the environmental parameters e g temperature and ph so that the removal of emerging contaminants can be enhanced thereby minimizing their ecological risks to aquatic organisms given that acidogenic fermentation of the ceps sludge could further reduce the levels of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant while the supernatant is to be processed for resource recovery lin et al 2017a 2018 this ceps based novel treatment process is expected to be increasingly applied for wastewater treatment in megacities worldwide in the future the ceps process is shown to be more cost effective than and highly competitive with the conventional wastewater treatment process for example the scistw that uses ceps has a hydraulic retention time hrt of less than 1 5 h which is much shorter than the hrts of the activated sludge based secondary treatment in the two reported stws 20 h for shatin stw and 13 6 h for stanley stw zhou et al 2019 overall the costs of ceps for wastewater treatment are much less than half of that of the secondary wastewater treatment chagnon and harleman 2002 acidogenic fermentation of ceps sludge can further reduce the treatment cost by recovering the organic carbon resources from the sludge lin et al 2017a 2018 whilst the removal of emerging contaminants in the supernatant during sludge fermentation is an additional achievement 4 conclusions this study represented the first comprehensive comparison regarding the removals of retinoids and edcs from the sewage by the al and fe based ceps treatments the results showed that these two processes exhibited the comparable removal efficiencies for the two classes of emerging contaminants over two thirds removals the removals were contributable mainly to the chemical sorption and accumulation in the ceps sludge investigation was also conducted on the levels and removals of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge during the acidogenic fermentation of al and fe based ceps sludge about half of retinoids and edcs was further removed from the supernatant during acidogenic fermentation of the ceps sludge while the amount of the chemicals in the solid phase of sludge increased fe based ceps coupled with fermentation of the sludge is preferentially recommended for wastewater treatment considering the relatively lower production of fe sludge and the lower accumulation of retinoids in fe sludge when compared to that of al sludge the levels of retinoids and edcs in the supernatant and sludge changed with time during the fermentation of actual fe sludge by applying sludge fermentation retinoids and edcs in the supernatant would decrease which is beneficial to the resource recovery and utilization of the supernatant while the chemicals will be concentrated into the solid phase of the sludge for disposal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18004,during advanced oxidation treatment for enhancing sludge dewaterability the peptide chains of protein can be decomposed into amino acids protein exhibits a great impact on sewage sludge dewaterability however the role of amino acids in sludge dewatering remains unclear in this study among the 23 types of amino acids investigated tryptophane trp and lysine lys were identified as the key amino acids affecting sludge dewaterability during fenton oxidation treatment the content of lysine showed positive correlations with capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf and bound water content and the concentrations of total protein low molecular weight protein amines and amides and 3 turn helix of proteinaceous compounds in bound extracellular polymeric substances eps while the content of tryptophane showed negative correlations with the above parameters the amino acids may be sourced from damage of the membrane and ribosomal proteins by hydroxyl radicals and the peptide bonds connected with tryptophane were more inclined to be decomposed than other amino acids particularly more amino acids of tryptophane can result in more hydrophobic interaction and less necessary energy barrier for aggregation of particles as such regulating protein degradation towards production of tryptophane may be related with enhanced sludge dewaterability

spectroscopy 1 introduction in wastewater treatment plants large amounts of waste activated sludge are being generated during the biological wastewater treatment process cieslik et al 2015 the management of waste activated sludge is difficult since it typically contains of up to 95 99 wt water content wu et al 2018 therefore sludge dewatering is necessary in minimizing sludge volume and cutting costs of transportation and disposal however waste activated sludge is a colloidal system and is mainly consisted of highly hydrated extracellular polymeric substances eps e g proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids lipids etc cao et al 2018 to improve sludge dewaterability fenton conditioning has been used through an oxidation step by degrading the highly hydrated macromolecules and converting bound water to free water and a subsequent re coagulation step by agglomerating small particles into larger ones xiao et al 2017a yu et al 2016 2017 the distribution and chemical composition of eps can significantly affect sludge dewaterability sheng et al 2010 for example higgins and novak 1997 reported that proteins polysaccharides and humic acids all exerted detrimental influences on sludge dewaterability and proteins were found to be more correlated with sludge dewaterability compared with polysaccharides and humic acids liu and fang 2003 xiao et al 2016 further investigated the relationship between protein molecular weight and sludge dewaterability and their results indicated that proteins with low molecular weight less than 20 000 da da were mainly responsible for the deteriorated sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 found that the destruction of α helix of protein secondary structure was efficient in enhancing sludge dewaterability during the oxidation process protein functionalities can be changed and degraded into amino acids li et al 2013 for example kim et al 2016 found that the content of amino acid can be a good indicator to reflect the oxidation degree of protein during sludge conditioning by thermal activated persulfate treatment muszkat et al 2001 noted that the cleavage of collagen by hydroxyl radicals in fenton oxidation can result in the production of glycine gly stadtman and levine 2003 reported that the hydroxyl radicals induced protein oxidation could nitrify aromatic amino acid residues hydroxylate aromatic groups and aliphatic amino acid side chains as well as cleave the polypeptide chain amino acids are the main compositions of protein and the by products of protein decomposition after the oxidation treatment of sludge compared with the numerous studies on the role of protein on sludge dewatering higgins and novak 1997 liu and fang 2003 wu et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 the role of amino acids in sludge dewatering is however neglected in fact there were typically 16 kinds of amino acids presented in sludge samples including 7 kinds of essential amino acids e g threonine thr valine val methionine met phenylalanine phe isoleucine ile leucine leu and lysine lys and 9 kinds of non essential amino acids e g aspartic acid asp glutamic acid glu serine ser histidine his glycine gly arginine arg alanine ala tyrosine tyr and cysteine cys liu et al 2009 amino acids are typically incorporated into the structures of peptides and protein and their types and compositional distributions can significantly affect protein physicochemical characteristics e g α helix mode of helix formation β strands etc subrahmanyam et al 1960 for example zhao et al 2018 found that the amino acids of phe leu ala thr gly glu and val can significantly affect the biosynthesis of extracellular protein cai et al 2016 found that tryptophane trp and tyr were degraded along with the release of free water during the thermophilic phase in the bio drying processes hou et al 2015 reported that the hydrophobic amino acids contributed to the hydrophobicity and aggregation ability of anammox sludge currently it remains unclear about the role of amino acids and their interaction with proteinaceous compounds in sludge dewatering particularly during the oxidation process fenton treatment is commonly used to improve sludge dewaterability due to its excellent performance in degrading the hydrophilic compounds and agglomerating sludge flocs yin et al 2015 the objectives of the study were to 1 investigate the changes of amino acid types before and after fenton oxidation treatment 2 investigate the correlation of identified key amino acids and the characteristics of proteins e g molecular weight secondary structure type and morphology density functional theory dft calculation was further conducted to reveal the oxidation reaction between the hydroxyl radical oh and peptide chains presented on protein molecules the effects of the identified amino acids on the interaction energy of sludge flocs were further validated by extended derjaguin landan venvey overbeek dlvo theory 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and chemicals raw sludge rs was waste activated sludge obtained from the thickening tank of shahu municipal wastewater treatment plant wuhan china the sludge samples were collected by polypropylene containers and stored at 4 c before use the main characteristics of sludge are shown in table s1 the chemicals used in this study can be found in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures two series of bench scale experiments were conducted in 500 ml beakers with the sludge volume of 250 ml to investigate the effects of fe ii and h2o2 concentrations on sludge dewaterability for the first batch a fixed fe ii concentration of 1 9 mmol g volatile solids vs was added into the sludge according to our previous study yu et al 2017 and then five different concentrations of h2o2 0 0 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 6 0 mmol g vs were added in five identical beakers for the second batch a fixed h2o2 concentration of 2 5 mmol g vs was added into the sludge followed by different concentrations of fe ii 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 9 3 0 and 4 8 mmol g vs for both these two batches the sludge was conditioned according to the following procedures adding fe ii solution 5 min of rapid mixing at 150 rpm adding h2o2 solution 30 min of slow mixing at 100 rpm xiao et al 2017a sludge samples were drawn for the analyses of sludge dewaterability e g capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf and bound water content and eps extraction all experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 3 analyses and calculations please refer to text s2 for characterization of sludge dewaterability physicochemical properties of sludge iron content determination eps extraction and analysis n functionalities in proteinaceous compounds and protein secondary structure amino acids protein type and protein morphology and details for the extended dlvo and dft calculations all analyses were conducted in triplicates pearson s correlation coefficient r value was used to evaluate the relationship between sludge dewaterability and proteinaceous characteristics by the statistical software spss spss version 22 the structural equation model sem was performed using spss and amos graphics software amos version 21 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of fenton oxidation treatment on sludge dewaterability the effects of h2o2 doses on sludge dewaterability in terms of cst srf and bound water content at a fixed concentration of fe ii are shown in fig 1 a and b it is noted that the doses of h2o2 have a remarkable influence on sludge dewaterability with the dose of h2o2 increased from 0 0 to 2 5 mmol g vs the values of cst srf and bound water content decreased rapidly and they all tended to stabilize when the dose of h2o2 further increased to 6 0 mmol g vs the maximum reductions of cst 89 0 and srf 95 5 were achieved with the fe ii dose of 1 9 mmol g vs and the h2o2 dose of 2 5 mmol g vs the enhancement of sludge dewaterability may be attributed to an oxidation step by the oh through degrading the hydrophilic compounds and converting the bound water to free water neyens and baeyens 2003 pham et al 2010 and a subsequent re coagulation step by the generation fe iii with detailed changes of sludge physicochemical properties e g zeta potential particle size and fe ii fe iii contents in the filtrate and sludge cakes can be found in fig s1 table s2 and text s3 in fenton oxidation system as the dose of h2o2 increased the oxidation degree increased and this increased oxidation degree typically showed more influential effects on the organic parts of sludge than the salts and inorganic particles due to the relatively faster reaction rates between the hydroxyl radicals and organic compounds mikrut et al 2018 similarly the effects of fe ii doses at a fixed dose of h2o2 showed a similar trend in enhancing sludge dewaterability fig s2 it is therefore deduced that similar performance can be achieved by varying either the dose of h2o2 or the dose of fe ii with the role of fe ii mainly for coagulation effects and the role of h2o2 mainly for oxidation in sludge dewaterability neyens and baeyens 2003 to clarify the role of amino acids in sludge dewatering which was sourced from the degradation of proteinaceous compounds by the oxidation process the downstream studies focused on the oxidation process by varying concentrations of h2o2 at a fixed concentration of fe ii 3 2 effects of fenton oxidation treatment on amino acids generally among the 23 types of amino acids investigated only 20 kinds of amino acids can be identified including 9 kinds of hydrophobic amino acids i e met trp phe leu ala tyr val ile and proline pro and 11 kinds of hydrophilic amino acids i e asp thr cys lys arg gly his ser and glu asparagine asn and glutamine gln fig 1c and d the residual three amino acids i e sarcosine sar hydroxyproline hyp and norvaline nva were under the detection limit and 12 hydrophobic hydrophilic amino acids including trp tyr lys met leu ala cys asp val ile phe and pro were found to be diversely presented in sludge samples before and after fenton treatment in the rs the hydrophilic thr was predominated 15 48 mg n l followed by the hydrophobic pro 13 08 mg n l the hydrophobic phe 6 24 mg n l and the hydrophilic lys 5 96 mg n l zhang et al 2013a also found that amino acids of thr pro lys glu gly arg ala and leu were the major constituents of sewage sludge after fenton treatment the total concentration of hydrophobic amino acids showed an increasing trend as the dose of h2o2 increased fig 1c which further confirmed the degradation of proteinaceous compounds moreover the concentration of thr was almost depleted and the concentrations of the hydrophilic cys and lys decreased but the concentrations of phe and pro were still predominant in association with the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of these amino acids it is therefore deduced that fenton treatment may be effective in degrading the hydrophilic amino acid e g thr cys and lys and promoting the generation of the hydrophobic amino acids e g phe and pro this can be related with the high reduction potential of oh about 2 3 v compared with the hydrogen bond in protein molecule the reduction potential of about 1 0 v choe and min 2006 the peptide bonds in protein molecules may be cleaved and then were spitted into fragments through a series of oxidation reactions kerkaert et al 2011 interestingly it is noted that when the dose of h2o2 was added at a high concentration e g 6 0 mmol g vs the concentration of hydrophobic phe sharply increased this may be due to that the phenyl rings usually showed higher resistance to oxidation than other functional groups e g double stranded structures helal and badawy 2011 3 3 effects of fenton oxidation treatment on the characteristics of nitrogenous compounds in different fractions of eps 3 3 1 nitrogenous compounds contents fig 1e h shows the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved organic nitrogen ton protein and nh4 n in different fractions of eps the sludge dewatering characteristics including cst srf and bound water content showed stronger positive correlations with the tdn ton and protein concentrations in bound eps bound eps than soluble eps sb eps thus indicating that these changes of protein based nitrogenous substances in bound eps can be more related with the enhanced sludge dewaterability by fenton oxidation treatment and more detailed discussion can be found in text s4 of supporting information 3 3 2 the changes of protein molecular weight the type and molecular weight of dissolved organic matters can be identified by the lc ocd ond technique the changes of hydrophilic dissolved organic carbon hi doc and lmw protein were more significant than others table 1 the concentrations of hi doc and lmw protein increased in sb eps as the doses of h2o2 increased from 0 0 to 1 0 mmol g vs but decreased while continuously increasing to 2 5 mmol g vs it indicated that the hydroxyl radical reacted with the soluble fraction of sludge under this condition the mineralization effect was more significant than the solubilization of organic compounds kim et al 2016 meanwhile the decreases of hi doc and lmw protein in bound eps of the treated sludge indicated the shift of organic compounds from the inner layer of sludge flocs bound eps to the outer layer of sludge flocs sb eps moreover the results of pearson s correlation indicated that sludge dewaterability in terms of bound water content showed a positive and strong correlation with the content of lmw protein in bound eps table s3 the predominance of lmw protein might be related to the decomposition of hmw macromolecules during fenton oxidation since the lmw protein showed a lower absolute bimolecular reaction rate constant than the hmw macromolecules during the reaction with hydroxyl radicals westerhoff et al 2007 3 3 3 protein secondary structure and n functionalities the protein secondary structures i e aggregated strands β sheet random coil α helix 3 turn helix and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands determine the aggregation adsorption and flocculation of microbial aggregates which are related to hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of proteins badireddy et al 2010 hou et al 2015 as shown in table s4 α helix and β sheet predominated in bound eps of sludge samples the α helix was retained by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond while the β sheet had a unique structure like the twisted and pleated sheet li et al 2020 after fenton oxidation treatment the content of β sheet was significantly higher than that in rs table s4 the higher content of β sheet indicated that the hydrogen bond was destroyed after fenton oxidation treatment thus leading to a looser structure of protein and benefiting the exposure of hydrophobic sites and groups of proteins for enhanced sludge dewaterability li et al 2020 the results of non protonated and protonated nitrogenous compounds were obtained from the xps analysis yin et al 2015 yuan et al 2011 as shown in table s4 combined with the results in table s3 the content of bound water showed a strong and positive correlation with the content of non protonated nitrogen nnonpr r 0 871 p 0 05 the amines and amides of nnonpr were related with the stretching co of β sheet in protein secondary structures as well as the stretching coo and c o of carboxylic groups in protein zhang et al 2013b therefore the increase of nnonpr content could significantly improve the strength stiffness and energy dissipation capacity of proteins failing to destruct protein structure yang et al 2017 thus leading to poor sludge dewaterability 3 3 4 protein types the origins functions biological process of proteins can be clarified based on gene ontology go classification for tracking the changes of proteins before and after fenton oxidation treatment fig 2 and table s5 in total 391 types of protein were identified in sludge samples among which most of the identified proteins were derived from the cytoplasm and identified as the intracellular proteins fig 2a such as ribosomal proteins there were also some identified proteins presented in extracellular part with higher contents of disulphide bridges and cysteine residues bradshaw 1989 such as porin transmembrane proteins they can function as a type of channel by transferring the certain small molecules e g proteins polysaccharide and ions through cell membrane nikaido 2003 moreover the membrane proteins on the bacterial surface played an important role in the bonding properties that were associated with the surface reaction and bio flocculation achouak et al 2001 according to results of the go analysis for protein functions the identified proteins in sludge were mainly responsible for functions such as structural constituent of ribosome nucleotide binding and oxidoreductase activity fig 2b for instance nucleotide binding proteins encompass many elongation factors which were associated with the initiation elongation and termination of protein biosynthesis bourne et al 1991 the classification of go analysis of biological processes indicated that proteins were primarily related with translation process and oxidation reduction process possibly induced by the fenton oxidation process interestingly most proteins that encompass translation process belong to the families of ribosomal proteins fig 2c the ribosomal proteins are the essential parts of the ribosome and cell organelles for intracellular protein synthesis chen et al 2010 nakashima and nishikawa 1992 also found that intracellular proteins were consisted with relatively high abundance of aliphatic and charged amino acid after fenton oxidation treatment 16 proteins were observed to be obviously down regulated fold change 0 83 and 29 proteins were up regulated fold change 1 20 table s5 most of up regulated proteins were related to nucleotide binding and transportation based on molecular functions and biological processes of go classification for example elongation factor tu belonging to intracellular proteins had a high fold change and its function was related with gtp binding and gtpase activity table s5 for the down related proteins most of them were originally derived from membrane and ribosome according to the classification basing on cellular components table s5 the decrease of extracellular membrane protein indicated the damage of the membrane structure induced by fenton oxidation the results of live dead staining can further support this finding the ratio of live dead cells decreased with the increasing dose of h2o2 further indicating that fenton oxidation was effective in damaging bacterial cells figs s3a f after cell lysis the membrane and ribosome proteins were destroyed along with the release of intracellular water which was beneficial for sludge dewaterability the decrease of fluorescence intensity of protein in sludge samples stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc further supported this finding fig 3 a f it was in consistent with the reduced protein content of eps after fenton oxidation treatment fig 1g the degradation of proteinaceous compounds may result in disruption of the hydration shell of proteins thus resulting in release of the bound water xu et al 2018 therefore it was inferred that fenton oxidation treatment could mainly damage the membrane and ribosomal proteins through destroying the transport and translation of cells 3 4 relationship between the contents of amino acids and proteinaceous compounds and sludge dewaterability 3 4 1 sludge dewaterability the results of pearson s correlation indicated that both cst and srf showed negative and strong correlations with the hydrophobicity of amino acids for cst r 0 984 p 0 01 for srf r 0 982 p 0 01 while they both showed positive and strong correlations with the hydrophilicity of amino acids for cst r 0 934 p 0 01 for srf r 0 890 p 0 05 table 2 the enhanced sludge dewaterability after fenton treatment can be related with the release of hydrophobic amino acids and the degradation of hydrophilic amino acids moreover the concentration of the hydrophobic amino acid of trp showed a strong and negative correlation with sludge dewaterability for bound water content r 0 953 p 0 05 while the hydrophilic amino acid of lys showed a strong and positive correlation with sludge dewaterability for bound water content r 0 964 p 0 01 table 2 nakashima and nishikawa 1994 reported that trp and lys were the important compositions of both intracellular and extracellular proteins the characteristics of trp significantly affected protein physicochemical characteristics e g α helix mode of helix formation β strands etc subrahmanyam et al 1960 more presence of the hydrophobic trp can make sludge flocs easily to separate from water and settle through building hydrophobic regions for forming drainage channels liu et al 2020 in contrast the hydrophilic groups i e free nh2 and co of lys can change the surface characteristics of sludge particles by increasing their viscosity and hydrophilicity lin et al 2019 3 4 2 proteinaceous compounds as can be seen in table 2 indiscernible correlations between the concentrations of amino acids and the concentrations of tdn ton protein and nh4 n in sb eps were noted however interestingly the concentrations of the amino acids lys ala and trp were strongly correlated with nitrogenous components e g tdn ton and protein in bound eps to be exemplified the content of lys showed a strong and positive correlation with tdn ton and protein for tdn r 0 982 p 0 01 for ton r 0 982 p 0 01 for protein r 0 974 p 0 01 while the content of trp showed a strong and negative correlation with tdn ton and protein for tdn r 0 986 p 0 01 for ton r 0 986 p 0 01 for protein r 0 985 p 0 01 the predominance of the tryptophan like protein in sludge samples identified by the three dimensional excitation emission matrix has been widely reported xiao et al 2017b yu et al 2019 similarly the predominance of lys in sludge samples has also been reported in other studies chen et al 2019 therefore the predominance of trp and lys in sludge samples was related with their roles as the key amino acids responsible for affecting sludge dewaterability during the fenton treatment 3 4 3 protein molecular weight in bound eps it is noted that the hydrophobic amino acid of trp showed strong and negative correlations with the hi doc r 0 965 p 0 01 and lmw protein r 0 987 p 0 01 in bound eps fig 3g the hi doc and lmw protein can deteriorate sludge dewaterability due to their strong affinities towards water chen et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 the indole and pyrrolidine ring in the aromatic amino acids of trp could serve as hydrogen donors via their hydroxyl groups to react with the hydroxyl radicals pouzo et al 2016 making these functional groups in proteins more accessible to the oxidation process hence more try can be generated while destructing the hi doc and lmw protein thus showing a negative correlation moreover the content of hydrophilic amino acid of lys showed strong and positive correlations with the hi doc r 0 893 p 0 05 and lmw protein r 0 937 p 0 01 in bound eps fig 3g the fe ii could bind to the lys and formed the chelate reaction with h2o2 to generate the hydroxyl radicals that then preferentially attack the lys stadtman and levine 2003 the positive correlation between lys and hi doc with lmw protein was related with the hydrophilicity and vulnerability of lys during fenton oxidation treatment zhou et al 2019 3 4 4 protein secondary structure and n functionalities in bound eps as shown in fig 3g the content of trp showed a strong and negative correlation with the secondary structure of 3 turn helix r 0 840 p 0 05 it has been reported that 3 turn helix was found in the compositional distribution of the amino acid of trp argos and palau 1982 destructing protein secondary structure with more production of hydrophobic sites of 3 turn helix may contribute to the production of hydrophobic amino acids of trp moreover as shown in fig 3g trp showed strong and negative correlations with nnonpr r 0 984 p 0 01 and lys showed strong and positive correlations with nnonpr r 0 924 p 0 01 while indiscernible correlations were observed between these amino acids and npr the destruction of amines and amides was the key factor responsible for the production of these hydrophobic amino acids the results of borduas et al 2016 supported this study that the amide bonds peptide bonds were the central structure of protein molecules and the destruction of amide bonds can result in the generation of trp the oh may react with protein side chains and weaken non polar inter protein reactions thus resulting in expansion of the protein tertiary structure and the release of interstitial water and bound water wang et al 2018 the structural equation models showed the direct and indirect influences between bound water content amino acids molecular weight and secondary structure of protein and n functionalities in bound eps fig 3h and i it showed that both lys and trp have indirect effects on bound water content through three paths which are lys trp 3 turn helix bound water content lys trp nnonpr lmw protein bound water content and lys trp 3 turn helix nnonpr lmw protein bound water content these indirect effects of both lys and trp on bound water content and the related protein properties may suggest that the effects of amino acids on sludge dewaterability were closely related with the destruction of protein structures during sludge dewatering by fenton oxidation treatment lys positively influenced the 3 turn helix and nnonpr however trp had a negative influence on 3 turn helix and nnonpr it may be related that trp and lys are hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids respectively thus resulting in the different influences on protein characteristics 3 4 5 dft calculation of the oxidation process in recent years the dft calculation has been becoming a useful tool to investigate the intrinsic kinetics and the chemical pathways for the degradation of key organic matters in wastewater wang et al 2020 aquatic environment wang et al 2019 soil suzuki et al 2019 and sludge chen et al 2020 in this study the molecular dynamics simulation of protein and hydroxyl was regarded as a proxy for the investigation on the mechanism of possible interaction between protein and hydroxyl radical in the molecular aspect and the protein structure was represented by the simplified structure of peptide containing amino acids identified in sludge sample as showed in fig 4 through the dft calculation the total charge δq of hydroxyl was calculated using the bader method which can show the electric charge transfer during the interaction of hydroxyl and peptide table s6 it showed that the charge transfer of hydroxyl with the peptide containing trp was the highest of 0 337 e it may be related that the hydroxyl was more likely to interact with the peptide containing trp resulting in more production of hydrophobic amino acid of trp after fenton treatment however the dft calculation of the oxidation process might not work accurately in the real situations if considering the complex environmental conditions in the future work more practical parameters will be considered during the dft calculation 3 5 effects of the identified amino acids on sludge dewatering of the re coagulation process the surface thermodynamic parameters of free energy values for aggregation of rs and sludge samples treated by amino acids of lys and trp were calculated the results are listed in table s7 the interfacial free energy δ g a d h of sludge treated by trp was 15 36 mj m2 which was significantly lower than that of rs and sludge samples treated by lys the addition of trp may lead to a stronger hydrophobic interaction of the surface of sludge the lewis acid base interaction free energies δ g a d h a b of sludge treated by trp and lys had higher absolute values compared with that of van der waals interaction free energies δ g a d h l w implying that lewis acid based interactions played more important roles in the coagulation process to analyze the distance dependent interrelationship of interaction energies the extended dlvo curves of rs and sludge samples treated by amino acids of lys and trp were presented as can be seen in fig 5 considering the relatively high absolute value of the acid base interaction wab it is therefore concluded that its contribution to the total interaction energy was obviously more significant than those of the energy of van der waals energies wa and the energy of electric double layer wr hou et al 2015 meanwhile it is noted that wab of rs and sludge added with lys was both positive indicating that sludge flocs were relatively hydrophilicity and mutually exclusive moreover the wab of sludge added with lys was higher than that of rs indicating that the addition of lys can significantly enhance sludge hydrophilicity thus deteriorating sludge dewaterability in contrast the wab of sludge was negative with the addition of trp indicating that the hydrophobic interaction was predominated in the sludge the total energy of the interaction wtot the sum of wa wr and wab is an indicator of the energy barrier for sludge coagulation the total interaction wtot increased with the nearness between sludge particles and the absolute values of wtot were in sequence of rs lys rs rs trp these results indicated that compared with the rs the sludge particles added with lys must overcome higher energy barrier for aggregation while the sludge particles added with trp may result in less energy barrier for aggregation 4 conclusions this study systematically studied the types and concentrations of amino acids and investigated their correlations with characteristics of proteinaceous compounds i e molecular weight secondary structure type and morphology during sludge conditioning by fenton s reagent through the statistical analyses of pearson s correlation and sem the results indicated that the hydrophobic amino acid of trp and the hydrophilic amino acid of lys were the key amino acids related with protein molecular weight type and secondary structure as well as with sludge dewaterability the amino acids may be sourced from damage of the membrane and ribosomal proteins by the hydroxyl radicals the generation of amino acids during the oxidation of sludge samples by the hydroxyl radicals was calculated with the dft method for the first time the peptide bonds connected with trp were more inclined to be decomposed than other amino acids particularly more predominance of trp can result in less necessary energy barrier for aggregation of particles this study suggests that regulating protein degradation towards more production of trp could contribute to enhance sludge dewaterability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18004,during advanced oxidation treatment for enhancing sludge dewaterability the peptide chains of protein can be decomposed into amino acids protein exhibits a great impact on sewage sludge dewaterability however the role of amino acids in sludge dewatering remains unclear in this study among the 23 types of amino acids investigated tryptophane trp and lysine lys were identified as the key amino acids affecting sludge dewaterability during fenton oxidation treatment the content of lysine showed positive correlations with capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf and bound water content and the concentrations of total protein low molecular weight protein amines and amides and 3 turn helix of proteinaceous compounds in bound extracellular polymeric substances eps while the content of tryptophane showed negative correlations with the above parameters the amino acids may be sourced from damage of the membrane and ribosomal proteins by hydroxyl radicals and the peptide bonds connected with tryptophane were more inclined to be decomposed than other amino acids particularly more amino acids of tryptophane can result in more hydrophobic interaction and less necessary energy barrier for aggregation of particles as such regulating protein degradation towards production of tryptophane may be related with enhanced sludge dewaterability

management of waste activated sludge is difficult since it typically contains of up to 95 99 wt water content wu et al 2018 therefore sludge dewatering is necessary in minimizing sludge volume and cutting costs of transportation and disposal however waste activated sludge is a colloidal system and is mainly consisted of highly hydrated extracellular polymeric substances eps e g proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids lipids etc cao et al 2018 to improve sludge dewaterability fenton conditioning has been used through an oxidation step by degrading the highly hydrated macromolecules and converting bound water to free water and a subsequent re coagulation step by agglomerating small particles into larger ones xiao et al 2017a yu et al 2016 2017 the distribution and chemical composition of eps can significantly affect sludge dewaterability sheng et al 2010 for example higgins and novak 1997 reported that proteins polysaccharides and humic acids all exerted detrimental influences on sludge dewaterability and proteins were found to be more correlated with sludge dewaterability compared with polysaccharides and humic acids liu and fang 2003 xiao et al 2016 further investigated the relationship between protein molecular weight and sludge dewaterability and their results indicated that proteins with low molecular weight less than 20 000 da da were mainly responsible for the deteriorated sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 found that the destruction of α helix of protein secondary structure was efficient in enhancing sludge dewaterability during the oxidation process protein functionalities can be changed and degraded into amino acids li et al 2013 for example kim et al 2016 found that the content of amino acid can be a good indicator to reflect the oxidation degree of protein during sludge conditioning by thermal activated persulfate treatment muszkat et al 2001 noted that the cleavage of collagen by hydroxyl radicals in fenton oxidation can result in the production of glycine gly stadtman and levine 2003 reported that the hydroxyl radicals induced protein oxidation could nitrify aromatic amino acid residues hydroxylate aromatic groups and aliphatic amino acid side chains as well as cleave the polypeptide chain amino acids are the main compositions of protein and the by products of protein decomposition after the oxidation treatment of sludge compared with the numerous studies on the role of protein on sludge dewatering higgins and novak 1997 liu and fang 2003 wu et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 the role of amino acids in sludge dewatering is however neglected in fact there were typically 16 kinds of amino acids presented in sludge samples including 7 kinds of essential amino acids e g threonine thr valine val methionine met phenylalanine phe isoleucine ile leucine leu and lysine lys and 9 kinds of non essential amino acids e g aspartic acid asp glutamic acid glu serine ser histidine his glycine gly arginine arg alanine ala tyrosine tyr and cysteine cys liu et al 2009 amino acids are typically incorporated into the structures of peptides and protein and their types and compositional distributions can significantly affect protein physicochemical characteristics e g α helix mode of helix formation β strands etc subrahmanyam et al 1960 for example zhao et al 2018 found that the amino acids of phe leu ala thr gly glu and val can significantly affect the biosynthesis of extracellular protein cai et al 2016 found that tryptophane trp and tyr were degraded along with the release of free water during the thermophilic phase in the bio drying processes hou et al 2015 reported that the hydrophobic amino acids contributed to the hydrophobicity and aggregation ability of anammox sludge currently it remains unclear about the role of amino acids and their interaction with proteinaceous compounds in sludge dewatering particularly during the oxidation process fenton treatment is commonly used to improve sludge dewaterability due to its excellent performance in degrading the hydrophilic compounds and agglomerating sludge flocs yin et al 2015 the objectives of the study were to 1 investigate the changes of amino acid types before and after fenton oxidation treatment 2 investigate the correlation of identified key amino acids and the characteristics of proteins e g molecular weight secondary structure type and morphology density functional theory dft calculation was further conducted to reveal the oxidation reaction between the hydroxyl radical oh and peptide chains presented on protein molecules the effects of the identified amino acids on the interaction energy of sludge flocs were further validated by extended derjaguin landan venvey overbeek dlvo theory 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and chemicals raw sludge rs was waste activated sludge obtained from the thickening tank of shahu municipal wastewater treatment plant wuhan china the sludge samples were collected by polypropylene containers and stored at 4 c before use the main characteristics of sludge are shown in table s1 the chemicals used in this study can be found in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures two series of bench scale experiments were conducted in 500 ml beakers with the sludge volume of 250 ml to investigate the effects of fe ii and h2o2 concentrations on sludge dewaterability for the first batch a fixed fe ii concentration of 1 9 mmol g volatile solids vs was added into the sludge according to our previous study yu et al 2017 and then five different concentrations of h2o2 0 0 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 6 0 mmol g vs were added in five identical beakers for the second batch a fixed h2o2 concentration of 2 5 mmol g vs was added into the sludge followed by different concentrations of fe ii 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 9 3 0 and 4 8 mmol g vs for both these two batches the sludge was conditioned according to the following procedures adding fe ii solution 5 min of rapid mixing at 150 rpm adding h2o2 solution 30 min of slow mixing at 100 rpm xiao et al 2017a sludge samples were drawn for the analyses of sludge dewaterability e g capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf and bound water content and eps extraction all experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 3 analyses and calculations please refer to text s2 for characterization of sludge dewaterability physicochemical properties of sludge iron content determination eps extraction and analysis n functionalities in proteinaceous compounds and protein secondary structure amino acids protein type and protein morphology and details for the extended dlvo and dft calculations all analyses were conducted in triplicates pearson s correlation coefficient r value was used to evaluate the relationship between sludge dewaterability and proteinaceous characteristics by the statistical software spss spss version 22 the structural equation model sem was performed using spss and amos graphics software amos version 21 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of fenton oxidation treatment on sludge dewaterability the effects of h2o2 doses on sludge dewaterability in terms of cst srf and bound water content at a fixed concentration of fe ii are shown in fig 1 a and b it is noted that the doses of h2o2 have a remarkable influence on sludge dewaterability with the dose of h2o2 increased from 0 0 to 2 5 mmol g vs the values of cst srf and bound water content decreased rapidly and they all tended to stabilize when the dose of h2o2 further increased to 6 0 mmol g vs the maximum reductions of cst 89 0 and srf 95 5 were achieved with the fe ii dose of 1 9 mmol g vs and the h2o2 dose of 2 5 mmol g vs the enhancement of sludge dewaterability may be attributed to an oxidation step by the oh through degrading the hydrophilic compounds and converting the bound water to free water neyens and baeyens 2003 pham et al 2010 and a subsequent re coagulation step by the generation fe iii with detailed changes of sludge physicochemical properties e g zeta potential particle size and fe ii fe iii contents in the filtrate and sludge cakes can be found in fig s1 table s2 and text s3 in fenton oxidation system as the dose of h2o2 increased the oxidation degree increased and this increased oxidation degree typically showed more influential effects on the organic parts of sludge than the salts and inorganic particles due to the relatively faster reaction rates between the hydroxyl radicals and organic compounds mikrut et al 2018 similarly the effects of fe ii doses at a fixed dose of h2o2 showed a similar trend in enhancing sludge dewaterability fig s2 it is therefore deduced that similar performance can be achieved by varying either the dose of h2o2 or the dose of fe ii with the role of fe ii mainly for coagulation effects and the role of h2o2 mainly for oxidation in sludge dewaterability neyens and baeyens 2003 to clarify the role of amino acids in sludge dewatering which was sourced from the degradation of proteinaceous compounds by the oxidation process the downstream studies focused on the oxidation process by varying concentrations of h2o2 at a fixed concentration of fe ii 3 2 effects of fenton oxidation treatment on amino acids generally among the 23 types of amino acids investigated only 20 kinds of amino acids can be identified including 9 kinds of hydrophobic amino acids i e met trp phe leu ala tyr val ile and proline pro and 11 kinds of hydrophilic amino acids i e asp thr cys lys arg gly his ser and glu asparagine asn and glutamine gln fig 1c and d the residual three amino acids i e sarcosine sar hydroxyproline hyp and norvaline nva were under the detection limit and 12 hydrophobic hydrophilic amino acids including trp tyr lys met leu ala cys asp val ile phe and pro were found to be diversely presented in sludge samples before and after fenton treatment in the rs the hydrophilic thr was predominated 15 48 mg n l followed by the hydrophobic pro 13 08 mg n l the hydrophobic phe 6 24 mg n l and the hydrophilic lys 5 96 mg n l zhang et al 2013a also found that amino acids of thr pro lys glu gly arg ala and leu were the major constituents of sewage sludge after fenton treatment the total concentration of hydrophobic amino acids showed an increasing trend as the dose of h2o2 increased fig 1c which further confirmed the degradation of proteinaceous compounds moreover the concentration of thr was almost depleted and the concentrations of the hydrophilic cys and lys decreased but the concentrations of phe and pro were still predominant in association with the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of these amino acids it is therefore deduced that fenton treatment may be effective in degrading the hydrophilic amino acid e g thr cys and lys and promoting the generation of the hydrophobic amino acids e g phe and pro this can be related with the high reduction potential of oh about 2 3 v compared with the hydrogen bond in protein molecule the reduction potential of about 1 0 v choe and min 2006 the peptide bonds in protein molecules may be cleaved and then were spitted into fragments through a series of oxidation reactions kerkaert et al 2011 interestingly it is noted that when the dose of h2o2 was added at a high concentration e g 6 0 mmol g vs the concentration of hydrophobic phe sharply increased this may be due to that the phenyl rings usually showed higher resistance to oxidation than other functional groups e g double stranded structures helal and badawy 2011 3 3 effects of fenton oxidation treatment on the characteristics of nitrogenous compounds in different fractions of eps 3 3 1 nitrogenous compounds contents fig 1e h shows the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved organic nitrogen ton protein and nh4 n in different fractions of eps the sludge dewatering characteristics including cst srf and bound water content showed stronger positive correlations with the tdn ton and protein concentrations in bound eps bound eps than soluble eps sb eps thus indicating that these changes of protein based nitrogenous substances in bound eps can be more related with the enhanced sludge dewaterability by fenton oxidation treatment and more detailed discussion can be found in text s4 of supporting information 3 3 2 the changes of protein molecular weight the type and molecular weight of dissolved organic matters can be identified by the lc ocd ond technique the changes of hydrophilic dissolved organic carbon hi doc and lmw protein were more significant than others table 1 the concentrations of hi doc and lmw protein increased in sb eps as the doses of h2o2 increased from 0 0 to 1 0 mmol g vs but decreased while continuously increasing to 2 5 mmol g vs it indicated that the hydroxyl radical reacted with the soluble fraction of sludge under this condition the mineralization effect was more significant than the solubilization of organic compounds kim et al 2016 meanwhile the decreases of hi doc and lmw protein in bound eps of the treated sludge indicated the shift of organic compounds from the inner layer of sludge flocs bound eps to the outer layer of sludge flocs sb eps moreover the results of pearson s correlation indicated that sludge dewaterability in terms of bound water content showed a positive and strong correlation with the content of lmw protein in bound eps table s3 the predominance of lmw protein might be related to the decomposition of hmw macromolecules during fenton oxidation since the lmw protein showed a lower absolute bimolecular reaction rate constant than the hmw macromolecules during the reaction with hydroxyl radicals westerhoff et al 2007 3 3 3 protein secondary structure and n functionalities the protein secondary structures i e aggregated strands β sheet random coil α helix 3 turn helix and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands determine the aggregation adsorption and flocculation of microbial aggregates which are related to hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of proteins badireddy et al 2010 hou et al 2015 as shown in table s4 α helix and β sheet predominated in bound eps of sludge samples the α helix was retained by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond while the β sheet had a unique structure like the twisted and pleated sheet li et al 2020 after fenton oxidation treatment the content of β sheet was significantly higher than that in rs table s4 the higher content of β sheet indicated that the hydrogen bond was destroyed after fenton oxidation treatment thus leading to a looser structure of protein and benefiting the exposure of hydrophobic sites and groups of proteins for enhanced sludge dewaterability li et al 2020 the results of non protonated and protonated nitrogenous compounds were obtained from the xps analysis yin et al 2015 yuan et al 2011 as shown in table s4 combined with the results in table s3 the content of bound water showed a strong and positive correlation with the content of non protonated nitrogen nnonpr r 0 871 p 0 05 the amines and amides of nnonpr were related with the stretching co of β sheet in protein secondary structures as well as the stretching coo and c o of carboxylic groups in protein zhang et al 2013b therefore the increase of nnonpr content could significantly improve the strength stiffness and energy dissipation capacity of proteins failing to destruct protein structure yang et al 2017 thus leading to poor sludge dewaterability 3 3 4 protein types the origins functions biological process of proteins can be clarified based on gene ontology go classification for tracking the changes of proteins before and after fenton oxidation treatment fig 2 and table s5 in total 391 types of protein were identified in sludge samples among which most of the identified proteins were derived from the cytoplasm and identified as the intracellular proteins fig 2a such as ribosomal proteins there were also some identified proteins presented in extracellular part with higher contents of disulphide bridges and cysteine residues bradshaw 1989 such as porin transmembrane proteins they can function as a type of channel by transferring the certain small molecules e g proteins polysaccharide and ions through cell membrane nikaido 2003 moreover the membrane proteins on the bacterial surface played an important role in the bonding properties that were associated with the surface reaction and bio flocculation achouak et al 2001 according to results of the go analysis for protein functions the identified proteins in sludge were mainly responsible for functions such as structural constituent of ribosome nucleotide binding and oxidoreductase activity fig 2b for instance nucleotide binding proteins encompass many elongation factors which were associated with the initiation elongation and termination of protein biosynthesis bourne et al 1991 the classification of go analysis of biological processes indicated that proteins were primarily related with translation process and oxidation reduction process possibly induced by the fenton oxidation process interestingly most proteins that encompass translation process belong to the families of ribosomal proteins fig 2c the ribosomal proteins are the essential parts of the ribosome and cell organelles for intracellular protein synthesis chen et al 2010 nakashima and nishikawa 1992 also found that intracellular proteins were consisted with relatively high abundance of aliphatic and charged amino acid after fenton oxidation treatment 16 proteins were observed to be obviously down regulated fold change 0 83 and 29 proteins were up regulated fold change 1 20 table s5 most of up regulated proteins were related to nucleotide binding and transportation based on molecular functions and biological processes of go classification for example elongation factor tu belonging to intracellular proteins had a high fold change and its function was related with gtp binding and gtpase activity table s5 for the down related proteins most of them were originally derived from membrane and ribosome according to the classification basing on cellular components table s5 the decrease of extracellular membrane protein indicated the damage of the membrane structure induced by fenton oxidation the results of live dead staining can further support this finding the ratio of live dead cells decreased with the increasing dose of h2o2 further indicating that fenton oxidation was effective in damaging bacterial cells figs s3a f after cell lysis the membrane and ribosome proteins were destroyed along with the release of intracellular water which was beneficial for sludge dewaterability the decrease of fluorescence intensity of protein in sludge samples stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc further supported this finding fig 3 a f it was in consistent with the reduced protein content of eps after fenton oxidation treatment fig 1g the degradation of proteinaceous compounds may result in disruption of the hydration shell of proteins thus resulting in release of the bound water xu et al 2018 therefore it was inferred that fenton oxidation treatment could mainly damage the membrane and ribosomal proteins through destroying the transport and translation of cells 3 4 relationship between the contents of amino acids and proteinaceous compounds and sludge dewaterability 3 4 1 sludge dewaterability the results of pearson s correlation indicated that both cst and srf showed negative and strong correlations with the hydrophobicity of amino acids for cst r 0 984 p 0 01 for srf r 0 982 p 0 01 while they both showed positive and strong correlations with the hydrophilicity of amino acids for cst r 0 934 p 0 01 for srf r 0 890 p 0 05 table 2 the enhanced sludge dewaterability after fenton treatment can be related with the release of hydrophobic amino acids and the degradation of hydrophilic amino acids moreover the concentration of the hydrophobic amino acid of trp showed a strong and negative correlation with sludge dewaterability for bound water content r 0 953 p 0 05 while the hydrophilic amino acid of lys showed a strong and positive correlation with sludge dewaterability for bound water content r 0 964 p 0 01 table 2 nakashima and nishikawa 1994 reported that trp and lys were the important compositions of both intracellular and extracellular proteins the characteristics of trp significantly affected protein physicochemical characteristics e g α helix mode of helix formation β strands etc subrahmanyam et al 1960 more presence of the hydrophobic trp can make sludge flocs easily to separate from water and settle through building hydrophobic regions for forming drainage channels liu et al 2020 in contrast the hydrophilic groups i e free nh2 and co of lys can change the surface characteristics of sludge particles by increasing their viscosity and hydrophilicity lin et al 2019 3 4 2 proteinaceous compounds as can be seen in table 2 indiscernible correlations between the concentrations of amino acids and the concentrations of tdn ton protein and nh4 n in sb eps were noted however interestingly the concentrations of the amino acids lys ala and trp were strongly correlated with nitrogenous components e g tdn ton and protein in bound eps to be exemplified the content of lys showed a strong and positive correlation with tdn ton and protein for tdn r 0 982 p 0 01 for ton r 0 982 p 0 01 for protein r 0 974 p 0 01 while the content of trp showed a strong and negative correlation with tdn ton and protein for tdn r 0 986 p 0 01 for ton r 0 986 p 0 01 for protein r 0 985 p 0 01 the predominance of the tryptophan like protein in sludge samples identified by the three dimensional excitation emission matrix has been widely reported xiao et al 2017b yu et al 2019 similarly the predominance of lys in sludge samples has also been reported in other studies chen et al 2019 therefore the predominance of trp and lys in sludge samples was related with their roles as the key amino acids responsible for affecting sludge dewaterability during the fenton treatment 3 4 3 protein molecular weight in bound eps it is noted that the hydrophobic amino acid of trp showed strong and negative correlations with the hi doc r 0 965 p 0 01 and lmw protein r 0 987 p 0 01 in bound eps fig 3g the hi doc and lmw protein can deteriorate sludge dewaterability due to their strong affinities towards water chen et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 the indole and pyrrolidine ring in the aromatic amino acids of trp could serve as hydrogen donors via their hydroxyl groups to react with the hydroxyl radicals pouzo et al 2016 making these functional groups in proteins more accessible to the oxidation process hence more try can be generated while destructing the hi doc and lmw protein thus showing a negative correlation moreover the content of hydrophilic amino acid of lys showed strong and positive correlations with the hi doc r 0 893 p 0 05 and lmw protein r 0 937 p 0 01 in bound eps fig 3g the fe ii could bind to the lys and formed the chelate reaction with h2o2 to generate the hydroxyl radicals that then preferentially attack the lys stadtman and levine 2003 the positive correlation between lys and hi doc with lmw protein was related with the hydrophilicity and vulnerability of lys during fenton oxidation treatment zhou et al 2019 3 4 4 protein secondary structure and n functionalities in bound eps as shown in fig 3g the content of trp showed a strong and negative correlation with the secondary structure of 3 turn helix r 0 840 p 0 05 it has been reported that 3 turn helix was found in the compositional distribution of the amino acid of trp argos and palau 1982 destructing protein secondary structure with more production of hydrophobic sites of 3 turn helix may contribute to the production of hydrophobic amino acids of trp moreover as shown in fig 3g trp showed strong and negative correlations with nnonpr r 0 984 p 0 01 and lys showed strong and positive correlations with nnonpr r 0 924 p 0 01 while indiscernible correlations were observed between these amino acids and npr the destruction of amines and amides was the key factor responsible for the production of these hydrophobic amino acids the results of borduas et al 2016 supported this study that the amide bonds peptide bonds were the central structure of protein molecules and the destruction of amide bonds can result in the generation of trp the oh may react with protein side chains and weaken non polar inter protein reactions thus resulting in expansion of the protein tertiary structure and the release of interstitial water and bound water wang et al 2018 the structural equation models showed the direct and indirect influences between bound water content amino acids molecular weight and secondary structure of protein and n functionalities in bound eps fig 3h and i it showed that both lys and trp have indirect effects on bound water content through three paths which are lys trp 3 turn helix bound water content lys trp nnonpr lmw protein bound water content and lys trp 3 turn helix nnonpr lmw protein bound water content these indirect effects of both lys and trp on bound water content and the related protein properties may suggest that the effects of amino acids on sludge dewaterability were closely related with the destruction of protein structures during sludge dewatering by fenton oxidation treatment lys positively influenced the 3 turn helix and nnonpr however trp had a negative influence on 3 turn helix and nnonpr it may be related that trp and lys are hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids respectively thus resulting in the different influences on protein characteristics 3 4 5 dft calculation of the oxidation process in recent years the dft calculation has been becoming a useful tool to investigate the intrinsic kinetics and the chemical pathways for the degradation of key organic matters in wastewater wang et al 2020 aquatic environment wang et al 2019 soil suzuki et al 2019 and sludge chen et al 2020 in this study the molecular dynamics simulation of protein and hydroxyl was regarded as a proxy for the investigation on the mechanism of possible interaction between protein and hydroxyl radical in the molecular aspect and the protein structure was represented by the simplified structure of peptide containing amino acids identified in sludge sample as showed in fig 4 through the dft calculation the total charge δq of hydroxyl was calculated using the bader method which can show the electric charge transfer during the interaction of hydroxyl and peptide table s6 it showed that the charge transfer of hydroxyl with the peptide containing trp was the highest of 0 337 e it may be related that the hydroxyl was more likely to interact with the peptide containing trp resulting in more production of hydrophobic amino acid of trp after fenton treatment however the dft calculation of the oxidation process might not work accurately in the real situations if considering the complex environmental conditions in the future work more practical parameters will be considered during the dft calculation 3 5 effects of the identified amino acids on sludge dewatering of the re coagulation process the surface thermodynamic parameters of free energy values for aggregation of rs and sludge samples treated by amino acids of lys and trp were calculated the results are listed in table s7 the interfacial free energy δ g a d h of sludge treated by trp was 15 36 mj m2 which was significantly lower than that of rs and sludge samples treated by lys the addition of trp may lead to a stronger hydrophobic interaction of the surface of sludge the lewis acid base interaction free energies δ g a d h a b of sludge treated by trp and lys had higher absolute values compared with that of van der waals interaction free energies δ g a d h l w implying that lewis acid based interactions played more important roles in the coagulation process to analyze the distance dependent interrelationship of interaction energies the extended dlvo curves of rs and sludge samples treated by amino acids of lys and trp were presented as can be seen in fig 5 considering the relatively high absolute value of the acid base interaction wab it is therefore concluded that its contribution to the total interaction energy was obviously more significant than those of the energy of van der waals energies wa and the energy of electric double layer wr hou et al 2015 meanwhile it is noted that wab of rs and sludge added with lys was both positive indicating that sludge flocs were relatively hydrophilicity and mutually exclusive moreover the wab of sludge added with lys was higher than that of rs indicating that the addition of lys can significantly enhance sludge hydrophilicity thus deteriorating sludge dewaterability in contrast the wab of sludge was negative with the addition of trp indicating that the hydrophobic interaction was predominated in the sludge the total energy of the interaction wtot the sum of wa wr and wab is an indicator of the energy barrier for sludge coagulation the total interaction wtot increased with the nearness between sludge particles and the absolute values of wtot were in sequence of rs lys rs rs trp these results indicated that compared with the rs the sludge particles added with lys must overcome higher energy barrier for aggregation while the sludge particles added with trp may result in less energy barrier for aggregation 4 conclusions this study systematically studied the types and concentrations of amino acids and investigated their correlations with characteristics of proteinaceous compounds i e molecular weight secondary structure type and morphology during sludge conditioning by fenton s reagent through the statistical analyses of pearson s correlation and sem the results indicated that the hydrophobic amino acid of trp and the hydrophilic amino acid of lys were the key amino acids related with protein molecular weight type and secondary structure as well as with sludge dewaterability the amino acids may be sourced from damage of the membrane and ribosomal proteins by the hydroxyl radicals the generation of amino acids during the oxidation of sludge samples by the hydroxyl radicals was calculated with the dft method for the first time the peptide bonds connected with trp were more inclined to be decomposed than other amino acids particularly more predominance of trp can result in less necessary energy barrier for aggregation of particles this study suggests that regulating protein degradation towards more production of trp could contribute to enhance sludge dewaterability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
