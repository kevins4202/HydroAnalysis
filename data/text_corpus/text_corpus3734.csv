18670,with the growth in production and use of chemicals and the fact that many end up in the aquatic environment there is an increasing need for advanced water treatment technologies that can remove chemicals of emerging concern cecs from water the current lack of a homogenous approach for testing advanced water treatment technologies hampers the interpretation and evaluation of cec removal efficiency data and hinders informed decision making by stakeholders with regard to which treatment technology could satisfy their specific needs here a data evaluation framework is proposed to improve the use of current knowledge in the field of advanced water treatment technologies for drinking water and wastewater consisting of a set of 9 relevance criteria and 51 reliability criteria the two criteria sets underpin a thorough unbiased and standardised method to select studies to evaluate and compare cec removal efficiency of advanced water treatment technologies in a scientifically sound way the relevance criteria set was applied to 244 papers on removal efficiency of which only 20 fulfilled the criteria the reliability criteria were applied to the remaining papers in general these criteria were fulfilled with regards to information on the target compound the water matrix and the treatment process conditions however there was a lack of information on data interpretation and statistics in conclusion a minority of the evaluated papers are suited for comparison across techniques compounds and water matrixes there is a clear need for more uniform reporting of water treatment studies for cec removal in the future this will benefit the selection of appropriate technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords data evaluation criteria chemicals of emerging concern advanced water treatment technologies removal efficiency drinking water wastewater 1 introduction chemicals are continuously produced for various beneficial purposes such as protecting crops conserving food or treatment of diseases over 348 000 chemicals are currently registered and regulated via national and international authorities chemlist new chemicals enter the market constantly and the global volume of production of chemicals is continuously growing bernhardt et al 2017 cefic 2016 unep 2013 many of these chemicals and their transformation products enter the aquatic environment during their life cycle schwarzenbach et al 2006 chemicals of emerging concern cecs in the water cycle have been the focus of research for more than 30 years the main focus has been on assessing their toxicity bruce et al 2010 schriks et al 2010 identifying their fate in the environment mamy et al 2015 documenting their occurrence loos et al 2009 2010 2013 and minimising their release into the environment together with optimising removal options rivera utrilla et al 2013 van wezel et al 2017 to minimise concentrations and thus adverse effects removal efficiencies of various advanced drinking water and wastewater treatment technologies have been the focus of research lee and von gunten 2010 luo et al 2014 rivera utrilla et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 yang et al 2017 advanced water treatment technologies are based on sorption oxidation and size exclusion principles the experimental settings in studies on the efficiency of these technologies are not homogeneous technologies can be tested at lab pilot or full scale with different compounds and under different conditions different water matrices can be tested such as demineralised water real or standardized surface water ground water drinking water and wastewater the target compounds can be spiked as single compound in mixtures with varying concentrations or environmental samples can be used there can be variations in the process conditions of the treatment e g dose contact time or flux finally there are variations in how experimental set ups and results are expressed in mj cm2 or w m2 in case of uv oxidation with freundlich isotherms or removal percentage in the case of granular activated carbon gac and many others these variations and the resulting ambiguity obstruct the interpretation and evaluation of data concerning the removal efficiency of cecs of specific treatment technologies stakeholders within the urban water cycle have sufficient information on sources occurrence and risks of cecs and on potential mitigation options but the relevance and reliability of the information is often unknown fischer et al 2017 as a consequence a framework for evaluation of scientific and technical information when evaluating removal efficiency studies would be helpful including criteria for relevance and reliability specified for the technologies examples of such data evaluation frameworks from the field of eco toxicology are available and well used e g to identify studies for the derivation of environmental quality standards in a scientifically sound way ågerstrand et al 2011b klimisch et al 1997 moermond et al 2016 roth and ciffroy 2016 the aim of this study is to develop a novel evaluation framework that consists of two criteria sets that can be used to evaluate the i relevance and ii reliability of cec removal efficiency studies for advanced drinking and wastewater treatment technologies commonly used advanced drinking and wastewater treatment technologies are activated carbon granulated or powdered activated carbon gac or pac the use of ozone o3 and uv with or without h2o2 and finally nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro luo et al 2014 van wezel et al 2017 therefore the criteria developed focus on those technologies the developed criteria sets are subsequently applied to 244 removal efficiency studies 2 methodology firstly existing data evaluation frameworks were explored to be used as a starting point for the water treatment technology evaluation framework secondly we identified parameters influencing removal efficiencies of the selected treatment technologies such as cec characteristics characteristics of the water matrix involved and the treatment process settings and characteristics these impact parameters may differ per treatment technology an initial literature review was carried out to gain insight in the selected treatment technologies using scopus papers describing the water treatment techniques gac pac ozone uv h2o2 and nf ro membranes were selected based on their title the full paper was retrieved based on the abstract and priority was given to recent reviews preliminary impact parameter lists were created and subsequently discussed with five experts from universities knowledge institutes and water utilities covering all selected technologies we used semi structured face to face interviews and e mailed the preliminary impact parameter lists ahead of the interview to give the possibility of addressing additional parameters the interviews were recorded and analysed based on this further extensive additional literature research on each individual treatment technique was carried out to underpin the selected impact parameters and make sure none were left out a revised impact parameter list was discussed in a workshop within the eu fp7 solutions project based on this the final impact parameter list was set the selected data evaluation framework was then used to develop a novel framework suited to evaluate the cec removal efficiency studies for advanced water treatment technologies finally we used the developed framework to evaluate the relevance of 244 removal efficiency papers these papers were found using the scopus database by searching on removal of cecs and the chosen treatment technologies and in the reference lists of the retained articles the 244 papers evaluated for relevance covered 54 journals with impact factors from 0 7 to 11 6 and included various research fields such as radiation physics environmental pollution and chemical engineering supplementary information 1 papers fulfilling the relevance criteria were evaluated with regards to the reliability criteria 3 existing data evaluation frameworks many frameworks for evaluation of scientific and technical information exist echa 2011 epa 2012 oecd 1998 usepa 2003 most are developed and applied for the implementation of experimental data in regulatory frameworks or decision making processes in one of the first generic frameworks for evaluation of scientific and technical information five key factors are highlighted usepa 2003 1 soundness the extent to which the scientific and technical procedures and methods employed to generate the information are reasonable for and consistent with the intended application 2 applicability and utility the extent to which the information is relevant for the intended use 3 clarity and completeness the degree of clarity and completeness with which the data assumptions methods quality assurance and analyses employed to generate the information are documented 4 uncertainty and variability the extent to which the quantitative and qualitative variability and uncertainty in the information or in the procedures measures methods or models are evaluated and characterized 5 evaluation and review the extent of independent verification validation and peer review of the information or of the procedures measures methods or models besides the generic evaluation frameworks several scientific fields have their own specific frameworks tailored to their needs within the field of eco toxicology thorough and scientifically sound assessment of scientific data is necessary in relation to the hazard and risk evaluation of chemicals echa 2011 klimisch et al 1997 moermond et al 2016 roth and ciffroy 2016 in view of the analogy of having to consider the complexity of cecs in various water matrices these well developed data evaluation frameworks were considered a useful starting point to develop a data evaluation criteria set for the cec removal efficiencies the first and most used toxicological evaluation framework is the klimisch approach focussing on 1 reliability evaluating the inherent quality of a test report or publication relating to preferably standardized methodologies and the description of experimental procedures and results to give evidence of the clarity and plausibility of the findings 2 relevance covering the extent to which data and or tests are appropriate for a particular intended use of the data i e in the case toxicological evaluation hazard identification or risk characterization 3 adequacy defining the usefulness of data for the intended risk assessment purposes when there is more than one set of data for each effect the greatest weight is attached to the most reliable and relevant data set the klimisch approach is used in the reach legislation for information requirements and chemical safety assessment echa 2011 the klimisch framework has been criticised for being too reliant on expert judgement as it provides few criteria for the reliability evaluation and only mentions relevance with very little guidance on how to evaluate this ågerstrand et al 2011a kase et al 2016 moermond et al 2016 therefore a more detailed framework for evaluation was developed and tested within the cred criteria for reporting and evaluation ecotoxicity data project kase et al 2016 moermond et al 2016 this framework consists of two criteria sets addressing relevance and reliability in this framework adequacy is addressed under the heading relevance the relevance criteria set contains 13 relevance criteria under the headings general biological relevance and exposure relevance the reliability criteria set entails 20 quite specific criteria under the headings general information test set up test compound test organism exposure conditions and finally statistical design and biological response these criteria sets are further elaborated point by point as to why it is important and how it should be verified moermond et al 2016 this elaboration is followed by a recommendation of 50 points which should be included in a study to be able to evaluate it properly the existing eco toxicology frameworks have recently been evaluated by roth and ciffroy 2016 as relevance and reliability were seen as important evaluation points here we considered only frameworks clearly separating and evaluating these criteria i e ågerstrand amore and cred ågerstrand et al 2011b isigonis et al 2015 moermond et al 2016 the amore framework was not selected as it is a computer based decision support system very specifically tailored to the evaluation of ecotoxicity tests and not easily adaptable to other purposes ågerstrand et al 2011b isigonis et al 2015 moermond et al 2016 roth and ciffroy 2016 the cred framework gives a detailed description of what needs to be assessed for the evaluation of relevance and reliability summarized in two tables these were used as a starting point to develop a relevance and a reliability criteria set for the evaluation of cec removal efficiency studies for water treatment technologies 4 results 4 1 impact parameters for water treatment efficiency assessment the impact parameters which influence cec removal efficiencies of advanced water treatment technologies concern a cec characteristics b water matrix characteristics and c treatment process conditions these are specified per treatment technology in table 1 parameters in bold are unique to each study other parameters are relevant but can be retrieved elsewhere such as via scientific literature and databases such as episuite chemspider and oecd toolbox 4 2 relevance and reliability criteria for water treatment efficiency assessment 4 2 1 assessing the relevance of a water treatment study for relevance we used the definitions of klimisch et al 1997 and ecetoc 2009 relevance broadly refers to the extent to which data and tests are appropriate fit for purpose for their intended use it is a context dependent quality criterion that is neither intrinsic to a given study per se nor a function of the information available about that study the relevance criteria appropriateness of data and tests see table 2 are used to determine whether a paper is of interest for the specific purpose if positive the reliability should be assessed 4 2 1 1 explanation of the relevance criteria criteria numbers from table 2 relevance of data 1 is the scope of the tests appropriate for the evaluation the requirements for evaluating cec removal efficiencies by water treatment technologies is that the technology is commercially available and full scale applied in the water sector only then can it be used by stakeholders to make informed decisions about relevant treatment technologies this at current implies that cec removal studies on activated carbon gac and pac o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 or nf and ro membranes are considered appropriate evidently in the future this list of commercially available and full scale applied techniques can be expanded 2 are the data reported appropriate for the evaluation the purpose is to compare the removal efficiency of one treatment technology with another this means that if a study reports removal efficiencies in such a way that these cannot be compared across technologies e g break through curves for granular activated carbon it is not considered relevant for this purpose the results should ideally be reported as removal percentage log units of removal or influent effluent concentrations which can be used to calculate the removal efficiency studies presenting the removal precentages only in graph form were disregarded as excact removal percentages cannot be retrieved from graphs many studies use the connotation and before the removal percentage as they cannot be more specific due to the limit of quantification limit of detection lod loq this severly hampers the possibility of comparing the study to other studies in case or have been used only studies reporting removal precentages 99 or 1 have been included as these results are considered equal to 99 or 1 removal in case of negative removal efficiencies these may reflect loq in influent matrices fluctuating concentrations or transformation processes during treatment and can be relevant to include however studies to find the conditions at which a certain percentage of a compound is removed i e where the removal percentage is fixed are discarded as this is a different way of studying removal relevance of tests 3 5 relevance of target compound s when testing a large number of compounds these should ideally represent a broad range of physicochemical properties the focus can also be on one compound or a group of compounds that are known to be problematic to remove with other techniques than advanced water treatment techniques such as persistent mobile organic compounds pmocs reemtsma et al 2016 in case of compounds that degrade easily due to other processes than the treatment studied it should be verified that the compound is actually removed by the tested treatment technology this emphasizes the importance of controls ideally tested concentrations of the cecs should be representative for environmental levels but this can be difficult to achieve with compounds with a high loq 6 7 relevance of water matrix it is important to ensure that the selected water matrix corresponds with the purpose of the study especially wastewater has many properties that alter removal efficiencies compared to cleaner matrices luo et al 2014 as an example the often higher wastewater content of doc nom influences the efficiency of o3 or uv compared to surface water with generally lower doc nom content 8 9 relevance of treatment technology experimental conditions need to be appropriate for the purpose of the tests it should be considered how the tested conditions relate to full scale operational ranges e g dosing exposure time and whether they are realistic for example the maximum dosage of o3 is in many cases legally restricted because of the formation of bromate that is highly toxic von gunten 2003b 4 2 2 assessing the reliability of a water treatment study when assessing the reliability of a water treatment study for data evaluation we used the definition by roth and ciffroy 2016 the reliability of a study relates inter alia to the robustness and validity of the method used the completeness and detail of reporting the clarity and plausibility of the findings to ensure their reproducibility but also to the uncertainty of the knowledge base with regard to reliability we divide the criteria into the highlighted components from the above definition method reporting information reproducibility and uncertainty see table 3 4 2 2 1 explanation of the reliability criteria criteria numbers from table 3 method 1 2 is a guideline or modified guideline used for any part of the experiment is the test performed under glp conditions the international organization for standardization iso and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd are continuously producing guidelines to amongst others standardize various chemical tests iso 2017 oecd 2017 at the moment no guidelines for testing removal efficiencies for the selected treatment techniques are available nevertheless iso and oecd have provided guidelines on how to measure cecs and how to take water samples the american society for testing and materials astm published several standards related to water treatment technologies on their website amongst others standards on how to predict adsorption capacity of activated carbon ac and some standard procedures for membrane testing e g salt rejection astm 2014a b c these guidelines are relevant for certain studies on cec removal efficiency besides these guidelines it is also relevant to know if the experiments are performed under good laboratory practices glp conditions 3 are validity criteria fulfilled controls this to verify that only the tested treatment technology is removing the cecs from the water matrix and no other processes such as natural degradation or evaporation takes place reporting information to have all the information necessary to make a thorough evaluation of the limitations and exact conditions of the cec removal efficiency study the following information criteria 4 47 should be reported either in the study itself or in the supplementary information target compound 4 6 identification many of the below mentioned impact parameters can be found in databases and literature e g episuite chemspider oecd toolbox etc if the compound name and or cas number is known 7 molecular charge pka ac ozone nf ro membranes the pka of the compound combined with the ph of the water matrix can be used to determine the charge of the compound if this is not given in the study de ridder et al 2010 moreno castilla 2004 a charged molecule will be either attracted to or repelled by the charge of the ac surface de ridder et al 2011 de ridder et al 2010 kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2014 margot et al 2013 moreno castilla 2004 for the same reason the charge of a compound also has an influence on the nf ro rejection usually negatively charged cecs are better rejected than positively charged cecs bellona et al 2004 verliefde et al 2008 yoon et al 2007 also for treatment with ozone the charge is often relevant especially for nitrogen containing compounds as often only deprotonated compounds have enough electron density see also 10 functional groups reactivity to be attacked by ozone borowska et al 2016 8 log kow log dow ac nf ro membranes the hydrophobicity of a compound affects the efficiency of a treatment technique hu et al 1998 kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2005 the hydrophobicity is often expressed as the octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow or the ph corrected log dow de ridder et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 log dow values can be calculated on the basis of the reported ph of the water matrix the pka and the log kow so it is not essential to report for nf ro membranes more hydrophobic cecs can be adsorbed by the membrane and are initially well removed but removal may decrease later due to saturation of the membrane hu et al 2007 moons and van der bruggen 2006 verliefde et al 2007a 9 molecular weight size ac nf ro membranes large compounds tend to be less easily removed with ac de ridder et al 2011 mailler et al 2014 the size of a compound expressed in molecular weight is believed to be one of the main factors in rejection of cecs by nf ro membranes bellona et al 2004 yoon et al 2007 besides the molecular weight also the molecular size width length effective diameter and the molecular volume are used in studies as a measure of the size of the cec braeken et al 2005 comerton et al 2008 2009 jung et al 2005 kiso et al 2001 sadmani et al 2014 yangali quintanilla et al 2009 10 functional groups reactivity all relevant functional groups can be identified on the basis of the compound structure so in principle they do not have to be reported although it is helpful if the author includes information on this topic different functional groups are relevant for different techniques with regards to ac especially groups allowing h bonds or π π binding are relevant de ridder et al 2010 mailler et al 2014 for nf ro membranes functional groups of cecs may play a role in whether the compound is rejected or not this is however mostly related to the resulting size and or charge of the compound bellona et al 2004 košutić and kunst 2002 ozaki and li 2002 with regards to o3 and uv it is the reactivity of a compound that is important this is related to the electron density of the compound which can again be related to the functional groups functional groups with a high electron density will increase the reactivity of a compound von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for treatment with ozone a broad range of functional groups such as nitro groups amides primary amines thioethers and olefins are known to enhance the removal of cecs kovalova et al 2013 nakada et al 2007 snyder et al 2007a von gunten 2003a for uv or o3 treatment in combination with h2o2 an even broader scale of chemical structures will be attacked as oh radicals react more unspecific with a very wide variety of functional groups snyder et al 2007a 11 supplier and purity all supplier and purity of purchased target compounds should be reported as this cannot be retrieved elsewhere this is important with regards to both the analysis and the behaviour of the target compounds water matrix 12 type of water all it is essential to know which type of water was used and whether it has been artificially created or is of environmental origin this gives an indication of the relevance of the study in relation to full scale treatment and what issues to expect from the water matrix if the water matrix is artificially created details on the substituents and preparation procedure are to be reported in addition the origin of the composition may be given as this can be based on literature e g greywater benami et al 2016 pradhan et al 2019 and wastewater wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2004 13 ph all as previously discussed under 7 molecular charge pka the ph of the water matrix is relevant in most full scale treatments the ph lies between 7 and 9 kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2014 margot et al 2013 so it should be explicated if the study has been performed at a significantly different ph depending on the pka a cec might express higher or lower reaction rates with uv or ozone at a specific ph due to whether it will be present in a deprotonated or protonated state as mentioned in 7 molecular charge pka avisar et al 2010 borowska et al 2016 real et al 2009 furthermore at a high ph ozone decomposition to oh radicals increases and this likely will change the cec removal real et al 2009 the ph can also have an influence on the surface charge of both nf ro membranes and ac as well as impact fouling of the membrane bellona et al 2004 braghetta et al 1997 deshmukh and childress 2001 hagmeyer and gimbel 1998 14 nom concentration and composition all for all treatments the presence of nom can reduce the efficiency of the treatment in which both the concentration and composition are relevant parameters boehler et al 2012 de ridder et al 2011 loos et al 2013 mailler et al 2016 von gunten 2003a with regards to ac nom can reduce the removal efficiency of cecs by pore blocking or adsorption competition kilduff et al 1998 matsui et al 2002 newcombe and drikas 1997 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 the composition of nom has proven to be relevant for adsorption competition where protein like fluorophores seem to be the most problematic molecular components mailler et al 2016 in advanced oxidation treatment the oh radicals are scavenged by nom leading to lower removal efficiencies neamţu and frimmel 2006 pereira et al 2007 snyder et al 2007a von gunten 2003a yuan et al 2009 zwiener and frimmel 2000 in the case of uv treatment the presence of nom can increase the removal efficiency of the treatment as the presence of nom can initiate the production of oh radicals leech et al 2009 neamţu and frimmel 2006 pereira et al 2007 zhan et al 2006 on the other hand nom can also decrease the efficiency of uv treatment as it can adsorb the uv see 19 uv transmittance as with uv the effect of nom on nf ro membrane removal efficiency is ambiguous depending on the amount of nom the type of cecs and the type and thickness of the fouling layer and has been researched in many studies comerton et al 2009 nghiem and coleman 2008 nghiem et al 2010 nghiem and hawkes 2007 verliefde et al 2009a usually nom in wastewater is negatively charged assisting in repulsion of negatively charged cecs mailler et al 2014 even though the effect of nom present in the water matrix may not be clear it is important to mention the presence concentration and when relevant and possible the composition of the nom so the influence can be taken into consideration when evaluating the removal efficiency in the 49 studies evaluated in this paper nom is expressed as doc 18 studies toc 17 studies and or cod 13 studies to enable comparison across studies it is recommended to include at least doc only 4 studies mentions nom composition 2 pac studies one nf and one nf ro study 15 temperature all with regards to ac the temperature can an influence adsorption kinetics with a low temperature giving lower removal efficiency nam et al 2014 in removal with ozone temperature can influence ozone decay in a study by real et al 2009 the rate constants of removal with uv increased with increasing temperature however the difference in minimum and maximum temperature in the study was 30 c and this difference is unlikely to occur in full scale applications with regards to nf ro membranes a higher temperature will result is more viscous water which will easier transport diffuse through the membrane and therefore result in a higher flux which also influences the cec removal see also 34 35 transmembrane pressure and permeate flux crittenden and montgomery watson 2012 16 17 nitrite nitrate and bromide bromate ozone uv when applying ozone especially for wastewater the nitrite concentration is relevant since nitrite reacts quickly with ozone and reduces the available dose hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2013 for both uv and ozone the nitrate concentration especially for drinking water is also relevant as this can form nitrite and other by products which are highly toxic furthermore bromide can form the toxic compound bromate with ozone and consequently above certain bromide concentrations ozonation cannot be recommended lee et al 2013 von gunten 2003b von sonntag and von gunten 2012 18 turbidity nf ro membranes for nf ro membranes the turbidity can give an indication of the pre treatment needed and whether to expect fouling see 33 fouling kim et al 2002 19 uv transmittance uv the uv transmittance of the water matrix is relevant to be able to understand the ability of the uv radiation to reach the cecs the transmittance is an indication of how much of the uv radiation is adsorbed by dissolved matter in the water matrix and is related to the nom and nitrate content of the water matrix kruithof and martijn 2013 in general the higher the transmittance the higher the cec removal wols et al 2015 a low transmittance can be compensated for by using more energy to reach the same uv dose treatment process conditions the parameters listed below are all relevant to report as they are unique to the particular study and cannot be found elsewhere some of these parameters will change over time so it is important to report any development of these parameters over the course of the technology test 20 type of technology all the exact type of water treatment technology used should be reported 21 surface membrane area ac nf ro membranes the surface area has a significant influence on the removal efficiency of a specific ac and is thus important to report in general a smaller surface has a smaller removal efficiency mailler et al 2016 the surface area can be acquired from the producer if the commercial name is provided in the study for nf ro membranes the membrane area tested is important to understand the scale of the test rather than its influence on the removal capacity verliefde et al 2009b 22 pore volume and pore size distribution ac the pore volume and the pore size distribution is relevant in relation to the size of the cec and the competition of nom kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2016 moreno castilla 2004 nom can access mesopores and block these and the access of the cecs to underlying micropores moreno castilla 2004 23 25 bedvolume flow through and preloading gac the bedvolume and flow through of the gac column influences the removal efficiency of the gac treatment chowdhury 2013 bedvolume and flow through indicate the time the cecs have to adsorb to the ac see also 28 contact time in case the gac has been used before it will be preloaded with nom this should be reported as it can have a negative influence on the efficiency however preloaded gac columns might also exhibit biological degradation which will have a positive effect on the removal efficiency bourgin et al 2018 26 surface charge ac nf ro membranes the impact of the surface charge has been discussed under 7 molecular charge pka for nf ro membranes the surface charge is often quantified as zeta potential bellona et al 2004 nf ro membranes are mostly negatively charged at neutral ph and thus have a higher affinity for positively or neutral compounds bellona et al 2004 taheran et al 2016 27 concentration dosage intensity pac ozone uv for pac the dosage is the main controlling factor for the removal efficiency the higher the dose the higher the removal boehler et al 2012 mailler et al 2014 snyder et al 2007b also for ozone the dosage has a substantial positive influence on the removal efficiency margot et al 2013 snyder et al 2007a zwiener and frimmel 2000 often the ozone dosage is related to the doc concentration of the water matrix as a higher dose can compensate for the limiting effect of the doc concentration zwiener and frimmel 2000 especially for wastewater the ozone dosage is often given in relation to the doc concentration as g o3 g doc hollender et al 2009 kovalova et al 2013 also for uv in general the higher the dose the higher the removal efficiency however this is only valid for cecs that are already susceptible to degradation with uv light kovalova et al 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 wols et al 2013 in some of the studies evaluated the uv intensity is given in einstein s 1 which is not a si unit and cannot be compared to the more commonly used mj cm2 28 contact exposure or irradiation time ac ozone uv the contact time can have a great influence on the removal efficiency of ac mailler et al 2016 snyder et al 2007b however for compounds with very fast adsorption kinetics this impact factor will be less relevant mailler et al 2016 in uv studies the irradiation time is included in the calculation of the dose so it is less relevant to state however when using advanced oxidation the exposure time during which the oh radicals have time to form and react with the cecs is relevant 29 biological activity gac usually it is known if there is a possibility of biological activity in the gac experiments if this is the case it needs to be stated as the presence of microorganisms in the gac filter can enhance removal of biodegradable cecs bourgin et al 2018 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 rattier et al 2014 biological activity depends on the time the gac have been in use when using fresh gac or gac directly after regeneration there will be no biological activity in the beginning but it will develop and increase in time during use 30 technology application all the way the technology is applied is also relevant to report as for example the efficiency of ozone depends a lot on the mixing regime dodd et al 2008 zucker et al 2016 it can be difficult to describe an experimental set up so in this case the criterion is considered fulfilled if a schematic of the set up has been included 31 wavelenght uv the wavelength or the source of the uv light which type of lamp is relevant especially in the case of treatment without h2o2 yang et al 2014 as mentioned under 10 functional groups reactivity this can have influence on whether the cec will be able to absorb the radiation and thus degraded by photolysis chen et al 2007 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 yang et al 2014 furthermore a broader uv spectrum can lead to more unwanted by products hofman caris et al 2015 32 concentration of reagent h2o2 ozone uv the addition of h2o2 to ozone or uv treatment increases the production of oh radicals and thus the removal efficiency of the treatment ocampo pérez et al 2010 real et al 2009 ternes et al 2003 zwiener and frimmel 2000 an increase of the h2o2 dose can be used to compensate for nom scavenging zwiener and frimmel 2000 33 fouling nf ro membranes fouling and the type of fouling is important for the evaluation of the removal efficiency of the nf ro membrane organic fouling biofouling has been referred to under 14 nom concentration and composition fouling with nom can lead to higher removal of negatively charged cecs and lower removal of positively charged cecs pressure and flux is also influenced by fouling added resistance as it takes more pressure to force water through a fouled membrane while keeping the flux stable see also 34 35 transmembrane pressure and permeate flux taheran et al 2016 34 35 transmembrane pressure and permeate flux nf ro membranes the transmembrane pressure tmp is related to the permeate flux in a nf ro membrane the higher the transmembrane pressure the higher the flux when the resistance is constant plakas and karabelas 2012 increased pressure lead to higher removal of cecs plakas and karabelas 2012 the highest removal efficiency of pesticides was found with nf membranes operation with a high flux by chen et al 2004 and ahmad et al 2008 in the 49 evaluated papers tmp was not always given instead the working pressure the applied pressure or just pressure was given obstructing comparison across studies 36 cross flow velocity nf membranes during membrane filtration the phenomenon of concentration polarization occurs resulting in a higher concentration of solutes in front of the membrane surface resulting in a lower rejection of solutes compared to the bulk solution hajibabania et al 2011a ng and elimelech 2004 a higher cross flow velocity results in a lower concentration polarization and therefore a higher cec rejection crittenden and montgomery watson 2012 the cross flow velocity cleans the membrane the higher the velocity the more fouling resistance is removed crittenden and montgomery watson 2012 the influence of fouling on removal of cecs has been discussed under 33 fouling 37 backwashing gac backwashing can influence the cec removal of the gac it removes materials blocking the pores of the gac enhancing the removal efficiency on the other hand it can also disturb the build up of the bed and remove organic material degrading the cecs which will decrease the removal efficiency see also 29 biological activity and 14 nom concentration and composition it is therefore important to state if backwashing is done and how it has been done 38 recovery nf ro membranes the recovery of a nf ro membrane has an effect on the removal efficiency bellona et al 2004 several studies have found that removal efficiency of cecs decreases with increasing recovery chellam and taylor 2001 chen et al 2004 39 mwco and or salt rejection data nf ro membranes the rejection capacity of nf ro membranes can be characterized by the salt passage or rejection of standard salts for ro membranes typically monovalent salts such as nacl are used while for nf membranes bivalent salts such as mgso4 are used bellona et al 2004 kiso et al 1992 1996 2001 it is preferable that these characteristics are noted in the original study as there might be minor changes from batch to batch producers and production processes change the molecular weight cut off mwco is also used in nf ro referring to the lowest molecular weight solute in daltons in which 90 of the solute is retained by the membrane the mwco however can be difficult to obtain and is due to differences in protocols used by manufacturers not always comparable between nf ro membranes bellona et al 2004 cleveland et al 2002 experimental conditions all experimental conditions are essential to report as they are all unique to the specific treatment study and can influence the removal efficiency of the studied technique 40 scale of experiment as differences can be expected between lab pilot and full scale experiments it is important to know the scale of the study hofman caris et al 2017 verliefde et al 2009b lab scale refers to laboratory scale experiments proof of principle this can be either batch experiments batch volume 100 l or continuous flow experiments flow 100 l h pilot scale proof of practice refers to experiments on a larger scale often on site with a flow rate normally 10 m3 h these scales proceed full scale application proof of market 41 stand alone or part of a treatment train when the study is done on a treatment train it is important to know the impact parameters of the water matrix and the removal efficiency of the cecs at each step of the treatment train at least if the authors want to conclude anything on the individual treatment steps in all studies it is relevant to know whether the tested water has received any form of pre treatment in advance of the treatment technology investigated in order to have an understanding of what to expect in the tested water matrix see also 12 type of water the impact parameters of the water matrix should be measured after the pre treatment in case any post treatment is needed it can be relevant to mention this depending on the purpose of the study 42 cec already present or spiked depending on the purpose of the study spiking can be necessary to ensure that an accurate removal percentage can be calculated when spiking a factor 100 above the limit of quantification a removal percentage of 99 can be determined however very high spiking at environmentally unrealistic concentrations may have an effect on removal efficiencies and may alter the behaviour of the cec which is undesirable 43 single compound or mixture this gives an indication of the boundaries of the study as in reality the compounds will almost always be present in a mixture 44 45 initial and end concentration of cecs the initial concentration and the end concentration is particularly important in case no explanation is given on how removal efficiency percentage have been calculated 46 sample collection it is relevant to report how the samples have been collected e g grab sampling or continuously sampling also the number of samples and over what time period is important to mention in order to get an understanding of the representativeness of the samples 47 analytical method cecs here it is essential to describe the analytical methods used and the treatment of the samples furthermore it is important to give the limit of detection for each cec specifically and if possible the recoveries too this information is very relevant as it gives a detailed understanding of what the removal efficiencies are based on this can all be added in supplementary information reproducibility and uncertainties to ensure the clarity and plausibility of the experimental findings the following information criteria 48 51 should be available to assess the reproducibility and uncertainties of the study 48 calculation of removal efficiency it should be clear how the removal efficiencies are calculated and how values loq lod are treated as these choices highly impact the results helsel 2005 weltje and sumpter 2017 when spiking the cecs this problem can be avoided by spiking a high enough concentration when not spiking when not spiking a percentage using the loq lod as end concentration is preferred to stating a 100 removal as this in cases with a low initial concentration and a high loq lod can be very misleading it is also important to note the number of replicates and how they are used in the determination of the removal efficiencies 49 statistical methods have appropriate statistical techniques been employed to evaluate variability and uncertainty if any statistics are used to analyse the experimental findings this should be mentioned including which methods and why 50 significance when significance of the experimental findings is presented it should be noted how this is determined and at what p value a result is deemed significant 51 uncertainties data a description of the produced amount of data and to what degree it is sufficient to support the conclusions of the study is very helpful to evaluate the reliability of the results to what extent do the uncertainty and variability of the different measurements impact the conclusions that can be inferred from the data and the utility of the study what is the standard deviation of the results 5 application of the criteria the current status of reporting is discussed based on the review of 244 selected papers supplementary information 1 and the benefits of a standardised framework are elaborated based on the findings because of the broad selection of techniques and resulting large amount of data the evaluation of the cec removal itself will be presented in a follow up study 5 1 relevance criteria table 4 details the results of the application of the relevance criteria described in chapter 4 2 1 on 244 peer reviewed scientific articles on the removal of cecs with one of the selected water treatment techniques it is important to realise that the failure to fulfil one of the relevance criteria does not necessarily mean that the paper is of poor quality but merely that the paper does not comply with the specified relevance criteria and cannot be used for our purpose i e decision making by stakeholders comparing removal efficiencies between various water treatment techniques it is however remarkable that so few of the evaluated papers are suitable for a comparison across techniques compounds and water matrixes in general the first three criteria are the ones most frequently not fulfilled the papers were either outside the scope we were interested in did not include removal percentages at all or did not report removal percentages in a way that could be used for our purpose overall only 20 of the papers evaluated were in compliance with the relevance criteria and could be used for our purpose 5 2 reliability criteria the application of the relevance criteria left 49 studies on which the reliability criteria could be applied table 5 details the results of the application of the 51 reliability criteria to the water treatment technology papers from table 5 it is clear that some criteria in bold such as compound name technology combinations wavelength scale of experiment whether it is a stand alone whether the compound is spiked or not and the pressure for nf ro membranes are always reported for compound name technology combinations and scale of the experiment this is logical as this is also included in the relevance criteria and the studies have been selected based on this information several criteria are almost always reported criteria 9 12 13 14 21 27 30 32 36 39 43 44 and 47 however for some of these parameters such as nom content and dosage of o3 and uv what is reported is not consistent nom was found to be reported in doc toc and or cod and o3 as mg l or mg o3 g doc which cannot easily be compared if doc is not given the criteria for the target compound properties criteria 4 10 are poorly reported varying from not at all to 50 of the studies except for molecular weight which is reported in 21 of 24 studies in general these criteria are not essential to report as they can be found elsewhere however they facilitate the interpretation of the results in the studies themselves the supplier of the cecs tested criterion 11 is in general reported however the purity of the compound also criterion 11 only in approximately 60 of the studies the criteria concerning the water matrix criteria 12 19 except water type ph and nom concentration and composition are also not well reported with the most reported in 50 of the studies and the least in 25 this is essential information specific for the study and cannot be found elsewhere for the treatment process conditions criteria 20 39 not yet mentioned reporting is also not complete in general they are reported in less than 40 of the studies this information is also specific for the study and cannot be found elsewhere with regards to the experimental conditions criteria 42 48 sample collection and concentration after treatment are rarely reported especially the lack of end concentration makes it very difficult to understand and reproduce the calculation of removal efficiencies understanding removal efficiencies is even more difficult as lod loq and recoveries for the analytical methods are not always reported criterion 47 especially when the method used to calculate the efficiencies the number of replicas the standard deviation and how values below the lod loq are dealt with are reported in as little as 15 47 of the studies this makes it almost impossible to validate the findings of the studies there is also virtually no reporting on whether statistics have been used in the studies criterion 49 and how this together with details on sample collection criterion 46 are the most underreported areas found in the studies no papers fulfilled all the criteria the gac papers fulfil 36 50 of the criteria pac 41 73 ozone h2o2 38 74 uv h2o2 33 64 nf ro 39 71 this does not mean that the papers cannot be used but that not all the information needed for our evaluation is available this will make the assessment of the efficiency of the technique less straightforward as impact parameters that can influence the removal efficiency are not reported and or removal efficiencies have not been described 6 conclusions and recommendations our literature survey revealed that there is currently no uniform approach to study the cec removal efficiency of advanced water treatment technologies removal is tested at various scales with different water matrices and numerous cecs there are large variations in the process conditions of the treatment in the experimental set ups and in the way results are expressed and reported these variations hinder the interpretation and evaluation of the removal efficiency data this in turn makes it difficult for stakeholders to make an informed decision with regards to which treatment technology will be relevant for their specific needs therefore in this study a framework for evaluation of scientific and technical information that describes what is important when evaluating removal efficiency studies was developed for this framework two criteria sets were developed 9 relevance criteria and 51 reliability criteria these two criteria sets offer a thorough unbiased and standardised method to select studies to evaluate and compare the cec removal efficiency of advanced water treatment technologies in a scientifically sound way the relevance criteria have been applied to 244 treatment technology studies and 49 of these papers fulfilled the criteria with non compliance with the criteria outside scope and appropriate data being the main reason for the papers being discarded especially the lack of removal percentage and data reported in a way that it cannot be used affect the potential of these studies to provide additional information and be suitable for a comparison across techniques compounds and water matrixes the reliability criteria were applied to the 49 remaining papers the main finding here was a severe lack of information on how removal percentages had been calculated in terms of how lod loqs had been dealt with how many replicas had been used what statistics had been applied and what the standard deviation was this hinders the interpretation of the reported result furthermore many papers did not report on all the identified impact parameters which makes comparison across studies difficult these findings clearly demonstrates the need for a more uniform approach when the developed framework is used as a guideline by scientists to document their studies it will facilitate the comparison of different treatment technologies regarding the removal of cecs this in turn will enhance the interpretation of the findings of the studies and consequently benefit the selection of appropriate technologies by

18670,with the growth in production and use of chemicals and the fact that many end up in the aquatic environment there is an increasing need for advanced water treatment technologies that can remove chemicals of emerging concern cecs from water the current lack of a homogenous approach for testing advanced water treatment technologies hampers the interpretation and evaluation of cec removal efficiency data and hinders informed decision making by stakeholders with regard to which treatment technology could satisfy their specific needs here a data evaluation framework is proposed to improve the use of current knowledge in the field of advanced water treatment technologies for drinking water and wastewater consisting of a set of 9 relevance criteria and 51 reliability criteria the two criteria sets underpin a thorough unbiased and standardised method to select studies to evaluate and compare cec removal efficiency of advanced water treatment technologies in a scientifically sound way the relevance criteria set was applied to 244 papers on removal efficiency of which only 20 fulfilled the criteria the reliability criteria were applied to the remaining papers in general these criteria were fulfilled with regards to information on the target compound the water matrix and the treatment process conditions however there was a lack of information on data interpretation and statistics in conclusion a minority of the evaluated papers are suited for comparison across techniques compounds and water matrixes there is a clear need for more uniform reporting of water treatment studies for cec removal in the future this will benefit the selection of appropriate technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords data evaluation criteria chemicals of emerging concern advanced water treatment technologies removal efficiency drinking water wastewater 1 introduction chemicals are continuously produced for various beneficial purposes such as protecting crops conserving food or treatment of diseases over 348 000 chemicals are currently registered and regulated via national and international authorities chemlist new chemicals enter the market constantly and the global volume of production of chemicals is continuously growing bernhardt et al 2017 cefic 2016 unep 2013 many of these chemicals and their transformation products enter the aquatic environment during their life cycle schwarzenbach et al 2006 chemicals of emerging concern cecs in the water cycle have been the focus of research for more than 30 years the main focus has been on assessing their toxicity bruce et al 2010 schriks et al 2010 identifying their fate in the environment mamy et al 2015 documenting their occurrence loos et al 2009 2010 2013 and minimising their release into the environment together with optimising removal options rivera utrilla et al 2013 van wezel et al 2017 to minimise concentrations and thus adverse effects removal efficiencies of various advanced drinking water and wastewater treatment technologies have been the focus of research lee and von gunten 2010 luo et al 2014 rivera utrilla et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 yang et al 2017 advanced water treatment technologies are based on sorption oxidation and size exclusion principles the experimental settings in studies on the efficiency of these technologies are not homogeneous technologies can be tested at lab pilot or full scale with different compounds and under different conditions different water matrices can be tested such as demineralised water real or standardized surface water ground water drinking water and wastewater the target compounds can be spiked as single compound in mixtures with varying concentrations or environmental samples can be used there can be variations in the process conditions of the treatment e g dose contact time or flux finally there are variations in how experimental set ups and results are expressed in mj cm2 or w m2 in case of uv oxidation with freundlich isotherms or removal percentage in the case of granular activated carbon gac and many others these variations and the resulting ambiguity obstruct the interpretation and evaluation of data concerning the removal efficiency of cecs of specific treatment technologies stakeholders within the urban water cycle have sufficient information on sources occurrence and risks of cecs and on potential mitigation options but the relevance and reliability of the information is often unknown fischer et al 2017 as a consequence a framework for evaluation of scientific and technical information when evaluating removal efficiency studies would be helpful including criteria for relevance and reliability specified for the technologies examples of such data evaluation frameworks from the field of eco toxicology are available and well used e g to identify studies for the derivation of environmental quality standards in a scientifically sound way ågerstrand et al 2011b klimisch et al 1997 moermond et al 2016 roth and ciffroy 2016 the aim of this study is to develop a novel evaluation framework that consists of two criteria sets that can be used to evaluate the i relevance and ii reliability of cec removal efficiency studies for advanced drinking and wastewater treatment technologies commonly used advanced drinking and wastewater treatment technologies are activated carbon granulated or powdered activated carbon gac or pac the use of ozone o3 and uv with or without h2o2 and finally nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro luo et al 2014 van wezel et al 2017 therefore the criteria developed focus on those technologies the developed criteria sets are subsequently applied to 244 removal efficiency studies 2 methodology firstly existing data evaluation frameworks were explored to be used as a starting point for the water treatment technology evaluation framework secondly we identified parameters influencing removal efficiencies of the selected treatment technologies such as cec characteristics characteristics of the water matrix involved and the treatment process settings and characteristics these impact parameters may differ per treatment technology an initial literature review was carried out to gain insight in the selected treatment technologies using scopus papers describing the water treatment techniques gac pac ozone uv h2o2 and nf ro membranes were selected based on their title the full paper was retrieved based on the abstract and priority was given to recent reviews preliminary impact parameter lists were created and subsequently discussed with five experts from universities knowledge institutes and water utilities covering all selected technologies we used semi structured face to face interviews and e mailed the preliminary impact parameter lists ahead of the interview to give the possibility of addressing additional parameters the interviews were recorded and analysed based on this further extensive additional literature research on each individual treatment technique was carried out to underpin the selected impact parameters and make sure none were left out a revised impact parameter list was discussed in a workshop within the eu fp7 solutions project based on this the final impact parameter list was set the selected data evaluation framework was then used to develop a novel framework suited to evaluate the cec removal efficiency studies for advanced water treatment technologies finally we used the developed framework to evaluate the relevance of 244 removal efficiency papers these papers were found using the scopus database by searching on removal of cecs and the chosen treatment technologies and in the reference lists of the retained articles the 244 papers evaluated for relevance covered 54 journals with impact factors from 0 7 to 11 6 and included various research fields such as radiation physics environmental pollution and chemical engineering supplementary information 1 papers fulfilling the relevance criteria were evaluated with regards to the reliability criteria 3 existing data evaluation frameworks many frameworks for evaluation of scientific and technical information exist echa 2011 epa 2012 oecd 1998 usepa 2003 most are developed and applied for the implementation of experimental data in regulatory frameworks or decision making processes in one of the first generic frameworks for evaluation of scientific and technical information five key factors are highlighted usepa 2003 1 soundness the extent to which the scientific and technical procedures and methods employed to generate the information are reasonable for and consistent with the intended application 2 applicability and utility the extent to which the information is relevant for the intended use 3 clarity and completeness the degree of clarity and completeness with which the data assumptions methods quality assurance and analyses employed to generate the information are documented 4 uncertainty and variability the extent to which the quantitative and qualitative variability and uncertainty in the information or in the procedures measures methods or models are evaluated and characterized 5 evaluation and review the extent of independent verification validation and peer review of the information or of the procedures measures methods or models besides the generic evaluation frameworks several scientific fields have their own specific frameworks tailored to their needs within the field of eco toxicology thorough and scientifically sound assessment of scientific data is necessary in relation to the hazard and risk evaluation of chemicals echa 2011 klimisch et al 1997 moermond et al 2016 roth and ciffroy 2016 in view of the analogy of having to consider the complexity of cecs in various water matrices these well developed data evaluation frameworks were considered a useful starting point to develop a data evaluation criteria set for the cec removal efficiencies the first and most used toxicological evaluation framework is the klimisch approach focussing on 1 reliability evaluating the inherent quality of a test report or publication relating to preferably standardized methodologies and the description of experimental procedures and results to give evidence of the clarity and plausibility of the findings 2 relevance covering the extent to which data and or tests are appropriate for a particular intended use of the data i e in the case toxicological evaluation hazard identification or risk characterization 3 adequacy defining the usefulness of data for the intended risk assessment purposes when there is more than one set of data for each effect the greatest weight is attached to the most reliable and relevant data set the klimisch approach is used in the reach legislation for information requirements and chemical safety assessment echa 2011 the klimisch framework has been criticised for being too reliant on expert judgement as it provides few criteria for the reliability evaluation and only mentions relevance with very little guidance on how to evaluate this ågerstrand et al 2011a kase et al 2016 moermond et al 2016 therefore a more detailed framework for evaluation was developed and tested within the cred criteria for reporting and evaluation ecotoxicity data project kase et al 2016 moermond et al 2016 this framework consists of two criteria sets addressing relevance and reliability in this framework adequacy is addressed under the heading relevance the relevance criteria set contains 13 relevance criteria under the headings general biological relevance and exposure relevance the reliability criteria set entails 20 quite specific criteria under the headings general information test set up test compound test organism exposure conditions and finally statistical design and biological response these criteria sets are further elaborated point by point as to why it is important and how it should be verified moermond et al 2016 this elaboration is followed by a recommendation of 50 points which should be included in a study to be able to evaluate it properly the existing eco toxicology frameworks have recently been evaluated by roth and ciffroy 2016 as relevance and reliability were seen as important evaluation points here we considered only frameworks clearly separating and evaluating these criteria i e ågerstrand amore and cred ågerstrand et al 2011b isigonis et al 2015 moermond et al 2016 the amore framework was not selected as it is a computer based decision support system very specifically tailored to the evaluation of ecotoxicity tests and not easily adaptable to other purposes ågerstrand et al 2011b isigonis et al 2015 moermond et al 2016 roth and ciffroy 2016 the cred framework gives a detailed description of what needs to be assessed for the evaluation of relevance and reliability summarized in two tables these were used as a starting point to develop a relevance and a reliability criteria set for the evaluation of cec removal efficiency studies for water treatment technologies 4 results 4 1 impact parameters for water treatment efficiency assessment the impact parameters which influence cec removal efficiencies of advanced water treatment technologies concern a cec characteristics b water matrix characteristics and c treatment process conditions these are specified per treatment technology in table 1 parameters in bold are unique to each study other parameters are relevant but can be retrieved elsewhere such as via scientific literature and databases such as episuite chemspider and oecd toolbox 4 2 relevance and reliability criteria for water treatment efficiency assessment 4 2 1 assessing the relevance of a water treatment study for relevance we used the definitions of klimisch et al 1997 and ecetoc 2009 relevance broadly refers to the extent to which data and tests are appropriate fit for purpose for their intended use it is a context dependent quality criterion that is neither intrinsic to a given study per se nor a function of the information available about that study the relevance criteria appropriateness of data and tests see table 2 are used to determine whether a paper is of interest for the specific purpose if positive the reliability should be assessed 4 2 1 1 explanation of the relevance criteria criteria numbers from table 2 relevance of data 1 is the scope of the tests appropriate for the evaluation the requirements for evaluating cec removal efficiencies by water treatment technologies is that the technology is commercially available and full scale applied in the water sector only then can it be used by stakeholders to make informed decisions about relevant treatment technologies this at current implies that cec removal studies on activated carbon gac and pac o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 or nf and ro membranes are considered appropriate evidently in the future this list of commercially available and full scale applied techniques can be expanded 2 are the data reported appropriate for the evaluation the purpose is to compare the removal efficiency of one treatment technology with another this means that if a study reports removal efficiencies in such a way that these cannot be compared across technologies e g break through curves for granular activated carbon it is not considered relevant for this purpose the results should ideally be reported as removal percentage log units of removal or influent effluent concentrations which can be used to calculate the removal efficiency studies presenting the removal precentages only in graph form were disregarded as excact removal percentages cannot be retrieved from graphs many studies use the connotation and before the removal percentage as they cannot be more specific due to the limit of quantification limit of detection lod loq this severly hampers the possibility of comparing the study to other studies in case or have been used only studies reporting removal precentages 99 or 1 have been included as these results are considered equal to 99 or 1 removal in case of negative removal efficiencies these may reflect loq in influent matrices fluctuating concentrations or transformation processes during treatment and can be relevant to include however studies to find the conditions at which a certain percentage of a compound is removed i e where the removal percentage is fixed are discarded as this is a different way of studying removal relevance of tests 3 5 relevance of target compound s when testing a large number of compounds these should ideally represent a broad range of physicochemical properties the focus can also be on one compound or a group of compounds that are known to be problematic to remove with other techniques than advanced water treatment techniques such as persistent mobile organic compounds pmocs reemtsma et al 2016 in case of compounds that degrade easily due to other processes than the treatment studied it should be verified that the compound is actually removed by the tested treatment technology this emphasizes the importance of controls ideally tested concentrations of the cecs should be representative for environmental levels but this can be difficult to achieve with compounds with a high loq 6 7 relevance of water matrix it is important to ensure that the selected water matrix corresponds with the purpose of the study especially wastewater has many properties that alter removal efficiencies compared to cleaner matrices luo et al 2014 as an example the often higher wastewater content of doc nom influences the efficiency of o3 or uv compared to surface water with generally lower doc nom content 8 9 relevance of treatment technology experimental conditions need to be appropriate for the purpose of the tests it should be considered how the tested conditions relate to full scale operational ranges e g dosing exposure time and whether they are realistic for example the maximum dosage of o3 is in many cases legally restricted because of the formation of bromate that is highly toxic von gunten 2003b 4 2 2 assessing the reliability of a water treatment study when assessing the reliability of a water treatment study for data evaluation we used the definition by roth and ciffroy 2016 the reliability of a study relates inter alia to the robustness and validity of the method used the completeness and detail of reporting the clarity and plausibility of the findings to ensure their reproducibility but also to the uncertainty of the knowledge base with regard to reliability we divide the criteria into the highlighted components from the above definition method reporting information reproducibility and uncertainty see table 3 4 2 2 1 explanation of the reliability criteria criteria numbers from table 3 method 1 2 is a guideline or modified guideline used for any part of the experiment is the test performed under glp conditions the international organization for standardization iso and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd are continuously producing guidelines to amongst others standardize various chemical tests iso 2017 oecd 2017 at the moment no guidelines for testing removal efficiencies for the selected treatment techniques are available nevertheless iso and oecd have provided guidelines on how to measure cecs and how to take water samples the american society for testing and materials astm published several standards related to water treatment technologies on their website amongst others standards on how to predict adsorption capacity of activated carbon ac and some standard procedures for membrane testing e g salt rejection astm 2014a b c these guidelines are relevant for certain studies on cec removal efficiency besides these guidelines it is also relevant to know if the experiments are performed under good laboratory practices glp conditions 3 are validity criteria fulfilled controls this to verify that only the tested treatment technology is removing the cecs from the water matrix and no other processes such as natural degradation or evaporation takes place reporting information to have all the information necessary to make a thorough evaluation of the limitations and exact conditions of the cec removal efficiency study the following information criteria 4 47 should be reported either in the study itself or in the supplementary information target compound 4 6 identification many of the below mentioned impact parameters can be found in databases and literature e g episuite chemspider oecd toolbox etc if the compound name and or cas number is known 7 molecular charge pka ac ozone nf ro membranes the pka of the compound combined with the ph of the water matrix can be used to determine the charge of the compound if this is not given in the study de ridder et al 2010 moreno castilla 2004 a charged molecule will be either attracted to or repelled by the charge of the ac surface de ridder et al 2011 de ridder et al 2010 kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2014 margot et al 2013 moreno castilla 2004 for the same reason the charge of a compound also has an influence on the nf ro rejection usually negatively charged cecs are better rejected than positively charged cecs bellona et al 2004 verliefde et al 2008 yoon et al 2007 also for treatment with ozone the charge is often relevant especially for nitrogen containing compounds as often only deprotonated compounds have enough electron density see also 10 functional groups reactivity to be attacked by ozone borowska et al 2016 8 log kow log dow ac nf ro membranes the hydrophobicity of a compound affects the efficiency of a treatment technique hu et al 1998 kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2005 the hydrophobicity is often expressed as the octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow or the ph corrected log dow de ridder et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 log dow values can be calculated on the basis of the reported ph of the water matrix the pka and the log kow so it is not essential to report for nf ro membranes more hydrophobic cecs can be adsorbed by the membrane and are initially well removed but removal may decrease later due to saturation of the membrane hu et al 2007 moons and van der bruggen 2006 verliefde et al 2007a 9 molecular weight size ac nf ro membranes large compounds tend to be less easily removed with ac de ridder et al 2011 mailler et al 2014 the size of a compound expressed in molecular weight is believed to be one of the main factors in rejection of cecs by nf ro membranes bellona et al 2004 yoon et al 2007 besides the molecular weight also the molecular size width length effective diameter and the molecular volume are used in studies as a measure of the size of the cec braeken et al 2005 comerton et al 2008 2009 jung et al 2005 kiso et al 2001 sadmani et al 2014 yangali quintanilla et al 2009 10 functional groups reactivity all relevant functional groups can be identified on the basis of the compound structure so in principle they do not have to be reported although it is helpful if the author includes information on this topic different functional groups are relevant for different techniques with regards to ac especially groups allowing h bonds or π π binding are relevant de ridder et al 2010 mailler et al 2014 for nf ro membranes functional groups of cecs may play a role in whether the compound is rejected or not this is however mostly related to the resulting size and or charge of the compound bellona et al 2004 košutić and kunst 2002 ozaki and li 2002 with regards to o3 and uv it is the reactivity of a compound that is important this is related to the electron density of the compound which can again be related to the functional groups functional groups with a high electron density will increase the reactivity of a compound von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for treatment with ozone a broad range of functional groups such as nitro groups amides primary amines thioethers and olefins are known to enhance the removal of cecs kovalova et al 2013 nakada et al 2007 snyder et al 2007a von gunten 2003a for uv or o3 treatment in combination with h2o2 an even broader scale of chemical structures will be attacked as oh radicals react more unspecific with a very wide variety of functional groups snyder et al 2007a 11 supplier and purity all supplier and purity of purchased target compounds should be reported as this cannot be retrieved elsewhere this is important with regards to both the analysis and the behaviour of the target compounds water matrix 12 type of water all it is essential to know which type of water was used and whether it has been artificially created or is of environmental origin this gives an indication of the relevance of the study in relation to full scale treatment and what issues to expect from the water matrix if the water matrix is artificially created details on the substituents and preparation procedure are to be reported in addition the origin of the composition may be given as this can be based on literature e g greywater benami et al 2016 pradhan et al 2019 and wastewater wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2004 13 ph all as previously discussed under 7 molecular charge pka the ph of the water matrix is relevant in most full scale treatments the ph lies between 7 and 9 kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2014 margot et al 2013 so it should be explicated if the study has been performed at a significantly different ph depending on the pka a cec might express higher or lower reaction rates with uv or ozone at a specific ph due to whether it will be present in a deprotonated or protonated state as mentioned in 7 molecular charge pka avisar et al 2010 borowska et al 2016 real et al 2009 furthermore at a high ph ozone decomposition to oh radicals increases and this likely will change the cec removal real et al 2009 the ph can also have an influence on the surface charge of both nf ro membranes and ac as well as impact fouling of the membrane bellona et al 2004 braghetta et al 1997 deshmukh and childress 2001 hagmeyer and gimbel 1998 14 nom concentration and composition all for all treatments the presence of nom can reduce the efficiency of the treatment in which both the concentration and composition are relevant parameters boehler et al 2012 de ridder et al 2011 loos et al 2013 mailler et al 2016 von gunten 2003a with regards to ac nom can reduce the removal efficiency of cecs by pore blocking or adsorption competition kilduff et al 1998 matsui et al 2002 newcombe and drikas 1997 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 the composition of nom has proven to be relevant for adsorption competition where protein like fluorophores seem to be the most problematic molecular components mailler et al 2016 in advanced oxidation treatment the oh radicals are scavenged by nom leading to lower removal efficiencies neamţu and frimmel 2006 pereira et al 2007 snyder et al 2007a von gunten 2003a yuan et al 2009 zwiener and frimmel 2000 in the case of uv treatment the presence of nom can increase the removal efficiency of the treatment as the presence of nom can initiate the production of oh radicals leech et al 2009 neamţu and frimmel 2006 pereira et al 2007 zhan et al 2006 on the other hand nom can also decrease the efficiency of uv treatment as it can adsorb the uv see 19 uv transmittance as with uv the effect of nom on nf ro membrane removal efficiency is ambiguous depending on the amount of nom the type of cecs and the type and thickness of the fouling layer and has been researched in many studies comerton et al 2009 nghiem and coleman 2008 nghiem et al 2010 nghiem and hawkes 2007 verliefde et al 2009a usually nom in wastewater is negatively charged assisting in repulsion of negatively charged cecs mailler et al 2014 even though the effect of nom present in the water matrix may not be clear it is important to mention the presence concentration and when relevant and possible the composition of the nom so the influence can be taken into consideration when evaluating the removal efficiency in the 49 studies evaluated in this paper nom is expressed as doc 18 studies toc 17 studies and or cod 13 studies to enable comparison across studies it is recommended to include at least doc only 4 studies mentions nom composition 2 pac studies one nf and one nf ro study 15 temperature all with regards to ac the temperature can an influence adsorption kinetics with a low temperature giving lower removal efficiency nam et al 2014 in removal with ozone temperature can influence ozone decay in a study by real et al 2009 the rate constants of removal with uv increased with increasing temperature however the difference in minimum and maximum temperature in the study was 30 c and this difference is unlikely to occur in full scale applications with regards to nf ro membranes a higher temperature will result is more viscous water which will easier transport diffuse through the membrane and therefore result in a higher flux which also influences the cec removal see also 34 35 transmembrane pressure and permeate flux crittenden and montgomery watson 2012 16 17 nitrite nitrate and bromide bromate ozone uv when applying ozone especially for wastewater the nitrite concentration is relevant since nitrite reacts quickly with ozone and reduces the available dose hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2013 for both uv and ozone the nitrate concentration especially for drinking water is also relevant as this can form nitrite and other by products which are highly toxic furthermore bromide can form the toxic compound bromate with ozone and consequently above certain bromide concentrations ozonation cannot be recommended lee et al 2013 von gunten 2003b von sonntag and von gunten 2012 18 turbidity nf ro membranes for nf ro membranes the turbidity can give an indication of the pre treatment needed and whether to expect fouling see 33 fouling kim et al 2002 19 uv transmittance uv the uv transmittance of the water matrix is relevant to be able to understand the ability of the uv radiation to reach the cecs the transmittance is an indication of how much of the uv radiation is adsorbed by dissolved matter in the water matrix and is related to the nom and nitrate content of the water matrix kruithof and martijn 2013 in general the higher the transmittance the higher the cec removal wols et al 2015 a low transmittance can be compensated for by using more energy to reach the same uv dose treatment process conditions the parameters listed below are all relevant to report as they are unique to the particular study and cannot be found elsewhere some of these parameters will change over time so it is important to report any development of these parameters over the course of the technology test 20 type of technology all the exact type of water treatment technology used should be reported 21 surface membrane area ac nf ro membranes the surface area has a significant influence on the removal efficiency of a specific ac and is thus important to report in general a smaller surface has a smaller removal efficiency mailler et al 2016 the surface area can be acquired from the producer if the commercial name is provided in the study for nf ro membranes the membrane area tested is important to understand the scale of the test rather than its influence on the removal capacity verliefde et al 2009b 22 pore volume and pore size distribution ac the pore volume and the pore size distribution is relevant in relation to the size of the cec and the competition of nom kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2016 moreno castilla 2004 nom can access mesopores and block these and the access of the cecs to underlying micropores moreno castilla 2004 23 25 bedvolume flow through and preloading gac the bedvolume and flow through of the gac column influences the removal efficiency of the gac treatment chowdhury 2013 bedvolume and flow through indicate the time the cecs have to adsorb to the ac see also 28 contact time in case the gac has been used before it will be preloaded with nom this should be reported as it can have a negative influence on the efficiency however preloaded gac columns might also exhibit biological degradation which will have a positive effect on the removal efficiency bourgin et al 2018 26 surface charge ac nf ro membranes the impact of the surface charge has been discussed under 7 molecular charge pka for nf ro membranes the surface charge is often quantified as zeta potential bellona et al 2004 nf ro membranes are mostly negatively charged at neutral ph and thus have a higher affinity for positively or neutral compounds bellona et al 2004 taheran et al 2016 27 concentration dosage intensity pac ozone uv for pac the dosage is the main controlling factor for the removal efficiency the higher the dose the higher the removal boehler et al 2012 mailler et al 2014 snyder et al 2007b also for ozone the dosage has a substantial positive influence on the removal efficiency margot et al 2013 snyder et al 2007a zwiener and frimmel 2000 often the ozone dosage is related to the doc concentration of the water matrix as a higher dose can compensate for the limiting effect of the doc concentration zwiener and frimmel 2000 especially for wastewater the ozone dosage is often given in relation to the doc concentration as g o3 g doc hollender et al 2009 kovalova et al 2013 also for uv in general the higher the dose the higher the removal efficiency however this is only valid for cecs that are already susceptible to degradation with uv light kovalova et al 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 wols et al 2013 in some of the studies evaluated the uv intensity is given in einstein s 1 which is not a si unit and cannot be compared to the more commonly used mj cm2 28 contact exposure or irradiation time ac ozone uv the contact time can have a great influence on the removal efficiency of ac mailler et al 2016 snyder et al 2007b however for compounds with very fast adsorption kinetics this impact factor will be less relevant mailler et al 2016 in uv studies the irradiation time is included in the calculation of the dose so it is less relevant to state however when using advanced oxidation the exposure time during which the oh radicals have time to form and react with the cecs is relevant 29 biological activity gac usually it is known if there is a possibility of biological activity in the gac experiments if this is the case it needs to be stated as the presence of microorganisms in the gac filter can enhance removal of biodegradable cecs bourgin et al 2018 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 rattier et al 2014 biological activity depends on the time the gac have been in use when using fresh gac or gac directly after regeneration there will be no biological activity in the beginning but it will develop and increase in time during use 30 technology application all the way the technology is applied is also relevant to report as for example the efficiency of ozone depends a lot on the mixing regime dodd et al 2008 zucker et al 2016 it can be difficult to describe an experimental set up so in this case the criterion is considered fulfilled if a schematic of the set up has been included 31 wavelenght uv the wavelength or the source of the uv light which type of lamp is relevant especially in the case of treatment without h2o2 yang et al 2014 as mentioned under 10 functional groups reactivity this can have influence on whether the cec will be able to absorb the radiation and thus degraded by photolysis chen et al 2007 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 yang et al 2014 furthermore a broader uv spectrum can lead to more unwanted by products hofman caris et al 2015 32 concentration of reagent h2o2 ozone uv the addition of h2o2 to ozone or uv treatment increases the production of oh radicals and thus the removal efficiency of the treatment ocampo pérez et al 2010 real et al 2009 ternes et al 2003 zwiener and frimmel 2000 an increase of the h2o2 dose can be used to compensate for nom scavenging zwiener and frimmel 2000 33 fouling nf ro membranes fouling and the type of fouling is important for the evaluation of the removal efficiency of the nf ro membrane organic fouling biofouling has been referred to under 14 nom concentration and composition fouling with nom can lead to higher removal of negatively charged cecs and lower removal of positively charged cecs pressure and flux is also influenced by fouling added resistance as it takes more pressure to force water through a fouled membrane while keeping the flux stable see also 34 35 transmembrane pressure and permeate flux taheran et al 2016 34 35 transmembrane pressure and permeate flux nf ro membranes the transmembrane pressure tmp is related to the permeate flux in a nf ro membrane the higher the transmembrane pressure the higher the flux when the resistance is constant plakas and karabelas 2012 increased pressure lead to higher removal of cecs plakas and karabelas 2012 the highest removal efficiency of pesticides was found with nf membranes operation with a high flux by chen et al 2004 and ahmad et al 2008 in the 49 evaluated papers tmp was not always given instead the working pressure the applied pressure or just pressure was given obstructing comparison across studies 36 cross flow velocity nf membranes during membrane filtration the phenomenon of concentration polarization occurs resulting in a higher concentration of solutes in front of the membrane surface resulting in a lower rejection of solutes compared to the bulk solution hajibabania et al 2011a ng and elimelech 2004 a higher cross flow velocity results in a lower concentration polarization and therefore a higher cec rejection crittenden and montgomery watson 2012 the cross flow velocity cleans the membrane the higher the velocity the more fouling resistance is removed crittenden and montgomery watson 2012 the influence of fouling on removal of cecs has been discussed under 33 fouling 37 backwashing gac backwashing can influence the cec removal of the gac it removes materials blocking the pores of the gac enhancing the removal efficiency on the other hand it can also disturb the build up of the bed and remove organic material degrading the cecs which will decrease the removal efficiency see also 29 biological activity and 14 nom concentration and composition it is therefore important to state if backwashing is done and how it has been done 38 recovery nf ro membranes the recovery of a nf ro membrane has an effect on the removal efficiency bellona et al 2004 several studies have found that removal efficiency of cecs decreases with increasing recovery chellam and taylor 2001 chen et al 2004 39 mwco and or salt rejection data nf ro membranes the rejection capacity of nf ro membranes can be characterized by the salt passage or rejection of standard salts for ro membranes typically monovalent salts such as nacl are used while for nf membranes bivalent salts such as mgso4 are used bellona et al 2004 kiso et al 1992 1996 2001 it is preferable that these characteristics are noted in the original study as there might be minor changes from batch to batch producers and production processes change the molecular weight cut off mwco is also used in nf ro referring to the lowest molecular weight solute in daltons in which 90 of the solute is retained by the membrane the mwco however can be difficult to obtain and is due to differences in protocols used by manufacturers not always comparable between nf ro membranes bellona et al 2004 cleveland et al 2002 experimental conditions all experimental conditions are essential to report as they are all unique to the specific treatment study and can influence the removal efficiency of the studied technique 40 scale of experiment as differences can be expected between lab pilot and full scale experiments it is important to know the scale of the study hofman caris et al 2017 verliefde et al 2009b lab scale refers to laboratory scale experiments proof of principle this can be either batch experiments batch volume 100 l or continuous flow experiments flow 100 l h pilot scale proof of practice refers to experiments on a larger scale often on site with a flow rate normally 10 m3 h these scales proceed full scale application proof of market 41 stand alone or part of a treatment train when the study is done on a treatment train it is important to know the impact parameters of the water matrix and the removal efficiency of the cecs at each step of the treatment train at least if the authors want to conclude anything on the individual treatment steps in all studies it is relevant to know whether the tested water has received any form of pre treatment in advance of the treatment technology investigated in order to have an understanding of what to expect in the tested water matrix see also 12 type of water the impact parameters of the water matrix should be measured after the pre treatment in case any post treatment is needed it can be relevant to mention this depending on the purpose of the study 42 cec already present or spiked depending on the purpose of the study spiking can be necessary to ensure that an accurate removal percentage can be calculated when spiking a factor 100 above the limit of quantification a removal percentage of 99 can be determined however very high spiking at environmentally unrealistic concentrations may have an effect on removal efficiencies and may alter the behaviour of the cec which is undesirable 43 single compound or mixture this gives an indication of the boundaries of the study as in reality the compounds will almost always be present in a mixture 44 45 initial and end concentration of cecs the initial concentration and the end concentration is particularly important in case no explanation is given on how removal efficiency percentage have been calculated 46 sample collection it is relevant to report how the samples have been collected e g grab sampling or continuously sampling also the number of samples and over what time period is important to mention in order to get an understanding of the representativeness of the samples 47 analytical method cecs here it is essential to describe the analytical methods used and the treatment of the samples furthermore it is important to give the limit of detection for each cec specifically and if possible the recoveries too this information is very relevant as it gives a detailed understanding of what the removal efficiencies are based on this can all be added in supplementary information reproducibility and uncertainties to ensure the clarity and plausibility of the experimental findings the following information criteria 48 51 should be available to assess the reproducibility and uncertainties of the study 48 calculation of removal efficiency it should be clear how the removal efficiencies are calculated and how values loq lod are treated as these choices highly impact the results helsel 2005 weltje and sumpter 2017 when spiking the cecs this problem can be avoided by spiking a high enough concentration when not spiking when not spiking a percentage using the loq lod as end concentration is preferred to stating a 100 removal as this in cases with a low initial concentration and a high loq lod can be very misleading it is also important to note the number of replicates and how they are used in the determination of the removal efficiencies 49 statistical methods have appropriate statistical techniques been employed to evaluate variability and uncertainty if any statistics are used to analyse the experimental findings this should be mentioned including which methods and why 50 significance when significance of the experimental findings is presented it should be noted how this is determined and at what p value a result is deemed significant 51 uncertainties data a description of the produced amount of data and to what degree it is sufficient to support the conclusions of the study is very helpful to evaluate the reliability of the results to what extent do the uncertainty and variability of the different measurements impact the conclusions that can be inferred from the data and the utility of the study what is the standard deviation of the results 5 application of the criteria the current status of reporting is discussed based on the review of 244 selected papers supplementary information 1 and the benefits of a standardised framework are elaborated based on the findings because of the broad selection of techniques and resulting large amount of data the evaluation of the cec removal itself will be presented in a follow up study 5 1 relevance criteria table 4 details the results of the application of the relevance criteria described in chapter 4 2 1 on 244 peer reviewed scientific articles on the removal of cecs with one of the selected water treatment techniques it is important to realise that the failure to fulfil one of the relevance criteria does not necessarily mean that the paper is of poor quality but merely that the paper does not comply with the specified relevance criteria and cannot be used for our purpose i e decision making by stakeholders comparing removal efficiencies between various water treatment techniques it is however remarkable that so few of the evaluated papers are suitable for a comparison across techniques compounds and water matrixes in general the first three criteria are the ones most frequently not fulfilled the papers were either outside the scope we were interested in did not include removal percentages at all or did not report removal percentages in a way that could be used for our purpose overall only 20 of the papers evaluated were in compliance with the relevance criteria and could be used for our purpose 5 2 reliability criteria the application of the relevance criteria left 49 studies on which the reliability criteria could be applied table 5 details the results of the application of the 51 reliability criteria to the water treatment technology papers from table 5 it is clear that some criteria in bold such as compound name technology combinations wavelength scale of experiment whether it is a stand alone whether the compound is spiked or not and the pressure for nf ro membranes are always reported for compound name technology combinations and scale of the experiment this is logical as this is also included in the relevance criteria and the studies have been selected based on this information several criteria are almost always reported criteria 9 12 13 14 21 27 30 32 36 39 43 44 and 47 however for some of these parameters such as nom content and dosage of o3 and uv what is reported is not consistent nom was found to be reported in doc toc and or cod and o3 as mg l or mg o3 g doc which cannot easily be compared if doc is not given the criteria for the target compound properties criteria 4 10 are poorly reported varying from not at all to 50 of the studies except for molecular weight which is reported in 21 of 24 studies in general these criteria are not essential to report as they can be found elsewhere however they facilitate the interpretation of the results in the studies themselves the supplier of the cecs tested criterion 11 is in general reported however the purity of the compound also criterion 11 only in approximately 60 of the studies the criteria concerning the water matrix criteria 12 19 except water type ph and nom concentration and composition are also not well reported with the most reported in 50 of the studies and the least in 25 this is essential information specific for the study and cannot be found elsewhere for the treatment process conditions criteria 20 39 not yet mentioned reporting is also not complete in general they are reported in less than 40 of the studies this information is also specific for the study and cannot be found elsewhere with regards to the experimental conditions criteria 42 48 sample collection and concentration after treatment are rarely reported especially the lack of end concentration makes it very difficult to understand and reproduce the calculation of removal efficiencies understanding removal efficiencies is even more difficult as lod loq and recoveries for the analytical methods are not always reported criterion 47 especially when the method used to calculate the efficiencies the number of replicas the standard deviation and how values below the lod loq are dealt with are reported in as little as 15 47 of the studies this makes it almost impossible to validate the findings of the studies there is also virtually no reporting on whether statistics have been used in the studies criterion 49 and how this together with details on sample collection criterion 46 are the most underreported areas found in the studies no papers fulfilled all the criteria the gac papers fulfil 36 50 of the criteria pac 41 73 ozone h2o2 38 74 uv h2o2 33 64 nf ro 39 71 this does not mean that the papers cannot be used but that not all the information needed for our evaluation is available this will make the assessment of the efficiency of the technique less straightforward as impact parameters that can influence the removal efficiency are not reported and or removal efficiencies have not been described 6 conclusions and recommendations our literature survey revealed that there is currently no uniform approach to study the cec removal efficiency of advanced water treatment technologies removal is tested at various scales with different water matrices and numerous cecs there are large variations in the process conditions of the treatment in the experimental set ups and in the way results are expressed and reported these variations hinder the interpretation and evaluation of the removal efficiency data this in turn makes it difficult for stakeholders to make an informed decision with regards to which treatment technology will be relevant for their specific needs therefore in this study a framework for evaluation of scientific and technical information that describes what is important when evaluating removal efficiency studies was developed for this framework two criteria sets were developed 9 relevance criteria and 51 reliability criteria these two criteria sets offer a thorough unbiased and standardised method to select studies to evaluate and compare the cec removal efficiency of advanced water treatment technologies in a scientifically sound way the relevance criteria have been applied to 244 treatment technology studies and 49 of these papers fulfilled the criteria with non compliance with the criteria outside scope and appropriate data being the main reason for the papers being discarded especially the lack of removal percentage and data reported in a way that it cannot be used affect the potential of these studies to provide additional information and be suitable for a comparison across techniques compounds and water matrixes the reliability criteria were applied to the 49 remaining papers the main finding here was a severe lack of information on how removal percentages had been calculated in terms of how lod loqs had been dealt with how many replicas had been used what statistics had been applied and what the standard deviation was this hinders the interpretation of the reported result furthermore many papers did not report on all the identified impact parameters which makes comparison across studies difficult these findings clearly demonstrates the need for a more uniform approach when the developed framework is used as a guideline by scientists to document their studies it will facilitate the comparison of different treatment technologies regarding the removal of cecs this in turn will enhance the interpretation of the findings of the studies and consequently benefit the selection of appropriate technologies by

18671,due to the importance of analyzing the efficiency of water utilities and the large number of publications in this area at least five reviews have already been carried out to identify patterns and trends these reviews aimed to cover worldwide studies and the results may not correspond to the reality in developing countries therefore this review provides a literature update on the quantitative studies of water and sanitation services focusing on studies carried out in developing countries this overview mainly examines the economies of scale and scope public versus private ownership and the impact of regulation as expected our results show patterns that differ from those found in worldwide reviews e g the influence of regulatory incentives on operator efficiency and economies of scope in addition this paper presents patterns regarding the quantitative methods adopted as well as some trends and areas for possible future research keywords water and sanitation utilities efficiency benchmarking quantitative techniques 1 introduction the performance of the operators of water supply and sanitation services wss has been the focus of much research given the international interest in the economy of public resources and the development of competition simulations yardstick competition due to the monopolistic nature of the sector indeed over time an increasing number of studies have acknowledged the importance of performance and its economic impact on wss aspects related to performance evaluation efficiency productivity and its determinants benchmarking incentives and market structure have gained relevance in the research in this sector following the growing scientific literature on the performance of wss operators at least five bibliographic reviews have discussed how the international scientific community is making progress from theoretical and practical points of view berg and marques 2011 conducted a comprehensive review until the end of 2008 based on 190 studies these authors found strong evidence of a positive influence of regulatory incentives on the efficiency of operators but mixed results have been found in the analysis of privatization and economies of scale scope and density abbott and cohen 2009 also presented a comprehensive review based on more than 75 studies through early 2009 they concluded that there are economies of scale and of scope in the sector water and sanitation especially for small utilities however the results for privatization were ambiguous walter et al 2009 focused their review on water distribution in the period between 1998 and 2008 they concluded that the influence of privatization on operator performance was not clear but that institutional designs tend to be a dominant factor in efficiency they also found an omnipresence of economy of density and evidence of economies of scope a review on market structure analysis was conducted by carvalho et al 2012 in which a meta regression applied to more than 60 articles indicated a higher probability of finding diseconomies of scale and scope in large operators and in those under public management worthington 2014 focusing on frontier analysis reviewed 27 studies between 1990 and 2014 and found patterns on the impact of privatization and regulation on efficiency they analyzed patterns of economies of scale scope and density despite the five reviews two comprehensive and three more focused in studies that included all countries the trends and patterns found do not seem to represent the reality in the developing countries 1 1 we used the classification of the international monetary fund first this is because the number of studies conducted in developed countries is much higher influencing the patterns found second the developing countries present specific features such as the need for universality of service along with issues of equity continuity and water quality in addition the high levels of water losses found can skew the analysis of performance and the low availability of data which may limit the evaluation methodologies therefore in this article we provide a review of the literature for developing countries on the efficiency of wss and the application of econometric and linear programming models in addition we have compiled the most important conclusions in relation to the market structure operating environment privatization and incentives these results can be particularly useful for decision makers public services managers and other stakeholders after this brief introduction the article is organized as follows section 2 presents the characteristics of the research focusing on the publishing area countries data availability and the authors of these studies section 3 explores the quantitative techniques used in performance evaluations with details about the most often used basic qualitative and explanatory variables section 4 presents the main conclusions about the market structure property operational environment incentives and benchmarking section 5 lists important implications learned from the review and suggests an outlook of research needs 2 research characteristics overview a comprehensive review through may 2019 of the literature was conducted including studies that use quantitative methods to evaluate the performance of wss operators in developing countries the review was based on research published in international journals since this is a more accessible type of publication and is submitted to impartial review we searched for literature in the scopus science direct and google scholar databases using the following boolean search string dea or data envelopment analysis or sfa or stochastic frontiers analysis or sbm or slack based measure or tfp total factor productivity or ddf or directional distance function or luenberger or malmquist or ols or ordinary least squares or fdh or full disposal hull or order m or order α and water utilities or water industry or water sector or water supply or wss we also included relevant papers encountered when screening or reviewing other studies the studies were selected following the rules inclusion of studies carried out in developing countries inclusion of research published in international journals exclusion of studies which do not include quantitative results exclusion of studies in other languages than english exclusion of duplicates forty six articles were selected among the identified pieces of literature most of which were published in the last 20 years therefore this type of study in developing countries is quite recent and its increase is mainly due to the availability of data and interest in the recent privatization and regulation processes in the sector some interesting patterns were found when analyzing the authorship publishing area countries studied and data sources chronological analysis the first study found for a developing country was akosa et al 1995 who used the data envelopment analysis dea to rank 10 sanitation projects in ghana this was the only article found up to the year 2000 there was a lag in publications when compared to those in developed countries in their review berg and marques 2011 found 69 publications through 2000 with the first being the article of ford and watford in 1969 the delay in publications occurred because of a shortage of sufficient data to carry out performance analyses walter et al 2009 only 7 years after the first publication two other articles were published on this topic but the most typical objectives were the performance evaluation of operators one focused on analyzing the efficiency of regulation in mexico anwandter and ozuna 2002 and another focused on checking the influence of privatization on the performance of asian and oceania operators estache and rossi 2002 in the 2000s a total of 19 articles were published the main focus was comparing the efficiency of public and private companies accompanying the privatization process that took place in developing countries some examples are the process that took place in argentina in which at the end of the 1990s 70 of the urban population was served by private providers estache and trujillo 2003 the phenomenon that began in chile in 1998 and culminated in 2014 with 95 7 of consumers being served by private providers molinos senante et al 2016 and the process that increased in africa from the mid 1990s until the end of the decade driven by international funding agencies such as the world bank kirkpatrick et al 2006 accordingly studies were conducted in brazil argentina and malaysia e g estache and trujillo 2003 sabbioni 2008 munisamy 2009 and others in multiple countries kirkpatrick et al 2006 estache and rossi 2002 at that time it was also possible to observe the appearance of benchmarking studies that were mostly linked to the implementation of regulation processes e g corton 2003 berg and lin 2008 the only article dedicated solely to checking economies of scale scope and density was conducted then nauges and van den berg 2008 from 2010 to the present 26 additional articles were published the themes of privatization and regulation are still prevalent due to the processes that occurred in those countries although studies with other scopes also appear some of them examine exogenous variables that influence the efficiency of the operators e g ferro et al 2011 see 2015 and others include the variables of quality and efficiency in their analyses by comparing their results with traditional modeling e g lin and berg 2008 mbuvi et al 2012 fig 1 summarizes the number of publications per year area of publication the items found were categorized into 4 areas a business and administration b economics econometrics and finance c engineering and d environmental sciences 2 2 the area of science and water technology according to the scimago categorization fig 2 shows the distribution of 46 articles found in these four categories the publications are concentrated in the area of business and administration because many journals include that kind of study however a tendency toward change has been observed for the past 10 years publications in the areas of administration and economy have jointly fallen 50 while publications in the environmental sciences have tripled this can be mainly attributed to the tendency of studies to focus on equity and accessibility issues rather than on economic performance table 1 shows the number of publications by journal forty six papers were published in 24 different journals the journal utilities policy published 39 1 of all studies only five other journals had more than one publication water policy with three publications and environmental science policy the journal of infrastructure systems the journal of cleaner production and the world bank economic review each with two publications of the 24 scientific periodicals 89 5 are indexed in the scopus database and 87 are in the thompson database authors performance studies of wss operators require knowledge of the quantitative tools used of the institutional and managerial issues of the operators of the real significance and limitations of the available data and of the possible interpretations made from the results therefore it was expected that several authors participated in the studies however 71 of the publications had a maximum of two authors as shown in fig 3 a total of 46 articles were produced by 77 authors 77 9 of whom participated in only one article these figures show that the authors study the performance of operators in developing countries but do not go beyond that this can be mainly attributed to the non availability of reliable data to perform such analysis only 9 1 of the authors had three or more publications molinos senante with five publications sala garrido with four publications and berg ferro lin moreira and mugisha each with three publications this finding could also be attributed to the fact that most of the studies were conducted by researchers who were not from the countries they studied of the 46 articles 54 4 had at least one author from a developed country while nearly 29 were exclusively authors from developed countries of the 77 authors 41 6 were from academic institutions in developed countries 44 2 were from academic institutions in developing countries 11 7 were from governmental institutions and only 2 6 were from institutions linked to local water services countries studied a total of 74 developing countries were covered by the wss performance studies however fig 4 shows that nine articles analyzed more than one country cross country it is important to note that the main purpose of these articles was not to compare efficiency between countries but it was a way to address the lack of data dmu that prevented the models from being run in only one country 3 3 these cross comparison countries generate problems between operators in different operational environments walter et al 2009 but are used to avoid the problems of degrees of freedom for example the dea method requires that the number of dmus is greater than or equal to a m a x n d e i n p u t s n d e o u t p u t s 3 n d e i n p u t s n d e o u t p u t s banker et al 1989 of the countries studied 79 7 were exclusively covered in the nine cross country studies the studies that covered only one specific country 37 articles were for 15 countries the cross country studies exclusively covered 100 of the countries from oceania 88 9 from africa 75 from asia and 64 7 from america this shows the absence of data for individual analyses in the countries of these continents the countries that had more studies were brazil 9 individual and 2 cross country chile 6 individual and 1 cross country india and peru 4 individual and 1 cross country malaysia 3 individual and 2 cross country uganda 2 individual and 2 cross country ghana 1 individual and 3 cross country and zambia 4 cross country apart from zambia where all the analyses were carried out in conjunction with other countries all other countries presented systematic data provision as shown in the next section of all the articles 53 2 were conducted on the american continent 29 8 in asia 14 9 in africa and 2 1 in oceania two of the articles were based on intercontinental data nauges and van den berg 2008 compared the structure of the market scale scope and density in brazil moldova romania and vietnam and estache and rossi 2002 analyzed the efficiency of public and private companies in 31 countries in asia and oceania data source most developing countries do not provide periodic operational economic or financial and quality of service information about wss this is the main reason for the small number of quantitative studies in these countries however the 15 countries that were covered by individual studies showed sufficient data for these studies this was the case in the 11 studies conducted in brazil that collected data from the national sanitation information system snis the snis was created in 1996 as an integral part of the national sanitation policy as this was a periodic database and was relatively old it allowed the authors to carry out various quantitative performance analysis techniques including hypothesis testing that involved the evolution of efficiency in time of the eleven articles ten used panel data such as carvalho and sampaio 2015 who analyzed the efficiency of regulation and carvalho et al 2015 who checked for efficiency differences in clusters other countries presented similar databases and for this reason there are individual studies for them this was the case for information systems that we could find in a argentina managed by the national agency for water and sanitation works enohsa estache and trujillo 2003 b iran administered by the national company of water and wastewater engineering nwwec nourali et al 2014 c mexico managed by the national water commission anc anwandter and ozuna 2002 d palestine whose data were provided by the palestinian authority of water pwa alsharif et al 2008 e malaysia which has provided data relative to sanitation since 1994 through the malaysian water association mwa kamarudin et al 2016 f india which does not have a specific water and sanitation utilities performance information system but has a ministry of urban development moud that publishes performance reports of its operators vishwakarma and kulshrestha 2010 and g china which also does not have a specific information system but the national bureau of statistics nbs of china provides an annual survey from industrial firms li 2018 another form of data availability was the data published by regulatory authorities this is the case of peru whose data have been available since 1999 through the national superintendence of sanitation services sunass corton 2003 berg and lin 2008 and of chile whose data are available through the superintendence of sanitary services siss molinos senante et al 2016 ferro and mercadier 2016 we found another method that consisted of obtaining data from a single operator that operates in several cities in this way articles have compared the efficiency between units of an operator but not between operators this was found for studies in uganda in which the data were extracted from the regulation audit reports of the national water and sewerage corporation nwsc which operates in the 22 major cities of uganda including kampala mugisha 2007 2008 and 2014 mellah and amor 2016 used the data from a report from the tunisia water utility twu which is a state owned monopoly holder of water services in the country this was also the strategy used for the study in sri lanka in which dharmaratna and parasnis 2012 collected the data from a public utility with monopoly over water supply national water supply and drainage board nwsdb in addition we found a study in venezuela in which the data were provided by the utilities with the help of the compañía anónima hidrológicas de venezuela hidroven higuerey et al 2017 for studies involving more than one country data sources can come from international partnerships this was the case in africa in which the partnership between water operators wup provided a report on performance indicators through spbnet mbuvi et al 2012 kirkpatrick et al 2006 the same occurred in southeast asia in which the data could be collected from reports provided by the water services network of southeast asia seawun see 2015 and in south america where information could be consulted from the latin association of water regulators aderasa ferro et al 2011 corton and berg 2009 another data source in the studies between countries was the surveys conducted by development agencies in asia the asian development bank adb conducted research with 50 water services companies estache and rossi 2002 in africa the world bank in partnership with the african development bank adb and other institutions provided a diagnosis of the existing infrastructure in sub saharan africa in which information about water operators was included buafua 2015 although the ibnet international benchmarking network for water and sanitation utilities is the world largest database for water and sanitation utilities performance information only two studies used this database nauges and van den berg 2008 and corton and berg 2009 note that corton and berg verified the ibnet data contacting the utilities and they also used other data source aderasa database evaluating the performance of the sector and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of current regulatory and managerial arrangements without financial and operational statistics is an arduous if not impossible task this kind of observation implies the need for a permanent regulatory effort related to the collection and verification of data and the investment of operators in robust information systems berg and phillips 2017 note that developing countries lack such systems of information but their implementation is critical for monitoring performance and reaching related goals 3 quantitative techniques used the quantitative studies in the sector are usually categorized as parametric and nonparametric the main difference between them is that the parametric studies need to define a priori a function for production technology whereas the nonparametric studies do not have this requirement in studies on the efficiency of water operators in developing countries there is a dominance of nonparametric methods 54 4 over parametric methods 39 1 only 6 5 of studies used both methods almost all of the parametric studies used stochastic frontiers sfa in their analysis only the article by sabbioni 2008 used a variation of the least squares regression the least square dummy variables lsdv stochastic frontiers can be divided on the basis of cost production function and distance function of the sixteen sfa studies ten used cost functions and the most commonly used distributions were cobb douglas 44 4 translog 33 3 half normal 11 1 exponential 11 1 and natural logarithmic 11 1 the studies that used production functions 31 3 primarily adopted the translog distribution one article used it along with the cobb douglas distribution and another only used the cobb douglas distribution all the studies adopting the distance function 44 were based on inputs and used the translog distribution except for two that used log linear and cobb douglas distribution data envelopment analysis dea was the most commonly used nonparametric methodology 68 there are two approaches to dea one that compares only operators at the same level of scale variable returns to scale vrs and another that assumes that all operators operate at an optimum level constant returns to scale crs only three studies exclusively used the crs approach nine used the vrs approach and eight used both of them usually to deduce the scale efficiency dea can also be categorized into two more approaches the first input oriented aims to optimize efficiency by securing the outputs and inputs contracting the inputs in the second output oriented approach the optimization is performed by setting the vector of inputs and expanding the outputs a portion of the articles that used dea 23 8 also used the malmquist productivity index which captures changes in productivity between two periods the study of lin and berg 2008 in addition to the traditional dea used a nonradial approach in which a nonproportional reduction of inputs or a nonproportional increase of outputs is possible only seven works exclusively used other nonparametric methods estache and trujillo 2003 and li 2018 used the total production factor tfp molinos senante and sala garrido 2015 see and ma 2018 and sala garrido et al 2019 used a generalization of the malmquist productivity index luenberger productivity indicator to compute changes in productivity kamarudin et al 2016 and sala garrido et al 2019 applied a directional distance function ddf for simultaneously contracting inputs and expanding outputs and thus considering undesirable outputs and barbosa et al 2016 used a model based on dynamic slacks dsbm able to estimate production through time no studies were carried out using partial frontiers order m and order α or conditional frontiers in the nonparametric methods because they are deterministic it is not possible to distinguish the random variations of inefficiency in relation to the frontier in this way exogenous factors are accounted for as inefficiencies to overcome this limitation some studies used a second stage after obtaining efficiency scores mainly to return the dea efficiency measures against a number of explanatory variables tobit regression was used in four studies as was the bootstrap technique or double bootstrap nonparametric statistical tests were used in two studies and generalized estimating equations gee and lsdv were used in only one study no studies were found to use least squares regression ols or maximum likelihood estimation mle variables used the choice of inputs and outputs to be used in quantitative methods for analyzing the efficiency of operators is very relevant however it is also rather complicated due to the complexity of the water industry and in developing countries the availability of data table 2 shows the frequency of inputs and outputs used the input labor is usually measured in terms of wages total expenditure with employees or number of employees the extension of the water network is used as a proxy for capital expenditure of the operators which is very difficult to achieve in developing countries total revenue is usually measured as the total water volume accounted for lin 2005 and singh et al 2010 argue that operators with good cost efficiency do not necessarily feature good quality of services therefore it is desirable to incorporate quality variables into performance analysis picazo tadeo et al 2008 romano et al 2017 molinos senante et al 2015 state that the inclusion of these variables can encourage operators to improve customer services and aid regulators in developing incentives however lin and berg 2008 argue that most studies conducted in developing countries do not consider qualitative variables due to methodological limitations and data availability in fact in our review only 37 of the studies included quality variables in their analyses with the most frequent variables being water losses chlorination continuity of supply and service coverage most authors 50 modeled these variables as outputs the other works modeled them as inputs 25 or undesirable outputs 25 regarding the qualitative variable water losses the main strategy adopted was to use it as an input however two other strategies were found in our review which were to model it as undesirable output or to consider the total amount of water produced as an input and the amount of water delivered as an output explanatory variables refer to contextual issues affecting efficiency but are outside the scope of action of the operators and ignoring them in the analyses could lead to biased results berg and marques 2011 found more than 20 explanatory variables in their study while in this study more than 25 were found the most frequent were the scope of operation local or regional independent adjustment private participation type of economic regulatory mechanisms price cap revenue cap and rate of return density of connections water losses and water sources others were examined in only a few studies 4 4 other explanatory variables include the ratio of metered connections continuity of supply water storage capacity by the operator temperature of the region financial incentives tariff value peak factor complaints operator size ratio of water volume intended for tourism treated wastewater volume scope of the operator water or wastewater regions number of residential connections and gross domestic product per capita 4 issues addressed by the studies categorization according to the main issues addressed by the studies the results were categorized into 1 market structure economies of scale scope and density 2 private participation 3 regulatory incentives 4 benchmarking and 5 exogenous factors that influence performance market structure we found 25 works that studied the economies of scale scope and density however only nauges and van den berg 2008 focused on the market structure in developed countries it is more common to find diseconomies of scale in large operators and in operators under public management carvalho et al 2012 however only economies of scale were identified in developing countries in brazil barbosa et al 2016 carvalho et al 2015 sabbioni 2008 and seroa da motta and moreira 2006 identified economies of scale and nauges and van den berg 2008 identified positive but not significant effects carvalho et al 2015 analyzed approximately 4900 dmus between 2001 and 2011 and estimated the optimal volume of the water supply to be 600 000 m³ year economies of scale have also been found in india gupta et al 2012 kumar and managi 2010 singh et al 2010 mexico anwandter and ozuna 2002 malaysia munisamy 2009 vietnam nauges and van den berg 2008 tunisia mellah and amor 2016 iran nourali et al 2014 sri lanka dharmaratna and parasnis 2012 and six central american countries corton and berg 2009 in chile the results were not significant molinos senante et al 2015 although positive and negative economies of scale were found for full private and concessionary water utilities respectively molinos senante et al 2018 although in the water supply and wastewater sectors economies of density can be measured in terms of customers networks and production walter et al 2009 in developing countries they were analyzed only with regard to network concentration fifteen studies performed this analysis and in eight it was concluded that network density increased the efficiency of operators since it reduced costs e g souza et al 2008 the other seven works found similar results but they were not statistically significant e g tupper and resende 2004 concerning the economies of scope different approaches may also exist for example integrating the water sector with the provision of electricity and gas few studies have examined economies of scope 10 in developing countries and all of them addressed the vertical integration between water services and sanitation in brazil carvalho et al 2015 and barbosa et al 2016 found economies of scope nauges and van den berg 2008 did not find significant results and ferro et al 2014 found diseconomies of scope in vietnam a study identified economies of scope nauges and van den berg 2008 private participation the most frequently adopted objective was to identify the impact of public and private management on operator efficiency although there are theories that suggest increased efficiency by private operators research shows mixed results in various sectors berg and marques 2011 eighteen studies focused on this theme eight of them concluded that private operators were more efficient than public operators eight did not find significant differences and only two identified public operators as being more efficient even within the same country the results were diverse in brazil three studies concluded that private operators were more efficient three found no evidence and one concluded that public operators were more efficient although these differences can be explained by differences in the method or database used there was also evidence that the private sector ensured greater flexibility and productivity of labor sharma et al 2007 souza et al 2007 however capital expenditure was higher in the private sector than in public operators only four works that focused on comparing the efficiency between public and private operators used quality variables in all the private operators were more efficient than the public ones although the studies are few there is evidence that private operators were more efficient when factors such as water losses buafua 2015 water treatment carvalho et al 2015 sanitation ferro et al 2014 and quality of service munisamy 2009 were included in the analysis models benchmarking the second most representative objective of the studies considered in this review was to use quantitative techniques to measure the operators performance in the sample considered and identify best practices this review found 16 studies that had benchmarking as one of their main objectives most of them compared operators within a country but there were also studies that compared regions or countries alsharif et al 2008 corton and berg 2009 some studies focused on the impact of quality of service variables on performance evaluation kumar and managi 2010 lin 2005 lin and berg 2008 mbuvi et al 2012 the study of singh et al 2010 focused on incorporating sustainability parameters in benchmarking structures according to berg and marques 2011 the relevance of the rankings generated in these studies should be investigated in future research this topic is even more relevant in developing countries since issues such as loss of water and universalization of service are not included in models focused on minimizing costs corrected ordinary least squares classic sfa or dea with single outputs 5 5 berg and lin 2008 ranked the operators from peru using dea and sfa to compare them with rankings generated by local regulatory sunass they concluded that if it is necessary to include quality variables the dea or sfa methods based on the distance function are most suitable therefore if the objective is to use these rankings to devise incentives for the operators the use of traditional models may not enable the attainment of objectives such as universalization equity loss control and service quality however this review showed that these issues were seldom included in benchmarking studies only seven studied water losses six studied service coverage and four studied the number of hours of water supply these issues should be considered in models to prevent the use of benchmarking ranks based only on volumes and financial costs for example in countries such as brazil it could be cheaper to produce more water than to control losses sabbioni 2008 exogenous factors thirteen of the 46 articles studied the factors that influence the efficiency of operators as a main objective the main results of these studies are briefly described below in brazil carvalho et al 2015 found that local operators were more efficient than regional operators however the other three papers concluded the opposite seroa da motta and moreira 2006 sabbioni 2008 ferro et al 2014 in addition negative relationships were found between productivity and tariffs seroa da motta and moreira 2006 and between performance and gdp barbosa et al 2016 ferro et al 2011 analyzing 16 latin america and central countries found a negative relationship between the number of metered customers and operator performance gupta et al 2012 concluded that in india less populated cities showed relatively better performance mbuvi et al 2012 studying 11 african countries found a positive gdp influence on operator efficiency in uganda the positive impacts of financial incentives mugisha 2007 2014 managerial improvements mugisha 2008 and coverage improvements mugisha 2014 were found however targets for water loss reduction had a negative influence on performance mugisha 2014 in chile molinos senante and sala garrido 2015 concluded that exogenous variables the number of customers and size did not affect the efficiency of operators but molinos senante et al 2015 found a positive influence of peak water demand and a negative influence of water losses among 7 countries in southeast asia see 2015 concluded that environmental variables meteorological factors and gdp do not affect the efficiency of the operators regulatory incentive there was also a small group of six studies whose main objective was to analyze the impact of incentives on the water operators in theory one of the regulation objectives is to use benchmarking techniques to compare operators and to generate incentives for efficiency improvement benchmarking is used as a simulation of market forces to supplant potential abuses of the natural monopoly of the sector berg and marques 2011 operators that are not subject to regulatory systems tend to negotiate their tariffs with the government in those systems there is no generation of incentives for performance improvement conversely in regulatory regimes the most common incentives were the price cap the revenue cap and the rate of return only the work of barbosa et al 2016 studied the impact of different regulatory regimes on efficiency in their study in brazil they found that operators under the price cap and revenue cap were associated with lower efficiency than those under the rate of return or those that were not regulated the authors attributed this result to the possibility of negligent action and the political use of regulatory agencies ferro and mercadier 2016 exploring a possible path to recognize the associated increased costs with water loss control found that the regulators can induce providers to invest more through a k factor the other four studies compared the performance of operators under a regulatory regime they adopted two approaches a timeline in which efficiencies were compared before and after the implementation of regulatory systems and another in the form of clusters in which a regulated cluster was compared with an unregulated cluster buafua 2015 analyzing the regulatory system in 16 sub saharan african countries found that regulation via performance contracts led to greater efficiency than the controls carried out by independent regulators carvalho et al 2015 and carvalho and sampaio 2015 showed that brazilian operators were more efficient before the regulatory system had been implemented in méxico anwandter and ozuna 2002 also found that regulation did not bring efficiency improvements for operators thus surprisingly no articles showed that performance improved because of regulatory incentives wren lewis 2014 argued that in africa this was due to institutional weaknesses and that the models imported from developed countries did not have any effect 5 conclusions lessons learned we provide a critical review across the literature for developing countries on the efficiency of wss and the application of econometric and linear programming models the important implications of our work are there was a tendency of private operators to exhibit better performance in developing countries especially when qualitative variables were accounted for in the evaluations performed regarding market structure economies of scale have been found in brazil india mexico malaysia vietnam tunisia iran and six central american countries in other countries this question was not analyzed or the results were not statistically significant all the works that examined economies of density found positive results but only slightly more than 50 were significant concerning economies of scope wss studies were conducted only in brazil with diverging results and in vietnam where economies of scope were found the regulatory incentives have not promoted performance improvement of water utilities in developing countries some of the results of our review show patterns that differ from those found in the literature covering developed and developing countries simultaneously e g a positive influence of regulatory incentives in the efficiency of operators and the existence of economies of scope future research directions based on the outcomes of this review the following research directions have been identified to help the research community and the professionals working on the performance evaluation of water utilities more than 70 of the nonparametric studies used the input oriented approach keeping in mind the studies conducted in developed countries in which operators provide drinking water to and collect wastewater from all domestic customers and cannot encourage consumption however for developing countries the need for universalization is a reality future studies should consider using a service maximization approach in terms of number of connections or clients service coverage or other the use of distance functions on sfa is a way to go beyond the inconvenience of sfa by not admitting multiple inputs and outputs simultaneously it is desirable to incorporate quality variables into performance analysis carried out on developing countries regarding the qualitative variable water losses there are advantages in modeling water losses as an undesirable output and this should be a strategy in future research traditional benchmarking studies may not enable the attainment of objectives such as universalization equity loss control and service quality therefore future research should focus on studying models that capture these issues although the implementation information systems is critical for monitoring performance and reaching related goals the use of panel data and more robust methods e g partial frontiers methods are interesting strategies to deal with data unavailability and data quality issues e g curse of dimensionality extreme data and outliers there is a disbelief that such quantitative studies can lead to improvements in the performance of water companies in developing countries because the institutional weaknesses e g limited regulatory capacity and limited fiscal efficiency are the main issue of regulatory failure accordingly addressing the related problems is more important than solving the concerns that are normally stressed in the regulation of utilities in developed countries e g performance therefore would be interesting that future publications in this field discuss this subject some topics that should be addressed in future research are linked to the universalization and equity of access and water losses thus future studies should incorporate qualitative variables that capture these issues use appropriate models e g dea directed toward outputs and compare the results with traditional approaches of cost minimization

18671,due to the importance of analyzing the efficiency of water utilities and the large number of publications in this area at least five reviews have already been carried out to identify patterns and trends these reviews aimed to cover worldwide studies and the results may not correspond to the reality in developing countries therefore this review provides a literature update on the quantitative studies of water and sanitation services focusing on studies carried out in developing countries this overview mainly examines the economies of scale and scope public versus private ownership and the impact of regulation as expected our results show patterns that differ from those found in worldwide reviews e g the influence of regulatory incentives on operator efficiency and economies of scope in addition this paper presents patterns regarding the quantitative methods adopted as well as some trends and areas for possible future research keywords water and sanitation utilities efficiency benchmarking quantitative techniques 1 introduction the performance of the operators of water supply and sanitation services wss has been the focus of much research given the international interest in the economy of public resources and the development of competition simulations yardstick competition due to the monopolistic nature of the sector indeed over time an increasing number of studies have acknowledged the importance of performance and its economic impact on wss aspects related to performance evaluation efficiency productivity and its determinants benchmarking incentives and market structure have gained relevance in the research in this sector following the growing scientific literature on the performance of wss operators at least five bibliographic reviews have discussed how the international scientific community is making progress from theoretical and practical points of view berg and marques 2011 conducted a comprehensive review until the end of 2008 based on 190 studies these authors found strong evidence of a positive influence of regulatory incentives on the efficiency of operators but mixed results have been found in the analysis of privatization and economies of scale scope and density abbott and cohen 2009 also presented a comprehensive review based on more than 75 studies through early 2009 they concluded that there are economies of scale and of scope in the sector water and sanitation especially for small utilities however the results for privatization were ambiguous walter et al 2009 focused their review on water distribution in the period between 1998 and 2008 they concluded that the influence of privatization on operator performance was not clear but that institutional designs tend to be a dominant factor in efficiency they also found an omnipresence of economy of density and evidence of economies of scope a review on market structure analysis was conducted by carvalho et al 2012 in which a meta regression applied to more than 60 articles indicated a higher probability of finding diseconomies of scale and scope in large operators and in those under public management worthington 2014 focusing on frontier analysis reviewed 27 studies between 1990 and 2014 and found patterns on the impact of privatization and regulation on efficiency they analyzed patterns of economies of scale scope and density despite the five reviews two comprehensive and three more focused in studies that included all countries the trends and patterns found do not seem to represent the reality in the developing countries 1 1 we used the classification of the international monetary fund first this is because the number of studies conducted in developed countries is much higher influencing the patterns found second the developing countries present specific features such as the need for universality of service along with issues of equity continuity and water quality in addition the high levels of water losses found can skew the analysis of performance and the low availability of data which may limit the evaluation methodologies therefore in this article we provide a review of the literature for developing countries on the efficiency of wss and the application of econometric and linear programming models in addition we have compiled the most important conclusions in relation to the market structure operating environment privatization and incentives these results can be particularly useful for decision makers public services managers and other stakeholders after this brief introduction the article is organized as follows section 2 presents the characteristics of the research focusing on the publishing area countries data availability and the authors of these studies section 3 explores the quantitative techniques used in performance evaluations with details about the most often used basic qualitative and explanatory variables section 4 presents the main conclusions about the market structure property operational environment incentives and benchmarking section 5 lists important implications learned from the review and suggests an outlook of research needs 2 research characteristics overview a comprehensive review through may 2019 of the literature was conducted including studies that use quantitative methods to evaluate the performance of wss operators in developing countries the review was based on research published in international journals since this is a more accessible type of publication and is submitted to impartial review we searched for literature in the scopus science direct and google scholar databases using the following boolean search string dea or data envelopment analysis or sfa or stochastic frontiers analysis or sbm or slack based measure or tfp total factor productivity or ddf or directional distance function or luenberger or malmquist or ols or ordinary least squares or fdh or full disposal hull or order m or order α and water utilities or water industry or water sector or water supply or wss we also included relevant papers encountered when screening or reviewing other studies the studies were selected following the rules inclusion of studies carried out in developing countries inclusion of research published in international journals exclusion of studies which do not include quantitative results exclusion of studies in other languages than english exclusion of duplicates forty six articles were selected among the identified pieces of literature most of which were published in the last 20 years therefore this type of study in developing countries is quite recent and its increase is mainly due to the availability of data and interest in the recent privatization and regulation processes in the sector some interesting patterns were found when analyzing the authorship publishing area countries studied and data sources chronological analysis the first study found for a developing country was akosa et al 1995 who used the data envelopment analysis dea to rank 10 sanitation projects in ghana this was the only article found up to the year 2000 there was a lag in publications when compared to those in developed countries in their review berg and marques 2011 found 69 publications through 2000 with the first being the article of ford and watford in 1969 the delay in publications occurred because of a shortage of sufficient data to carry out performance analyses walter et al 2009 only 7 years after the first publication two other articles were published on this topic but the most typical objectives were the performance evaluation of operators one focused on analyzing the efficiency of regulation in mexico anwandter and ozuna 2002 and another focused on checking the influence of privatization on the performance of asian and oceania operators estache and rossi 2002 in the 2000s a total of 19 articles were published the main focus was comparing the efficiency of public and private companies accompanying the privatization process that took place in developing countries some examples are the process that took place in argentina in which at the end of the 1990s 70 of the urban population was served by private providers estache and trujillo 2003 the phenomenon that began in chile in 1998 and culminated in 2014 with 95 7 of consumers being served by private providers molinos senante et al 2016 and the process that increased in africa from the mid 1990s until the end of the decade driven by international funding agencies such as the world bank kirkpatrick et al 2006 accordingly studies were conducted in brazil argentina and malaysia e g estache and trujillo 2003 sabbioni 2008 munisamy 2009 and others in multiple countries kirkpatrick et al 2006 estache and rossi 2002 at that time it was also possible to observe the appearance of benchmarking studies that were mostly linked to the implementation of regulation processes e g corton 2003 berg and lin 2008 the only article dedicated solely to checking economies of scale scope and density was conducted then nauges and van den berg 2008 from 2010 to the present 26 additional articles were published the themes of privatization and regulation are still prevalent due to the processes that occurred in those countries although studies with other scopes also appear some of them examine exogenous variables that influence the efficiency of the operators e g ferro et al 2011 see 2015 and others include the variables of quality and efficiency in their analyses by comparing their results with traditional modeling e g lin and berg 2008 mbuvi et al 2012 fig 1 summarizes the number of publications per year area of publication the items found were categorized into 4 areas a business and administration b economics econometrics and finance c engineering and d environmental sciences 2 2 the area of science and water technology according to the scimago categorization fig 2 shows the distribution of 46 articles found in these four categories the publications are concentrated in the area of business and administration because many journals include that kind of study however a tendency toward change has been observed for the past 10 years publications in the areas of administration and economy have jointly fallen 50 while publications in the environmental sciences have tripled this can be mainly attributed to the tendency of studies to focus on equity and accessibility issues rather than on economic performance table 1 shows the number of publications by journal forty six papers were published in 24 different journals the journal utilities policy published 39 1 of all studies only five other journals had more than one publication water policy with three publications and environmental science policy the journal of infrastructure systems the journal of cleaner production and the world bank economic review each with two publications of the 24 scientific periodicals 89 5 are indexed in the scopus database and 87 are in the thompson database authors performance studies of wss operators require knowledge of the quantitative tools used of the institutional and managerial issues of the operators of the real significance and limitations of the available data and of the possible interpretations made from the results therefore it was expected that several authors participated in the studies however 71 of the publications had a maximum of two authors as shown in fig 3 a total of 46 articles were produced by 77 authors 77 9 of whom participated in only one article these figures show that the authors study the performance of operators in developing countries but do not go beyond that this can be mainly attributed to the non availability of reliable data to perform such analysis only 9 1 of the authors had three or more publications molinos senante with five publications sala garrido with four publications and berg ferro lin moreira and mugisha each with three publications this finding could also be attributed to the fact that most of the studies were conducted by researchers who were not from the countries they studied of the 46 articles 54 4 had at least one author from a developed country while nearly 29 were exclusively authors from developed countries of the 77 authors 41 6 were from academic institutions in developed countries 44 2 were from academic institutions in developing countries 11 7 were from governmental institutions and only 2 6 were from institutions linked to local water services countries studied a total of 74 developing countries were covered by the wss performance studies however fig 4 shows that nine articles analyzed more than one country cross country it is important to note that the main purpose of these articles was not to compare efficiency between countries but it was a way to address the lack of data dmu that prevented the models from being run in only one country 3 3 these cross comparison countries generate problems between operators in different operational environments walter et al 2009 but are used to avoid the problems of degrees of freedom for example the dea method requires that the number of dmus is greater than or equal to a m a x n d e i n p u t s n d e o u t p u t s 3 n d e i n p u t s n d e o u t p u t s banker et al 1989 of the countries studied 79 7 were exclusively covered in the nine cross country studies the studies that covered only one specific country 37 articles were for 15 countries the cross country studies exclusively covered 100 of the countries from oceania 88 9 from africa 75 from asia and 64 7 from america this shows the absence of data for individual analyses in the countries of these continents the countries that had more studies were brazil 9 individual and 2 cross country chile 6 individual and 1 cross country india and peru 4 individual and 1 cross country malaysia 3 individual and 2 cross country uganda 2 individual and 2 cross country ghana 1 individual and 3 cross country and zambia 4 cross country apart from zambia where all the analyses were carried out in conjunction with other countries all other countries presented systematic data provision as shown in the next section of all the articles 53 2 were conducted on the american continent 29 8 in asia 14 9 in africa and 2 1 in oceania two of the articles were based on intercontinental data nauges and van den berg 2008 compared the structure of the market scale scope and density in brazil moldova romania and vietnam and estache and rossi 2002 analyzed the efficiency of public and private companies in 31 countries in asia and oceania data source most developing countries do not provide periodic operational economic or financial and quality of service information about wss this is the main reason for the small number of quantitative studies in these countries however the 15 countries that were covered by individual studies showed sufficient data for these studies this was the case in the 11 studies conducted in brazil that collected data from the national sanitation information system snis the snis was created in 1996 as an integral part of the national sanitation policy as this was a periodic database and was relatively old it allowed the authors to carry out various quantitative performance analysis techniques including hypothesis testing that involved the evolution of efficiency in time of the eleven articles ten used panel data such as carvalho and sampaio 2015 who analyzed the efficiency of regulation and carvalho et al 2015 who checked for efficiency differences in clusters other countries presented similar databases and for this reason there are individual studies for them this was the case for information systems that we could find in a argentina managed by the national agency for water and sanitation works enohsa estache and trujillo 2003 b iran administered by the national company of water and wastewater engineering nwwec nourali et al 2014 c mexico managed by the national water commission anc anwandter and ozuna 2002 d palestine whose data were provided by the palestinian authority of water pwa alsharif et al 2008 e malaysia which has provided data relative to sanitation since 1994 through the malaysian water association mwa kamarudin et al 2016 f india which does not have a specific water and sanitation utilities performance information system but has a ministry of urban development moud that publishes performance reports of its operators vishwakarma and kulshrestha 2010 and g china which also does not have a specific information system but the national bureau of statistics nbs of china provides an annual survey from industrial firms li 2018 another form of data availability was the data published by regulatory authorities this is the case of peru whose data have been available since 1999 through the national superintendence of sanitation services sunass corton 2003 berg and lin 2008 and of chile whose data are available through the superintendence of sanitary services siss molinos senante et al 2016 ferro and mercadier 2016 we found another method that consisted of obtaining data from a single operator that operates in several cities in this way articles have compared the efficiency between units of an operator but not between operators this was found for studies in uganda in which the data were extracted from the regulation audit reports of the national water and sewerage corporation nwsc which operates in the 22 major cities of uganda including kampala mugisha 2007 2008 and 2014 mellah and amor 2016 used the data from a report from the tunisia water utility twu which is a state owned monopoly holder of water services in the country this was also the strategy used for the study in sri lanka in which dharmaratna and parasnis 2012 collected the data from a public utility with monopoly over water supply national water supply and drainage board nwsdb in addition we found a study in venezuela in which the data were provided by the utilities with the help of the compañía anónima hidrológicas de venezuela hidroven higuerey et al 2017 for studies involving more than one country data sources can come from international partnerships this was the case in africa in which the partnership between water operators wup provided a report on performance indicators through spbnet mbuvi et al 2012 kirkpatrick et al 2006 the same occurred in southeast asia in which the data could be collected from reports provided by the water services network of southeast asia seawun see 2015 and in south america where information could be consulted from the latin association of water regulators aderasa ferro et al 2011 corton and berg 2009 another data source in the studies between countries was the surveys conducted by development agencies in asia the asian development bank adb conducted research with 50 water services companies estache and rossi 2002 in africa the world bank in partnership with the african development bank adb and other institutions provided a diagnosis of the existing infrastructure in sub saharan africa in which information about water operators was included buafua 2015 although the ibnet international benchmarking network for water and sanitation utilities is the world largest database for water and sanitation utilities performance information only two studies used this database nauges and van den berg 2008 and corton and berg 2009 note that corton and berg verified the ibnet data contacting the utilities and they also used other data source aderasa database evaluating the performance of the sector and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of current regulatory and managerial arrangements without financial and operational statistics is an arduous if not impossible task this kind of observation implies the need for a permanent regulatory effort related to the collection and verification of data and the investment of operators in robust information systems berg and phillips 2017 note that developing countries lack such systems of information but their implementation is critical for monitoring performance and reaching related goals 3 quantitative techniques used the quantitative studies in the sector are usually categorized as parametric and nonparametric the main difference between them is that the parametric studies need to define a priori a function for production technology whereas the nonparametric studies do not have this requirement in studies on the efficiency of water operators in developing countries there is a dominance of nonparametric methods 54 4 over parametric methods 39 1 only 6 5 of studies used both methods almost all of the parametric studies used stochastic frontiers sfa in their analysis only the article by sabbioni 2008 used a variation of the least squares regression the least square dummy variables lsdv stochastic frontiers can be divided on the basis of cost production function and distance function of the sixteen sfa studies ten used cost functions and the most commonly used distributions were cobb douglas 44 4 translog 33 3 half normal 11 1 exponential 11 1 and natural logarithmic 11 1 the studies that used production functions 31 3 primarily adopted the translog distribution one article used it along with the cobb douglas distribution and another only used the cobb douglas distribution all the studies adopting the distance function 44 were based on inputs and used the translog distribution except for two that used log linear and cobb douglas distribution data envelopment analysis dea was the most commonly used nonparametric methodology 68 there are two approaches to dea one that compares only operators at the same level of scale variable returns to scale vrs and another that assumes that all operators operate at an optimum level constant returns to scale crs only three studies exclusively used the crs approach nine used the vrs approach and eight used both of them usually to deduce the scale efficiency dea can also be categorized into two more approaches the first input oriented aims to optimize efficiency by securing the outputs and inputs contracting the inputs in the second output oriented approach the optimization is performed by setting the vector of inputs and expanding the outputs a portion of the articles that used dea 23 8 also used the malmquist productivity index which captures changes in productivity between two periods the study of lin and berg 2008 in addition to the traditional dea used a nonradial approach in which a nonproportional reduction of inputs or a nonproportional increase of outputs is possible only seven works exclusively used other nonparametric methods estache and trujillo 2003 and li 2018 used the total production factor tfp molinos senante and sala garrido 2015 see and ma 2018 and sala garrido et al 2019 used a generalization of the malmquist productivity index luenberger productivity indicator to compute changes in productivity kamarudin et al 2016 and sala garrido et al 2019 applied a directional distance function ddf for simultaneously contracting inputs and expanding outputs and thus considering undesirable outputs and barbosa et al 2016 used a model based on dynamic slacks dsbm able to estimate production through time no studies were carried out using partial frontiers order m and order α or conditional frontiers in the nonparametric methods because they are deterministic it is not possible to distinguish the random variations of inefficiency in relation to the frontier in this way exogenous factors are accounted for as inefficiencies to overcome this limitation some studies used a second stage after obtaining efficiency scores mainly to return the dea efficiency measures against a number of explanatory variables tobit regression was used in four studies as was the bootstrap technique or double bootstrap nonparametric statistical tests were used in two studies and generalized estimating equations gee and lsdv were used in only one study no studies were found to use least squares regression ols or maximum likelihood estimation mle variables used the choice of inputs and outputs to be used in quantitative methods for analyzing the efficiency of operators is very relevant however it is also rather complicated due to the complexity of the water industry and in developing countries the availability of data table 2 shows the frequency of inputs and outputs used the input labor is usually measured in terms of wages total expenditure with employees or number of employees the extension of the water network is used as a proxy for capital expenditure of the operators which is very difficult to achieve in developing countries total revenue is usually measured as the total water volume accounted for lin 2005 and singh et al 2010 argue that operators with good cost efficiency do not necessarily feature good quality of services therefore it is desirable to incorporate quality variables into performance analysis picazo tadeo et al 2008 romano et al 2017 molinos senante et al 2015 state that the inclusion of these variables can encourage operators to improve customer services and aid regulators in developing incentives however lin and berg 2008 argue that most studies conducted in developing countries do not consider qualitative variables due to methodological limitations and data availability in fact in our review only 37 of the studies included quality variables in their analyses with the most frequent variables being water losses chlorination continuity of supply and service coverage most authors 50 modeled these variables as outputs the other works modeled them as inputs 25 or undesirable outputs 25 regarding the qualitative variable water losses the main strategy adopted was to use it as an input however two other strategies were found in our review which were to model it as undesirable output or to consider the total amount of water produced as an input and the amount of water delivered as an output explanatory variables refer to contextual issues affecting efficiency but are outside the scope of action of the operators and ignoring them in the analyses could lead to biased results berg and marques 2011 found more than 20 explanatory variables in their study while in this study more than 25 were found the most frequent were the scope of operation local or regional independent adjustment private participation type of economic regulatory mechanisms price cap revenue cap and rate of return density of connections water losses and water sources others were examined in only a few studies 4 4 other explanatory variables include the ratio of metered connections continuity of supply water storage capacity by the operator temperature of the region financial incentives tariff value peak factor complaints operator size ratio of water volume intended for tourism treated wastewater volume scope of the operator water or wastewater regions number of residential connections and gross domestic product per capita 4 issues addressed by the studies categorization according to the main issues addressed by the studies the results were categorized into 1 market structure economies of scale scope and density 2 private participation 3 regulatory incentives 4 benchmarking and 5 exogenous factors that influence performance market structure we found 25 works that studied the economies of scale scope and density however only nauges and van den berg 2008 focused on the market structure in developed countries it is more common to find diseconomies of scale in large operators and in operators under public management carvalho et al 2012 however only economies of scale were identified in developing countries in brazil barbosa et al 2016 carvalho et al 2015 sabbioni 2008 and seroa da motta and moreira 2006 identified economies of scale and nauges and van den berg 2008 identified positive but not significant effects carvalho et al 2015 analyzed approximately 4900 dmus between 2001 and 2011 and estimated the optimal volume of the water supply to be 600 000 m³ year economies of scale have also been found in india gupta et al 2012 kumar and managi 2010 singh et al 2010 mexico anwandter and ozuna 2002 malaysia munisamy 2009 vietnam nauges and van den berg 2008 tunisia mellah and amor 2016 iran nourali et al 2014 sri lanka dharmaratna and parasnis 2012 and six central american countries corton and berg 2009 in chile the results were not significant molinos senante et al 2015 although positive and negative economies of scale were found for full private and concessionary water utilities respectively molinos senante et al 2018 although in the water supply and wastewater sectors economies of density can be measured in terms of customers networks and production walter et al 2009 in developing countries they were analyzed only with regard to network concentration fifteen studies performed this analysis and in eight it was concluded that network density increased the efficiency of operators since it reduced costs e g souza et al 2008 the other seven works found similar results but they were not statistically significant e g tupper and resende 2004 concerning the economies of scope different approaches may also exist for example integrating the water sector with the provision of electricity and gas few studies have examined economies of scope 10 in developing countries and all of them addressed the vertical integration between water services and sanitation in brazil carvalho et al 2015 and barbosa et al 2016 found economies of scope nauges and van den berg 2008 did not find significant results and ferro et al 2014 found diseconomies of scope in vietnam a study identified economies of scope nauges and van den berg 2008 private participation the most frequently adopted objective was to identify the impact of public and private management on operator efficiency although there are theories that suggest increased efficiency by private operators research shows mixed results in various sectors berg and marques 2011 eighteen studies focused on this theme eight of them concluded that private operators were more efficient than public operators eight did not find significant differences and only two identified public operators as being more efficient even within the same country the results were diverse in brazil three studies concluded that private operators were more efficient three found no evidence and one concluded that public operators were more efficient although these differences can be explained by differences in the method or database used there was also evidence that the private sector ensured greater flexibility and productivity of labor sharma et al 2007 souza et al 2007 however capital expenditure was higher in the private sector than in public operators only four works that focused on comparing the efficiency between public and private operators used quality variables in all the private operators were more efficient than the public ones although the studies are few there is evidence that private operators were more efficient when factors such as water losses buafua 2015 water treatment carvalho et al 2015 sanitation ferro et al 2014 and quality of service munisamy 2009 were included in the analysis models benchmarking the second most representative objective of the studies considered in this review was to use quantitative techniques to measure the operators performance in the sample considered and identify best practices this review found 16 studies that had benchmarking as one of their main objectives most of them compared operators within a country but there were also studies that compared regions or countries alsharif et al 2008 corton and berg 2009 some studies focused on the impact of quality of service variables on performance evaluation kumar and managi 2010 lin 2005 lin and berg 2008 mbuvi et al 2012 the study of singh et al 2010 focused on incorporating sustainability parameters in benchmarking structures according to berg and marques 2011 the relevance of the rankings generated in these studies should be investigated in future research this topic is even more relevant in developing countries since issues such as loss of water and universalization of service are not included in models focused on minimizing costs corrected ordinary least squares classic sfa or dea with single outputs 5 5 berg and lin 2008 ranked the operators from peru using dea and sfa to compare them with rankings generated by local regulatory sunass they concluded that if it is necessary to include quality variables the dea or sfa methods based on the distance function are most suitable therefore if the objective is to use these rankings to devise incentives for the operators the use of traditional models may not enable the attainment of objectives such as universalization equity loss control and service quality however this review showed that these issues were seldom included in benchmarking studies only seven studied water losses six studied service coverage and four studied the number of hours of water supply these issues should be considered in models to prevent the use of benchmarking ranks based only on volumes and financial costs for example in countries such as brazil it could be cheaper to produce more water than to control losses sabbioni 2008 exogenous factors thirteen of the 46 articles studied the factors that influence the efficiency of operators as a main objective the main results of these studies are briefly described below in brazil carvalho et al 2015 found that local operators were more efficient than regional operators however the other three papers concluded the opposite seroa da motta and moreira 2006 sabbioni 2008 ferro et al 2014 in addition negative relationships were found between productivity and tariffs seroa da motta and moreira 2006 and between performance and gdp barbosa et al 2016 ferro et al 2011 analyzing 16 latin america and central countries found a negative relationship between the number of metered customers and operator performance gupta et al 2012 concluded that in india less populated cities showed relatively better performance mbuvi et al 2012 studying 11 african countries found a positive gdp influence on operator efficiency in uganda the positive impacts of financial incentives mugisha 2007 2014 managerial improvements mugisha 2008 and coverage improvements mugisha 2014 were found however targets for water loss reduction had a negative influence on performance mugisha 2014 in chile molinos senante and sala garrido 2015 concluded that exogenous variables the number of customers and size did not affect the efficiency of operators but molinos senante et al 2015 found a positive influence of peak water demand and a negative influence of water losses among 7 countries in southeast asia see 2015 concluded that environmental variables meteorological factors and gdp do not affect the efficiency of the operators regulatory incentive there was also a small group of six studies whose main objective was to analyze the impact of incentives on the water operators in theory one of the regulation objectives is to use benchmarking techniques to compare operators and to generate incentives for efficiency improvement benchmarking is used as a simulation of market forces to supplant potential abuses of the natural monopoly of the sector berg and marques 2011 operators that are not subject to regulatory systems tend to negotiate their tariffs with the government in those systems there is no generation of incentives for performance improvement conversely in regulatory regimes the most common incentives were the price cap the revenue cap and the rate of return only the work of barbosa et al 2016 studied the impact of different regulatory regimes on efficiency in their study in brazil they found that operators under the price cap and revenue cap were associated with lower efficiency than those under the rate of return or those that were not regulated the authors attributed this result to the possibility of negligent action and the political use of regulatory agencies ferro and mercadier 2016 exploring a possible path to recognize the associated increased costs with water loss control found that the regulators can induce providers to invest more through a k factor the other four studies compared the performance of operators under a regulatory regime they adopted two approaches a timeline in which efficiencies were compared before and after the implementation of regulatory systems and another in the form of clusters in which a regulated cluster was compared with an unregulated cluster buafua 2015 analyzing the regulatory system in 16 sub saharan african countries found that regulation via performance contracts led to greater efficiency than the controls carried out by independent regulators carvalho et al 2015 and carvalho and sampaio 2015 showed that brazilian operators were more efficient before the regulatory system had been implemented in méxico anwandter and ozuna 2002 also found that regulation did not bring efficiency improvements for operators thus surprisingly no articles showed that performance improved because of regulatory incentives wren lewis 2014 argued that in africa this was due to institutional weaknesses and that the models imported from developed countries did not have any effect 5 conclusions lessons learned we provide a critical review across the literature for developing countries on the efficiency of wss and the application of econometric and linear programming models the important implications of our work are there was a tendency of private operators to exhibit better performance in developing countries especially when qualitative variables were accounted for in the evaluations performed regarding market structure economies of scale have been found in brazil india mexico malaysia vietnam tunisia iran and six central american countries in other countries this question was not analyzed or the results were not statistically significant all the works that examined economies of density found positive results but only slightly more than 50 were significant concerning economies of scope wss studies were conducted only in brazil with diverging results and in vietnam where economies of scope were found the regulatory incentives have not promoted performance improvement of water utilities in developing countries some of the results of our review show patterns that differ from those found in the literature covering developed and developing countries simultaneously e g a positive influence of regulatory incentives in the efficiency of operators and the existence of economies of scope future research directions based on the outcomes of this review the following research directions have been identified to help the research community and the professionals working on the performance evaluation of water utilities more than 70 of the nonparametric studies used the input oriented approach keeping in mind the studies conducted in developed countries in which operators provide drinking water to and collect wastewater from all domestic customers and cannot encourage consumption however for developing countries the need for universalization is a reality future studies should consider using a service maximization approach in terms of number of connections or clients service coverage or other the use of distance functions on sfa is a way to go beyond the inconvenience of sfa by not admitting multiple inputs and outputs simultaneously it is desirable to incorporate quality variables into performance analysis carried out on developing countries regarding the qualitative variable water losses there are advantages in modeling water losses as an undesirable output and this should be a strategy in future research traditional benchmarking studies may not enable the attainment of objectives such as universalization equity loss control and service quality therefore future research should focus on studying models that capture these issues although the implementation information systems is critical for monitoring performance and reaching related goals the use of panel data and more robust methods e g partial frontiers methods are interesting strategies to deal with data unavailability and data quality issues e g curse of dimensionality extreme data and outliers there is a disbelief that such quantitative studies can lead to improvements in the performance of water companies in developing countries because the institutional weaknesses e g limited regulatory capacity and limited fiscal efficiency are the main issue of regulatory failure accordingly addressing the related problems is more important than solving the concerns that are normally stressed in the regulation of utilities in developed countries e g performance therefore would be interesting that future publications in this field discuss this subject some topics that should be addressed in future research are linked to the universalization and equity of access and water losses thus future studies should incorporate qualitative variables that capture these issues use appropriate models e g dea directed toward outputs and compare the results with traditional approaches of cost minimization

18672,this paper presents a review of the current state of the art of real time control rtc of water distribution networks wdns after proving the basic concept and terms of rtc and presenting sensors regulation devices and controllers typically used in wdns the paper goes on by describing the most frequent control objectives which mainly include service pressure regulation control of tank filling and energy production in each wdn district various control methodologies recently proposed in the scientific literature are presented and discussed along with experimental and numerical results achieved also aspects related to the cost effectiveness of rtc are critically analyzed the paper ends by giving an outlook into potential future developments in the area of rtc for wdns graphical abstract image 1 keywords model based control real time control water distribution valves pumps pump as turbines 1 introduction water distribution networks wdns are complex systems made up of various interconnected nodes and pipes which take water of suitable quality from sources to supply customers in the service area based on the traditional design approach wdns are commonly expected to guarantee effectiveness and acceptable standards of service i e pressure flow quality reliability in most operational scenarios recently forms of real time control rtc of various levels of complexity have been successfully implemented in various case studies in the world to achieve objectives of enhanced quantity quality of the supplied water and more in general to improve the operation of wdns real time control refers to a control time step of minutes or less the control is not manual intermittent or only at specific times in an age when wdn management issues are more and more considered by the managers of water utilities bello et al 2019 a general analysis of the scientific and grey literature shows that at least three valid reasons exist for the implementation of rtc in wdns 1 nowadays supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems as well as internet of things technologies make it easier to monitor levels of applicability 2 results from numerous case studies have proven rtc to have significant potential for improving the operation of wdns 3 rtc enables pursuing water and energy savings the added value of rtc lies in the possibility to use current information about the real status of the system to improve its control thus limiting inaccuracies due to assumptions and hypotheses on its operation about two decades after the publication of the first papers the moment has come to take stock of the situation to highlight benefits and drawbacks of rtc in wdns since there is no literature review in this specific topic conversely state of the art papers were published in the research field of rtc of urban drainage systems schilling 1989 schutze et al 2004 campisano et al 2015 where examples of field implementation are already available starting from the early 60s the aim of this paper is to survey and review the main endeavors of the two most recent decades on the topic of rtc in wdns with emphasis on hydraulics control rationale and costs the paper will offer researchers academics and practitioners who are new to this topic an idea of the rationale for rtc and related technology as well as of its successful implementation in a real case study in the remainder of the paper first the fundamental concepts and terms of rtc and the devices typically used in wdns are presented then control objectives pertinent to wdns are described along with available numerical and experimental results and cost benefit analyses potential for exploitation of such a technology as well as existing technical and economic barriers to its large scale application in real systems are discussed the paper ends by reporting current and future trends of rtc in wdns 1 1 rtc concept and terminology typically many operators of water supply systems use improperly the term control to indicate the result of the monitoring of system parameters i e continuous acquisition of such properties as water levels in reservoirs flows in pipes and network pressure however acquisition of measurements is only one of the stages of the network control which also includes the adjustment of actuators installed in the system based on the collected measurements to intervene in an active way on the distribution process if active control of the system is performed with short time intervals occurring between two successive correction actions i e from the order of some minutes downwards the wdn is said to be controlled dynamically in real time e g see prescott and ulanicki 2008 and campisano et al 2010 therefore the rtc of wdns requires implementation of hardware elements in the network such as various types of sensors and actuators controllers and data transmission systems a sensor is a device that measures a physical property of the process to be controlled an actuator is a device by which a control system acts upon the process a controller is a device recently in the form of a microprocessor or computer that calculates the suitable corrections of the actuator setting for influencing the process based on a preset rationale data transmission systems are physical and unphysical interconnections that enable the exchange of data between the various element of the control system let us assume a process needs to be monitored and controlled in real time in a wdn furthermore let us assume that at the initial time the process variable of interest also called controlled variable is at its desired set point value due to the presence of disturbances such as variations in source pressure heads and or in nodal demands the variable of interest will tend to deviate from its set point a sensor is present to measure the controlled variable then the measurement acquired through the sensor is signaled to the controller at prefixed temporal steps through data processing the controller estimates how the actuator setting must be dynamically adjusted to minimize the current deviation of the controlled variable from the desired set point value finally the controller s correction is signaled to the actuator which is adjusted accordingly at every control time step connections between sensor actuator and controller are obtained through the data transmission system based on leased dedicated telephone lines or on wireless communication systems such as radio cellular systems or satellite telecommunication devices and so forth the process control described above can usually be schematized by means of a control loop fig 1 corrective actions can consist of discrete actions such as turning a pump on or off or fully opening or closing a valve in other cases they can consist of continuous adjustments in valve closure setting or pump speed set point can be constant or time dependent the succession of set points on time is called control strategy sometimes a deadband is used around the set point to which no corrective actions correspond this is done to prevent oscillation or repeated activation deactivation cycles of the actuator the loop control outlined in fig 1 can be carried out in different modalities feedback control loops calculate actuator corrections based on the measured deviation of the controlled process from the set point in feedforward control actuator corrections are calculated based on the deviation predicted for the near future by means of a simplified model of the process feedback feedforward control loops are combinations of the first two modalities 1 2 rtc system architecture the choice of the architecture of the rtc system conceptually the organization of its components is an important step for obtaining a high performance of the system campisano et al 2016 there is no unique best choice of architecture that could be recommended to fit any rtc application to wdns because implementation of control systems always faces different site specific challenges stinson et al 2006 however in general depending on the network topology and complexity the rtc system architecture can be local or global in the first case process measurements are taken by a sensor probe directly locally at the actuator site in which only one actuator is usually present an example of this architecture is represented by the pump switch on off based on the local water level measurement into the pump tank or a pressure control valve which hydraulically throttles the flow and attenuates downstream service pressure in the second case that is the most common for large networks various sensors and actuators are typically present in the system the measurements taken at all the sensor sites are signaled to a central control room which globally operates the different actuators in a coordinated way in most cases the sensor and actuator can communicate directly but can be overridden by the control room typically global rtc implies the implementation of remote control thus requiring various levels of sophistication of the transmission system intermediate architectures all based on remote control can be implemented for relatively large systems where measurements from a single remote sensor are used to adjust the settings of one single control or more multiple control actuators berardi et al 2017 this is for example the case of one pressure gauge in the downstream network used to control one or more upstream pressure valves e g see campisano et al 2016 conversely depending on the rtc objective the system design can consider architectures characterized by a single actuator controlled based on measurements received from several remote sensors distributed in the network the control of the network can have different degrees of automation it can be manual supervisory or automatic in the first case actuators are adjusted based on decisions of human operators who compare controlled variables to set points in the second case automatic controllers propose corrections to supervising operators who can still modify them based on their expertise in the last case the control is fully automatized though manual override can be carried out in the case of an emergency 1 3 sensors actuators and controllers for wdns principal requirements for rtc sensors in wdns are measurement accuracy and reliability accompanied by the suitability for continuous recording and remote transmission although necessary for implementing robust rtc systems sensor requirements are less stringent than those used for urban drainage systems where long term sensor resistance to the harsh environment of sewer networks is also required schutze et al 2004 campisano et al 2015 a certain degree of redundancy in the wdn is also required to increase the system s resilience to unexpected events determining sensors malfunctioning with potential loss of data and subsequent deterioration of the control action on the actuators puig et al 2016 some concepts of fault detection in wdns are provided in the following subsection main sensors used include water level gauges such as floating hydrometers bubblers pressure inductive gauges and sonic gauges to be typically installed in tanks to monitor water levels pressure sensors such as piezoresistive capacitive electromagnetic piezoelectric and optical gauges normally installed at demand nodes control valve inlet outlet and pump suction discharge to monitor pressure heads flow meters such as optical flow sensors electromagnetic or ultrasound flow meters in addition to the pressure based meters e g venturi meter and pitot tube electromagnetic and ultrasound flow meters may also be able to correct for varying pressure and temperature i e density conditions and for non linearities flow meters can be installed at wdn pipes and at users connections to monitor flows and consumption respectively traditional mechanical meters e g woltman and current meter for volumetric measurements usually when used in the context of rtc flow meters are installed to monitor flow at key pipes in the wdn such as the feeding pipes of district metered areas dmas in the case of flow meters a very small sampling period order of magnitude down to 1 s is used for acquiring the reading volumetric meters are used instead at user connections with a higher sampling period order of magnitude down to some minutes while measurements can be taken locally at a high frequency they may be communicated back to the control room at a polling interval which may be 15 min or an hour in this case they have report on exception which will call in at when a trigger level is hit actuators in wdns include pumps axial or screw with constant or variable speed to be installed along wdn pipes to increase head control valves that have a mechanical actuator such as plunger globe piston and butterfly valves to be installed along wdn pipes to modulate control flow valves that have a spring controlled actuator such as the pressure reducing valves prvs to be installed along wdn pipes to reduce the input upstream time varying pressure head to a steady output downstream value turbines or pumps as turbines pats to be installed along wdn pipes to enable conversion of the surplus of total head into electrical energy if the range of flow in the valve fitted pipe is large and the valve is sized to provide full demand when it is fully open the valve may need to be substantially closed almost fully closed during low flow times e g during night hours under such conditions the potential occurrence of cavitation must be assessed in the system design phase and anti cavitation devices such as anti cavitation buckets can be installed to prevent this phenomenon around the valve seat the control loop shown in fig 1 is the basic element of any rtc system and specifically in wdns the manipulation of the actuators is entrusted to controllers or control units digital control units such as programmable logic controllers plcs or remote terminal units rtus are used in the case of automatic control globally rtus and plcs have similar potentialities thus including data acquisition pre processing filtering validation check for status temporary storage of data calculation power as well as high connectivity for data exchange with a central station campisano et al 2015 in the control room a scada system can manage all incoming and outgoing data alarms are generated here and operators can monitor and control processes e g change of setpoints in addition the scada system can enable additional information to be used for automatically executing the control for example by incorporating additional validation steps beyond the basic controller logic some validation steps may use real time dynamic hydraulic modelling of the wdn abu mahfouz et al 2019 though the functionalities of plcs and rtus overlap with each other an rtu is a microprocessor controlled electronic device that interfaces objects in the physical world to a distributed control system or scada system by transmitting telemetry data to the system and or altering the state of connected objects based on control messages received from the system instead a plc is basically a digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes in fact rtus tend to be used more for wide geographic telemetry while plcs are best suited for local area control plcs and rtus can be programmed according to a specific rationale in order to achieve the optimal control of the actuator rules algorithms are implemented with the output correction signal being typically based on the current deviation between the measured value of the monitored variable and its setpoint schilling 1989 two options are commonly preferred in wdns the first option is the discrete two point or on off control most frequently applied when only two settings are available for the actuator on off or open closed this is the case with a constant speed pump controlled to fill a tank in the case of continuous control of the actuator pid proportional integral derivative algorithms and related simplifications e g p pi pd can be adopted a controller based on the pid logic calculates at prefixed control time steps deviation of the record from the set point and provides proportional p integral i and derivative d corrective contributes to adjust the actuator results from the literature have shown pid controllers to perform properly for accurate water level control in storage tanks e g kumar and kumar 2009 and for remote rtc of valves for pressure control in wdns e g prescott and ulanicki 2008 pid controllers have been successfully used also for the real time control of water quality including for example chlorine residual control in wdns wang et al 2006 souza and mohan kumar 2018 although pid algorithms have shown reliability and ease of implementation with use of industrial plcs calibration of such systems is needed to provide high performing control actions with sufficiently fast achievement of the set point without risks of oscillations of the controlled variable i e periodic oscillation of the controlled variable around the designed set point to be achieved ziegler nichols 1942 tyreus luyben 1992 cohen coon 1953 åström hägglund 1984 in the context of pressure control in wdns controllers were also proposed starting from simple physical considerations on network behavior e g creaco and franchini 2013 remarkably forecast techniques can also be used with controllers to estimate the future state of the system in order to obtain feedforward control page et al 2017a 2017b creaco 2017 page and creaco 2019 a significant aspect of a physically based controller is that it often can be formulated to have no tunable parameter i e is parameter free these controllers have been studied numerically by creaco et al 2017 giustolisi et al 2017 berardi et al 2017 page et al 2017a 2017b 2018 and page and creaco 2019 a parameter free controller can often be used initially and a related controller which has a tunable parameter can then be used by slowly changing the parameter away from its initial value to improve the control page et al 2018 1 4 quality of measurements and fault detection the good quality of sensor measurements is an essential prerequisite for the success of rtc therefore fault detection must be implemented to guarantee the reliability of rtc systems puig 2009 nowadays numerous statistical process control spc methods are available for the detection of faulty measurements venkatasubramanian et al 2003a b c including univariate methods like control charts schraa et al 2006 and multivariate methods e g based on principal component analysis pca rosen and lennox 2001 yoo et al 2006 the main difference between univariate and multivariate methods lies in the fact that the former process the measurements obtained from a single sensor checking the acceptability of their measurement noise the latter instead check this acceptability based on the interrelation with other measured signals if the same variable is measured by multiple sensors at the same time a confidence interval can be created to diagnose faulty measurements in the generic sensor off line measurements can be used as reference to validate on line measurements in this context non zero residuals are allowed as long as they are small and normally distributed if a reference measurement is available shewhart control charts checking measurements falling beyond a three sigma limit can be used to detect drift shift and outlier effects thomann et al 2002 alternatively residuals can be analyzed under the assumption of errors being represented like random variables with zero mean and constant variance homoscedasticity standard statistical tests searching for serial dependency or autocorrelation can be used to evaluate this property and detect potential sensor faults dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 in the case of measurements available from multiple e g three sensors for a generic controlled variable the operation of the rtc system may be as follows an alert message is given in the presence of an outlier in the controlled variable at a certain time of the day if the actuator setting at that time of the day is close to those in the previous days at the same time and if the outlier is present only in one of the sensors installed for monitoring the controlled variable the outlier is associated with poor quality data therefore the operation of the rtc system may go on ignoring this outlier and relying on the measurements from the other sensors otherwise if the actuator setting is different from those in the previous days at the same time and the multiple sensors agree on the measurement of the controlled variable this may be classified as an anomalous event in the system controlled in real time indeed this may happen when the forcing conditions of the system are significantly different from those expected at that time of the day like when the overall demand of the wdn suddenly increases due to the opening of one or more hydrants for firefighting or to a pipe burst 2 control objectives 2 1 service pressure control service pressure in wdn must be high enough to enable users full demand satisfaction when it falls below a desired threshold which may be a function of building height the wdn cannot supply all users with requested flows therefore at nodes experiencing pressure deficits the distributed flow becomes lower than the demand ciaponi et al 2015 conversely excessive service pressure has various negative impacts such as the increase in leakage and pipe bursts and the reduction in infrastructure life vicente et al 2016 hence comes the advisability of regulating controlling service pressure in real time to reduce it and keep it close to the desired pressure threshold which is assumed to be the set point value in the regulation process rtc can be conveniently performed independently at each district metered area dma if the wdn is divided into dmas specifically if the district has lower ground elevations compared to the feeding source regulation can be performed via control valves to dissipate pressure surpluses conversely if it has higher ground elevations it can be performed via variable speed pumps vsps this is the case with closed distribution systems with no storage capacity walski and creaco 2016 page et al 2018 in both the cases of control valves and vsps device settings are adjusted in real time to lead the controlled pressure head to the set point value under various operating conditions of the district the use of rtc can reduce leakage while fully satisfying demand 2 2 rtc of control valves in the presence of pressure surplus a large scientific literature exists concerning the dynamic regulation of service pressure in water distribution systems in this framework research efforts were dedicated to proving its better performance in comparison with the use of static prvs and of control valves actuated with no feedback from the wdn in fact abdelmeguid et al 2011 and creaco and walski 2018 showed the benefits obtained by using instead of the static prv a prv locally controlled in real time as a function of the flowing water discharge these authors proved that a locally controlled prv enables larger service pressure abatements in the wdn with beneficial effects in terms of leakage reduction these benefits increase when remote control as a function of the pressure head at the critical node in the dma is implemented instead of local control e g berardi et al 2017 creaco and walski 2018 furthermore campisano et al 2010 proved that compared to valve regulation based on the results obtained by applying optimization algorithms to the average daily pattern of demands araujo et al 2006 with no feedback from the current wdn status control valve regulation in real time has better flexibility under time varying water demand conditions furthermore other efforts were spent mainly on the development of increasingly efficient algorithms for rtc of service pressure through control valves while in most situations the pursuit of very high performance in the control may be unjustified considering the slow demand variations occurring in wdns the rapid response of the controller is needed to react to large and rapid changes in flow in fact the combination of transients and slow response can lead to undesirable pressure fluctuations large and rapid changes in flow may take place in the following cases a large industry needs a lot of water quickly and then goes back to low use for example filling of a batch mixing tank for some process fire fighters quickly open close hydrants even though they are trained not to operators quickly open close valves hydrants for flushing flow testing shutdowns even though they should know not to even better than fire fighters a pump to a higher pressure zone wholesale customer is turned on off without a slow closing operating control valve or soft start vfd a summary of the key features of the works dedicated to algorithm development is available in table 1 which also reports if each work has dealt with the issue of stability analysis i e the analysis of occurrence of permanent oscillations in actuator setting and controlled variable due to the overreactive response of the actuator an early example of local rtc comes from prescott and ulanicki 2008 who analyzed numerically the feedback control of pressure reducing valves at very small time steps order of magnitude of milliseconds the objective of the study was to investigate the interaction between mechanically actuated prvs and water network transients unsteady flow network models incorporating random pulsed demands were combined with a behavioral prv model to demonstrate how the response of the system to changes in demand can produce large or persistent pressure variations similar to those seen in practical experiments a pid control system to replace the existing prv hydraulic controller was proposed and this alternative controller was shown to significantly improve the network response in numerical and field applications as a development of the work of prescott and ulanicki 2008 abdelmeguid et al 2011 developed the aquai mod controller which aims to modulate the prv outlet pressure according to the valve flow in their work the authors constructed a numerical model of the prv and controller and validated it through experiments in a laboratory rig the first attempt to explore benefits of introducing remote feedback rtc for pressure control valves in wdns is provided in campisano et al 2010 the objective of the described rtc system was to reduce pressure surplus and leakage in the network to achieve such an objective the authors suggested assuming as controlled node the node with the lowest pressure head in the wdn district or some critical customer in this node the pressure head is assumed to be monitored in continuous and the average value of the pressure is transmitted to the valve site at prefixed control time steps minutes p controllers were assumed to calculate the valve settings as a function of the deviation of actual pressure value from the set point the wdn behavior was analyzed through the extended period simulation in which transients are neglected the results of the simulations proved the rtc system to enable proper pressure control with leakage reduction while meeting the conditions for full demand satisfaction in the daily operation of the wdn while sticking to the same simulation framework as campisano et al 2010 campisano et al 2012 developed through the dimensionless approach a method for the calibration of p controllers in wdns the numerical applications proved that p controllers calibrated through this method have a fast response with no occurrence of permanent oscillations around the set point which are the sign of instability in the control this method can be used by practitioners as an alternative option to other well established techniques ziegler nichols 1942 tyreus luyben 1992 cohen and coon 1953 åström and hägglund 1984 from industrial control engineering using a similar numerical model to campisano et al 2010 creaco and franchini 2013 showed better controller performances including attenuated pressure head oscillations around the set point can be obtained if the proportional control logic is replaced with a new logic which makes use of measurements concerning both the pressure head at the controlled node and the water discharge in the pipe fitted with the control valve this new physically based logic evaluates the valve setting adjustment starting from the pressure head deviation based on physical considerations on steady states in the wdn in fact it aims to correct the valve head loss coefficient as a function of measured water discharge and pressure head deviation the adjusted valve setting is obtained starting from the adjusted head loss coefficient by using the relationship between head loss coefficient and valve setting provided by the manufacturer by making use of the software wdnetxl giustolisi et al 2017 presented the numerical comparison of three kinds of controllers for pressure rtc specifically the p controllers of campisano et al 2010 the physically based controller of creaco and franchini 2013 operating on valve resistance and a novel physically based controller operating on the head loss across the control valve the results of their work proved the superiority of the physically based controllers with a slight predominance of their novel controller however for the novel controller the authors did not provide any closed form expressions for estimating the suitable setting correction for the control valve at the generic control time step page et al 2017a implemented water discharge prediction through a linear relationship inside the physically based controller of creaco and franchini 2013 the resulting controller is parameter free and of feedback feedforward kind in fact the suitable actuator setting correction at the generic time step is estimated based on variables at the old time pressure head deviation at the controlled node and water discharge in the valve fitted pipe and on the forecasted water discharge at the new time the results of the numerical work of page et al 2017a proved the controller to be stable and responsive under smooth demand conditions in the wdn a field oriented methodology to evaluate benefits of pressure rtc to reduce leakage by pressure control valves in wdn was tested by campisano et al 2016 the paper introduced modalities for addressing the selection of the proper rtc system architecture based on the network connectivity at the valve sites criteria for target node identification and rtc strategy selection in case of single control one valve one target node and multiple control multiple valve one target node architectures were developed the impact on the control performance of controller calibration and on communication protocol selection procedures was also explored the methodology was applied to a norwegian wdn in which the installation of a field pilot rtc system is in progress in order to overcome the limitations of results obtained using eps creaco et al 2017 investigated the potential of unsteady flow modelling for the simulation of remote feedback rtc of pressure in wdns performed through the algorithm of creaco and franchini 2013 the applications concerned a skeletonized wdn in which random pulsed nodal demands had been generated though a stochastic model for pulsed demand compared to eps the unsteady flow model proved to provide sounder description of the amplitude of the pressure head variations at the controlled node furthermore it facilitates identification of the suitable control time step to be adopted for obtaining a prompt and effective regulation nevertheless eps based models are enough to provide quite accurate estimates of daily leakage and of valve setting patterns at a much smaller computational cost a similar unsteady flow model was used by creaco et al 2018 to analyze numerically the behavior of remotely controlled valves in comparison with prv during hydrant activation scenarios for firefighting in fact these scenarios deserve attention due to the inherent high flow conditions which are very different from usual operational scenarios the model was applied to a skeletonized wdn model in which a prv and an rtc valve were alternatively been assumed to be installed at the pipe connecting the source node to the remainder of the wdn the results highlighted the better capability of rtc of controlling service pressure at the critical node and therefore in the whole wdn pressure deficits occur in the presence of the prv which is not able to sense the pressure signal from the remote critical node the larger service pressure occurring with rtc results in beneficially larger outflows from the hydrants operated in the wdn creaco et al 2018 also investigated numerically the issue of rtc stability showing that the parameter of the control logic of creaco and franchini 2013 must not overcome a threshold to prevent control instability by working numerically with eps creaco 2017 developed a generalization of the control logic of creaco and franchini 2013 for the remote rtc of control valves compared to the work of page et al 2017a the author developed a fully feedforward controller in which the suitable actuator setting correction at the generic time step is estimated only as a function of forecasted variables at the new time namely pressure head deviation at the controlled node and water discharge in the valve fitted pipe the author applied his controller to the eps of a skeletonized wdn with random pulsed nodal demands averaged over the control time step this marks an important difference from the work of page et al 2017a bringing numerical simulation closer to the real behavior of wdns a related study to that of creaco 2017 not only discussed the derivation of the various physically based controllers in one place page and creaco 2019 but also showed how the water discharge prediction in page et al 2017a can be improved in the presence of random pulsed nodal demands the results of the applications highlighted that the new logic yields advantages in terms of closeness of controlled variable to set point and of total variation of the device setting above all when the water discharge pattern features contained random fluctuations and large hourly variations fontana et al 2018a discussed the theoretical framework of rtc of a prv for pressure regulation in a wdn the authors identified a simplified dynamic model of a hydraulically operated prv and developed a controller for closed loop regulation of the pressure at any given monitored node basically the regulation of pressure at any node is obtained by dynamically modifying the outlet pressure of the prv this marks a difference from the remote rtc described above where the remote control is obtained by operating on valve closure setting fontana et al 2018a showed that a pure p controller is unable to control pressure at any node with a prv because an error between set point pressure and controlled pressure head should be present in order to generate the control signal to set the downstream pressure a zero error would imply zero input signal regardless of the desired downstream pressure whereas an integral controller block can have a nonzero constant output with a zero error i e at steady state the integral term can cause overshooting of the system but it may be accepted if the relative extent thereof with respect to the desired step does not exceed some value and the set point value is rapidly achieved they also discussed the issues e g stability arising from rtc of the pressure at a monitored node a finite delay may generate oscillations and even instability therefore smaller values of gains should be chosen or the smith s predictor should be added to the controller fontana et al 2018a b also discussed laboratory and field experiments to show the reliability of algorithms and equipment for rtc of pressure in a wdn laboratory experiments demonstrated the controller s ability to regulate pressure at the monitored node the integrator gain was varied to identify the best trade off between transient duration and stability of regulation and issues related to transport delays were analyzed showing that oscillations and instabilities may arise in real environment for large gain values field experiments showed the effectiveness of the equipment communication architecture and algorithm for pressure control in real environment an integral controller was used to account for the high variability of pressure at the monitored node coupled to the smith s predictor because of the distance between prv and controlled node the controller resulted quite effective guaranteeing very stable regulation without oscillations and instabilities compared to the previous works the main merit of janus and ulanicki 2018 was to propose a solution to tackle the occurrence of instabilities in the rtc of prvs through pid units the authors took inspiration from an instability event recorded in a large scale pressure control scheme in one of the major cities in the united kingdom in fact if the valve controller is tuned at medium valve openings characteristic of normal operating conditions the increased gain at low valve openings can cause the control system to be too reactive in its valve position adjustments leading to oscillations as a remedy they carried out a numerical investigation to show that instabilities can be prevented by implementing gain compensation inside the pid control a more formal and comprehensive analysis of instability was performed by galuppini et al 2019b who applied tools and methodologies of control system theory to analyze both nominal and robust stability of rtc algorithms the authors showed that due to the nonlinearity of the gain of the process under control it is advisable to base the regulator design on high order models which better describe the dynamics of the process around the working point otherwise wide robustness margins must be provided in the design of the feedback system for this purpose it is shown that the introduction of a low pass filter and a smith predictor can significantly improve the robustness of the control scheme while at the same time helping to reduce the cost of control galuppini et al 2019a investigated numerically the benefits of considering the dynamic behavior of the wdn in the set up of rtc algorithms in comparison with the algorithm developed by creaco and franchini 2013 based on physical considerations on the steady state behavior of the system specifically the authors applied a pi controller a filtered pi controller and a linear quadratic gaussian controller in two wdns though increasing the number and size of actuator setting adjustments all control algorithms improve the state of the art in terms of regulation error in presence of pulsed nodal demand on average the reduction in the regulation error added up to about 40 therefore the adoption of these algorithms is advisable in all cases when the more rapid wearing of the control valve is not a limiting factor 2 3 rtc of variable speed pumps in the presence of pressure deficits compared to control valves the applications to vsps supplying water to closed distribution systems are less numerous in this context some research efforts e g walski and creaco 2016 showed that the installation of vsps at dma inlets may be beneficial in terms of long run operational costs in fact besides the same kind of pressure reduction benefits as that obtained with control valves the use of vsps in lieu of fixed speed pumps enables reduction in the consumption of electric energy and as a result in the water utility s expenses this has been tested in small scale experimental test beds which perform rtc to control the pressure remotely with vsps these studies found the following deceases in the electrical energy used by the vsps relative to a fixed speed pump 35 03 bezerra et al 2012 19 23 silva et al 2015 66 2 filho et al 2018 other contributions concern the set up of controllers see table 2 using a similar approach to page et al 2017a page et al 2017b developed a physically based controller for vsps this controller is parameter free and of feedback feedforward kind in fact the suitable correction in pump speed at the generic time step is estimated based on variables at the old time pressure head deviation at the controlled node and water discharge in the vsp fitted pipe and on the forecasted water discharge at the new time like the controller of page et al 2017a for control valves the controller of page et al 2017b for vsps proved stable and responsive under smooth demand conditions in the wdn using the same approach as for the control valve creaco 2017 also developed a feedforward controller for vsps which evaluates pump speed correction as a function of the forecasted water discharge in the vsp fitted pipe and of the forecasted pressure deviation at the controlled node as mentioned above a merit of the work of creaco 2017 lies in accounting for random pulsed nodal demands the author remarked that in the case of the vsp the oscillations of the controlled variable caused by the pulsed nature of demands are smaller especially under low demand conditions compared to the control valve this is because the pump tends to dampen the effects of water discharge variations better than the valve especially under low demand conditions which require high valve closures and low pump speeds simplified physically based controllers which do not use a forecasted water discharge have also been formulated by page et al 2017b the tendency of oscillations of the controlled variable to be small due to pulsed demand variation was also observed for these controllers page et al 2018 several studies reported experimental remote rtc investigations using a small laboratory testbed that models a wdn these studies do not use physically based controllers but provide valuable insight into the experimental performance and stability of controllers on a time scale of seconds or milliseconds various studies were done for a single vsp first a controller using fuzzy logic was studied bezerra et al 2012 fuzzy logic is an attempt at the formalization and mechanization of the human capability to make rational decisions second both pid and an enhancement called active disturbance rejection control adrc was compared madonski et al 2014 adrc improves the performance of a classical feedback controller for example pid by adding a disturbance observer that reconstructs and rejects the unwanted perturbation in the system in each control cycle another related approach was used by filho et al 2018 and de araújo moura et al 2018 who proposed a feedback controller based on artificial neural networks ann the actuator was either two identical vsps in parallel filho et al 2018 or a single vsp de araújo moura et al 2018 training was done based on laboratory experiments through the descending gradient filho et al 2018 or levenberg marquardt de araújo moura et al 2018 backpropagation algorithms for both studies the controllers proved stable and robust in the testing phase the controller in filho et al 2018 incorporates the minimization of the measured electrical power use of the two vsps for low demand it is found that only one of the two identical vsps needs to operate however as the demand increases both vsps start to operate with each at the same pump speed this work also shows that the controller is robust under disturbances which occur when the pumps switch the various studies that do not use physically based controllers have almost entirely been carried out by related authors a gap in the literature is that these authors need to provide clarity on which of the many controllers they proposed performs the best furthermore comparison to a state of the art physically based controller would be invaluable 2 4 water level control if the wdn is gravity fed by tanks open distribution systems pumps are typically used to re fill the tanks by pumping water from source s unlike closed distribution systems in this case pumps are required to fill tanks in a reasonable time period with no need to regulate pump speed indeed pump on off switches need to be optimized to minimize the daily cost of electricity and the wear of the pumps and motors which depends on various variables such the number of pump switches in the context of tank filling the traditional approach considered in the scientific literature for the optimization of pump on off switches is pump scheduling ps for which an extensive literature review was carried out by mala jetmarova et al 2018 this approach lies in considering a historical pattern of outflows from the tank e g the daily average pattern and in applying optimization techniques to optimize pump statuses at each time step of operation however ps features a high number of decisional variables equal to the number of pumps present in the station times the number of time steps for the optimization alvisi and franchini 2017 furthermore the implementation of the results of ps yields largely suboptimal solutions resulting in spilling from the tank and high cost of electricity when the generic day of wdn operation differs from that considered in the optimization framework to partly correct the issue of suboptimality at the end of the generic day of system operation forecast techniques could be used to predict outflows in the following day to be used as input for ps however it must be noted that the results of forecast techniques always feature some degree of uncertainty which results once more in problems of suboptimality quintiliani and creaco 2019 as an alternative option to ps remote feedback rtc can be used to regulate tank filling this consists of switching on and off the pumps present in a pumping station as a function of the water level in the tank the two point control is applied in this context numerical optimizations are used to optimize on off trigger levels for each pump to minimize the daily pumping cost and other variables such as the number of pump switches or the time lag between two successive switches if a system of pumps in parallel feeds a tank pump on off trigger levels must be optimized in such a way that the tank level always lies between a minimum and a maximum level the on trigger level is a suitably low level in the tank in correspondence to when the generic pump is set on conversely the off trigger level is a suitably high level in correspondence to when the pump is set off the key features of the main contributions in the context of rtc of fixed speed pumps for tank filling are summarized in table 3 the simplest method fixed trigger levels ftls for the rtc of pumps lies in setting for each pump the on and off trigger levels as constant values in the whole day paschke et al 2001 as an improvement of the ftls method various authors used the reduced fixed trigger levels rftls e g creaco et al 2016a 2016b marchi et al 2016 in the rftls method the day is assumed to be divided into two or more energy tariff periods peak and off peak periods as regulated by the energy utility in each of which the on and off trigger levels are defined for each pump ultimately the rftls method was conceived to reduce the use of pumps when energy costs more this is accomplished by running the pump s such that the water level in the tank is close to the highest point at the end of the low tariff period i e at the beginning of the peak period and near the minimum desired level at the end of the peak period though being beneficial in terms of pumping costs the rftls method may increase the wear of pumps in fact the pursuit of the beneficial condition described above may require the on off trigger levels for the generic pump to be too close thus overly increasing the number of pump switches to make up for this unpleasant effect alvisi and franchini 2017 proposed variable trigger levels vtls later also used by housh and salomons 2019 in vtls the off trigger level in the off peak period and the on trigger level in the peak period are set constant and equal to the maximum and the minimum acceptable tank water level respectively the two other trigger levels instead are assumed variable in time with a power law to correct the drawbacks of rftls quintiliani and creaco 2019 proposed the rflats methodology where rflats stands for reduced fixed trigger levels with additional time slots in this kind of control additional time slots where trigger levels must be optimized are added immediately before tariff change instants this enables the beneficial condition mentioned above to be obtained without changing trigger levels continuously as in alvisi and franchini 2017 and housh and salomons 2019 and without overly increasing the number of pump switches as in rftls 2 5 service pressure control and energy production maximization using flow control when a wdn district has lower ground elevation than its source node turbines can be used to dissipate pressure surpluses compared to the simple use of prvs this causes larger installation costs which may be paid back in the long run by the production of electrical energy instead of turbines pump as turbines pats i e pumps running in reverse mode carravetta et al 2014 can be used resulting in many advantages including lower cost shorter delivery time easier installation and service availability williams 1996 isbasoiu et al 2007 as some works have shown e g mcnabola et al 2011 samora et al 2016 the combination of pressure control and hydropower generation offers large potential revenues and attractive capital payback periods besides the pat itself a by pass pipe must be installed to convey the flow that is unsuitable for power generation because either it is too small or it exceeds the pat capacity for flow modulation control valves can be installed at both the pat and by pass pipes however if no real time regulation is performed in these control valves the power generation and pressure reduction effects are sub optimal at each time step of the system operation therefore the operation of the pat and control valves can be dynamically improved through rtc to pursue maximization of produced electrical energy while guaranteeing a sufficiently high service pressure downstream in this context fontana et al 2016 developed theoretical and experimental analyses for the operation of a prototype for hydropower generation in wdns the prototype is composed of two parallel lines the generation pipe equipped with a needle valve prv and a pat and the by pass line equipped with a needle valve rtc was implemented to both maximize the power generated by the pat at varying upstream pressure and inflow discharge and ensuring the required pressure at the critical node because the impeller has a constant rotational speed the optimization problem was simply solved by convoying the maximum possible flow through generation pipe while respecting the minimum pressure level at the critical node to this end a two level control strategy was implemented the high level controller which determines pressure drop and flow between the lines and the low level controllers which operate the prvs to obtain the desired set points of pressure and flow a switching control also called bang bang control was used because the needle valves are controlled through a digital signal switching among the three possible inputs open stop close the open command starts the rotation of the motor at a fixed speed in the opening direction the close command starts the rotation in the closing direction and the stop command stops the motor rotation in the experiments the control time step and signal input to the valves were set to be of the order of milliseconds in order to reduce the valve velocity fontana et al 2018c further improved the prototype rtc by maximizing power generation by also varying the rotational speed of the impeller to this end an inverter was added to the prototype the algorithm maintains the two level control strategy but a non trivial optimization problem arises because of two decisional variables namely the maximum possible flow through generation pipe and the rotational speed of the impeller two approaches were proposed to solve in real time the optimization problem in the first the generated power was maximized using a matlab optimization toolbox yalmip which calculates the rotational speed and the discharge in the pat to allow communication between matlab and the plc which operates the prvs and inverter an open platform communication opc standard solution was used the second approach does not require an external optimization module but uses relationships to represent the operation of the pat by means of dimensionless parameters flow number head number and power number numerical and laboratory experiments were also carried out to assess the operation and reliability of the proposed control algorithms preliminary results developed by fontana et al 2018c showed that the control algorithm operates properly under certain operating conditions fontana et al 2019 further validated the effectiveness of the control algorithm carrying out extensive laboratory experiments under different operating conditions in all cases experiments revealed that the prototype s operation showed robust behavior without instabilities also when abrupt flow discharge and set point pressure variation occurred 3 a real case study this case study is taken from the work of fontana et al 2018b which describes the application of rtc in benevento a medium size city of regione campania campania region in southern italy with a population of around 60 000 inhabitants fig 2 the wdn managed by the ge se sa water company is divided into 30 district meters areas dmas for improved leakage control at the inlet of each dma a prv and a flow meter are installed to ensure flow measurement and pressure control over the district a control system for pressure rtc was installed in one district of the network the control system was installed in the santa colomba district and has been operating since september 2016 the total length of main pipes within the district is around 8 4 km fig 3 with nominal diameters nd ranging between 50 mm and 250 mm the network serves around 2800 properties with a total population of about 8600 inhabitants the area served is fairly even with elevation ranging between 122 m above sea level asl and 135 m asl in the southern part of the district a few nodes have higher elevation up to 155 m asl preliminary field measurements and hydraulic analysis identified the critical node see fig 3 where a minimum pressure has to be guaranteed 3 1 equipment and communication system pressure transducers are installed at the monitored node and both upstream and downstream of the prv at the dma inlet an electromagnetic flow meter mod g2 pmag was also installed the pressure at the inlet was remotely regulated using a prv with motorized pilot the prv is a pilot operated bermad valve mod en 720 4se vi nominal diameter 150 mm the valve is hydraulically operated by means of a diaphragm actuator which reduces the upstream pressure to a lower constant downstream pressure pressure regulation is independent of upstream pressure and flow discharge the prv is equipped with a motorized pilot with input voltage v ranging between 0 v and 10 v by varying v an actuator compresses or stretches the pilot spring thus varying the outlet pressure h d an input voltage of 0 v corresponds to the maximum outlet pressure whereas an input voltage of 10 v corresponds to the minimum outlet pressure i e closed valve input voltage to the prv is commanded by a plc which is installed in an electric panel at the dma inlet the plc allowed acquisition of inflow discharge and the pressures upstream and downstream of the prv as well a point i o associated with the plc is also installed at the critical node for pressure acquisition during the installation stage the communication between the point i o and the plc was a relevant issue because of the distance in between being in the order of 3 5 km and with urbanization of the area causing a lack of visibility between the points the point i o has to communicate with the plc to transmit in real time the acquired pressure thus driving the regulation of the prv gsm global system for mobile communications gprs general packet radio service transmission is used to assume effective and reliable communication between point i o and plc thus a modem was mounted at both the plc and the point i o a triangle based scheme was considered for communication i e the modems do not establish a point to point connection such a scheme can connect a scada system for high level process supervisory management fig 4 a server was installed at ge se sa offices receiving the data from the modems on site i e the modem close to the monitored node and the modem close to the district inlet which signal data on measured critical pressure head and entering water discharge in the dma respectively the server then sends the data to the plc which process them to evaluate actuator setting corrections 3 2 controller for rtc a pure integral controller was used for the regulation of the prv as proposed by fontana et al 2018a b unlike a proportional action the integral controller introduces a filtering action on pressure measurement thus eliminating the effects of high frequency pressure variations due to user demand as a result the prv reacts more slowly in the order of minutes to pressure variations at the critical node but is totally consistent with the operation of a wdn the finite delay between the time at which the signal is sent to the prv and the time at which the effects of such a regulation are measured downstream at the critical node was also considered in the controller s design such a delay may cause oscillations and even instabilities in pressure control especially for larger values of the gain to this end the smith s predictor was implemented thus improving the performance of the controller preliminary laboratory experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the adopted solution fontana et al 2018a 3 3 measurements from the field some measurements were carried out in the field to assess the effectiveness of the pressure rtc and compare the benefits against a traditional pressure control in a wdn fig 5 shows the experimental pattern at the critical node during a 3 day interval considering a traditional pressure regulation by setting a constant input signal to the prv so as to guarantee a minimum pressure close to 18 m b rtc with a set point pressure of 20 m at the critical node and c rtc with a set point pressure of 18 m at the critical node results show in case of rtc a quite regular pressure pattern with negligible deviations from the set point value fig 5 the benefits of such a control are evident especially during night hours because a significant pressure regulation can be performed against a fixed prv thus reducing pressure over the network rtc also ensures a lower and more regular pressure pattern within the whole wdn experiments showed a reduction in both fluctuation amplitude and standard deviation indicating a lower variability of pressure over time the effectiveness of the rtc was also assessed in terms of leakage reduction within the wdn minimum night flow mnf was measured at the network inlet showing a decrement by approximately 1 l s when rtc was applied in comparison with the case of prv regulation in the absence of rtc 4 discussions compared to static control in which actuator settings are not dynamically modified in time rtc has undisputed beneficial effects but features larger installation and operational costs while investigating the economics of rtc to control pressure creaco and walski 2017 2018 found that the benefits of rtc where greatest in large pressure zones where the variable operating and maintenance costs energy chemicals of lost water is very high the number of continuously running leaks is large and the demand showed significant variations over the course of the day local rtc was generally more economical than remote rtc because only one vault was required and no communication cost was involved but remote rtc was the best technology for responding to unusual events fire shutdowns in the system sensors for remote rtc could be located at critical customers e g hospitals key factories instead of at the inflow to the zone in most of the research papers on rtc providing minimum acceptable pressure is an objective in order to reduce leakage and pipe breaks as well as to contribute to extending infrastructure life however providing a target pressure above the minimal has benefits in terms of customer satisfaction less need to pump in taller buildings better performance by fire and irrigation sprinklers better fire flow through hydrants and greater margin of safety to prevent intrusion during emergencies in many cases the expected benefits pay back the larger installation costs in a sustainable time frame a survey has revealed that rtc is now employed in many real world wdns in most cases the configuration described in the section entitled a real case study featuring a prv with setting regulated in real time to guarantee desired pressure head values at the remotely controlled node s is the favorite one the installation of rtc typically follows wdn partitioning into dmas with the objective to monitor wdn consumption and leakage and to regulate service pressure as an additional example well documented in the scientific literature there is the city of denizli e g see güngör et al 2019 in western turkey in which the prv based rtc configuration is effectively operating in one of the dmas of the wdn like the real rtc application described above the transfer of data is carried out through the gsm gprs transmission and a scada system is used for high level process supervisory management conversely the setting of the prv is regulated locally as a function of the water discharge 5 conclusions the literature review of the works on rtc in wdns has highlighted the following aspects 1 all works have proven that rtc is highly beneficial in many contexts such as service pressure control tank level regulation and optimization of hydroelectric energy production 2 service pressure control through valves is by far the most investigated topic 3 regrettably the number of numerical works largely exceeds that of experimental works in most cases the prediction capability of numerical models of rtc has not been corroborated through comparisons with experimental data 4 the number of works reporting about experimental results in real wdns is very small in this review only the papers of fontana et al 2018b janus and ulanicki 2018 güngör et al 2019 which use a prv as an actuator the issues related to points 3 and 4 should drive the future endeavors of the scientific community in fact only by comparison of numerical and experimental results can the marginal benefits of more and more sophisticated rtc algorithms be suitably assessed furthermore the performance of rtc in real case studies need to be analyzed and compared in depth to have better insight into real benefits and limits of this control solution since various water utilities e g in the uk and in northern italy claim that they have been adopting rtc in their wdns researchers ought to get in contact with them to receive useful hints and feedbacks another prospect for rtc could be the extension to aspects of water quality in fact while the rtc of disinfectant residuals has been considered in a few studies e g wang et al 2006 souza and mohan kumar 2018 important issues such as the use of rtc for maneuvering isolation valves to isolate dmas in the case of contamination events have been totally overlooked 
18672,this paper presents a review of the current state of the art of real time control rtc of water distribution networks wdns after proving the basic concept and terms of rtc and presenting sensors regulation devices and controllers typically used in wdns the paper goes on by describing the most frequent control objectives which mainly include service pressure regulation control of tank filling and energy production in each wdn district various control methodologies recently proposed in the scientific literature are presented and discussed along with experimental and numerical results achieved also aspects related to the cost effectiveness of rtc are critically analyzed the paper ends by giving an outlook into potential future developments in the area of rtc for wdns graphical abstract image 1 keywords model based control real time control water distribution valves pumps pump as turbines 1 introduction water distribution networks wdns are complex systems made up of various interconnected nodes and pipes which take water of suitable quality from sources to supply customers in the service area based on the traditional design approach wdns are commonly expected to guarantee effectiveness and acceptable standards of service i e pressure flow quality reliability in most operational scenarios recently forms of real time control rtc of various levels of complexity have been successfully implemented in various case studies in the world to achieve objectives of enhanced quantity quality of the supplied water and more in general to improve the operation of wdns real time control refers to a control time step of minutes or less the control is not manual intermittent or only at specific times in an age when wdn management issues are more and more considered by the managers of water utilities bello et al 2019 a general analysis of the scientific and grey literature shows that at least three valid reasons exist for the implementation of rtc in wdns 1 nowadays supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems as well as internet of things technologies make it easier to monitor levels of applicability 2 results from numerous case studies have proven rtc to have significant potential for improving the operation of wdns 3 rtc enables pursuing water and energy savings the added value of rtc lies in the possibility to use current information about the real status of the system to improve its control thus limiting inaccuracies due to assumptions and hypotheses on its operation about two decades after the publication of the first papers the moment has come to take stock of the situation to highlight benefits and drawbacks of rtc in wdns since there is no literature review in this specific topic conversely state of the art papers were published in the research field of rtc of urban drainage systems schilling 1989 schutze et al 2004 campisano et al 2015 where examples of field implementation are already available starting from the early 60s the aim of this paper is to survey and review the main endeavors of the two most recent decades on the topic of rtc in wdns with emphasis on hydraulics control rationale and costs the paper will offer researchers academics and practitioners who are new to this topic an idea of the rationale for rtc and related technology as well as of its successful implementation in a real case study in the remainder of the paper first the fundamental concepts and terms of rtc and the devices typically used in wdns are presented then control objectives pertinent to wdns are described along with available numerical and experimental results and cost benefit analyses potential for exploitation of such a technology as well as existing technical and economic barriers to its large scale application in real systems are discussed the paper ends by reporting current and future trends of rtc in wdns 1 1 rtc concept and terminology typically many operators of water supply systems use improperly the term control to indicate the result of the monitoring of system parameters i e continuous acquisition of such properties as water levels in reservoirs flows in pipes and network pressure however acquisition of measurements is only one of the stages of the network control which also includes the adjustment of actuators installed in the system based on the collected measurements to intervene in an active way on the distribution process if active control of the system is performed with short time intervals occurring between two successive correction actions i e from the order of some minutes downwards the wdn is said to be controlled dynamically in real time e g see prescott and ulanicki 2008 and campisano et al 2010 therefore the rtc of wdns requires implementation of hardware elements in the network such as various types of sensors and actuators controllers and data transmission systems a sensor is a device that measures a physical property of the process to be controlled an actuator is a device by which a control system acts upon the process a controller is a device recently in the form of a microprocessor or computer that calculates the suitable corrections of the actuator setting for influencing the process based on a preset rationale data transmission systems are physical and unphysical interconnections that enable the exchange of data between the various element of the control system let us assume a process needs to be monitored and controlled in real time in a wdn furthermore let us assume that at the initial time the process variable of interest also called controlled variable is at its desired set point value due to the presence of disturbances such as variations in source pressure heads and or in nodal demands the variable of interest will tend to deviate from its set point a sensor is present to measure the controlled variable then the measurement acquired through the sensor is signaled to the controller at prefixed temporal steps through data processing the controller estimates how the actuator setting must be dynamically adjusted to minimize the current deviation of the controlled variable from the desired set point value finally the controller s correction is signaled to the actuator which is adjusted accordingly at every control time step connections between sensor actuator and controller are obtained through the data transmission system based on leased dedicated telephone lines or on wireless communication systems such as radio cellular systems or satellite telecommunication devices and so forth the process control described above can usually be schematized by means of a control loop fig 1 corrective actions can consist of discrete actions such as turning a pump on or off or fully opening or closing a valve in other cases they can consist of continuous adjustments in valve closure setting or pump speed set point can be constant or time dependent the succession of set points on time is called control strategy sometimes a deadband is used around the set point to which no corrective actions correspond this is done to prevent oscillation or repeated activation deactivation cycles of the actuator the loop control outlined in fig 1 can be carried out in different modalities feedback control loops calculate actuator corrections based on the measured deviation of the controlled process from the set point in feedforward control actuator corrections are calculated based on the deviation predicted for the near future by means of a simplified model of the process feedback feedforward control loops are combinations of the first two modalities 1 2 rtc system architecture the choice of the architecture of the rtc system conceptually the organization of its components is an important step for obtaining a high performance of the system campisano et al 2016 there is no unique best choice of architecture that could be recommended to fit any rtc application to wdns because implementation of control systems always faces different site specific challenges stinson et al 2006 however in general depending on the network topology and complexity the rtc system architecture can be local or global in the first case process measurements are taken by a sensor probe directly locally at the actuator site in which only one actuator is usually present an example of this architecture is represented by the pump switch on off based on the local water level measurement into the pump tank or a pressure control valve which hydraulically throttles the flow and attenuates downstream service pressure in the second case that is the most common for large networks various sensors and actuators are typically present in the system the measurements taken at all the sensor sites are signaled to a central control room which globally operates the different actuators in a coordinated way in most cases the sensor and actuator can communicate directly but can be overridden by the control room typically global rtc implies the implementation of remote control thus requiring various levels of sophistication of the transmission system intermediate architectures all based on remote control can be implemented for relatively large systems where measurements from a single remote sensor are used to adjust the settings of one single control or more multiple control actuators berardi et al 2017 this is for example the case of one pressure gauge in the downstream network used to control one or more upstream pressure valves e g see campisano et al 2016 conversely depending on the rtc objective the system design can consider architectures characterized by a single actuator controlled based on measurements received from several remote sensors distributed in the network the control of the network can have different degrees of automation it can be manual supervisory or automatic in the first case actuators are adjusted based on decisions of human operators who compare controlled variables to set points in the second case automatic controllers propose corrections to supervising operators who can still modify them based on their expertise in the last case the control is fully automatized though manual override can be carried out in the case of an emergency 1 3 sensors actuators and controllers for wdns principal requirements for rtc sensors in wdns are measurement accuracy and reliability accompanied by the suitability for continuous recording and remote transmission although necessary for implementing robust rtc systems sensor requirements are less stringent than those used for urban drainage systems where long term sensor resistance to the harsh environment of sewer networks is also required schutze et al 2004 campisano et al 2015 a certain degree of redundancy in the wdn is also required to increase the system s resilience to unexpected events determining sensors malfunctioning with potential loss of data and subsequent deterioration of the control action on the actuators puig et al 2016 some concepts of fault detection in wdns are provided in the following subsection main sensors used include water level gauges such as floating hydrometers bubblers pressure inductive gauges and sonic gauges to be typically installed in tanks to monitor water levels pressure sensors such as piezoresistive capacitive electromagnetic piezoelectric and optical gauges normally installed at demand nodes control valve inlet outlet and pump suction discharge to monitor pressure heads flow meters such as optical flow sensors electromagnetic or ultrasound flow meters in addition to the pressure based meters e g venturi meter and pitot tube electromagnetic and ultrasound flow meters may also be able to correct for varying pressure and temperature i e density conditions and for non linearities flow meters can be installed at wdn pipes and at users connections to monitor flows and consumption respectively traditional mechanical meters e g woltman and current meter for volumetric measurements usually when used in the context of rtc flow meters are installed to monitor flow at key pipes in the wdn such as the feeding pipes of district metered areas dmas in the case of flow meters a very small sampling period order of magnitude down to 1 s is used for acquiring the reading volumetric meters are used instead at user connections with a higher sampling period order of magnitude down to some minutes while measurements can be taken locally at a high frequency they may be communicated back to the control room at a polling interval which may be 15 min or an hour in this case they have report on exception which will call in at when a trigger level is hit actuators in wdns include pumps axial or screw with constant or variable speed to be installed along wdn pipes to increase head control valves that have a mechanical actuator such as plunger globe piston and butterfly valves to be installed along wdn pipes to modulate control flow valves that have a spring controlled actuator such as the pressure reducing valves prvs to be installed along wdn pipes to reduce the input upstream time varying pressure head to a steady output downstream value turbines or pumps as turbines pats to be installed along wdn pipes to enable conversion of the surplus of total head into electrical energy if the range of flow in the valve fitted pipe is large and the valve is sized to provide full demand when it is fully open the valve may need to be substantially closed almost fully closed during low flow times e g during night hours under such conditions the potential occurrence of cavitation must be assessed in the system design phase and anti cavitation devices such as anti cavitation buckets can be installed to prevent this phenomenon around the valve seat the control loop shown in fig 1 is the basic element of any rtc system and specifically in wdns the manipulation of the actuators is entrusted to controllers or control units digital control units such as programmable logic controllers plcs or remote terminal units rtus are used in the case of automatic control globally rtus and plcs have similar potentialities thus including data acquisition pre processing filtering validation check for status temporary storage of data calculation power as well as high connectivity for data exchange with a central station campisano et al 2015 in the control room a scada system can manage all incoming and outgoing data alarms are generated here and operators can monitor and control processes e g change of setpoints in addition the scada system can enable additional information to be used for automatically executing the control for example by incorporating additional validation steps beyond the basic controller logic some validation steps may use real time dynamic hydraulic modelling of the wdn abu mahfouz et al 2019 though the functionalities of plcs and rtus overlap with each other an rtu is a microprocessor controlled electronic device that interfaces objects in the physical world to a distributed control system or scada system by transmitting telemetry data to the system and or altering the state of connected objects based on control messages received from the system instead a plc is basically a digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes in fact rtus tend to be used more for wide geographic telemetry while plcs are best suited for local area control plcs and rtus can be programmed according to a specific rationale in order to achieve the optimal control of the actuator rules algorithms are implemented with the output correction signal being typically based on the current deviation between the measured value of the monitored variable and its setpoint schilling 1989 two options are commonly preferred in wdns the first option is the discrete two point or on off control most frequently applied when only two settings are available for the actuator on off or open closed this is the case with a constant speed pump controlled to fill a tank in the case of continuous control of the actuator pid proportional integral derivative algorithms and related simplifications e g p pi pd can be adopted a controller based on the pid logic calculates at prefixed control time steps deviation of the record from the set point and provides proportional p integral i and derivative d corrective contributes to adjust the actuator results from the literature have shown pid controllers to perform properly for accurate water level control in storage tanks e g kumar and kumar 2009 and for remote rtc of valves for pressure control in wdns e g prescott and ulanicki 2008 pid controllers have been successfully used also for the real time control of water quality including for example chlorine residual control in wdns wang et al 2006 souza and mohan kumar 2018 although pid algorithms have shown reliability and ease of implementation with use of industrial plcs calibration of such systems is needed to provide high performing control actions with sufficiently fast achievement of the set point without risks of oscillations of the controlled variable i e periodic oscillation of the controlled variable around the designed set point to be achieved ziegler nichols 1942 tyreus luyben 1992 cohen coon 1953 åström hägglund 1984 in the context of pressure control in wdns controllers were also proposed starting from simple physical considerations on network behavior e g creaco and franchini 2013 remarkably forecast techniques can also be used with controllers to estimate the future state of the system in order to obtain feedforward control page et al 2017a 2017b creaco 2017 page and creaco 2019 a significant aspect of a physically based controller is that it often can be formulated to have no tunable parameter i e is parameter free these controllers have been studied numerically by creaco et al 2017 giustolisi et al 2017 berardi et al 2017 page et al 2017a 2017b 2018 and page and creaco 2019 a parameter free controller can often be used initially and a related controller which has a tunable parameter can then be used by slowly changing the parameter away from its initial value to improve the control page et al 2018 1 4 quality of measurements and fault detection the good quality of sensor measurements is an essential prerequisite for the success of rtc therefore fault detection must be implemented to guarantee the reliability of rtc systems puig 2009 nowadays numerous statistical process control spc methods are available for the detection of faulty measurements venkatasubramanian et al 2003a b c including univariate methods like control charts schraa et al 2006 and multivariate methods e g based on principal component analysis pca rosen and lennox 2001 yoo et al 2006 the main difference between univariate and multivariate methods lies in the fact that the former process the measurements obtained from a single sensor checking the acceptability of their measurement noise the latter instead check this acceptability based on the interrelation with other measured signals if the same variable is measured by multiple sensors at the same time a confidence interval can be created to diagnose faulty measurements in the generic sensor off line measurements can be used as reference to validate on line measurements in this context non zero residuals are allowed as long as they are small and normally distributed if a reference measurement is available shewhart control charts checking measurements falling beyond a three sigma limit can be used to detect drift shift and outlier effects thomann et al 2002 alternatively residuals can be analyzed under the assumption of errors being represented like random variables with zero mean and constant variance homoscedasticity standard statistical tests searching for serial dependency or autocorrelation can be used to evaluate this property and detect potential sensor faults dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 in the case of measurements available from multiple e g three sensors for a generic controlled variable the operation of the rtc system may be as follows an alert message is given in the presence of an outlier in the controlled variable at a certain time of the day if the actuator setting at that time of the day is close to those in the previous days at the same time and if the outlier is present only in one of the sensors installed for monitoring the controlled variable the outlier is associated with poor quality data therefore the operation of the rtc system may go on ignoring this outlier and relying on the measurements from the other sensors otherwise if the actuator setting is different from those in the previous days at the same time and the multiple sensors agree on the measurement of the controlled variable this may be classified as an anomalous event in the system controlled in real time indeed this may happen when the forcing conditions of the system are significantly different from those expected at that time of the day like when the overall demand of the wdn suddenly increases due to the opening of one or more hydrants for firefighting or to a pipe burst 2 control objectives 2 1 service pressure control service pressure in wdn must be high enough to enable users full demand satisfaction when it falls below a desired threshold which may be a function of building height the wdn cannot supply all users with requested flows therefore at nodes experiencing pressure deficits the distributed flow becomes lower than the demand ciaponi et al 2015 conversely excessive service pressure has various negative impacts such as the increase in leakage and pipe bursts and the reduction in infrastructure life vicente et al 2016 hence comes the advisability of regulating controlling service pressure in real time to reduce it and keep it close to the desired pressure threshold which is assumed to be the set point value in the regulation process rtc can be conveniently performed independently at each district metered area dma if the wdn is divided into dmas specifically if the district has lower ground elevations compared to the feeding source regulation can be performed via control valves to dissipate pressure surpluses conversely if it has higher ground elevations it can be performed via variable speed pumps vsps this is the case with closed distribution systems with no storage capacity walski and creaco 2016 page et al 2018 in both the cases of control valves and vsps device settings are adjusted in real time to lead the controlled pressure head to the set point value under various operating conditions of the district the use of rtc can reduce leakage while fully satisfying demand 2 2 rtc of control valves in the presence of pressure surplus a large scientific literature exists concerning the dynamic regulation of service pressure in water distribution systems in this framework research efforts were dedicated to proving its better performance in comparison with the use of static prvs and of control valves actuated with no feedback from the wdn in fact abdelmeguid et al 2011 and creaco and walski 2018 showed the benefits obtained by using instead of the static prv a prv locally controlled in real time as a function of the flowing water discharge these authors proved that a locally controlled prv enables larger service pressure abatements in the wdn with beneficial effects in terms of leakage reduction these benefits increase when remote control as a function of the pressure head at the critical node in the dma is implemented instead of local control e g berardi et al 2017 creaco and walski 2018 furthermore campisano et al 2010 proved that compared to valve regulation based on the results obtained by applying optimization algorithms to the average daily pattern of demands araujo et al 2006 with no feedback from the current wdn status control valve regulation in real time has better flexibility under time varying water demand conditions furthermore other efforts were spent mainly on the development of increasingly efficient algorithms for rtc of service pressure through control valves while in most situations the pursuit of very high performance in the control may be unjustified considering the slow demand variations occurring in wdns the rapid response of the controller is needed to react to large and rapid changes in flow in fact the combination of transients and slow response can lead to undesirable pressure fluctuations large and rapid changes in flow may take place in the following cases a large industry needs a lot of water quickly and then goes back to low use for example filling of a batch mixing tank for some process fire fighters quickly open close hydrants even though they are trained not to operators quickly open close valves hydrants for flushing flow testing shutdowns even though they should know not to even better than fire fighters a pump to a higher pressure zone wholesale customer is turned on off without a slow closing operating control valve or soft start vfd a summary of the key features of the works dedicated to algorithm development is available in table 1 which also reports if each work has dealt with the issue of stability analysis i e the analysis of occurrence of permanent oscillations in actuator setting and controlled variable due to the overreactive response of the actuator an early example of local rtc comes from prescott and ulanicki 2008 who analyzed numerically the feedback control of pressure reducing valves at very small time steps order of magnitude of milliseconds the objective of the study was to investigate the interaction between mechanically actuated prvs and water network transients unsteady flow network models incorporating random pulsed demands were combined with a behavioral prv model to demonstrate how the response of the system to changes in demand can produce large or persistent pressure variations similar to those seen in practical experiments a pid control system to replace the existing prv hydraulic controller was proposed and this alternative controller was shown to significantly improve the network response in numerical and field applications as a development of the work of prescott and ulanicki 2008 abdelmeguid et al 2011 developed the aquai mod controller which aims to modulate the prv outlet pressure according to the valve flow in their work the authors constructed a numerical model of the prv and controller and validated it through experiments in a laboratory rig the first attempt to explore benefits of introducing remote feedback rtc for pressure control valves in wdns is provided in campisano et al 2010 the objective of the described rtc system was to reduce pressure surplus and leakage in the network to achieve such an objective the authors suggested assuming as controlled node the node with the lowest pressure head in the wdn district or some critical customer in this node the pressure head is assumed to be monitored in continuous and the average value of the pressure is transmitted to the valve site at prefixed control time steps minutes p controllers were assumed to calculate the valve settings as a function of the deviation of actual pressure value from the set point the wdn behavior was analyzed through the extended period simulation in which transients are neglected the results of the simulations proved the rtc system to enable proper pressure control with leakage reduction while meeting the conditions for full demand satisfaction in the daily operation of the wdn while sticking to the same simulation framework as campisano et al 2010 campisano et al 2012 developed through the dimensionless approach a method for the calibration of p controllers in wdns the numerical applications proved that p controllers calibrated through this method have a fast response with no occurrence of permanent oscillations around the set point which are the sign of instability in the control this method can be used by practitioners as an alternative option to other well established techniques ziegler nichols 1942 tyreus luyben 1992 cohen and coon 1953 åström and hägglund 1984 from industrial control engineering using a similar numerical model to campisano et al 2010 creaco and franchini 2013 showed better controller performances including attenuated pressure head oscillations around the set point can be obtained if the proportional control logic is replaced with a new logic which makes use of measurements concerning both the pressure head at the controlled node and the water discharge in the pipe fitted with the control valve this new physically based logic evaluates the valve setting adjustment starting from the pressure head deviation based on physical considerations on steady states in the wdn in fact it aims to correct the valve head loss coefficient as a function of measured water discharge and pressure head deviation the adjusted valve setting is obtained starting from the adjusted head loss coefficient by using the relationship between head loss coefficient and valve setting provided by the manufacturer by making use of the software wdnetxl giustolisi et al 2017 presented the numerical comparison of three kinds of controllers for pressure rtc specifically the p controllers of campisano et al 2010 the physically based controller of creaco and franchini 2013 operating on valve resistance and a novel physically based controller operating on the head loss across the control valve the results of their work proved the superiority of the physically based controllers with a slight predominance of their novel controller however for the novel controller the authors did not provide any closed form expressions for estimating the suitable setting correction for the control valve at the generic control time step page et al 2017a implemented water discharge prediction through a linear relationship inside the physically based controller of creaco and franchini 2013 the resulting controller is parameter free and of feedback feedforward kind in fact the suitable actuator setting correction at the generic time step is estimated based on variables at the old time pressure head deviation at the controlled node and water discharge in the valve fitted pipe and on the forecasted water discharge at the new time the results of the numerical work of page et al 2017a proved the controller to be stable and responsive under smooth demand conditions in the wdn a field oriented methodology to evaluate benefits of pressure rtc to reduce leakage by pressure control valves in wdn was tested by campisano et al 2016 the paper introduced modalities for addressing the selection of the proper rtc system architecture based on the network connectivity at the valve sites criteria for target node identification and rtc strategy selection in case of single control one valve one target node and multiple control multiple valve one target node architectures were developed the impact on the control performance of controller calibration and on communication protocol selection procedures was also explored the methodology was applied to a norwegian wdn in which the installation of a field pilot rtc system is in progress in order to overcome the limitations of results obtained using eps creaco et al 2017 investigated the potential of unsteady flow modelling for the simulation of remote feedback rtc of pressure in wdns performed through the algorithm of creaco and franchini 2013 the applications concerned a skeletonized wdn in which random pulsed nodal demands had been generated though a stochastic model for pulsed demand compared to eps the unsteady flow model proved to provide sounder description of the amplitude of the pressure head variations at the controlled node furthermore it facilitates identification of the suitable control time step to be adopted for obtaining a prompt and effective regulation nevertheless eps based models are enough to provide quite accurate estimates of daily leakage and of valve setting patterns at a much smaller computational cost a similar unsteady flow model was used by creaco et al 2018 to analyze numerically the behavior of remotely controlled valves in comparison with prv during hydrant activation scenarios for firefighting in fact these scenarios deserve attention due to the inherent high flow conditions which are very different from usual operational scenarios the model was applied to a skeletonized wdn model in which a prv and an rtc valve were alternatively been assumed to be installed at the pipe connecting the source node to the remainder of the wdn the results highlighted the better capability of rtc of controlling service pressure at the critical node and therefore in the whole wdn pressure deficits occur in the presence of the prv which is not able to sense the pressure signal from the remote critical node the larger service pressure occurring with rtc results in beneficially larger outflows from the hydrants operated in the wdn creaco et al 2018 also investigated numerically the issue of rtc stability showing that the parameter of the control logic of creaco and franchini 2013 must not overcome a threshold to prevent control instability by working numerically with eps creaco 2017 developed a generalization of the control logic of creaco and franchini 2013 for the remote rtc of control valves compared to the work of page et al 2017a the author developed a fully feedforward controller in which the suitable actuator setting correction at the generic time step is estimated only as a function of forecasted variables at the new time namely pressure head deviation at the controlled node and water discharge in the valve fitted pipe the author applied his controller to the eps of a skeletonized wdn with random pulsed nodal demands averaged over the control time step this marks an important difference from the work of page et al 2017a bringing numerical simulation closer to the real behavior of wdns a related study to that of creaco 2017 not only discussed the derivation of the various physically based controllers in one place page and creaco 2019 but also showed how the water discharge prediction in page et al 2017a can be improved in the presence of random pulsed nodal demands the results of the applications highlighted that the new logic yields advantages in terms of closeness of controlled variable to set point and of total variation of the device setting above all when the water discharge pattern features contained random fluctuations and large hourly variations fontana et al 2018a discussed the theoretical framework of rtc of a prv for pressure regulation in a wdn the authors identified a simplified dynamic model of a hydraulically operated prv and developed a controller for closed loop regulation of the pressure at any given monitored node basically the regulation of pressure at any node is obtained by dynamically modifying the outlet pressure of the prv this marks a difference from the remote rtc described above where the remote control is obtained by operating on valve closure setting fontana et al 2018a showed that a pure p controller is unable to control pressure at any node with a prv because an error between set point pressure and controlled pressure head should be present in order to generate the control signal to set the downstream pressure a zero error would imply zero input signal regardless of the desired downstream pressure whereas an integral controller block can have a nonzero constant output with a zero error i e at steady state the integral term can cause overshooting of the system but it may be accepted if the relative extent thereof with respect to the desired step does not exceed some value and the set point value is rapidly achieved they also discussed the issues e g stability arising from rtc of the pressure at a monitored node a finite delay may generate oscillations and even instability therefore smaller values of gains should be chosen or the smith s predictor should be added to the controller fontana et al 2018a b also discussed laboratory and field experiments to show the reliability of algorithms and equipment for rtc of pressure in a wdn laboratory experiments demonstrated the controller s ability to regulate pressure at the monitored node the integrator gain was varied to identify the best trade off between transient duration and stability of regulation and issues related to transport delays were analyzed showing that oscillations and instabilities may arise in real environment for large gain values field experiments showed the effectiveness of the equipment communication architecture and algorithm for pressure control in real environment an integral controller was used to account for the high variability of pressure at the monitored node coupled to the smith s predictor because of the distance between prv and controlled node the controller resulted quite effective guaranteeing very stable regulation without oscillations and instabilities compared to the previous works the main merit of janus and ulanicki 2018 was to propose a solution to tackle the occurrence of instabilities in the rtc of prvs through pid units the authors took inspiration from an instability event recorded in a large scale pressure control scheme in one of the major cities in the united kingdom in fact if the valve controller is tuned at medium valve openings characteristic of normal operating conditions the increased gain at low valve openings can cause the control system to be too reactive in its valve position adjustments leading to oscillations as a remedy they carried out a numerical investigation to show that instabilities can be prevented by implementing gain compensation inside the pid control a more formal and comprehensive analysis of instability was performed by galuppini et al 2019b who applied tools and methodologies of control system theory to analyze both nominal and robust stability of rtc algorithms the authors showed that due to the nonlinearity of the gain of the process under control it is advisable to base the regulator design on high order models which better describe the dynamics of the process around the working point otherwise wide robustness margins must be provided in the design of the feedback system for this purpose it is shown that the introduction of a low pass filter and a smith predictor can significantly improve the robustness of the control scheme while at the same time helping to reduce the cost of control galuppini et al 2019a investigated numerically the benefits of considering the dynamic behavior of the wdn in the set up of rtc algorithms in comparison with the algorithm developed by creaco and franchini 2013 based on physical considerations on the steady state behavior of the system specifically the authors applied a pi controller a filtered pi controller and a linear quadratic gaussian controller in two wdns though increasing the number and size of actuator setting adjustments all control algorithms improve the state of the art in terms of regulation error in presence of pulsed nodal demand on average the reduction in the regulation error added up to about 40 therefore the adoption of these algorithms is advisable in all cases when the more rapid wearing of the control valve is not a limiting factor 2 3 rtc of variable speed pumps in the presence of pressure deficits compared to control valves the applications to vsps supplying water to closed distribution systems are less numerous in this context some research efforts e g walski and creaco 2016 showed that the installation of vsps at dma inlets may be beneficial in terms of long run operational costs in fact besides the same kind of pressure reduction benefits as that obtained with control valves the use of vsps in lieu of fixed speed pumps enables reduction in the consumption of electric energy and as a result in the water utility s expenses this has been tested in small scale experimental test beds which perform rtc to control the pressure remotely with vsps these studies found the following deceases in the electrical energy used by the vsps relative to a fixed speed pump 35 03 bezerra et al 2012 19 23 silva et al 2015 66 2 filho et al 2018 other contributions concern the set up of controllers see table 2 using a similar approach to page et al 2017a page et al 2017b developed a physically based controller for vsps this controller is parameter free and of feedback feedforward kind in fact the suitable correction in pump speed at the generic time step is estimated based on variables at the old time pressure head deviation at the controlled node and water discharge in the vsp fitted pipe and on the forecasted water discharge at the new time like the controller of page et al 2017a for control valves the controller of page et al 2017b for vsps proved stable and responsive under smooth demand conditions in the wdn using the same approach as for the control valve creaco 2017 also developed a feedforward controller for vsps which evaluates pump speed correction as a function of the forecasted water discharge in the vsp fitted pipe and of the forecasted pressure deviation at the controlled node as mentioned above a merit of the work of creaco 2017 lies in accounting for random pulsed nodal demands the author remarked that in the case of the vsp the oscillations of the controlled variable caused by the pulsed nature of demands are smaller especially under low demand conditions compared to the control valve this is because the pump tends to dampen the effects of water discharge variations better than the valve especially under low demand conditions which require high valve closures and low pump speeds simplified physically based controllers which do not use a forecasted water discharge have also been formulated by page et al 2017b the tendency of oscillations of the controlled variable to be small due to pulsed demand variation was also observed for these controllers page et al 2018 several studies reported experimental remote rtc investigations using a small laboratory testbed that models a wdn these studies do not use physically based controllers but provide valuable insight into the experimental performance and stability of controllers on a time scale of seconds or milliseconds various studies were done for a single vsp first a controller using fuzzy logic was studied bezerra et al 2012 fuzzy logic is an attempt at the formalization and mechanization of the human capability to make rational decisions second both pid and an enhancement called active disturbance rejection control adrc was compared madonski et al 2014 adrc improves the performance of a classical feedback controller for example pid by adding a disturbance observer that reconstructs and rejects the unwanted perturbation in the system in each control cycle another related approach was used by filho et al 2018 and de araújo moura et al 2018 who proposed a feedback controller based on artificial neural networks ann the actuator was either two identical vsps in parallel filho et al 2018 or a single vsp de araújo moura et al 2018 training was done based on laboratory experiments through the descending gradient filho et al 2018 or levenberg marquardt de araújo moura et al 2018 backpropagation algorithms for both studies the controllers proved stable and robust in the testing phase the controller in filho et al 2018 incorporates the minimization of the measured electrical power use of the two vsps for low demand it is found that only one of the two identical vsps needs to operate however as the demand increases both vsps start to operate with each at the same pump speed this work also shows that the controller is robust under disturbances which occur when the pumps switch the various studies that do not use physically based controllers have almost entirely been carried out by related authors a gap in the literature is that these authors need to provide clarity on which of the many controllers they proposed performs the best furthermore comparison to a state of the art physically based controller would be invaluable 2 4 water level control if the wdn is gravity fed by tanks open distribution systems pumps are typically used to re fill the tanks by pumping water from source s unlike closed distribution systems in this case pumps are required to fill tanks in a reasonable time period with no need to regulate pump speed indeed pump on off switches need to be optimized to minimize the daily cost of electricity and the wear of the pumps and motors which depends on various variables such the number of pump switches in the context of tank filling the traditional approach considered in the scientific literature for the optimization of pump on off switches is pump scheduling ps for which an extensive literature review was carried out by mala jetmarova et al 2018 this approach lies in considering a historical pattern of outflows from the tank e g the daily average pattern and in applying optimization techniques to optimize pump statuses at each time step of operation however ps features a high number of decisional variables equal to the number of pumps present in the station times the number of time steps for the optimization alvisi and franchini 2017 furthermore the implementation of the results of ps yields largely suboptimal solutions resulting in spilling from the tank and high cost of electricity when the generic day of wdn operation differs from that considered in the optimization framework to partly correct the issue of suboptimality at the end of the generic day of system operation forecast techniques could be used to predict outflows in the following day to be used as input for ps however it must be noted that the results of forecast techniques always feature some degree of uncertainty which results once more in problems of suboptimality quintiliani and creaco 2019 as an alternative option to ps remote feedback rtc can be used to regulate tank filling this consists of switching on and off the pumps present in a pumping station as a function of the water level in the tank the two point control is applied in this context numerical optimizations are used to optimize on off trigger levels for each pump to minimize the daily pumping cost and other variables such as the number of pump switches or the time lag between two successive switches if a system of pumps in parallel feeds a tank pump on off trigger levels must be optimized in such a way that the tank level always lies between a minimum and a maximum level the on trigger level is a suitably low level in the tank in correspondence to when the generic pump is set on conversely the off trigger level is a suitably high level in correspondence to when the pump is set off the key features of the main contributions in the context of rtc of fixed speed pumps for tank filling are summarized in table 3 the simplest method fixed trigger levels ftls for the rtc of pumps lies in setting for each pump the on and off trigger levels as constant values in the whole day paschke et al 2001 as an improvement of the ftls method various authors used the reduced fixed trigger levels rftls e g creaco et al 2016a 2016b marchi et al 2016 in the rftls method the day is assumed to be divided into two or more energy tariff periods peak and off peak periods as regulated by the energy utility in each of which the on and off trigger levels are defined for each pump ultimately the rftls method was conceived to reduce the use of pumps when energy costs more this is accomplished by running the pump s such that the water level in the tank is close to the highest point at the end of the low tariff period i e at the beginning of the peak period and near the minimum desired level at the end of the peak period though being beneficial in terms of pumping costs the rftls method may increase the wear of pumps in fact the pursuit of the beneficial condition described above may require the on off trigger levels for the generic pump to be too close thus overly increasing the number of pump switches to make up for this unpleasant effect alvisi and franchini 2017 proposed variable trigger levels vtls later also used by housh and salomons 2019 in vtls the off trigger level in the off peak period and the on trigger level in the peak period are set constant and equal to the maximum and the minimum acceptable tank water level respectively the two other trigger levels instead are assumed variable in time with a power law to correct the drawbacks of rftls quintiliani and creaco 2019 proposed the rflats methodology where rflats stands for reduced fixed trigger levels with additional time slots in this kind of control additional time slots where trigger levels must be optimized are added immediately before tariff change instants this enables the beneficial condition mentioned above to be obtained without changing trigger levels continuously as in alvisi and franchini 2017 and housh and salomons 2019 and without overly increasing the number of pump switches as in rftls 2 5 service pressure control and energy production maximization using flow control when a wdn district has lower ground elevation than its source node turbines can be used to dissipate pressure surpluses compared to the simple use of prvs this causes larger installation costs which may be paid back in the long run by the production of electrical energy instead of turbines pump as turbines pats i e pumps running in reverse mode carravetta et al 2014 can be used resulting in many advantages including lower cost shorter delivery time easier installation and service availability williams 1996 isbasoiu et al 2007 as some works have shown e g mcnabola et al 2011 samora et al 2016 the combination of pressure control and hydropower generation offers large potential revenues and attractive capital payback periods besides the pat itself a by pass pipe must be installed to convey the flow that is unsuitable for power generation because either it is too small or it exceeds the pat capacity for flow modulation control valves can be installed at both the pat and by pass pipes however if no real time regulation is performed in these control valves the power generation and pressure reduction effects are sub optimal at each time step of the system operation therefore the operation of the pat and control valves can be dynamically improved through rtc to pursue maximization of produced electrical energy while guaranteeing a sufficiently high service pressure downstream in this context fontana et al 2016 developed theoretical and experimental analyses for the operation of a prototype for hydropower generation in wdns the prototype is composed of two parallel lines the generation pipe equipped with a needle valve prv and a pat and the by pass line equipped with a needle valve rtc was implemented to both maximize the power generated by the pat at varying upstream pressure and inflow discharge and ensuring the required pressure at the critical node because the impeller has a constant rotational speed the optimization problem was simply solved by convoying the maximum possible flow through generation pipe while respecting the minimum pressure level at the critical node to this end a two level control strategy was implemented the high level controller which determines pressure drop and flow between the lines and the low level controllers which operate the prvs to obtain the desired set points of pressure and flow a switching control also called bang bang control was used because the needle valves are controlled through a digital signal switching among the three possible inputs open stop close the open command starts the rotation of the motor at a fixed speed in the opening direction the close command starts the rotation in the closing direction and the stop command stops the motor rotation in the experiments the control time step and signal input to the valves were set to be of the order of milliseconds in order to reduce the valve velocity fontana et al 2018c further improved the prototype rtc by maximizing power generation by also varying the rotational speed of the impeller to this end an inverter was added to the prototype the algorithm maintains the two level control strategy but a non trivial optimization problem arises because of two decisional variables namely the maximum possible flow through generation pipe and the rotational speed of the impeller two approaches were proposed to solve in real time the optimization problem in the first the generated power was maximized using a matlab optimization toolbox yalmip which calculates the rotational speed and the discharge in the pat to allow communication between matlab and the plc which operates the prvs and inverter an open platform communication opc standard solution was used the second approach does not require an external optimization module but uses relationships to represent the operation of the pat by means of dimensionless parameters flow number head number and power number numerical and laboratory experiments were also carried out to assess the operation and reliability of the proposed control algorithms preliminary results developed by fontana et al 2018c showed that the control algorithm operates properly under certain operating conditions fontana et al 2019 further validated the effectiveness of the control algorithm carrying out extensive laboratory experiments under different operating conditions in all cases experiments revealed that the prototype s operation showed robust behavior without instabilities also when abrupt flow discharge and set point pressure variation occurred 3 a real case study this case study is taken from the work of fontana et al 2018b which describes the application of rtc in benevento a medium size city of regione campania campania region in southern italy with a population of around 60 000 inhabitants fig 2 the wdn managed by the ge se sa water company is divided into 30 district meters areas dmas for improved leakage control at the inlet of each dma a prv and a flow meter are installed to ensure flow measurement and pressure control over the district a control system for pressure rtc was installed in one district of the network the control system was installed in the santa colomba district and has been operating since september 2016 the total length of main pipes within the district is around 8 4 km fig 3 with nominal diameters nd ranging between 50 mm and 250 mm the network serves around 2800 properties with a total population of about 8600 inhabitants the area served is fairly even with elevation ranging between 122 m above sea level asl and 135 m asl in the southern part of the district a few nodes have higher elevation up to 155 m asl preliminary field measurements and hydraulic analysis identified the critical node see fig 3 where a minimum pressure has to be guaranteed 3 1 equipment and communication system pressure transducers are installed at the monitored node and both upstream and downstream of the prv at the dma inlet an electromagnetic flow meter mod g2 pmag was also installed the pressure at the inlet was remotely regulated using a prv with motorized pilot the prv is a pilot operated bermad valve mod en 720 4se vi nominal diameter 150 mm the valve is hydraulically operated by means of a diaphragm actuator which reduces the upstream pressure to a lower constant downstream pressure pressure regulation is independent of upstream pressure and flow discharge the prv is equipped with a motorized pilot with input voltage v ranging between 0 v and 10 v by varying v an actuator compresses or stretches the pilot spring thus varying the outlet pressure h d an input voltage of 0 v corresponds to the maximum outlet pressure whereas an input voltage of 10 v corresponds to the minimum outlet pressure i e closed valve input voltage to the prv is commanded by a plc which is installed in an electric panel at the dma inlet the plc allowed acquisition of inflow discharge and the pressures upstream and downstream of the prv as well a point i o associated with the plc is also installed at the critical node for pressure acquisition during the installation stage the communication between the point i o and the plc was a relevant issue because of the distance in between being in the order of 3 5 km and with urbanization of the area causing a lack of visibility between the points the point i o has to communicate with the plc to transmit in real time the acquired pressure thus driving the regulation of the prv gsm global system for mobile communications gprs general packet radio service transmission is used to assume effective and reliable communication between point i o and plc thus a modem was mounted at both the plc and the point i o a triangle based scheme was considered for communication i e the modems do not establish a point to point connection such a scheme can connect a scada system for high level process supervisory management fig 4 a server was installed at ge se sa offices receiving the data from the modems on site i e the modem close to the monitored node and the modem close to the district inlet which signal data on measured critical pressure head and entering water discharge in the dma respectively the server then sends the data to the plc which process them to evaluate actuator setting corrections 3 2 controller for rtc a pure integral controller was used for the regulation of the prv as proposed by fontana et al 2018a b unlike a proportional action the integral controller introduces a filtering action on pressure measurement thus eliminating the effects of high frequency pressure variations due to user demand as a result the prv reacts more slowly in the order of minutes to pressure variations at the critical node but is totally consistent with the operation of a wdn the finite delay between the time at which the signal is sent to the prv and the time at which the effects of such a regulation are measured downstream at the critical node was also considered in the controller s design such a delay may cause oscillations and even instabilities in pressure control especially for larger values of the gain to this end the smith s predictor was implemented thus improving the performance of the controller preliminary laboratory experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the adopted solution fontana et al 2018a 3 3 measurements from the field some measurements were carried out in the field to assess the effectiveness of the pressure rtc and compare the benefits against a traditional pressure control in a wdn fig 5 shows the experimental pattern at the critical node during a 3 day interval considering a traditional pressure regulation by setting a constant input signal to the prv so as to guarantee a minimum pressure close to 18 m b rtc with a set point pressure of 20 m at the critical node and c rtc with a set point pressure of 18 m at the critical node results show in case of rtc a quite regular pressure pattern with negligible deviations from the set point value fig 5 the benefits of such a control are evident especially during night hours because a significant pressure regulation can be performed against a fixed prv thus reducing pressure over the network rtc also ensures a lower and more regular pressure pattern within the whole wdn experiments showed a reduction in both fluctuation amplitude and standard deviation indicating a lower variability of pressure over time the effectiveness of the rtc was also assessed in terms of leakage reduction within the wdn minimum night flow mnf was measured at the network inlet showing a decrement by approximately 1 l s when rtc was applied in comparison with the case of prv regulation in the absence of rtc 4 discussions compared to static control in which actuator settings are not dynamically modified in time rtc has undisputed beneficial effects but features larger installation and operational costs while investigating the economics of rtc to control pressure creaco and walski 2017 2018 found that the benefits of rtc where greatest in large pressure zones where the variable operating and maintenance costs energy chemicals of lost water is very high the number of continuously running leaks is large and the demand showed significant variations over the course of the day local rtc was generally more economical than remote rtc because only one vault was required and no communication cost was involved but remote rtc was the best technology for responding to unusual events fire shutdowns in the system sensors for remote rtc could be located at critical customers e g hospitals key factories instead of at the inflow to the zone in most of the research papers on rtc providing minimum acceptable pressure is an objective in order to reduce leakage and pipe breaks as well as to contribute to extending infrastructure life however providing a target pressure above the minimal has benefits in terms of customer satisfaction less need to pump in taller buildings better performance by fire and irrigation sprinklers better fire flow through hydrants and greater margin of safety to prevent intrusion during emergencies in many cases the expected benefits pay back the larger installation costs in a sustainable time frame a survey has revealed that rtc is now employed in many real world wdns in most cases the configuration described in the section entitled a real case study featuring a prv with setting regulated in real time to guarantee desired pressure head values at the remotely controlled node s is the favorite one the installation of rtc typically follows wdn partitioning into dmas with the objective to monitor wdn consumption and leakage and to regulate service pressure as an additional example well documented in the scientific literature there is the city of denizli e g see güngör et al 2019 in western turkey in which the prv based rtc configuration is effectively operating in one of the dmas of the wdn like the real rtc application described above the transfer of data is carried out through the gsm gprs transmission and a scada system is used for high level process supervisory management conversely the setting of the prv is regulated locally as a function of the water discharge 5 conclusions the literature review of the works on rtc in wdns has highlighted the following aspects 1 all works have proven that rtc is highly beneficial in many contexts such as service pressure control tank level regulation and optimization of hydroelectric energy production 2 service pressure control through valves is by far the most investigated topic 3 regrettably the number of numerical works largely exceeds that of experimental works in most cases the prediction capability of numerical models of rtc has not been corroborated through comparisons with experimental data 4 the number of works reporting about experimental results in real wdns is very small in this review only the papers of fontana et al 2018b janus and ulanicki 2018 güngör et al 2019 which use a prv as an actuator the issues related to points 3 and 4 should drive the future endeavors of the scientific community in fact only by comparison of numerical and experimental results can the marginal benefits of more and more sophisticated rtc algorithms be suitably assessed furthermore the performance of rtc in real case studies need to be analyzed and compared in depth to have better insight into real benefits and limits of this control solution since various water utilities e g in the uk and in northern italy claim that they have been adopting rtc in their wdns researchers ought to get in contact with them to receive useful hints and feedbacks another prospect for rtc could be the extension to aspects of water quality in fact while the rtc of disinfectant residuals has been considered in a few studies e g wang et al 2006 souza and mohan kumar 2018 important issues such as the use of rtc for maneuvering isolation valves to isolate dmas in the case of contamination events have been totally overlooked 
18673,the extensive application of biochar bc attracts concerns regarding its environmental effect wastewater treatment systems are potential bc recipients however the impacts of bc on these systems are still unclear in this study effects of bc on the phenol treatment performance and shift in microbial communities in sequencing batch reactor sbr were investigated the phenol degradation rates were enhanced in all bc treated sbrs during the whole operation due to promotion of key enzymes involved in phenol degradation the decrease in abundance of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros in sbrs indicated that bc protected microorganisms by ameliorating phenol toxicity leading to a decrease in the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps the functional groups protein c o co nh polysaccharide c oh c o c c o and nucleic acids o p o associated bonds of eps decreased or disappeared in bc treated sbrs miseq sequencing revealed significant decrease in bacterial diversity and remarkable changes in the bacterial community structure in bc treated sbrs abundances of comamonas and cupriavidus increased significantly upon bc exposure which contributed to phenol degradation treatment with relatively high bc dosage exhibited considerable inhibition on thauera canonical correspondence analysis cca indicated that the shift in abundances of these genera was closely associated with bc dosage this study suggested that bc exerted protective effects on sludge microbes of phenol wastewater treatment systems while it affected the bacterial community structure and diversity at test concentrations thus this study elucidates the comprehensive effects of bc on wastewater treatment process keywords biochar phenol wastewater key enzymes extracellular polymeric substances microbial community 1 introduction biochar bc is carbon rich solid produced by carbonization and or biomass pyrolysis and is derived from straw wood and organic industrial wastes cao et al 2009 2010 ahmad et al 2014 bc is primarily introduced as a soil amendment due to its role in carbon sequestration improvement of soil fertility and reduction of greenhouse effects zhang et al 2017 recently owing to its lower production cost and efficiency in the removal of organic and metal contaminants it is considered to be a viable alternative to activated carbon ac for various wastewater treatment procedures mohan and pittman 2006 2011 inevitably bc will enter various environmental matrices however the potential environmental risks of bc are rarely studied and a comprehensive investigation is needed it has previously been reported that bc is toxic to various organisms such as plants lepidium sativum bacteria vibrio fischeri microbacterium sp brevundimonas diminuta citrobacter freundii and comamonas testosterone etc alga selenastrum capricornutum protozoa tetrahymena thermophila and crustaceans daphnia magna which may be due to the absorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs that are formed during pyrolysis leading to growth inhibition or even mortality of organisms oleszczuk et al 2013 clements et al 2015 suggested that bc could exhibit negative impacts on aquatic organisms and alter the structure and function of stream benthic communities thereby significantly reducing community metabolism as important receptors and sink of waste streams wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the most probable bc recipients of industrial and domestic sewage zhang et al 2017 found that bc addition enriched the aggregation related species and pyridine degrading species in activated sludge and thus accelerated aerobic granulation and promoted degradation efficiency of highly refractory compounds moreover bc has been found to enhance methane production and promote the rapid development of biofilms in anaerobic reactors sunyoto et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 reported that bc could not only increase nitrobenzene removal rate but also improve the activated sludge system stability which may be related to the shift of microbial communities that the relative abundance of nitrobenzene reduction related bacteria was enriched in bc addition systems in addition song et al 2019 demonstrated that bc addition enriched the dominant microbes related to petroleum hydrocarbons transformation in anaerobic methanogenic system although recent studies have suggested that bc addition enriched the relative abundance of pollutants related bacteria in activated sludge system and thus promote the metabolic activity of activated sludge however the effects of bc on activated sludge system are still unclear and need further systematic research as is well known phenol is the typically aromatic compound generated from various industrial processes including coke production petrochemical refineries and chemical compounds production kobayashi et al 2012 bera et al 2017 hence the objectives of the current study are to 1 explore the impacts of bc on phenol degradation efficiency and the activity of key enzymes in activated sludge systems 2 investigate the cytotoxicity of bc to microbial communities by detecting intracellular ros production and release of lactate dehydrogenase ldh 3 and to analyze the variation of extracellular polymeric substances eps and 4 monitor diversity and structural shifts of microbial communities to achieve these goals various sbrs were established for treating phenol wastewater with addition of either 0 s1 1 s2 2 s3 or 4 s4 g l bc and operated for 50 days 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of bc the rice straw obtained from liaoning province of china were air dried milled into powders of 2 mm through a sifter as the feedstock biomass for the production of bc the biomass was pyrolyzed in a quartz tube inside a tubular furnace tdrg tengda thermal technology co ltd yixing china to yield bc via slow pyrolysis in a n2 environment at a temperature of 600 c for 1 h tang et al 2015 the samples were washed with deionized water to remove impurities for several times oven dried and were sealed in a container for further testing 2 2 experimental design the reactor was of length 15 5 cm width 8 cm and height 19 cm with 1000 ml of synthetic wastewater fresh air for aeration was supplied through an air pump at the reactor bottom with an airflow rate of 0 4 l min in this study the synthetic wastewater was composed of kh2po4 2 g l nh4 2so4 2 g l na2hpo4 12h2o 3 3 g l the sbrs were seeded with activated sludge which gathered from the secondary sedimentation tank of chunliu river wastewater treatment plant dalian china 4 5 g l dry weight at 105 c and domesticated activated sludge with the synthetic wastewater the sbrs were operated under identical conditions each cycle of sbr was operated for 24 h including 2 h fill 18 h aeration 2 h settling and 2 h effluent withdraw the effluent was discharged through the medium height outlet ports of the reactor making the volume exchange ratio 50 after 10 days of domestication the sbrs were divided into 4 groups with different dosages of bc g l 0 s1 1 s2 2 s3 and 4 s4 the operation was divided into two stages the first stage day 0 20 and the second stage day 21 50 the phenol concentration was changed during the second stage to compare the robustness of the control reactor with the bc treated sbrs during the 50 days operation cod and phenol concentration of the influent and effluent was tested daily and on day 1 and 20 phenol degradation was monitored every 2 h the activated sludge samples were taken at the end of the first stage day 20 and second stage day 50 for the analysis of enzyme activity and community structure the sludge volume after 0 5 h of settling sv30 were monitored daily and the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solid mlss was measured every five days because the system operated well and only 0 1 g l dry weight at 105 c sludge in s4 on day 20 was discharged during the whole process the mlss was relatively stable during the process fig s1 therefore the sludge retention time was not considered herein 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of phenol were detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc system as previously reported jiang et al 2016 xue et al 2017 cod concentration was determined by potassium dichromate method apha 2005 sludge samples were dried to a constant weight at 105 c for mlss determination and sv30 was the percentage of sludge volume after 0 5 h of settling which were according to apha standard methods apha 2005 for adsorption experiment 0 1 2 4 g l of bc without sludge and autoclaved sludge bc was placed in 100 ml erlenmeyer flask respectively the adsorption capacities of them were determined at an initial phenol concentration of 400 mg l after shaking at 150 rpm for 8 h the mixture was centrifuged and the phenol concentration in supernatant was then determined the dehydrogenase dha activity the adenosine triphosphate atp content the phenol hydroxylase ph catechol 1 2 dioxygenase c12o and catechol 2 3 dioxygenase c23o activities were tested as previous reports harayama et al 1992 powlowski and shingler 1994 hino et al 1998 ding et al 2016 the detailed procedures for eps and soluble microbial products smp extraction were described by wang et al 2018 and liang et al 2010 respectively polysaccharides ps content in eps and smp was measured according to the anthrone sulphuric acid method laurentin and edwards 2003 and proteins pn content in eps and smp was measured using the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard frolund et al 1995 uv vis absorption spectrum of influent effluent and eps was collected by uv vis spectrophotometer jascov 560 japan the eem fluorescence spectra of eps were measured using a luminescence spectrometry f 7000 hitachi japan fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 6700 thermo usa was used to detect the infrared spectra of eps ros assay kit was used to measure intracellular ros production beyotime institution of biotechnology china surface microstructure of bc was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem su8010 hitachi japan all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 dna extraction and pcr amplification the genomic dna of activated sludge samples was extracted using ezna soil dna kit omega bio tek inc norcross ga usa according to the manufacture s instruction primers 341f and 805r were used to amplify v3 v4 region of 16s rrna gene the reaction system and thermocycling steps were done as previously described shi et al 2015 the products of pcr were purified by qiaquick gel extraction kit finally the dna library was constructed and run on the illumina miseq platform by sangon biotech shanghai china co ltd 2 5 microbial community structure analysis after sequencing the paired end reads were joined by the flash program and sequences containing ambiguous reads n were removed a similarity of 97 has been classified into the same operational taxonomic units otus detrended correspondence analysis dca was performed using r v 2 13 1 with a 3 cutoff in nucleic acid sequences the influences of environmental parameters bc dosage phenol and cod concentration to the variances of bacterial communities were assessed with variance partitioning analysis using canonical correspondence analysis cca by r v 2 13 1 all the interrelationships mentioned were analyzed by pearson s product momentum correlation coefficient rp spss v24 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bc on sbr degradation performances the surface area and pore volume of bc analyzed by the bet adsorption method asap2460 micromeritics usa was 78 009 m2 g and 0 03793 cm3 g acute and chronic effects of bc on phenol wastewater degradation were detected on day 1 the phenol degradation rate of different sbrs exhibited increase with increase in bc dosage fig s2 a the phenol degradation rate reached 100 within 4 h in s4 while phenol degradation rate was only 65 3 for s1 within 4 h phenol degradation reaction of each sbr followed zero order kinetics and the value of reaction rate constant k 39 800 was the highest in s4 followed by s3 s2 and s1 table s1 phenol was completely degraded within 10 h in all sbrs on the first day and it was almost completely removed within one cycle of operation in all sbrs for the next 19 days fig 1 a however cod of all the sbrs was not completely abolished on the first day the uv vis spectrum of effluent on day 1 showed that intermediate products of phenol λ max 269 nm represents phenol did not exist in the cod fig s3 instead a gradually weaker absorption peak at λ max 212 nm was observed which might correspond to smp according to the previous report the term smp has been adopted to define the pool of organic compounds that are released into solution after substrate metabolism and thus the majority of the soluble organic matter in effluents of biological treatment processes referred to smp barker and stuckey 1999 pn and ps content of smp confirmed that the residual cod arose from smp table s2 the cod removal efficiency was bc dosage dependent in the order of s4 s3 s2 s1 during the first stage fig 1 b the cod removal efficiency in s4 increased from initial 93 2 100 on day 9 and remained constant till the end of the first stage day 20 however cod removal efficiency in s1 increased from 79 5 to 97 5 on day 20 the cod removal efficiency of s4 was significantly higher than that of s1 indicating high degradation performance of s4 on day 21 phenol concentration was increased to 800 mg l to investigate the robustness of the constructed systems on the first day of the second stage day 21 the phenol degradation rate showed the similar trend as on day 1 fig s2 b the reaction rate constant value k 14 775 was also the highest in s4 table s1 during the last 30 days phenol degradation rate was still 100 within one cycle of operation in all reactors the cod removal efficiency also showed same trend as that mentioned above and again reached 100 in s4 on day 30 till the end of the second stage day 50 and 98 0 in s1 on day 50 as is well known bc is widely used as an adsorbent for organic and metal contaminant removal due to its unique properties mohan and pittman 2006 2011 adsorption experiments showed that addition of 0 1 2 and 4 g l bc led to adsorption of 0 02 12 61 15 40 and 20 31 phenol respectively within 8 h confirming that the bc mediated adsorption is associated with phenol degradation therefore we preliminarily inferred that the enhanced phenol degradation rate in s2 s3 and s4 were associated with the bc mediated adsorption however when using autoclaved sludge bc phenol adsorption was significantly reduced compared to that exhibited by bc table s3 one possibility could be that phenol affinity to bc weakened as bc might be fouled by smp eps and microbes kong et al 2018 moreover the adsorption of both phenol and microbes on bc surface might give rise to a greater concentration of phenol in the vicinity of colonizing bacterial cells and therefore might increase the rate of biodegradation of phenol denyes et al 2016 thus phenol was biodegraded rather than being adsorbed in the bc treated sbr therefore the results indicated that phenol degradation rate correlated with bc dosage and bc showed a positive effect rather than toxic effect on phenol wastewater treatment in sbr moreover the addition of bc in sbr significantly improved the degradation efficiency of pyridine compared to that in control zhang et al 2017 thus the results suggest that bc has positive impact on degradation performance of sbrs 3 2 effects of bc on the activity of key enzymes tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are basic biochemical processes in microbial cells during aerobic biodegradation of organic compounds dha activity involves in tca cycle which belongs to the oxidoreductases mersi and schinner 1991 atp is generated during oxidative phosphorylation therefore dha activity and atp content can indicate the biodegradation ability of organic matters changes of dha activity atp content were shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b dha activities on day 20 and day 50 were higher in all sbrs compared to control test day 0 on day 20 and day 50 dha activities were observed in following order s1 s2 s3 s4 and dha activity of each sbr on day 50 was higher than that on day 20 the atp content in all sbrs displayed similar changing trends as the dha activity these results indicated that bc promoted the activity of dha and production of atp and they could be further enhanced with the increase in operating time pearson s product momentum further confirmed that dha activity rp 0 668 p 0 01 and atp content rp 0 938 p 0 01 were significantly positively correlated with bc dosage atp is an essential energy carrier which is produced when electrons are transferred from nadh to o2 by the cytochrome and proteins bounded in cell membrane lim et al 2008 the effect of bc on dha activity also led to an increase in nadh production which in turn enhanced atp production the correlation analysis between dha activity rp 0 839 p 0 01 or atp content rp 0 512 p 0 05 and phenol degradation rate further indicating that they were indicators of phenol degradation in the aerobic degradation pathways for phenol the first key step is hydroxylation reaction of phenol by ph which results in the production of catechol harayama et al 1992 hino et al 1998 the second key step is the ring cleavage of catechol which is performed either by c12o or c23o and the respective pathways are called the ortho cleavage and meta cleavage pathways harayama et al 1992 powlowski and shingler 1994 thus ph and c12o or c23o are key enzymes which directly correlate with phenol degradation vedler et al 2013 compared to that of control test day 0 the ph activity was increased from day 20 to day 50 and it also increased with higher bc dosage fig 2 c similar results were observed in fig 2 d and fig 2 e for c12o and c23o and the activity of c23o was significantly higher than that of c12o there was a positive correlation between ph or c23o activity and bc dosage rp 0 729 p 0 01 rp 0 685 p 0 01 whereas there was no significant correlation between c12o activity and bc dosage further analysis revealed that ph and c23o instead of c12o were positively correlated with phenol degradation rate rp 0 770 p 0 01 rp 0 764 p 0 01 confirming that phenol degradation mainly depended on meta cleavage pathway rather than ortho cleavage pathway in sbrs therefore it was concluded that bc dosage had significant positive effect on key enzymes involved in phenol catabolism except c12o thus it could be inferred that bc exposure enhanced the growth of microorganisms which resulted in the increase in activities of key enzymes involved in phenol degradation 3 3 effects of bc on the production of intracellular ros and the release of ldh under normal conditions low levels of intracellular ros are generated which are easily neutralized nel et al 2006 however the intracellular ros induced by external stimulation may attack cellular components and result in loss of physiological functions which can significantly damage microbial cells han et al 2016 thus intracellular ros production of each sbr treated with different bc dosages was investigated fig s4 relatively high production of intracellular ros was observed in s1 which might be due to the toxicity of phenol towards sludge microbes in sbrs however intracellular ros production was decreased with the increase in bc dosage this result indicated that the addition of bc might ameliorate the toxicity of phenol to sludge microbes in sbrs and thus reduce oxidative stress the harmful effects of intracellular ros could be eliminated by catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod in microbial cells dukan and touati 1996 han et al 2016 in this study the activities of cat and sod were observed to gradually increase with increase in bc dosage which in turn reduced the production of intracellular ros data not shown ldh is a glycolytic enzyme mainly found in the cytoplasm ldh is rarely found outside the cells under normal circumstances when the cell membrane is destroyed ldh leak into solution thus ldh can be used as an indicator for cell rupture garvie 1998 ldh release was detected in order to estimate the surface integrity of activated sludge in sbrs containing bc no significant cell leakage was detected in the presence of bc confirming that bc exhibited no negative effect on the integrity of cell membrane of microbes present in activated sludge data not shown 3 4 effects of bc on eps 3 4 1 effects of bc on eps content it is already known that eps and sludge properties are highly linked and it is speculated that the eps could largely determine the properties of sludge thereby affecting the performance of activated sludge systems li et al 2016 2018 the production and composition of eps were significantly influenced by external environmental conditions that govern microbial communities in sludge and microbial metabolism thus the effect of bc addition on the eps production and composition was systematically investigated in this study eps are comprised mostly of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps wingender et al 1999 bhaskar and bhosle 2005 vu et al 2009 eps are comprised mostly of proteins and polysaccharides the abundances of pn and ps of epss1 were the highest 87 58 and 72 86 mg g vss followed by epss2 62 50 and 58 66 mg g vss epss3 53 96 and 56 09 mg g vss and epss4 42 98 and 51 25 mg g vss fig s5 a indicating that the eps secretion decreased with the increase in bc dosage in terms of toxic compounds e g chloroform phenol glutaraldehyde and tetracycline higher levels of eps were produced by microbial cells in activated sludge as a vital self protection mechanism against the harsh environment owing to the reduction of toxic effect of phenol to sludge microbes in sbr by bc exposure epss2 epss3 and epss4 content was lower than that of epss1 alternatively the decrease in eps content might be due to the absorption of eps by bc compared to control test 0 g l bc the absorption rates of pn and ps increased with increase in bc dosage from 1 to 4 g l and finally reached values of 11 5 and 21 3 respectively fig s5 b the decrease in eps content could also be because of utilization of biodegradable components of eps by activated sludge to sustain vital metabolic processes the proportion of eps components is crucial to determine the characteristics of eps liao et al 2001 with the increase in bc dosage from 0 to 4 g l pn ps content ratio of eps in sbr decreased from 1 20 to 0 84 indicating that the proportion of pn component of eps decreased more significantly than that of ps fig s5 c pearson correlation coefficient showed that pn was significantly negatively correlated with the increase in bc dosage rp 0 925 p 0 05 while ps showed no significant correlation with bc dosage which suggested that pn production was significantly decreased due to the reduction of toxic effect of phenol by bc in previous studies the production of pn far exceeded than that of other components of eps under harsh conditions shi et al 2013 3 4 2 uv vis spectra of eps since eps contain large quantities of aromatic structures and unsaturated fatty chains with various types of functional groups these functional groups were investigated in four eps using uv vis spectroscopy sheng et al 2010 in fig 3 a obvious absorption band at 210 220 nm was observed in the spectrum of all four eps which belonged to n π electron transitions in amide bond of protein carboxyl or ester in eps matrix nevertheless absorption band at 255 265 nm was only found in the spectrum of epss1 which could be attributed to π π electron transitions in aromatic and polyaromatic compounds of eps such as tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine related amino acids or pn chen et al 2013 meng et al 2016 moreover the wavelengths of absorption peaks of epss2 epss3 and epss4 were significantly blue shifted compared to epss1 while there were no obvious differences among the peaks of epss2 epss3 and epss4 fig 3 normally the blue shift in the uv vis spectrum indicates an increase in energy required for electron transitions which indicated a change in molecular structures chen et al 2013 pn has been reported to contain a large amount of aromatic and polyaromatic moieties in their molecules chen et al 2013 thus the low content of pn might lead to the disappearance of absorption band at 255 265 nm in epss2 epss3 and epss4 and the blue shift of epss2 epss3 and epss4 spectrum 3 4 3 3d eem spectra of eps in order to further clarify the organic components in eps under different bc dosages 3d eem spectra were employed as shown in fig 4 the 3d eem profiles for epss1 epss2 epss3 and epss4 were semblable two major fluorescence peaks were confirmed in the eem spectra of eps in presence of 0 4 g l bc the excitation emission wavelength ex em of peaks a and b in the eps were situated at 285 345 355 nm and 345 365 435 455 nm respectively according to previous studies peak a and b were interrelated to tryptophan protein like substance and humic acid like substances respectively chen et al 2003 you et al 2015 however unlike epss1 peak a and b were blue shifted by 0 10 nm and 20 20 nm along ex em axis for epss2 epss3 and epss4 respectively the blue shifts were associated with the reduction in abundance of aromatic moieties aromatic ring number and conjugated bonds in the chain structure table s4 swietlik and sikorska 2004 moreover the fluorescence intensity of both peak a and b changed significantly with the increase in bc dosage compared to epss1 the intensity of peak a decreased by 87 9 for epss2 91 1 for epss3 and 92 0 for epss4 similarly the intensity of peak b was also reduced for epss2 56 7 epss3 84 8 and epss4 85 3 compared to epss1 these results further confirmed that the bc addition reduced the aromatic moiety aromatic ring number in eps and decrease the content of eps which were consistent with the above results 3 4 4 ftir spectra of eps it is well known that the 1800 cm 1 600 cm 1 region of the ftir spectra can show the main information about eps compositions and functionalities badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the ftir spectra of eps can be divided into six dominant regions associated with several characteristic functional groups amide ⅰ region 1700 1600 cm 1 associated with pn amide ⅱ region 1600 1500 cm 1 associated with pn carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds 1500 1300 cm 1 amide ⅲ region 1300 1200 cm 1 associated with pn ps and nucleic acids 1200 900 cm 1 and fingerprint region 900 600 cm 1 badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 thus to compare the impacts of bc dosage the related regions of ftir spectra were extracted in this study fig 5 according to previous reports various bands emerged in all six regions of ftir spectra which revealed the complex pn and ps associated functional groups and compositions of eps badireddy et al 2008 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the ftir profiles for epss1 epss2 epss3 and epss4 were comparable which indicated that the main functional groups were quite semblable for the four eps nevertheless a closer investigation demonstrated that the ftir profile of epss1 was different from those of epss2 epss3 and epss4 based on the literature screening the detailed bands assigned for ftir spectral features of eps are listed in table 1 badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the bands at 1630 1552 1295 1137 1053 1037 and 664 cm 1 observed for all four eps indicating that all the eps contained pn ps lipids dna and aromatic compounds with abundance of functional groups such as c o nh2 n h c n co nh c oh c o c o c etc the bands at 1630 1552 and 1295 cm 1 in ftir of epss2 epss3 and epss4 became weaker than in ftir of epss1 revealing the relatively lower amount of c o stretch associated with pn co nh of pn and secondary amides of pn in ftir of epss2 epss3 and epss4 than in epss1 table 1 appearance of gradually weaker bands at 1137 1053 and 1037 cm 1 in epss2 epss3 and epss4 than in epss1 indicated lower amount of ps c oh c o c and c o associated bands with ps in epss2 epss3 and epss4 than in epss1 these results were consistent with the content of pn and ps detected in the above results which confirmed that the addition of bc could reduce the pn and ps secretion a weak band at 910 cm 1 was only detected in ftir of epss1 directly suggesting the presence of o p o stretches associated with nucleic acids wang et al 2018 reported that relatively higher levels of o p o stretches in eps might originate from the excessive release of nucleic acids under the endogenous decay of bacteria in sbr therefore the only detected o p o stretches associated with nucleic acids in epss1 might arise due to the toxicity of phenol whereas the addition of bc could lower the toxicity of phenol and thus no o p o stretches were observed in epss2 epss3 and epss4 which was consistent with the results of ros and ldh qu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 in addition other weak bands at 1462 and 1403 cm 1 were only detected in ftir of epss1 indicating the relative higher amount of coo namely the acidic nature of eps components in epss1 than in epss2 epss3 and epss4 the bands at 664 cm 1 in ftir of epss2 epss3 and epss4 became weaker than in ftir of epss1 which suggested relatively lower contents of aromatic compounds and nucleic acids in epss2 epss3 and epss4 than that in epss1 moreover quantitative analysis of the second derivative spectra and the curve fitting of the original infrared spectra for the amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 were performed as shown in fig s6 and table s5 the peak intensity and proportion of secondary structures of all proteins gradually decreased with the increase of bc dosage the distinguishable ftir spectral features and the protein secondary structure of epss1 from epss2 epss3 and epss4 arose due to bc addition 3 5 analysis of microbial community in sbrs 3 5 1 overall responses of bacterial community to bc the sludge samples from day 20 s1 20 s2 20 s3 20 and s4 20 day 50 s1 50 s2 50 s3 50 and s4 50 were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform the 47137 74642 effective sequence tags were yield and the otu numbers ranged from 1161 to 1496 at the clustering threshold of 97 for the 9 samples table s6 results of this study showed that 99 9 of the sequences attributed to bacteria the coverage for all the samples was 99 reflecting that the sequencing results represented the real situation of the samples shannon diversity was significantly reduced in response to bc exposure on day 20 and 50 shannon diversity was significantly negatively correlated with the increase in bc dosage rp 0 913 p 0 05 moreover bc significantly increased the simpson index on day 20 and 50 and the simpson index showed significant positive correlation with bc dosage on day 20 rp 0 959 p 0 05 it indicated that bc exhibited significantly negative effects on bacterial diversity dca analysis showed that s1 20 and s1 50 clustered together and separated from other groups fig s7 dissimilarity analyses by anosim and premanova also indicated that bc treated sbrs was significantly distinct from the sbr without bc r 0 660 p 0 01 r 2 0 381 p 0 01 these results revealed that bc significantly altered bacterial communities especially the dominant populations and might have an impact on system functions 3 5 2 significantly changed genera in response to bc illumina miseq results indicated that bacterial community was mainly composed of 14 genera in all the 8 samples fig 6 overall microbial communities were altered significantly with the addition of different bc dosages which might be attributed to the formation of biofilm on bc surface sem proved the formation of biofilm on bc surface fig 7 on day 20 comamonas 23 and thauera 17 were the most two predominant genera in s1 followed by rudaea stenotrophomonas petrimonas rhodanobacter cupriavidus ferruginibacter chryseobacterium pandora dokdonella dyella achromobacter and burkholderia with the addition of different dosage of bc the abundance of thauera was sharply dropped by 56 81 with the addition of bc thauera is generally known as denitrifying bacteria with the ability to degrade aromatic organic compounds to some extent mechichi et al 2002 liu et al 2013 in the sbrs using phenol as the only carbon source the existence of competition among microbes resulted in the washout of the genera with relatively poor phenol degradation performance on the contrary the relative abundance of comamonas increased from 25 to 35 with the increase in bc dosage and showed significant positive correlation with bc dosage on day 20 rp 0 943 p 0 05 in addition the abundance of cupriavidus which only accounted for 3 of total microbial population in s1 sharply increased from 25 to 45 with the bc dosage increased from 1 to 4 g l on day 20 and became the most predominant genus in s3 and s4 which also exhibited significant positive correlation with bc on day 20 rp 0 904 p 0 05 bc could support the growth of biofilm and selectively enriched functional microbes tightly attached to it su et al 2019 therefore the enhanced phenol degradation performance in bc treated sbrs at the first stage was mainly dependent on the enrichment of genera comamonas and cupriavidus which were known as efficient phenol degraders shi et al 2015 tiwari et al 2017 min et al 2018 similar result was obtained by zhao et al 2018 that the relative abundance of nitrobenzene reducting bacteria was enriched in bc containing systems song et al 2019 also demonstrated that bc addition would enrich the dominant microbes related to petroleum hydrocarbon transformation in anaerobically activated sludge system on day 50 with the increase of phenol concentration the abundance of comamonas decreased to 15 in s1 indicating that high concentration of phenol might inhibit the growth of comamonas however the relative abundance of comamonas in bc treated sbrs on day 50 27 45 in s2 s4 was even higher than that on day 20 indicating that bc addition apparently lowered phenol toxicity to comamonas the relative abundance of cupriavidus in s2 s4 was lower on day 50 than that on day 20 while gradually promoted with the increase of bc dosage compared to that in s1 indicating that cupriavidus was sensitive to high concentration of phenol while the addition of bc alleviated the phenol toxicity to cupriavidus to some extent these results indicating that the biofilm on bc might protect the microbes inside from inhibitory effects of the toxic compounds canonical correspondence analysis cca was performed in order to indentify the relationship between bacterial community structure and environmental parameters on the basis of variance inflation factors vif and 999 monte carlo permutations three significant environmental parameters bc dosage phenol concentration and cod were chosen in the cca biplot fig s8 among all the environmental parameters the bc dosage was the most important which strongly correlated to bacterial community structure whereas phenol concentration and cod showed relatively weaker correlation with bacterial community structure previous reports only confirmed that single bc dosage 1 5 g l and 4 g l could significantly alter bacterial communities and enrich the relative abundance of degradation related species thus enhance the degradation performance of nitrobenzene and pyridine zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 based on our study all the tested bc dosage addition 1 4 g l significantly altered the bacterial communities and enriched the dominant microbes related to phenol degrading species and this enrichment increased with the increase of bc dosage thus best phenol degradation performance in sbr was achieved at bc dosage of 4 g l 4 conclusion this study showed that bc exhibited protective rather than toxic effects on sludge microbes in sbrs leading to the decrease of intracellular ros production in bc treated sbrs bc enhanced the treatment performance of phenol because of bc dosage showed significant positive correlation with dha activity atp content ph and c23o activity moreover functional groups and components of eps were changed with bc addition the composition and structure of inherent activated sludge bacterial communities were significantly shifted in response to bc addition comamonas and cupriavidus were mainly responsible for the enhancement phenol degradation process and increased significantly upon bc shock growth of thauera was considerably inhibited with the addition of bc declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known

18673,the extensive application of biochar bc attracts concerns regarding its environmental effect wastewater treatment systems are potential bc recipients however the impacts of bc on these systems are still unclear in this study effects of bc on the phenol treatment performance and shift in microbial communities in sequencing batch reactor sbr were investigated the phenol degradation rates were enhanced in all bc treated sbrs during the whole operation due to promotion of key enzymes involved in phenol degradation the decrease in abundance of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros in sbrs indicated that bc protected microorganisms by ameliorating phenol toxicity leading to a decrease in the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps the functional groups protein c o co nh polysaccharide c oh c o c c o and nucleic acids o p o associated bonds of eps decreased or disappeared in bc treated sbrs miseq sequencing revealed significant decrease in bacterial diversity and remarkable changes in the bacterial community structure in bc treated sbrs abundances of comamonas and cupriavidus increased significantly upon bc exposure which contributed to phenol degradation treatment with relatively high bc dosage exhibited considerable inhibition on thauera canonical correspondence analysis cca indicated that the shift in abundances of these genera was closely associated with bc dosage this study suggested that bc exerted protective effects on sludge microbes of phenol wastewater treatment systems while it affected the bacterial community structure and diversity at test concentrations thus this study elucidates the comprehensive effects of bc on wastewater treatment process keywords biochar phenol wastewater key enzymes extracellular polymeric substances microbial community 1 introduction biochar bc is carbon rich solid produced by carbonization and or biomass pyrolysis and is derived from straw wood and organic industrial wastes cao et al 2009 2010 ahmad et al 2014 bc is primarily introduced as a soil amendment due to its role in carbon sequestration improvement of soil fertility and reduction of greenhouse effects zhang et al 2017 recently owing to its lower production cost and efficiency in the removal of organic and metal contaminants it is considered to be a viable alternative to activated carbon ac for various wastewater treatment procedures mohan and pittman 2006 2011 inevitably bc will enter various environmental matrices however the potential environmental risks of bc are rarely studied and a comprehensive investigation is needed it has previously been reported that bc is toxic to various organisms such as plants lepidium sativum bacteria vibrio fischeri microbacterium sp brevundimonas diminuta citrobacter freundii and comamonas testosterone etc alga selenastrum capricornutum protozoa tetrahymena thermophila and crustaceans daphnia magna which may be due to the absorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs that are formed during pyrolysis leading to growth inhibition or even mortality of organisms oleszczuk et al 2013 clements et al 2015 suggested that bc could exhibit negative impacts on aquatic organisms and alter the structure and function of stream benthic communities thereby significantly reducing community metabolism as important receptors and sink of waste streams wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the most probable bc recipients of industrial and domestic sewage zhang et al 2017 found that bc addition enriched the aggregation related species and pyridine degrading species in activated sludge and thus accelerated aerobic granulation and promoted degradation efficiency of highly refractory compounds moreover bc has been found to enhance methane production and promote the rapid development of biofilms in anaerobic reactors sunyoto et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 reported that bc could not only increase nitrobenzene removal rate but also improve the activated sludge system stability which may be related to the shift of microbial communities that the relative abundance of nitrobenzene reduction related bacteria was enriched in bc addition systems in addition song et al 2019 demonstrated that bc addition enriched the dominant microbes related to petroleum hydrocarbons transformation in anaerobic methanogenic system although recent studies have suggested that bc addition enriched the relative abundance of pollutants related bacteria in activated sludge system and thus promote the metabolic activity of activated sludge however the effects of bc on activated sludge system are still unclear and need further systematic research as is well known phenol is the typically aromatic compound generated from various industrial processes including coke production petrochemical refineries and chemical compounds production kobayashi et al 2012 bera et al 2017 hence the objectives of the current study are to 1 explore the impacts of bc on phenol degradation efficiency and the activity of key enzymes in activated sludge systems 2 investigate the cytotoxicity of bc to microbial communities by detecting intracellular ros production and release of lactate dehydrogenase ldh 3 and to analyze the variation of extracellular polymeric substances eps and 4 monitor diversity and structural shifts of microbial communities to achieve these goals various sbrs were established for treating phenol wastewater with addition of either 0 s1 1 s2 2 s3 or 4 s4 g l bc and operated for 50 days 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of bc the rice straw obtained from liaoning province of china were air dried milled into powders of 2 mm through a sifter as the feedstock biomass for the production of bc the biomass was pyrolyzed in a quartz tube inside a tubular furnace tdrg tengda thermal technology co ltd yixing china to yield bc via slow pyrolysis in a n2 environment at a temperature of 600 c for 1 h tang et al 2015 the samples were washed with deionized water to remove impurities for several times oven dried and were sealed in a container for further testing 2 2 experimental design the reactor was of length 15 5 cm width 8 cm and height 19 cm with 1000 ml of synthetic wastewater fresh air for aeration was supplied through an air pump at the reactor bottom with an airflow rate of 0 4 l min in this study the synthetic wastewater was composed of kh2po4 2 g l nh4 2so4 2 g l na2hpo4 12h2o 3 3 g l the sbrs were seeded with activated sludge which gathered from the secondary sedimentation tank of chunliu river wastewater treatment plant dalian china 4 5 g l dry weight at 105 c and domesticated activated sludge with the synthetic wastewater the sbrs were operated under identical conditions each cycle of sbr was operated for 24 h including 2 h fill 18 h aeration 2 h settling and 2 h effluent withdraw the effluent was discharged through the medium height outlet ports of the reactor making the volume exchange ratio 50 after 10 days of domestication the sbrs were divided into 4 groups with different dosages of bc g l 0 s1 1 s2 2 s3 and 4 s4 the operation was divided into two stages the first stage day 0 20 and the second stage day 21 50 the phenol concentration was changed during the second stage to compare the robustness of the control reactor with the bc treated sbrs during the 50 days operation cod and phenol concentration of the influent and effluent was tested daily and on day 1 and 20 phenol degradation was monitored every 2 h the activated sludge samples were taken at the end of the first stage day 20 and second stage day 50 for the analysis of enzyme activity and community structure the sludge volume after 0 5 h of settling sv30 were monitored daily and the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solid mlss was measured every five days because the system operated well and only 0 1 g l dry weight at 105 c sludge in s4 on day 20 was discharged during the whole process the mlss was relatively stable during the process fig s1 therefore the sludge retention time was not considered herein 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of phenol were detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc system as previously reported jiang et al 2016 xue et al 2017 cod concentration was determined by potassium dichromate method apha 2005 sludge samples were dried to a constant weight at 105 c for mlss determination and sv30 was the percentage of sludge volume after 0 5 h of settling which were according to apha standard methods apha 2005 for adsorption experiment 0 1 2 4 g l of bc without sludge and autoclaved sludge bc was placed in 100 ml erlenmeyer flask respectively the adsorption capacities of them were determined at an initial phenol concentration of 400 mg l after shaking at 150 rpm for 8 h the mixture was centrifuged and the phenol concentration in supernatant was then determined the dehydrogenase dha activity the adenosine triphosphate atp content the phenol hydroxylase ph catechol 1 2 dioxygenase c12o and catechol 2 3 dioxygenase c23o activities were tested as previous reports harayama et al 1992 powlowski and shingler 1994 hino et al 1998 ding et al 2016 the detailed procedures for eps and soluble microbial products smp extraction were described by wang et al 2018 and liang et al 2010 respectively polysaccharides ps content in eps and smp was measured according to the anthrone sulphuric acid method laurentin and edwards 2003 and proteins pn content in eps and smp was measured using the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard frolund et al 1995 uv vis absorption spectrum of influent effluent and eps was collected by uv vis spectrophotometer jascov 560 japan the eem fluorescence spectra of eps were measured using a luminescence spectrometry f 7000 hitachi japan fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 6700 thermo usa was used to detect the infrared spectra of eps ros assay kit was used to measure intracellular ros production beyotime institution of biotechnology china surface microstructure of bc was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem su8010 hitachi japan all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 dna extraction and pcr amplification the genomic dna of activated sludge samples was extracted using ezna soil dna kit omega bio tek inc norcross ga usa according to the manufacture s instruction primers 341f and 805r were used to amplify v3 v4 region of 16s rrna gene the reaction system and thermocycling steps were done as previously described shi et al 2015 the products of pcr were purified by qiaquick gel extraction kit finally the dna library was constructed and run on the illumina miseq platform by sangon biotech shanghai china co ltd 2 5 microbial community structure analysis after sequencing the paired end reads were joined by the flash program and sequences containing ambiguous reads n were removed a similarity of 97 has been classified into the same operational taxonomic units otus detrended correspondence analysis dca was performed using r v 2 13 1 with a 3 cutoff in nucleic acid sequences the influences of environmental parameters bc dosage phenol and cod concentration to the variances of bacterial communities were assessed with variance partitioning analysis using canonical correspondence analysis cca by r v 2 13 1 all the interrelationships mentioned were analyzed by pearson s product momentum correlation coefficient rp spss v24 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bc on sbr degradation performances the surface area and pore volume of bc analyzed by the bet adsorption method asap2460 micromeritics usa was 78 009 m2 g and 0 03793 cm3 g acute and chronic effects of bc on phenol wastewater degradation were detected on day 1 the phenol degradation rate of different sbrs exhibited increase with increase in bc dosage fig s2 a the phenol degradation rate reached 100 within 4 h in s4 while phenol degradation rate was only 65 3 for s1 within 4 h phenol degradation reaction of each sbr followed zero order kinetics and the value of reaction rate constant k 39 800 was the highest in s4 followed by s3 s2 and s1 table s1 phenol was completely degraded within 10 h in all sbrs on the first day and it was almost completely removed within one cycle of operation in all sbrs for the next 19 days fig 1 a however cod of all the sbrs was not completely abolished on the first day the uv vis spectrum of effluent on day 1 showed that intermediate products of phenol λ max 269 nm represents phenol did not exist in the cod fig s3 instead a gradually weaker absorption peak at λ max 212 nm was observed which might correspond to smp according to the previous report the term smp has been adopted to define the pool of organic compounds that are released into solution after substrate metabolism and thus the majority of the soluble organic matter in effluents of biological treatment processes referred to smp barker and stuckey 1999 pn and ps content of smp confirmed that the residual cod arose from smp table s2 the cod removal efficiency was bc dosage dependent in the order of s4 s3 s2 s1 during the first stage fig 1 b the cod removal efficiency in s4 increased from initial 93 2 100 on day 9 and remained constant till the end of the first stage day 20 however cod removal efficiency in s1 increased from 79 5 to 97 5 on day 20 the cod removal efficiency of s4 was significantly higher than that of s1 indicating high degradation performance of s4 on day 21 phenol concentration was increased to 800 mg l to investigate the robustness of the constructed systems on the first day of the second stage day 21 the phenol degradation rate showed the similar trend as on day 1 fig s2 b the reaction rate constant value k 14 775 was also the highest in s4 table s1 during the last 30 days phenol degradation rate was still 100 within one cycle of operation in all reactors the cod removal efficiency also showed same trend as that mentioned above and again reached 100 in s4 on day 30 till the end of the second stage day 50 and 98 0 in s1 on day 50 as is well known bc is widely used as an adsorbent for organic and metal contaminant removal due to its unique properties mohan and pittman 2006 2011 adsorption experiments showed that addition of 0 1 2 and 4 g l bc led to adsorption of 0 02 12 61 15 40 and 20 31 phenol respectively within 8 h confirming that the bc mediated adsorption is associated with phenol degradation therefore we preliminarily inferred that the enhanced phenol degradation rate in s2 s3 and s4 were associated with the bc mediated adsorption however when using autoclaved sludge bc phenol adsorption was significantly reduced compared to that exhibited by bc table s3 one possibility could be that phenol affinity to bc weakened as bc might be fouled by smp eps and microbes kong et al 2018 moreover the adsorption of both phenol and microbes on bc surface might give rise to a greater concentration of phenol in the vicinity of colonizing bacterial cells and therefore might increase the rate of biodegradation of phenol denyes et al 2016 thus phenol was biodegraded rather than being adsorbed in the bc treated sbr therefore the results indicated that phenol degradation rate correlated with bc dosage and bc showed a positive effect rather than toxic effect on phenol wastewater treatment in sbr moreover the addition of bc in sbr significantly improved the degradation efficiency of pyridine compared to that in control zhang et al 2017 thus the results suggest that bc has positive impact on degradation performance of sbrs 3 2 effects of bc on the activity of key enzymes tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are basic biochemical processes in microbial cells during aerobic biodegradation of organic compounds dha activity involves in tca cycle which belongs to the oxidoreductases mersi and schinner 1991 atp is generated during oxidative phosphorylation therefore dha activity and atp content can indicate the biodegradation ability of organic matters changes of dha activity atp content were shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b dha activities on day 20 and day 50 were higher in all sbrs compared to control test day 0 on day 20 and day 50 dha activities were observed in following order s1 s2 s3 s4 and dha activity of each sbr on day 50 was higher than that on day 20 the atp content in all sbrs displayed similar changing trends as the dha activity these results indicated that bc promoted the activity of dha and production of atp and they could be further enhanced with the increase in operating time pearson s product momentum further confirmed that dha activity rp 0 668 p 0 01 and atp content rp 0 938 p 0 01 were significantly positively correlated with bc dosage atp is an essential energy carrier which is produced when electrons are transferred from nadh to o2 by the cytochrome and proteins bounded in cell membrane lim et al 2008 the effect of bc on dha activity also led to an increase in nadh production which in turn enhanced atp production the correlation analysis between dha activity rp 0 839 p 0 01 or atp content rp 0 512 p 0 05 and phenol degradation rate further indicating that they were indicators of phenol degradation in the aerobic degradation pathways for phenol the first key step is hydroxylation reaction of phenol by ph which results in the production of catechol harayama et al 1992 hino et al 1998 the second key step is the ring cleavage of catechol which is performed either by c12o or c23o and the respective pathways are called the ortho cleavage and meta cleavage pathways harayama et al 1992 powlowski and shingler 1994 thus ph and c12o or c23o are key enzymes which directly correlate with phenol degradation vedler et al 2013 compared to that of control test day 0 the ph activity was increased from day 20 to day 50 and it also increased with higher bc dosage fig 2 c similar results were observed in fig 2 d and fig 2 e for c12o and c23o and the activity of c23o was significantly higher than that of c12o there was a positive correlation between ph or c23o activity and bc dosage rp 0 729 p 0 01 rp 0 685 p 0 01 whereas there was no significant correlation between c12o activity and bc dosage further analysis revealed that ph and c23o instead of c12o were positively correlated with phenol degradation rate rp 0 770 p 0 01 rp 0 764 p 0 01 confirming that phenol degradation mainly depended on meta cleavage pathway rather than ortho cleavage pathway in sbrs therefore it was concluded that bc dosage had significant positive effect on key enzymes involved in phenol catabolism except c12o thus it could be inferred that bc exposure enhanced the growth of microorganisms which resulted in the increase in activities of key enzymes involved in phenol degradation 3 3 effects of bc on the production of intracellular ros and the release of ldh under normal conditions low levels of intracellular ros are generated which are easily neutralized nel et al 2006 however the intracellular ros induced by external stimulation may attack cellular components and result in loss of physiological functions which can significantly damage microbial cells han et al 2016 thus intracellular ros production of each sbr treated with different bc dosages was investigated fig s4 relatively high production of intracellular ros was observed in s1 which might be due to the toxicity of phenol towards sludge microbes in sbrs however intracellular ros production was decreased with the increase in bc dosage this result indicated that the addition of bc might ameliorate the toxicity of phenol to sludge microbes in sbrs and thus reduce oxidative stress the harmful effects of intracellular ros could be eliminated by catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod in microbial cells dukan and touati 1996 han et al 2016 in this study the activities of cat and sod were observed to gradually increase with increase in bc dosage which in turn reduced the production of intracellular ros data not shown ldh is a glycolytic enzyme mainly found in the cytoplasm ldh is rarely found outside the cells under normal circumstances when the cell membrane is destroyed ldh leak into solution thus ldh can be used as an indicator for cell rupture garvie 1998 ldh release was detected in order to estimate the surface integrity of activated sludge in sbrs containing bc no significant cell leakage was detected in the presence of bc confirming that bc exhibited no negative effect on the integrity of cell membrane of microbes present in activated sludge data not shown 3 4 effects of bc on eps 3 4 1 effects of bc on eps content it is already known that eps and sludge properties are highly linked and it is speculated that the eps could largely determine the properties of sludge thereby affecting the performance of activated sludge systems li et al 2016 2018 the production and composition of eps were significantly influenced by external environmental conditions that govern microbial communities in sludge and microbial metabolism thus the effect of bc addition on the eps production and composition was systematically investigated in this study eps are comprised mostly of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps wingender et al 1999 bhaskar and bhosle 2005 vu et al 2009 eps are comprised mostly of proteins and polysaccharides the abundances of pn and ps of epss1 were the highest 87 58 and 72 86 mg g vss followed by epss2 62 50 and 58 66 mg g vss epss3 53 96 and 56 09 mg g vss and epss4 42 98 and 51 25 mg g vss fig s5 a indicating that the eps secretion decreased with the increase in bc dosage in terms of toxic compounds e g chloroform phenol glutaraldehyde and tetracycline higher levels of eps were produced by microbial cells in activated sludge as a vital self protection mechanism against the harsh environment owing to the reduction of toxic effect of phenol to sludge microbes in sbr by bc exposure epss2 epss3 and epss4 content was lower than that of epss1 alternatively the decrease in eps content might be due to the absorption of eps by bc compared to control test 0 g l bc the absorption rates of pn and ps increased with increase in bc dosage from 1 to 4 g l and finally reached values of 11 5 and 21 3 respectively fig s5 b the decrease in eps content could also be because of utilization of biodegradable components of eps by activated sludge to sustain vital metabolic processes the proportion of eps components is crucial to determine the characteristics of eps liao et al 2001 with the increase in bc dosage from 0 to 4 g l pn ps content ratio of eps in sbr decreased from 1 20 to 0 84 indicating that the proportion of pn component of eps decreased more significantly than that of ps fig s5 c pearson correlation coefficient showed that pn was significantly negatively correlated with the increase in bc dosage rp 0 925 p 0 05 while ps showed no significant correlation with bc dosage which suggested that pn production was significantly decreased due to the reduction of toxic effect of phenol by bc in previous studies the production of pn far exceeded than that of other components of eps under harsh conditions shi et al 2013 3 4 2 uv vis spectra of eps since eps contain large quantities of aromatic structures and unsaturated fatty chains with various types of functional groups these functional groups were investigated in four eps using uv vis spectroscopy sheng et al 2010 in fig 3 a obvious absorption band at 210 220 nm was observed in the spectrum of all four eps which belonged to n π electron transitions in amide bond of protein carboxyl or ester in eps matrix nevertheless absorption band at 255 265 nm was only found in the spectrum of epss1 which could be attributed to π π electron transitions in aromatic and polyaromatic compounds of eps such as tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine related amino acids or pn chen et al 2013 meng et al 2016 moreover the wavelengths of absorption peaks of epss2 epss3 and epss4 were significantly blue shifted compared to epss1 while there were no obvious differences among the peaks of epss2 epss3 and epss4 fig 3 normally the blue shift in the uv vis spectrum indicates an increase in energy required for electron transitions which indicated a change in molecular structures chen et al 2013 pn has been reported to contain a large amount of aromatic and polyaromatic moieties in their molecules chen et al 2013 thus the low content of pn might lead to the disappearance of absorption band at 255 265 nm in epss2 epss3 and epss4 and the blue shift of epss2 epss3 and epss4 spectrum 3 4 3 3d eem spectra of eps in order to further clarify the organic components in eps under different bc dosages 3d eem spectra were employed as shown in fig 4 the 3d eem profiles for epss1 epss2 epss3 and epss4 were semblable two major fluorescence peaks were confirmed in the eem spectra of eps in presence of 0 4 g l bc the excitation emission wavelength ex em of peaks a and b in the eps were situated at 285 345 355 nm and 345 365 435 455 nm respectively according to previous studies peak a and b were interrelated to tryptophan protein like substance and humic acid like substances respectively chen et al 2003 you et al 2015 however unlike epss1 peak a and b were blue shifted by 0 10 nm and 20 20 nm along ex em axis for epss2 epss3 and epss4 respectively the blue shifts were associated with the reduction in abundance of aromatic moieties aromatic ring number and conjugated bonds in the chain structure table s4 swietlik and sikorska 2004 moreover the fluorescence intensity of both peak a and b changed significantly with the increase in bc dosage compared to epss1 the intensity of peak a decreased by 87 9 for epss2 91 1 for epss3 and 92 0 for epss4 similarly the intensity of peak b was also reduced for epss2 56 7 epss3 84 8 and epss4 85 3 compared to epss1 these results further confirmed that the bc addition reduced the aromatic moiety aromatic ring number in eps and decrease the content of eps which were consistent with the above results 3 4 4 ftir spectra of eps it is well known that the 1800 cm 1 600 cm 1 region of the ftir spectra can show the main information about eps compositions and functionalities badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the ftir spectra of eps can be divided into six dominant regions associated with several characteristic functional groups amide ⅰ region 1700 1600 cm 1 associated with pn amide ⅱ region 1600 1500 cm 1 associated with pn carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds 1500 1300 cm 1 amide ⅲ region 1300 1200 cm 1 associated with pn ps and nucleic acids 1200 900 cm 1 and fingerprint region 900 600 cm 1 badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 thus to compare the impacts of bc dosage the related regions of ftir spectra were extracted in this study fig 5 according to previous reports various bands emerged in all six regions of ftir spectra which revealed the complex pn and ps associated functional groups and compositions of eps badireddy et al 2008 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the ftir profiles for epss1 epss2 epss3 and epss4 were comparable which indicated that the main functional groups were quite semblable for the four eps nevertheless a closer investigation demonstrated that the ftir profile of epss1 was different from those of epss2 epss3 and epss4 based on the literature screening the detailed bands assigned for ftir spectral features of eps are listed in table 1 badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the bands at 1630 1552 1295 1137 1053 1037 and 664 cm 1 observed for all four eps indicating that all the eps contained pn ps lipids dna and aromatic compounds with abundance of functional groups such as c o nh2 n h c n co nh c oh c o c o c etc the bands at 1630 1552 and 1295 cm 1 in ftir of epss2 epss3 and epss4 became weaker than in ftir of epss1 revealing the relatively lower amount of c o stretch associated with pn co nh of pn and secondary amides of pn in ftir of epss2 epss3 and epss4 than in epss1 table 1 appearance of gradually weaker bands at 1137 1053 and 1037 cm 1 in epss2 epss3 and epss4 than in epss1 indicated lower amount of ps c oh c o c and c o associated bands with ps in epss2 epss3 and epss4 than in epss1 these results were consistent with the content of pn and ps detected in the above results which confirmed that the addition of bc could reduce the pn and ps secretion a weak band at 910 cm 1 was only detected in ftir of epss1 directly suggesting the presence of o p o stretches associated with nucleic acids wang et al 2018 reported that relatively higher levels of o p o stretches in eps might originate from the excessive release of nucleic acids under the endogenous decay of bacteria in sbr therefore the only detected o p o stretches associated with nucleic acids in epss1 might arise due to the toxicity of phenol whereas the addition of bc could lower the toxicity of phenol and thus no o p o stretches were observed in epss2 epss3 and epss4 which was consistent with the results of ros and ldh qu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 in addition other weak bands at 1462 and 1403 cm 1 were only detected in ftir of epss1 indicating the relative higher amount of coo namely the acidic nature of eps components in epss1 than in epss2 epss3 and epss4 the bands at 664 cm 1 in ftir of epss2 epss3 and epss4 became weaker than in ftir of epss1 which suggested relatively lower contents of aromatic compounds and nucleic acids in epss2 epss3 and epss4 than that in epss1 moreover quantitative analysis of the second derivative spectra and the curve fitting of the original infrared spectra for the amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 were performed as shown in fig s6 and table s5 the peak intensity and proportion of secondary structures of all proteins gradually decreased with the increase of bc dosage the distinguishable ftir spectral features and the protein secondary structure of epss1 from epss2 epss3 and epss4 arose due to bc addition 3 5 analysis of microbial community in sbrs 3 5 1 overall responses of bacterial community to bc the sludge samples from day 20 s1 20 s2 20 s3 20 and s4 20 day 50 s1 50 s2 50 s3 50 and s4 50 were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform the 47137 74642 effective sequence tags were yield and the otu numbers ranged from 1161 to 1496 at the clustering threshold of 97 for the 9 samples table s6 results of this study showed that 99 9 of the sequences attributed to bacteria the coverage for all the samples was 99 reflecting that the sequencing results represented the real situation of the samples shannon diversity was significantly reduced in response to bc exposure on day 20 and 50 shannon diversity was significantly negatively correlated with the increase in bc dosage rp 0 913 p 0 05 moreover bc significantly increased the simpson index on day 20 and 50 and the simpson index showed significant positive correlation with bc dosage on day 20 rp 0 959 p 0 05 it indicated that bc exhibited significantly negative effects on bacterial diversity dca analysis showed that s1 20 and s1 50 clustered together and separated from other groups fig s7 dissimilarity analyses by anosim and premanova also indicated that bc treated sbrs was significantly distinct from the sbr without bc r 0 660 p 0 01 r 2 0 381 p 0 01 these results revealed that bc significantly altered bacterial communities especially the dominant populations and might have an impact on system functions 3 5 2 significantly changed genera in response to bc illumina miseq results indicated that bacterial community was mainly composed of 14 genera in all the 8 samples fig 6 overall microbial communities were altered significantly with the addition of different bc dosages which might be attributed to the formation of biofilm on bc surface sem proved the formation of biofilm on bc surface fig 7 on day 20 comamonas 23 and thauera 17 were the most two predominant genera in s1 followed by rudaea stenotrophomonas petrimonas rhodanobacter cupriavidus ferruginibacter chryseobacterium pandora dokdonella dyella achromobacter and burkholderia with the addition of different dosage of bc the abundance of thauera was sharply dropped by 56 81 with the addition of bc thauera is generally known as denitrifying bacteria with the ability to degrade aromatic organic compounds to some extent mechichi et al 2002 liu et al 2013 in the sbrs using phenol as the only carbon source the existence of competition among microbes resulted in the washout of the genera with relatively poor phenol degradation performance on the contrary the relative abundance of comamonas increased from 25 to 35 with the increase in bc dosage and showed significant positive correlation with bc dosage on day 20 rp 0 943 p 0 05 in addition the abundance of cupriavidus which only accounted for 3 of total microbial population in s1 sharply increased from 25 to 45 with the bc dosage increased from 1 to 4 g l on day 20 and became the most predominant genus in s3 and s4 which also exhibited significant positive correlation with bc on day 20 rp 0 904 p 0 05 bc could support the growth of biofilm and selectively enriched functional microbes tightly attached to it su et al 2019 therefore the enhanced phenol degradation performance in bc treated sbrs at the first stage was mainly dependent on the enrichment of genera comamonas and cupriavidus which were known as efficient phenol degraders shi et al 2015 tiwari et al 2017 min et al 2018 similar result was obtained by zhao et al 2018 that the relative abundance of nitrobenzene reducting bacteria was enriched in bc containing systems song et al 2019 also demonstrated that bc addition would enrich the dominant microbes related to petroleum hydrocarbon transformation in anaerobically activated sludge system on day 50 with the increase of phenol concentration the abundance of comamonas decreased to 15 in s1 indicating that high concentration of phenol might inhibit the growth of comamonas however the relative abundance of comamonas in bc treated sbrs on day 50 27 45 in s2 s4 was even higher than that on day 20 indicating that bc addition apparently lowered phenol toxicity to comamonas the relative abundance of cupriavidus in s2 s4 was lower on day 50 than that on day 20 while gradually promoted with the increase of bc dosage compared to that in s1 indicating that cupriavidus was sensitive to high concentration of phenol while the addition of bc alleviated the phenol toxicity to cupriavidus to some extent these results indicating that the biofilm on bc might protect the microbes inside from inhibitory effects of the toxic compounds canonical correspondence analysis cca was performed in order to indentify the relationship between bacterial community structure and environmental parameters on the basis of variance inflation factors vif and 999 monte carlo permutations three significant environmental parameters bc dosage phenol concentration and cod were chosen in the cca biplot fig s8 among all the environmental parameters the bc dosage was the most important which strongly correlated to bacterial community structure whereas phenol concentration and cod showed relatively weaker correlation with bacterial community structure previous reports only confirmed that single bc dosage 1 5 g l and 4 g l could significantly alter bacterial communities and enrich the relative abundance of degradation related species thus enhance the degradation performance of nitrobenzene and pyridine zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 based on our study all the tested bc dosage addition 1 4 g l significantly altered the bacterial communities and enriched the dominant microbes related to phenol degrading species and this enrichment increased with the increase of bc dosage thus best phenol degradation performance in sbr was achieved at bc dosage of 4 g l 4 conclusion this study showed that bc exhibited protective rather than toxic effects on sludge microbes in sbrs leading to the decrease of intracellular ros production in bc treated sbrs bc enhanced the treatment performance of phenol because of bc dosage showed significant positive correlation with dha activity atp content ph and c23o activity moreover functional groups and components of eps were changed with bc addition the composition and structure of inherent activated sludge bacterial communities were significantly shifted in response to bc addition comamonas and cupriavidus were mainly responsible for the enhancement phenol

elsewhere niu et al 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 absorptive properties of aoms algal derived oms are expected to incorporate a more significant proportion of protein like compounds as compared to terrestrial nom higher ton toc ratio determined for aoms confirmed this assumption table 1 sr in table 1 is the ratio between the absorbance slope from 275 to 295 nm divided by the slope from 325 to 355 nm sr was previously recommended as an indicator for the overall molecular weight mw of oms helms et al 2008 based on the sr values the overall average molecular weight of ma aom and bg aoms is lower than that of sr hpo at 20 mg c l bg aom and ma aom have significantly lower absorbance in the ultraviolet and visible light uv vis region than sr hpo fig 1 correspondingly the specific uv absorption at 254 nm suva calculated for ma aom and bg aom was very low this low light absorbance of algal derived om was also reported in past studies fang et al 2010 henderson et al 2008 the aliphatic nature of microbial derived substances in both aom isolates is in agreement with their low suva the absorbance at 355 nm a355 an indicator for the abundance of chromophores guo et al 2007 rochelle newall and fisher 2002 was also one order of magnitude lower for both aoms than that for sr hpo hence unlike hydrophobic acids for which the photosensitized production of oh was demonstrated the efficiency of bg aom and ma aom as natural photosensitisers of oh was anticipated to be significantly lower 3 2 photosensitized production of oh although nitrates or nitrites were not expected in our reconstituted aom solutions analyses performed with sensitive ic confirmed our assumption data not shown fenton photochemistry involving h2o2 and fe ⅱ is an important source of oh in sunlit natural waters mostofa et al 2013 southworth and voelker 2003 but was unlikely to interfere in reconstituted solutions of purified noms used at a concentration of 5 mm benzene was the dominant scavenger in the sunlit solution interestingly the acceleration rates of phenol formation d phoh dt in the presence of sr hpo bg aom and ma aom were comparable fig 2 p oh values were also comparable to those previously reported for different types of oms dong and rosario ortiz 2012 mopper and zhou 1990 vaughan and blough 1998 this finding confirms that aom is another photochemical source of oh in aquatic systems the same level of p oh fig 2 produced from significantly lower light absorbing organic compounds fig 1 compared to sr hpo suggests the oh quantum yields for the two aoms be much higher the quantum yield for nom photosensitized production of oh ϕ n o m o h was determined by the ratio between p oh unit converted to mole m 3 s 1 for calculation and photons einstein m 2 s 1 absorbed the calculation was described in equation 2 and equation 3 2 ϕ n o m o h p oh l e 300 400 300 400 i λ 1 10 a λ l 3 e 300 400 k o b s p n a 2 303 ϕ p n a p y r 300 400 i λ ε λ p n a l is the optical path length of the reaction solution which is 0 05 m i λ refers to the normalized light intensity weight at λ the suntest irradiation spectrum from 300 to 400 nm was normalized to 1 similar to the calculation model in canonica et al 2008 a λ cm 1 is the absorbance of nom at wavelength λ e 300 400 einstein m 2 s 1 is the photon flux in the wavelength range of 300 400 nm obtained with pna pyr actinometer k o b s p n a s 1 is the observed first order rate constant of pna under the same irradiation conditions ϕ p n a p y r is the quantum yield of pna ϕ p n a p y r of 0 0032 mol e 1 was obtained based on calculation described elsewhere laszakovits et al 2016 ε λ p n a is the molar absorptivity of pna m2 mol 1 at wavelength λ sr hpo exhibited a ϕ s r h p o o h of 8 44 1 1 10 6 in this study fig 3 this value is reasonable and comparable with literature data dong rosario ortiz reported the ϕ n o m o h of different sr nom isolates to be 2 99 to 4 56 10 5 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 these higher values could be rationalised because the dominant irradiance spectra in our suntest are from 320 to 400 nm while the former work applied irradiance from 290 to 400 nm moreover oh quantum yield maxima of srfa was found to be in the range of 310 320 nm which was filtered in our experimental setup in the range of 320 400 nm the quantum yield decreased with increasing irradiation wavelength vaughan and blough 1998 additionally when determining the quantum yield of pna a recently updated equation was used laszakovits et al 2016 which gave a lower ϕ p n a p y r than the original equation used by dong and rosario ortiz 2012 dulin and mill 1982 these explain the lower ϕ n o m o h obtained in the present work ϕ b g a o m o h and ϕ b g a o m o h were determined to be 3 03 0 53 10 5 and 2 18 0 21 10 5 both are significantly higher than sr hpo indicating that these two aoms were optically more efficient in photosensitizing oh production this result suggests that the contribution of aoms as photochemical source of oh should not be underestimated in algal impacted resources when taking into account the toc content of the irradiated solutions i e normalized by toc p n o m oh aoms were shown to be as effective in photosensitizing oh production as sr hpo additionally they are more optically efficient with quantum yields being 2 3 times higher than sr hpo 3 3 unique characteristics of aom the unique chemical composition of nom fractions was characterised to provide insight into the corresponding components that potentially resulted in the high ϕ n o m o h the feem of bg aom and ma aom were obtained and compared with sr hpo fig 4 assignment of components on feem was described in some past studies fang et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 sr hpo showed the representative feem of terrestrial om i centred at λ ex 320 nm λ ex 420 nm this conforms to feem previously recorded for srfa chen et al 2003 fang et al 2010 ma aom appeared more representative of biologically impacted isolates featuring aromatic protein like moieties ii λ ex 225 nm λ ex 350 nm and soluble microbial substances iii λ ex 280 nm λ ex 350 nm in a previous study characterising ocean water fluorophores component iii was correlated to tryptophan yamashita and tanoue 2003 bg aom displayed a component at λ ex 250 nm and λ ex 350 nm with supplement of humic acid like component iv centred at λ ex 320 nm λ ex 420 nm the peak at 250nm 350 nm was never documented in feem of waters but this region could be assigned as either aromatic protein like or soluble microbial substances hence aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances are the distinct components of bg aom and ma aom not observed in sr hpo that are tentatively proposed to contribute to the higher ϕ n o m o h of aom complementarily fticr ms provided unique molecular signatures of each isolate the component assignment on the van krevelen diagram was adapted from niu et al 2018 and is available in si fig s2 firstly in agreement with table 1 the overall molecular weight of sr hpo was higher than ma aom and bg aom fig s3 secondly the van krevelen diagrams of the three isolates also showed significant differences sr hpo featured representative signatures of terrestrial organic matter that are predominantly lignin like or carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram niu et al 2018a contrariwise ma aom and bg aom bear insignificant lignin like moieties or cram instead they are enriched in aliphatic molecules h c 1 0 that are predominantly n containing fig 5 these molecules are assigned as protein like and lipid like and could be related to the protein like and soluble microbial substances in the respective feem also bg aom still contains some cram which were absent in ma aom difference in agreement with eem these results confirmed and improved our understanding of the unique components of aoms i e aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances thirdly it could be proposed from fig 5 that the aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances are related to the compounds with high h c h c 1 0 and low o c o c 0 4 area 1 2 in the unique molecules of ma aom in fig 5 molecules in area 1 were not usually observed in aquatic nom but they were detected in organic matter extracted from plant biomass ohno et al 2010 it is important to note that ohno et al 2010 also classified the molecules in area 1 as lignin derivatives molecules of area 2 refer to aliphatic cho molecules e g fatty acids and peptides n ohno et al 2010 molecules of area 1 are more likely the aromatic protein like moieties detected in the eem ex em 225 350 because the presence of aromatic moieties in area 2 is unlikely h c 2 0 in addition to molecules in the cram region the unique signatures of bg aom are composed of n containing molecules that are more oxidized protein like molecules area 3 and derivatives of carbohydrates area 4 molecules in area 4 were unlikely to be recorded on the feem in fig 4 because carbohydrate fluorescence occurs at a much longer excitation wavelength for example amylose is a glycosidic polysaccharide its excitation wavelength was recorded to be over 490 nm kitamura et al 1982 hence area 3 molecules are proposed for the unknown feem peak of bg aom ex em 250 350 although individual compounds of aom contributing to photosensitization are difficult to pinpoint past studies documented the photosensitizing activities of various biomolecules nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh photosensitized the formation of superoxide anion and singlet oxygen under irradiation of 290 405 nm hadjur et al 1994 a mechanism involving the excitation of nadh to its excited singlet state and the subsequent triplet state via intersystem crossing was proposed hadjur et al 1994 photosensitized production of oh by c phycocyanin a phycobiliprotein representative formula c33h38n4o6 from microalgae spirulina a genus of free floating filamentous cyanobacteria was reported zhang et al 1999 the c phycocyanin sensitized oh production partly involved h2o2 with the other part of the oh produced by some as of yet unknown photo induced electron transfer processes zhang et al 1999 a regional plot of c phycocyanin and its derivatives on the van krevelen diagram would embody them into area 1 of figure 5 hence the photochemical and the characterisation results of this study correlate to literature finding that illustrated the photosensitizing properties of model biomolecules such photosensitized oh productions proceed with a similar fashion with those proposed for fulvic and humic substances hadjur et al 1994 interestingly the allochthonous noms e g sr hpo tend to exert a much more significant quenching effect on excited triplet states than autochthonous nom e g aom in this study that are rich in aliphatic moieties niu et al 2018b it is thus worth considering that internal quenching effect of the aom matrix was insignificant compared with sr hpo potentially contributing to a higher apparent quantum yield of oh 4 conclusions implications 1 aoms with insignificant terrestrial inputs are effective photosensitisers for oh and the apparent quantum yield was considerably higher than sr hpo 2 aom fluorescence components that are likely responsible for the higher ϕ n o m o h than sr hpo include the microbial derived aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances this finding may explain why effluent organic matter efom showed higher photochemical quantum yield of oh in several previous studies for example dong and rosario ortiz reported that efom from municipal wastewater treatment plants in colorado had a higher ϕ n o m o h than sr nom dong and rosario ortiz 2012 an efom isolate jeddah saudi arabia containing both fulvic like components and protein like components exhibited a higher yield of oh normalized by toc as compared with sr hpo niu et al 2014 efom isolates were known to contain fulvic acid like humic acid like and autochthonous moieties due to applied biological treatment processes chen et al 2003 dignac et al 2000 niu et al 2014 hence higher ϕ n o m o h obtained from efom incorporated the contribution from aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances as reported in this study 3 fticr ms confirmed that the unique formulas of aom are mainly aromatic protein like the unique feem peak of bg aom at 250 350 was tentatively assigned to derivatives of amino sugar with relatively high o c 0 5 0 7 on the van krevelen diagram declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no conflict of

aom solutions were also analysed on an ics 90 ion chromatography apparatus dionex to confirm the absence of no3 and no2 fticr ms characterisation of aoms was achieved using a 12t bruker solarix mass spectrometer bruker daltonics bremen germany and an apollo ii electrospray ionization esi source in negative mode the detailed configurations and the associated data analysis procedures were described elsewhere niu et al 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 absorptive properties of aoms algal derived oms are expected to incorporate a more significant proportion of protein like compounds as compared to terrestrial nom higher ton toc ratio determined for aoms confirmed this assumption table 1 sr in table 1 is the ratio between the absorbance slope from 275 to 295 nm divided by the slope from 325 to 355 nm sr was previously recommended as an indicator for the overall molecular weight mw of oms helms et al 2008 based on the sr values the overall average molecular weight of ma aom and bg aoms is lower than that of sr hpo at 20 mg c l bg aom and ma aom have significantly lower absorbance in the ultraviolet and visible light uv vis region than sr hpo fig 1 correspondingly the specific uv absorption at 254 nm suva calculated for ma aom and bg aom was very low this low light absorbance of algal derived om was also reported in past studies fang et al 2010 henderson et al 2008 the aliphatic nature of microbial derived substances in both aom isolates is in agreement with their low suva the absorbance at 355 nm a355 an indicator for the abundance of chromophores guo et al 2007 rochelle newall and fisher 2002 was also one order of magnitude lower for both aoms than that for sr hpo hence unlike hydrophobic acids for which the photosensitized production of oh was demonstrated the efficiency of bg aom and ma aom as natural photosensitisers of oh was anticipated to be significantly lower 3 2 photosensitized production of oh although nitrates or nitrites were not expected in our reconstituted aom solutions analyses performed with sensitive ic confirmed our assumption data not shown fenton photochemistry involving h2o2 and fe ⅱ is an important source of oh in sunlit natural waters mostofa et al 2013 southworth and voelker 2003 but was unlikely to interfere in reconstituted solutions of purified noms used at a concentration of 5 mm benzene was the dominant scavenger in the sunlit solution interestingly the acceleration rates of phenol formation d phoh dt in the presence of sr hpo bg aom and ma aom were comparable fig 2 p oh values were also comparable to those previously reported for different types of oms dong and rosario ortiz 2012 mopper and zhou 1990 vaughan and blough 1998 this finding confirms that aom is another photochemical source of oh in aquatic systems the same level of p oh fig 2 produced from significantly lower light absorbing organic compounds fig 1 compared to sr hpo suggests the oh quantum yields for the two aoms be much higher the quantum yield for nom photosensitized production of oh ϕ n o m o h was determined by the ratio between p oh unit converted to mole m 3 s 1 for calculation and photons einstein m 2 s 1 absorbed the calculation was described in equation 2 and equation 3 2 ϕ n o m o h p oh l e 300 400 300 400 i λ 1 10 a λ l 3 e 300 400 k o b s p n a 2 303 ϕ p n a p y r 300 400 i λ ε λ p n a l is the optical path length of the reaction solution which is 0 05 m i λ refers to the normalized light intensity weight at λ the suntest irradiation spectrum from 300 to 400 nm was normalized to 1 similar to the calculation model in canonica et al 2008 a λ cm 1 is the absorbance of nom at wavelength λ e 300 400 einstein m 2 s 1 is the photon flux in the wavelength range of 300 400 nm obtained with pna pyr actinometer k o b s p n a s 1 is the observed first order rate constant of pna under the same irradiation conditions ϕ p n a p y r is the quantum yield of pna ϕ p n a p y r of 0 0032 mol e 1 was obtained based on calculation described elsewhere laszakovits et al 2016 ε λ p n a is the molar absorptivity of pna m2 mol 1 at wavelength λ sr hpo exhibited a ϕ s r h p o o h of 8 44 1 1 10 6 in this study fig 3 this value is reasonable and comparable with literature data dong rosario ortiz reported the ϕ n o m o h of different sr nom isolates to be 2 99 to 4 56 10 5 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 these higher values could be rationalised because the dominant irradiance spectra in our suntest are from 320 to 400 nm while the former work applied irradiance from 290 to 400 nm moreover oh quantum yield maxima of srfa was found to be in the range of 310 320 nm which was filtered in our experimental setup in the range of 320 400 nm the quantum yield decreased with increasing irradiation wavelength vaughan and blough 1998 additionally when determining the quantum yield of pna a recently updated equation was used laszakovits et al 2016 which gave a lower ϕ p n a p y r than the original equation used by dong and rosario ortiz 2012 dulin and mill 1982 these explain the lower ϕ n o m o h obtained in the present work ϕ b g a o m o h and ϕ b g a o m o h were determined to be 3 03 0 53 10 5 and 2 18 0 21 10 5 both are significantly higher than sr hpo indicating that these two aoms were optically more efficient in photosensitizing oh production this result suggests that the contribution of aoms as photochemical source of oh should not be underestimated in algal impacted resources when taking into account the toc content of the irradiated solutions i e normalized by toc p n o m oh aoms were shown to be as effective in photosensitizing oh production as sr hpo additionally they are more optically efficient with quantum yields being 2 3 times higher than sr hpo 3 3 unique characteristics of aom the unique chemical composition of nom fractions was characterised to provide insight into the corresponding components that potentially resulted in the high ϕ n o m o h the feem of bg aom and ma aom were obtained and compared with sr hpo fig 4 assignment of components on feem was described in some past studies fang et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 sr hpo showed the representative feem of terrestrial om i centred at λ ex 320 nm λ ex 420 nm this conforms to feem previously recorded for srfa chen et al 2003 fang et al 2010 ma aom appeared more representative of biologically impacted isolates featuring aromatic protein like moieties ii λ ex 225 nm λ ex 350 nm and soluble microbial substances iii λ ex 280 nm λ ex 350 nm in a previous study characterising ocean water fluorophores component iii was correlated to tryptophan yamashita and tanoue 2003 bg aom displayed a component at λ ex 250 nm and λ ex 350 nm with supplement of humic acid like component iv centred at λ ex 320 nm λ ex 420 nm the peak at 250nm 350 nm was never documented in feem of waters but this region could be assigned as either aromatic protein like or soluble microbial substances hence aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances are the distinct components of bg aom and ma aom not observed in sr hpo that are tentatively proposed to contribute to the higher ϕ n o m o h of aom complementarily fticr ms provided unique molecular signatures of each isolate the component assignment on the van krevelen diagram was adapted from niu et al 2018 and is available in si fig s2 firstly in agreement with table 1 the overall molecular weight of sr hpo was higher than ma aom and bg aom fig s3 secondly the van krevelen diagrams of the three isolates also showed significant differences sr hpo featured representative signatures of terrestrial organic matter that are predominantly lignin like or carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram niu et al 2018a contrariwise ma aom and bg aom bear insignificant lignin like moieties or cram instead they are enriched in aliphatic molecules h c 1 0 that are predominantly n containing fig 5 these molecules are assigned as protein like and lipid like and could be related to the protein like and soluble microbial substances in the respective feem also bg aom still contains some cram which were absent in ma aom difference in agreement with eem these results confirmed and improved our understanding of the unique components of aoms i e aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances thirdly it could be proposed from fig 5 that the aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances are related to the compounds with high h c h c 1 0 and low o c o c 0 4 area 1 2 in the unique molecules of ma aom in fig 5 molecules in area 1 were not usually observed in aquatic nom but they were detected in organic matter extracted from plant biomass ohno et al 2010 it is important to note that ohno et al 2010 also classified the molecules in area 1 as lignin derivatives molecules of area 2 refer to aliphatic cho molecules e g fatty acids and peptides n ohno et al 2010 molecules of area 1 are more likely the aromatic protein like moieties detected in the eem ex em 225 350 because the presence of aromatic moieties in area 2 is unlikely h c 2 0 in addition to molecules in the cram region the unique signatures of bg aom are composed of n containing molecules that are more oxidized protein like molecules area 3 and derivatives of carbohydrates area 4 molecules in area 4 were unlikely to be recorded on the feem in fig 4 because carbohydrate fluorescence occurs at a much longer excitation wavelength for example amylose is a glycosidic polysaccharide its excitation wavelength was recorded to be over 490 nm kitamura et al 1982 hence area 3 molecules are proposed for the unknown feem peak of bg aom ex em 250 350 although individual compounds of aom contributing to photosensitization are difficult to pinpoint past studies documented the photosensitizing activities of various biomolecules nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh photosensitized the formation of superoxide anion and singlet oxygen under irradiation of 290 405 nm hadjur et al 1994 a mechanism involving the excitation of nadh to its excited singlet state and the subsequent triplet state via intersystem crossing was proposed hadjur et al 1994 photosensitized production of oh by c phycocyanin a phycobiliprotein representative formula c33h38n4o6 from microalgae spirulina a genus of free floating filamentous cyanobacteria was reported zhang et al 1999 the c phycocyanin sensitized oh production partly involved h2o2 with the other part of the oh produced by some as of yet unknown photo induced electron transfer processes zhang et al 1999 a regional plot of c phycocyanin and its derivatives on the van krevelen diagram would embody them into area 1 of figure 5 hence the photochemical and the characterisation results of this study correlate to literature finding that illustrated the photosensitizing properties of model biomolecules such photosensitized oh productions proceed with a similar fashion with those proposed for fulvic and humic substances hadjur et al 1994 interestingly the allochthonous noms e g sr hpo tend to exert a much more significant quenching effect on excited triplet states than autochthonous nom e g aom in this study that are rich in aliphatic moieties niu et al 2018b it is thus worth considering that internal quenching effect of the aom matrix was insignificant compared with sr hpo potentially contributing to a higher apparent quantum yield of oh 4 conclusions implications 1 aoms with insignificant terrestrial inputs are effective photosensitisers for oh and the apparent quantum yield was considerably higher than sr hpo 2 aom fluorescence components that are likely responsible for the higher ϕ n o m o h than sr hpo include the microbial derived aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances this finding may explain why effluent organic matter efom showed higher photochemical quantum yield of oh in several previous studies for example dong and rosario ortiz reported that efom from municipal wastewater treatment plants in colorado had a higher ϕ n o m o h than sr nom dong and rosario ortiz 2012 an efom isolate jeddah saudi arabia containing both fulvic like components and protein like components exhibited a higher yield of oh normalized by toc as compared with sr hpo niu et al 2014 efom isolates were known to contain fulvic acid like humic acid like and autochthonous moieties due to applied biological treatment processes chen et al 2003 dignac et al 2000 niu et al 2014 hence higher ϕ n o m o h obtained from efom incorporated the contribution from aromatic protein like and soluble microbial substances as reported in this study 3 fticr ms confirmed that the unique formulas of aom are mainly aromatic protein like the unique feem peak of bg aom at 250 350 was tentatively assigned to derivatives of amino sugar with relatively high o c 0 5 0 7 on the van krevelen diagram declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no conflict of
