8350,study region the great barrier reef catchment is located adjacent to the world s largest coral reef system the great barrier reef in eastern queensland australia study focus this study characterized the geologic and hydrogeologic settings and evaluated the influence of regional faults on groundwater flow 3d geological models of six regions within the catchment were constructed using drill log data from 49 000 wells digital elevation models and surface geological maps the 3d models were then integrated with potentiometric surface maps and faults data to conceptualize the hydraulic relationships of aquifer units and estimate groundwater development potentials potentiometric surfaces and fault orientations were used to conceptualize groundwater flow directions new hydrological insights for the region the 3d geological and hydrogeological characterizations revealed previously unknown faults and aquifer units in the study area the study found that the central regions consisted of fractured and porous unconfined aquifers while confined aquifers which extend to the coast and likely beyond were also found in the northern and southern most regions the orientations of the faults trended in nw se directions and could form conduits for south easterly groundwater flow as opposed to the predominate easterly flow in the porous unconfined and confined aquifers the 3d models aquifer connectivities and geometries provided crucial information to determine groundwater development potentials and offer a first step in developing local and regional groundwater flow and contaminant transport models keywords aquifer type fault orientation groundwater catchment groundwater flow lithological model queensland 1 introduction the coastal aquifers adjacent to the great barrier reef gbr are essential to the region s terrestrial and aquatic livelihood agriculture mining tourism urban development and other interests are all heavily dependent on the gbr aquifers health and sustainability narayan et al 2003 coastal aquifer systems are important as they mark the interface between terrestrial and aquatic settings these include coastal processes such as seawater intrusion submarine groundwater discharge sgd and nutrient fluxes which can only be explained through comprehensive characterizations of coastal aquifer systems in the gbr catchment groundwater extraction has led to saltwater intrusion especially in heavily pumped areas like the lower burdekin region narayan et al 2003 aquifer protection from terrestrial sources of contamination including nutrient leaching from agricultural farms is also important as a portion of stored aquifer water can be discharged as sgd and serve as a pathway for aquatic nutrient enrichment to sensitive coastal ecosystems stieglitz 2005 slomp and cappellen 2004 given the importance of the coastal aquifers adjacent to the gbr on terrestrial and marine systems the lack of a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the region s hydrogeologic setting remains a major obstacle to understanding and predicting the significance of its groundwater system the hydrogeology of an aquifer system is often characterised through the construction of 3d geological models and the development of geological history unnikrishnan et al 2018 maliva 2016 3d geological models enable direct evaluations of the spatial distributions stratifications and volumes of lithologic units hassen et al 2016 this information can then be used to define aquifer characteristics including groundwater flow groundwater potential aquifer connectivities and geometries kumar et al 2017 zhou and li 2011 large scale 3d hydrogeological models allow the evaluation of trans boundary geological controls of groundwater flow and the temporal effects of human pressures and climate change on groundwater resources and groundwater dependent ecosystems cloutier et al 2015 large scale 3d aquifer characterizations have been developed in different parts of the globe e g hassen et al 2016 hamdi et al 2018 weissmann et al 1999 and across australia including the aquifers in southern perth basin csiro 2009 musgrave province south australia ley cooper and munday 2013 galilee and eromanga basins moya et al 2014 great artesian basin radke et al 2000 and the murray darling basin murray darling basin commission 2000 however to date a comprehensive 3d hydrogeologic framework has not been constructed for many important coastal aquifers including those adjacent to the gbr borehole data e g drill logs are often the backbone on which 3d models are built however collecting drill log data is labour intensive and costly and developing a representative subsurface geology map from the data can be challenging as it requires a dense dataset to accurately describe geological heterogeneities raiber et al 2015 therefore finding the optimum number of observations to develop a representative subsurface geology map of an aquifer is often a balance between data availability drilling expenses model uncertainties and computing power linde et al 2015 as an outgrowth of these limitations geological and hydrogeological framework development often relies on geostatistical analyses that can define the most likely values of earth materials locations without actual samples by extrapolating data between known points thorleifson 2015 shishaye et al 2019 for example hamdi et al 2018 used drill log data from 181 wells covering an area of 1100 km2 1 well per 6 km2 to develop a 3d model of the sisseb el alem nadhour saouaf basin north eastern tunisia where they estimated volumes of the productive layers and groundwater storage capacity of the aquifer system mukherjee et al 2007 also used drill log data from 143 wells covering 21 000 km2 1 well per 147 km2 to construct 3d geological model of west bengal india and were able to both qualitatively and quantitatively characterise the hydrostratigraphic setting and groundwater flow of the regional aquifer system while 3d models built with borehole data can be useful for characterising subsurface geological features of an area combining the model with hydrology and fault data can provide much more insight into subsurface hydrodynamics fault networks and orientations can be important drivers of aquifer connectivity and groundwater flow bense et al 2013 scibek et al 2016 combining fault data with 3d geological modelling and interpolated water levels can be used to evaluate groundwater flow directions in geologically complex areas such as fractured aquifer systems fault data are commonly extracted from satellite images and digital elevation models dem which can be validated by fracture data from drill logs wu and bao 2015 hassen et al 2016 applied an integrated method of a 3d geological model and fault orientations to evaluate the probable groundwater flow directions in the kasserine aquifer system in central tunisia and reported high interconnectivity between geological compartments with groundwater flow directions along fault orientations in contrast to topographical gradients achtziger zupancic et al 2016 also applied similar methods to evaluate groundwater flow in fractured basement rocks of the ore mountains in germany where they reported significant aquifer permeability due to the highly displaced faults this study aimed to develop a regional scale framework for the aquifers adjacent to the gbr we compiled and characterized the 3d geological settings of the aquifer systems in the gbr catchment using existing borehole data dem and surface geological maps we then identified lithological similarities in the subsurface to designate aquifer types volumes and connectivity we also used fracture data from drill logs dem extracted lineaments and existing faults data to construct fault network maps finally we combined regional hydrogeologic frameworks and fault orientations with interpolations of groundwater level data to predict representative regional groundwater flow directions this study provides crucial information to determine groundwater development potentials sgd and groundwater nutrient discharge and for a more robust understanding of how aquifer dynamics influence the overlying terrestrial and adjoining marine environments 2 methods 2 1 study area the gbr catchment is located along the eastern coast of australia and has a total catchment area of 464 404 km2 which is approximately 25 of the area of queensland fig 1 the great dividing range sets the inland divide for the gbr catchment separating the catchment from inland watersheds mackey et al 2010 the gbr catchment contains six natural resource management regions fig 1 hereafter named as gbr regions with approximately 40 significant watersheds draining into the gbr lagoon the gbr catchment contains some of the most heavily used agricultural land in australia and also supports large scale grazing forestry mining and urban development waterhouse et al 2016 the gbr regions have a two season climate with a warm dry winter season from may to october and a hot wet summer from november to april the precipitation regimes range from an average rainfall of 2010 mmyr 1 in the tropical north 1000 mmyr 1 in sub tropical southern extents to 500 mmyr 1 in the dry tropics central part of the catchment with 80 of rainfall occurring in the wetter summer months garzon garcia et al 2015 2 2 gbr geological history the geology of the gbr catchment dates back as far as the phanerozoic era with the rocks in the catchment ranging from palaeozoic to cainozoic eras fig s1 of the electronic supplementary material esm blake and kilgour 2012 the majority 60 of the catchment is covered by formations from the palaeozoic to mesozoic eras fig s1 of the esm bain and draper 1997 henderson and stephenson 1980 sedimentary rocks cover 41 of the gbr catchment followed by igneous rocks 30 unconsolidated sediments 27 and metamorphic rocks 2 fig 1 igneous rocks are the dominant rock types in the coastal borders while sedimentary rocks and sediments cover the vast majority of the west and north of the gbr catchment fig 1 the constant circulation of earth materials in the forearc regions as a result of subduction of the pacific plate oceanic floor subduction caused igneous rocks with a mixture of metamorphic and sedimentary sequences in eastern gbr catchment symonds et al 1983 while sedimentation from the queensland plateau south eastern cape york and the mossman orogen resulted in sedimentary rocks in the north gbr shaanan et al 2018 johnson 2016 turner et al 2009 reported that there were six major cycles of sedimentation in the central and southern gbr catchment between the jurassic to cretaceous periods the study reported that each of the cycles commenced with sandy deposits of high energy braided river systems and terminated with mudrock deposits of low energy meandering rivers lakes and mires which may explain the sedimentary rocks in the burdekin fitzroy and burnett regions fig 1 2 3 data collection and analysis 2 3 1 3d geological modelling drill log data from 49 605 wells fig s2a of the esm in the gbr catchment were obtained from the queensland government groundwater database www data qld gov au detailed data quality and consistency validations were conducted before using the data for 3d geologic modelling supplementary text 1 of the esm the data from each well included layer based lithological and stratigraphic information and well depths 3d lithological models and fence diagrams of the study area were built in rockworks 17 software rockworks 2017 for each of the six gbr regions fig 1 areas between the wells were interpolated using a lateral blending algorithm with a strong horizontal weighting component while defining the interpolation of values on the top boundary ground surface by the dem and below an imaginary bottom surface by the lowest points of the borehole data the algorithm assigned the borehole data to voxels immediately surrounding each borehole then the assignment moves progressively away from the boreholes using the nearest neighbour approach until reaching one third of the distance between boreholes at these distant voxels a randomizing algorithm in the centre areas minimizes abrupt changes between material types finally the superface filter of the rockworks 17 software was used to clip the block model of each region to the shape of the regions the lithologic uncertainty introduced by using different numbers of wells for each model area was analysed by quantifying the volume of each lithology as a function of the number of well logs used to create the geological model volume stability with the change in the number of wells was used as a confirmation of defendable models the distribution of wells with depth was also used to indicate areas or specific subsurface layers that need further investigations for detail understanding of the geological and hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifers 2 3 2 fault network mapping surface geology and faults network analyses were used to produce a detailed fault network map of the gbr catchment and to relate the faults to specific rock types the analysis incorporated a digital surface geological map geological survey of queensland 2012 queensland digital surface geological map scale1 2 000 000 department of natural resources and mines brisbane dem of the queensland state geological survey of queensland 2012 national geological contacts and faults data fig s3a of the esm geoscience australia 2012 fracture data from drill logs fig s3b of the esm and a review of published documents regarding the geology of the area the rock types were summarized into 26 layers from the approximately 500 geological units mapped by geological survey of queensland 2012 fig s4 of the esm previously developed fault maps in the gbr catchment show only the major faults fig s3a of the esm making it difficult to delineate fractured aquifers and conceptualize groundwater flow directions as both fault density and orientation affect groundwater flow green et al 2010 in order to build on this lineaments were extracted from 10 m by 10 m dem of the catchment using geomatica software geomatics enterprises 2018 fracture data from more than 2500 wells were overlaid with the faults previously mapped and lineament extracted in the gbr catchment on arcmap 10 5 to confirm that the extracted lineaments represent faults and fractures as lineaments could also represent ordinary geological contacts and to validate the locations of the previously mapped major faults fig s3b of the esm the spatial distributions of the faults and fractures were mapped using arcmap 10 5 and overlaid with the modified surface geological map fig s4 of the esm to relate the faults and extent of fracturing with specific rock types this was conducted to identify the highly fractured rock types which is important in fractured aquifer delineations combined with density and intersections of faults elfouly 2000 green et al 2010 in this case depths of the faults were constrained based on the fracture depths from the wells drilled in the fractured zones fig s3b of the esm rose diagrams of fault orientations and histograms of fault lengths were produced in rockworks 17 software to identify regional trends and connectivities that would likely affect groundwater flow 2 3 3 aquifer types groundwater catchments and development potentials the types of aquifers confined v unconfined and fractured v porous in each of the gbr regions were characterized by the 3d geological models faults map a 1 5 m scale hydrogeological map of australia lau et al 1987 and potentiometric surface maps developed based on the water level data from each of the aquifer layers to do this the aquifer systems were firstly classified into confined and unconfined units based on discrete geological units in the 3d geological models classifications of aquifers into confined and unconfined is a function of the subsurface geologic structures water table locations and hydraulic properties therefore the geological barriers and confining layers potentially continuous clay units and consolidated formations and the productive subsurface formations potential groundwater reservoirs fractured rocks and porous unconsolidated formations were first delineated using the characteristics of the lithotypes in the 3d geologic models then the potentiometric surface for each aquifer was interpolated from observed water levels using arcmap 10 5 since the potentiometric surface should be smooth we used it to validate the structural definition of aquifer types by comparing the misfit between the interpolated surface and the observations confined aquifers were delineated where the potentiometric surface was above the topmost elevation of the aquifer unit and unconfined aquifers were delineated where potentiometric surfaces were in equilibrium with atmospheric pressure for the potentiometric surface maps only water levels measured after 2005 were used the data was only used for regional evaluations and local assessments may need to consider seasonal borehole pressures the unconfined aquifers of each region were also classified as fracture dominated fractured unconfined and primary porosity dominated porous unconfined units using the fault network maps fracture data from drill logs and rock type similarities in the fractured unconfined units the spatial distribution of the faults and fractures was mapped using the natural neighbour interpolation technique of the fracture density in arcmap 10 5 using a maximum threshold of 1 fault per 5 km2 however rock type similarities were also used to manually manipulate the fault network maps unconsolidated formations were delineated separately while the consolidated formations located in a close neighbour of the highly fractured formations were considered as fractured aquifers the interpolated fracture density map was then combined appended with the 3d models of the aquifers in rockworks 17 software to delineate fracture dominated unconfined aquifers depths of the fractured aquifers were constrained based on the fracture depths from the drill log data as the drill log based faults and fractures data validated the locations of most of the faults in the gbr catchment fig 3b of the esm the depth of the faults was considered to be the same as the depth of the fully penetrating wells in the fractured areas aquifer connectivity was evaluated by using the structural information from the 3d geological models and the fault network maps aquifer connectivity was predicted where unconsolidated layers were continuous across two or more large scale regions in the gbr catchment and or faults cross the borders of aquifers in two different regions for the fractured aquifers potential groundwater pathways were estimated based on fault orientations and the direction of decreasing hydraulic head in the porous aquifers groundwater pathways were estimated based solely on the hydraulic gradients calculated from the interpolated potentiometric surface finally in order to compare groundwater and surface water catchments and to determine the influence of topography and the subsurface geologic setting on groundwater flow in the gbr catchment groundwater catchments were mapped based on the potentiometric surfaces while surface water catchments were delineated from the dem of the area using arcmap 10 5 groundwater development potentials of the regional aquifers in the gbr catchment were estimated by multiplying the volumes of the saturated aquifer formations from the 3d geological models and the regional average of the depth integrated specific yield values estimated from pumping test data fig s2b the saturated and unsaturated zones of the aquifers were separated using the measured depths of the water table 3 results 3 1 geological characterization 3 1 1 subsurface geology the 3d lithological models and fence diagrams fig 2 a f developed for the six surface topography based regional areas gbr regions showed no continuous layers throughout the gbr catchment however layers like the basalt basement which crossed three model areas fitzroy burdekin and mackay fig 2c d e continued up to 1500 km length covering the whole catchment areas across the central gbr regions the thick sediment and gravel layer overlaying the basements and the shale units underlain by the thick sediment and gravel layers in southern gbr fitzroy and burnett regions fig 2e f also continued up to 1000 km length covering the whole catchment areas across more than one region with varying thickness in the cape york region the majority of the subsurface geology was dominated by sedimentary rocks mainly sandstone and siltstone followed in decreasing volumetric extents by unconsolidated sediments and extrusive and intrusive igneous rocks respectively fig 2a intrusive igneous rocks mainly granite outcropped in the southeast and southwest while basalt formations outcrop in the northern and southern ends of the region fig 2a clay layers also appear on the surface and act as confining layers intercalated with the sandstones in the low elevation areas coastal borders the metamorphic and granitic rocks were overlain by gently dipping sediment and poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks the basement rock unclassified volcanics in the area was 1500 m below the surface the wet tropics region contained eleven major lithological layers fig 2b the late proterozoic cambrian metamorphic rocks located in the south west fig 2b were the oldest rock types fig s1 of the esm the volcanic and plutonic rocks in the region were extensively deformed fig 2b geoscience australia 2012 the region was highly stratified compared to the other areas with a heterogeneous geological structure fig 2b granite and basalt units dominated the geological layers in the south while the northern end was dominated by shale and the coastal borders by unconsolidated sediments the basement rock in the region was located 200 m below the ground surface in addition to sedimentary rocks the upper layer in the burdekin region consisted of regolith formations of weathered rock alluvium colluvium and volcanic rocks fig 2c the basement in the region averagely 100 32 m below the ground surface was modelled as basalt overlain by intrusive volcanic rock intruded from south to north in the southern half of the region fig 2c johnson 2016 this intrusive volcanic rock was separated from the basement in the southeast of the region by a thick clay layer fig 2c the basement rock outcrops in the north and northwest while the northeastern part of the region was dominated by sediment gravel and clay layers the mackay region was influenced by basalt flows originating from volcanism in the great dividing range fig 2d bain and draper 1997 plutonic rocks including diorite and granite sedimentary rocks comprised of shale intercalated with the sediments and gravel layer and clay were also found in the region fig 2d the top layer in the lower east and south of the region was dominated by sediment and gravel layers including weathered sedimentary and igneous rocks deposited from high elevation areas in the west the basement rock basalt 200 m below the ground surface was overlain by shale units in the majority of the region and by unclassified volcanic rocks in the south and north the geology of the fitzroy and burnett regions was distinctly different from the northern regions fig 2 a thick sediment and gravel layer 980 56 m in fitzroy and 896 46 m in burnett regions was modelled overlying the basements of both regions fig 2e f indicating mesozoic sediments extended from the southwest of the catchment in the fitzroy region the shale layer overlying this layer was relatively thinner 172 20 m fig 2e than that of in the burnett region 500 42 m fig 2f the dominant rock types in the uppermost unconfined unit of the fitzroy region were sedimentary rocks mainly sandstones siltstones and shales fig 2e while igneous rocks mainly basalt and granite were dominant in the burnett region fig 2f 3 1 2 uncertainty analysis the maximum available number of wells with drill log data used to produce the 3d lithological models of the cape york wet tropics mackay burdekin fitzroy and burnett regions were 1000 4 677 5 877 9 399 15 642 and 13 010 respectively fig s2 of the esm the distribution of well depths in each region indicated a higher density of wells in the upper quarter of the modelled geology fig 3 the number of wells then decreases with depth fig 3 likely leading to higher model uncertainty in the deeper layers the lithologic uncertainties of each of the 3d models were analysed by quantifying the volume of each lithotype as a function of the number of well logs used to create the geological model fig 4 figs s5 s9 of the esm using a small number of wells relative to the spatial complexity of the geology could lead to inaccurate predictions of unit extents and thicknesses which would lead to inaccurate volumes of each lithology therefore we sought to confirm that the numbers of well logs were sufficient for the volume of each lithology to converge to a representative volume for example the volume of geological units in the cape york region largely stabilizes after 750 wells were used fig 4 the volume of clay in the cape york region was overestimated by almost three times when using data from 600 wells compared to the data from 750 wells fig 4 and the volume of the basalt unit was underestimated by 25 using the same comparison the volumes of deeper units with less borehole data also stabilize as more wells are included in the analysis fig 4 figs s5 s9 of the esm in the cape york region for example fig 4 the changes in the volumes of the deeper lithological units sandstone siltstone and volcanic rocks stabilize after 750 wells are used this same steady state trend was also seen in most geological units in the other modelled regions even across the deeper layers were less data was available figs s5 s9 of the esm 3 1 3 fault network the number of previously mapped faults in the gbr catchment totalled 527 fig s3a of the esm while an additional 1056 lineament extracted faults were mapped by the dem fig 5 a the majority 60 of the faults were found on the eastern half of the gbr catchment fig 5b with densely faulted areas occurring in formations from palaeozoic to mesozoic eras fig s1 of the esm fault densities were also related to specific rock types most of the faults in the southern gbr were found within the arenite granitoid mafite and felsite rock types fig s4 of the esm the mackay and wet tropics regions which were mostly covered with granite and basalt rocks with a significant manifestation of arenites fig s4 of the esm were highly fractured with relatively short fault lengths fig 5b the central gbr catchments mainly fitzroy and burdekin regions were dominated by sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments fig 1 and had a relatively lower density of faults the density of faults was highest in the wet tropics 1 fault per 75 km2 followed by the burnett 1 per 141 km2 cape york 1 per 142 km2 mackay 1 per 163 km2 burdekin 1 per 508 km2 and fitzroy 1 per 701 km2 regions the lengths of the faults across the entire catchment ranged from 0 02 100 km with a mean length of 6 3 0 3 km fig s10 of the esm the majority of the faults trend in the nw se direction fig 6 the mean ray of the orientation of the faults passes through 338 7 nw and 158 7 se with a standard error of 5 8 calculated at a 99 confidence interval fig 6 3 2 hydrogeological characterization 3 2 1 aquifer types the types of aquifers in each regional area were characterized based on the 3d geological models fig 2 faults fig 5 and potentiometric surface maps figs 7 8 the cape york region was found to have three aquifer types fractured and porous unconfined aquifers located in the upper geological layer fig 9a and a lower confined aquifer that is bounded by volcanic rocks in the north and by an upper clay layer and a bottom volcanic rock layer in the south figs 2a 9 a a clay layer also acts as a semi confining unit within the porous unconfined aquifer in the south fig 2a the highest potentiometric surface elevation in the confined aquifer in the central and south of the region was 6 5 m above the land surface which is more than 500 m above the top surface of the aquifer unit while the maximum depth to the water table in the unconfined aquifer was 68 6 m below the ground surface fig 7a 8 a the wet tropics region contained a fractured aquifer in the higher elevation areas while the low elevation areas coastal borders were mainly comprised of a porous unconsolidated unconfined aquifer fig 9 b however the eastern side of the region had localized semi confined aquifers where a clay layer overlays sediment and gravel layers fig 2b the semi confining units in the region fig 2b caused the potentiometric surface to rise up to 1 m above the ground surface while the maximum depth to the water table was 78 6 m below the ground surface fig 7b the regional aquifer types in the burdekin region were porous unconfined and fractured unconfined aquifers fig 9c in the northeast and southwest of the region the aquifer was porous unconfined as it consisted of unconsolidated sediments gravel and weathered sedimentary rocks figs 2c 9 c the extensive clay layers in the region resulted in numerous localized confined and semi confined aquifers which are not visible in the 3d hydrogeologic models because of their small spatial coverage compared to the scale shown in the 3d models fig 9 however they are visible in the heterogeneous 3d lithologic models fig 2c the potentiometric surface elevation in the region fig 7c indicated that the local clay confining layers in the northeast northwest and southwest of the region caused the groundwater levels to reach a maximum of 16 m above the ground surface the mackay region aquifers were mostly fractured unconfined interspersed with areas of being porous unconfined fig 9d the porous unconfined aquifer in the region was in the lower floodplains bordering the coast the potentiometric surface map of the region fig 7d showed no confined units with water levels in the area corresponding to the local water table depth the fitzroy region was the only region in the gbr catchment where the fractured and porous unconfined units covered relatively similar areal extents fig 9e the confined aquifer fig 9e was overlain by a confining shale layer with an average thickness of 172 20 m the potentiometric surface of the confined aquifer fig 8e was as high as 1000 m above the ground surface indicative of high groundwater potential energy while the maximum depth to the water table in the unconfined aquifer was 152 m below the ground surface fig 7e in the burnett region the fractured and porous unconfined aquifers were separated from the confined aquifer by a thick shale confining unit average 500 42 m fig 9f groundwater in the confined aquifer rose up to a maximum of 7 4 m above the ground surface which is around 700 m above the top surface of the water bearing formation fig 8c while the maximum depth to the water table in the porous and fractured unconfined aquifers was 91 3 m below the ground surface fig 7f 3 2 2 aquifer geometries groundwater catchments and development potentials the upper aquifer spanning the whole gbr catchment consists of porous and fractured unconfined aquifers while regional confined aquifers were only identified in the cape york fitzroy and burnett regions fig 9 the upper porous unconfined aquifer covered 33 of the gbr catchment to an average depth of 130 9 m while the fractured aquifer covered 67 of the catchment with an average thickness of 54 5 m fig 9 regionally the porous unconfined aquifer in the fitzroy region covered 57 of the catchment area while it only covers 19 in the wet tropics table 1 the fitzroy region also had the thickest unconfined aquifer layer average 250 22 m while the shallowest was found in the mackay region average 60 7 m the fitzroy region also had the thickest confined aquifer average 980 56 m followed by burnett 896 46 m and cape york 546 41 m regions the largest confined aquifer volume was also found in fitzroy 173 227 5656 km3 followed by the burnett 40 558 1856 km3 and cape york 20 444 974 km3 regions further application of the 3d models assisted to estimate development potentials of the groundwater in the regional aquifers table 2 the estimated values show that the fitzroy region has a higher volume of estimated groundwater development potential followed by the burdekin and burnett regions table 2 however these values only show regional estimations further for the unconfined aquifers the values are principally based on the volumes of the saturated formations and average specific yield values of the aquifer systems for the confined aquifers the estimations show only porosity specific yield storages not considering the additional contribution due to elastic storage this was because of the lack of storativity and specific storage data that fairly represent the regional confined aquifers calculating the available groundwater volumes in the confined aquifers based on aquifer porosity values alone likely led to overestimated volume estimates in this study to address this limitation in future work more detailed local investigations may be required for a greater understanding of the spatial variabilities and the overall volumes of the groundwater resources in the confined aquifers within the gbr regions the areal extent of surface watersheds fig 10 a and groundwater catchments fig 10b in the gbr catchment did not always coincide the majority 78 of the gbr catchment system contained six major surface water catchments area 9000 km2 while the remaining 22 coastal borders is classified into 53 622 relatively small catchments area ranging from 0 01 to 3 000 km2 fig 10a however the groundwater catchments in the whole gbr catchment including areas with large area 150 000 km2 surface water catchments were predicted to have relatively small groundwatersheds area 14 000 km2 fig 10b these spatial differences indicate that surface topography does not solely control groundwater flow in the gbr regions where geology and recharge conditions likely influence the groundwater flow paths comparing the groundwater catchments developed from the potentiometric surfaces of the unconfined aquifers within the gbr catchment with the surficial geology the larger groundwater catchments area 1000 km2 were located in areas with formations with high porosity sediments and sedimentary rocks fig s11 of the esm in contrast the smallest groundwater catchments area 30 km2 were located in areas with igneous rocks these spatial patterns suggest the importance of geological controls on the behaviour of groundwater flow in the gbr catchment 4 discussion 4 1 3d geological modelling previous geological and hydrogeological studies in the gbr catchment have focused on constructing 2d spatial models and vertical geologic cross sections based on sparse data table s2 of the esm the limited number of 3d geologic models while setting important benchmarks for the development of the geological history of local aquifers do not directly show the spatial distribution of lithologic units stratifications or give volumetric assessments at regional scales table s2 of the esm constructing 3d models of the six management regions however showed distinct differences in the dominant lithological units and degree extents of stratifications in the region s geological structures the 3d models also provided insights into differences in the volume of each geological unit among the regions for example the volume of sandstone in the cape york region northern gbr was around 75 of the total volume of the region while it was only 4 of the total volume of the subsurface formations in the burdekin region on the other hand basalt was dominant 44 in the burdekin region while it occupies around 3 of the cape york region in general the 3d models indicated that sedimentary rocks dominate the northern gbr regions while volcanic rocks were dominant in the central and sediments and volcanic rocks exist in comparable volumes in the southern gbr regions fig 4 figs s5 s9 these results are needed as fundamental inputs to future research on the coastal and marine hydrogeological processes such as the geological controls of groundwater flow post et al 2013 ball et al 2014 and groundwater potential estimation shishaye et al 2019 the volumes of the different lithologic units and the overall subsurface geological settings of the gbr regions fig 2 varied based on the geological processes and deformation histories that had occurred for example most of the sub catchments in the cape york region were formed following the mossman orogenic cycle while the majority of the burdekin region was formed following the thomson orogenic cycle johnson 2016 leading to much more sedimentary rocks in the cape york region this suggests that the paleozoic metasedimentary strata of the queensland plateau south eastern cape york which correlates with rocks of the mossman orogen and was a result of the direct drainage of first cycle sediments shaanan et al 2018 formed the sedimentary rock dominated geological setting in the cape york region fig 2a the basalt flows from the thomson orogenic cycle and the formation of the great dividing range johnson 2016 also influenced the geology of the burdekin region leading to much higher volumes of basalt and other volcanic rocks fig 2c in contrast the wet tropics region was formed due to the deformation impacts of the two orogenic systems mossman in the north and thomson south orogenic cycles flood and jonathan 1993 leading to relatively expansive and thicker sedimentary rocks in the north and volcanic rocks in the south of the region fig 2b the wet tropics region was also influenced by several deformation events e g the formation of the great dividing range likely leading to the fine stratifications and sedimentations interrupted by mudrock shale deposition fig 2b the 3d geological models also showed that the southern gbr regions fitzroy and burnett regions have thick sediment and gravel rich lithological units overlain by sedimentary and volcanic rocks fig 2e f these sediment layers are attributed to the accretionary wedge of permian sediments that formed during major permian tectonic activities flood and jonathan 1993 following this period and during the new england orogen there were major pulses of deformation and metamorphism veevers et al 1993 resulting in erosion events that formed sediment and gravel layers the volcanic and sedimentary rock units overlaying the thick sediment and gravel layers in these regions fig 2e f were also formed as a result of different scale deformation processes in the triassic and jurassic ages turner et al 2009 johnson 2016 other basins surrounding orogenic belts have reported similar geological units li et al 2014 identified different basins dominated by sediments and volcanic rocks in the linxi area of inner mongolia and china and suggested that the depositional age and sedimentary provenance of the basins were controlled by similar permian and triassic orogenic cycles she et al 2006 also reported basins dominated by sediments and volcanic rocks in the songpan ganzi basin west china surrounding the qinling orogenic belt and suggested that the depositional age of flysches in the basin was controlled by the cycles the basement rock in most of the gbr regions was basalt except in the cape york and burnett regions where unclassified volcanic rock was found fig 2 understanding the type and characteristics of a basement rock is crucial to develop the geological history of an aquifer system which in turn provides important information on the geological controls of groundwater flow akanbi 2018 the basalt and volcanic rock floors in the gbr catchment were likely caused through ocean floor subduction when the floor of the ocean in the convergent zone dives below the less dense continental plate it can form an oceanic basaltic basement kazemi et al 2018 and can also cause basaltic plateaus parallel to the oceanic trench which is consistent with the basaltic plateaus seen along the coastal borders of the gbr regions fig 2 similar basaltic basements have been seen in the yamato basin in japan which was formed as a result of back arc magmatism hirahara et al 2015 and the subduction related sedimentary basins of the u s a and cordillera on the west coast of canada ingersoll 2008 the validity of the 3d models was visually compared with the existing 2d vertical geologic cross sections and more limited 3d geologic and groundwater flow models table s2 of the esm showing similar features the fact that volumes of the lithologic units reach steady state before all available well data were used fig 4 figs s5 9 also support their validity histograms of the well coverage in depth fig 3 indicated that fewer wells were located in the lower geological layers ranging from 1 well per 90 km2 in wet tropics to 1 well per 197 km2 in cape york compared to the upper half of the models ranging from 1 well per 3 km2 in mackay to 1 well per 40 km2 in cape york resulting in greater model uncertainty at deeper depths however when the variations in lithologic volumes even in the deep layers where less data is available were analysed using different numbers of wells most regions and most rock sediment types reached consistent values before all available well data were used fig 4 figs s5 9 therefore such convergence suggests that even the lower density of deep well data did not significantly vary the outcome of the models this model stability could be explained by the fact that there is less geological variability deeper in the subsurface compared to more heterogeneous surficial lithologies durr and meybeck 2005 4 2 fault network the fault network mapping in this study identified nearly three times as many faults as previously mapped fig 5 intensive rifting events in eastern australia occurred during the permian to triassic age when the eastern gondwana was rotated clockwise into higher southern latitudes turner et al 2009 leading to highly faulted areas associated with rift volcanism and thermal uplifts along the gbr coastline branquet et al 2012 reported similar hydro stratigraphic layers and faults associated with rift volcanism and thermal uplifts throughout eastern tianshan china they indicated that the intrusion of parent magmas revealed by the location and alignment of the mafic and ultramafic rocks along regional shear zones were controlled by tectonic processes this was consistent with the findings of this study as most of the faults in the gbr catchment were specific to mafic and ultramafic rocks and some sedimentary rocks like the arenites which were mostly found in the eastern half of the catchment fig s4 of the esm wadge et al 2016 also reported faults associated with thermal uplifts and rift volcanism in the east african rift system where they indicated that continental rifting controlled the geological setting of the region however unlike these studies the eastern half of the gbr catchment experienced further deformations resulting in dense faults fig 5 this could be due to the volcanism associated with a subducting plate margin and arc to the east occurred during the mid late jurassic age turner et al 2009 similar areas with dense faults caused by volcanism related to a subducting plate have been reported in north fiji basin in the central pacific ocean govers and wortel 2005 and the tyrrhenian sea and the apennine belt in italy rosenbaum et al 2008 the orientations of the faults in the gbr catchment trended in a nw se direction fig 6 and could form conduits for south easterly groundwater flow as opposed to the predominate easterly flow revealed using the potentiometric surface maps in the porous unconfined and confined aquifers figs 7 8 the faults within the regions could facilitate aquifer connectivity with the long and intersecting faults allowing regional groundwater flow along the prevailing fault direction previous geologic and hydrogeologic studies in the gbr catchment table s2 of the esm showed that the faults in the region are productive for example marshall et al 2015 indicated that the fractures in the southern region eastern burnett are productive potential fractured aquifer and showed the possible hydraulic connectivity between aquifers horn et al 1995 and leach 2014 also indicated that the faults in the cape york region are conductive a similar study by rajabpour et al 2016 in the north tabriz fault iran showed that the long faults 150 km length and intersecting faults in the area enabled regional groundwater flow along the fault another study in volcanic faulted areas in the queretaro mexico also revealed that faults in the area led to regional groundwater flow along the fault orientations as opposed to the regional hydraulic gradient ochoa gonzalez et al 2015 4 3 aquifer types and settings the large scale 3d hydrogeologic models revealed that while all gbr regions have an upper aquifer layer composed of fractured and porous unconfined aquifers regional confined aquifers were found only in the cape york fitzroy and burnett regions fig 9 as opposed to the previously developed 2d models that show the existence of regional confined aquifers covering only half of the fitzroy and burnett regions lau et al 1987 the 3d models revealed that the lower sediment and gravel layers confined aquifers in these regions extend to the coast and likely beyond previous studies have shown where thick confined aquifers exist at the coastline they can extend significant distances offshore in their review on the presence of offshore fresh groundwater lenses post et al 2013 reported several terrestrial confined aquifers that extend offshore and get freshwater recharge from inland further amir et al 2013 carried out two dimensional modelling of offshore aquifers on the mediterranean coast of israel where they showed that the significant thicknesses of the confined aquifers at the coast with upper and lower confining layers are possible indicators for an offshore extension of confined aquifers a conceptual study of offshore fresh groundwater behaviour in the perth basin australia by morgan et al 2018 also showed that the confined aquifers in the basin extend further offshore with a significant connection with the inland aquifers stieglitz 2005 also reported the existence of freshwater wonky holes offshore in the central and northern gbr lagoon indicating the offshore extensions of the regional confined aquifers in the gbr catchment the models also show that the aquifer systems in the gbr regions contain numerous confining layers and both consolidated and unconsolidated aquifers fig 9 the consolidated regional confined aquifers were located in the northern gbr cape york region while the unconsolidated confined aquifers were in the south mainly fitzroy and burnett regions figs 2 9 the sedimentation processes during the periodic tectonic uplifts of different orogenic cycles in the cape york region derrick 1982 may have formed the consolidated sedimentary confined aquifer in the region on the other hand sedimentation events terminated by shale depositions in the jurassic period turner et al 2009 formed the thick unconsolidated confined aquifers in the fitzroy and burnett regions fig 9e f the excessive sedimentation in the ocean side of the basins can also be attributed to the early toarcian peak in global sea level different confined aquifer systems in different parts of the globe were reported to be formed due to sedimentation processes during the jurassic period including the confined aquifers in northern atlantic coastal plains usa masterson et al 2013 and the great artesian basin in australia harrington et al 2014 the fractured aquifer systems in the wet tropics burdekin and mackay regions fig 9b c and 9d respectively were found to be dominated by volcanic rocks likely formed due to subduction processes in the convergent plate boundaries table s2 of the esm turner et al 2009 similar origins of the faulty volcanic rock which dominates subsurface formations in the sabzevar basin iran was related to the partial melting of mid ocean ridge basalt type slab and or depleted mantle wedge sources as a result of subduction related magmatism kazemi et al 2018 the cretaceous to quaternary volcanic activities that followed the sedimentation processes during the jurassic period and further erosional sedimentation from the high elevation environments of the southern gbr catchments turner et al 2009 likely led to the fractured and porous unconfined aquifers in the fitzroy and burnett regions fig 9 regional aquifer connectivities in the fractured unconfined aquifers of the gbr catchment were evaluated based on the faults crossing the boundaries of the gbr regions while it was based on the continues similar lithologic units crossing the regional boundaries in the porous unconfined and confined aquifers for example the transboundary sediment and gravel layers confined aquifers in the fitzroy and burnett regions are indications of connectivity of the aquifers in the regions while the faults crossing the gbr regions boundaries between fitzroy and burnett and burdekin and wet tropics regions indicate that the fractured aquifers in this regions have connectivities the thick sediment and gravel layers in the southern gbr regions resulted in high groundwater development potentials in the regional confined aquifers in the fitzroy and burnett regions table 2 aquifers that are filled by sediment and gravels primarily sand and gravel have high permeability that results in high groundwater development potentials hassen et al 2016 the groundwater development potentials in the unconsolidated unconfined aquifers in the fitzroy burdekin and burnett regions were also estimated to be relatively high due to the high permeability of the sediments aquifer thickness and areal coverages 4 4 groundwater catchments the difference between the groundwater and surface water catchments in the gbr catchment suggest that surface topography is not the sole controlling variable of groundwater flow in the area fig 10 while it can be a useful simplification to treat the water table as a replica of surface topography condon and maxwell 2015 it may lead to bias when topography is not the only controlling variable other factors such as geology and climate can also affect groundwater flow gleeson et al 2011 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 the results of this study showed that defining groundwater catchments based on potentiometric surfaces and comparing them with surface water catchments is an important way of describing which variables either surface topography or the geology may control groundwater flow in certain areas the use of this approach in this study indicated that geology based porosity differences could be the controlling variable for many areas within the gbr catchment however additional analysis of climatic topographic and geological drivers are required to classify the controlling variable at the watershed scale 5 conclusion and implications this study characterizes the 3d geological and hydrogeological settings of the gbr catchment and the connectivity of its aquifers porous unconsolidated formations and regional faults crossing more than one region were helpful to identify aquifer connectivities as the long faults could link the regional fractured and porous formations and the continuous unconsolidated formations show connectivities of aquifers between two regions accurately representing the subsurface hydrogeologic systems of such an important area is crucial to assure ecosystem resilience and sustainable development of the regional groundwater resources coastal land and marine managers and policymakers may be able to use these hydrogeologic models to design better coastal aquifer management strategies and groundwater allocation plans the study also highlights the distinctiveness of regional aquifer geometries and extents research on the current practice and future challenges of coastal aquifer management practices rely on accurate representations of the aquifer systems therefore the results from this study are fundamental inputs to future research on the coastal and marine hydrogeologic processes more specifically the 3d geological models and aquifer geometries can be used to guide local and regional submarine groundwater flow simulations and potentially identify non point pollution sources to coastal waters it also provides crucial information to determine sustainable yields development potentials and to evaluate sensitive groundwater areas and saltwater intrusion potentials by testing the influence of well log data density on the predicted geological structure we showed that the volume of each geology converged with 750 wells per lithology in the cape york region while convergence was seen with 3 500 4 000 7 000 13 000 and 10 000 wells in wet tropics burdekin mackay fitzroy and burnett regions respectively such an analysis can provide additional confidence in the accuracy of the resulting geological framework and can be used to quantify the uncertainty in the resulting geological models as more drill logs become available especially at greater depths the geological models can be updated and re computed for more accurate geological and hydrogeological representations

8350,study region the great barrier reef catchment is located adjacent to the world s largest coral reef system the great barrier reef in eastern queensland australia study focus this study characterized the geologic and hydrogeologic settings and evaluated the influence of regional faults on groundwater flow 3d geological models of six regions within the catchment were constructed using drill log data from 49 000 wells digital elevation models and surface geological maps the 3d models were then integrated with potentiometric surface maps and faults data to conceptualize the hydraulic relationships of aquifer units and estimate groundwater development potentials potentiometric surfaces and fault orientations were used to conceptualize groundwater flow directions new hydrological insights for the region the 3d geological and hydrogeological characterizations revealed previously unknown faults and aquifer units in the study area the study found that the central regions consisted of fractured and porous unconfined aquifers while confined aquifers which extend to the coast and likely beyond were also found in the northern and southern most regions the orientations of the faults trended in nw se directions and could form conduits for south easterly groundwater flow as opposed to the predominate easterly flow in the porous unconfined and confined aquifers the 3d models aquifer connectivities and geometries provided crucial information to determine groundwater development potentials and offer a first step in developing local and regional groundwater flow and contaminant transport models keywords aquifer type fault orientation groundwater catchment groundwater flow lithological model queensland 1 introduction the coastal aquifers adjacent to the great barrier reef gbr are essential to the region s terrestrial and aquatic livelihood agriculture mining tourism urban development and other interests are all heavily dependent on the gbr aquifers health and sustainability narayan et al 2003 coastal aquifer systems are important as they mark the interface between terrestrial and aquatic settings these include coastal processes such as seawater intrusion submarine groundwater discharge sgd and nutrient fluxes which can only be explained through comprehensive characterizations of coastal aquifer systems in the gbr catchment groundwater extraction has led to saltwater intrusion especially in heavily pumped areas like the lower burdekin region narayan et al 2003 aquifer protection from terrestrial sources of contamination including nutrient leaching from agricultural farms is also important as a portion of stored aquifer water can be discharged as sgd and serve as a pathway for aquatic nutrient enrichment to sensitive coastal ecosystems stieglitz 2005 slomp and cappellen 2004 given the importance of the coastal aquifers adjacent to the gbr on terrestrial and marine systems the lack of a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the region s hydrogeologic setting remains a major obstacle to understanding and predicting the significance of its groundwater system the hydrogeology of an aquifer system is often characterised through the construction of 3d geological models and the development of geological history unnikrishnan et al 2018 maliva 2016 3d geological models enable direct evaluations of the spatial distributions stratifications and volumes of lithologic units hassen et al 2016 this information can then be used to define aquifer characteristics including groundwater flow groundwater potential aquifer connectivities and geometries kumar et al 2017 zhou and li 2011 large scale 3d hydrogeological models allow the evaluation of trans boundary geological controls of groundwater flow and the temporal effects of human pressures and climate change on groundwater resources and groundwater dependent ecosystems cloutier et al 2015 large scale 3d aquifer characterizations have been developed in different parts of the globe e g hassen et al 2016 hamdi et al 2018 weissmann et al 1999 and across australia including the aquifers in southern perth basin csiro 2009 musgrave province south australia ley cooper and munday 2013 galilee and eromanga basins moya et al 2014 great artesian basin radke et al 2000 and the murray darling basin murray darling basin commission 2000 however to date a comprehensive 3d hydrogeologic framework has not been constructed for many important coastal aquifers including those adjacent to the gbr borehole data e g drill logs are often the backbone on which 3d models are built however collecting drill log data is labour intensive and costly and developing a representative subsurface geology map from the data can be challenging as it requires a dense dataset to accurately describe geological heterogeneities raiber et al 2015 therefore finding the optimum number of observations to develop a representative subsurface geology map of an aquifer is often a balance between data availability drilling expenses model uncertainties and computing power linde et al 2015 as an outgrowth of these limitations geological and hydrogeological framework development often relies on geostatistical analyses that can define the most likely values of earth materials locations without actual samples by extrapolating data between known points thorleifson 2015 shishaye et al 2019 for example hamdi et al 2018 used drill log data from 181 wells covering an area of 1100 km2 1 well per 6 km2 to develop a 3d model of the sisseb el alem nadhour saouaf basin north eastern tunisia where they estimated volumes of the productive layers and groundwater storage capacity of the aquifer system mukherjee et al 2007 also used drill log data from 143 wells covering 21 000 km2 1 well per 147 km2 to construct 3d geological model of west bengal india and were able to both qualitatively and quantitatively characterise the hydrostratigraphic setting and groundwater flow of the regional aquifer system while 3d models built with borehole data can be useful for characterising subsurface geological features of an area combining the model with hydrology and fault data can provide much more insight into subsurface hydrodynamics fault networks and orientations can be important drivers of aquifer connectivity and groundwater flow bense et al 2013 scibek et al 2016 combining fault data with 3d geological modelling and interpolated water levels can be used to evaluate groundwater flow directions in geologically complex areas such as fractured aquifer systems fault data are commonly extracted from satellite images and digital elevation models dem which can be validated by fracture data from drill logs wu and bao 2015 hassen et al 2016 applied an integrated method of a 3d geological model and fault orientations to evaluate the probable groundwater flow directions in the kasserine aquifer system in central tunisia and reported high interconnectivity between geological compartments with groundwater flow directions along fault orientations in contrast to topographical gradients achtziger zupancic et al 2016 also applied similar methods to evaluate groundwater flow in fractured basement rocks of the ore mountains in germany where they reported significant aquifer permeability due to the highly displaced faults this study aimed to develop a regional scale framework for the aquifers adjacent to the gbr we compiled and characterized the 3d geological settings of the aquifer systems in the gbr catchment using existing borehole data dem and surface geological maps we then identified lithological similarities in the subsurface to designate aquifer types volumes and connectivity we also used fracture data from drill logs dem extracted lineaments and existing faults data to construct fault network maps finally we combined regional hydrogeologic frameworks and fault orientations with interpolations of groundwater level data to predict representative regional groundwater flow directions this study provides crucial information to determine groundwater development potentials sgd and groundwater nutrient discharge and for a more robust understanding of how aquifer dynamics influence the overlying terrestrial and adjoining marine environments 2 methods 2 1 study area the gbr catchment is located along the eastern coast of australia and has a total catchment area of 464 404 km2 which is approximately 25 of the area of queensland fig 1 the great dividing range sets the inland divide for the gbr catchment separating the catchment from inland watersheds mackey et al 2010 the gbr catchment contains six natural resource management regions fig 1 hereafter named as gbr regions with approximately 40 significant watersheds draining into the gbr lagoon the gbr catchment contains some of the most heavily used agricultural land in australia and also supports large scale grazing forestry mining and urban development waterhouse et al 2016 the gbr regions have a two season climate with a warm dry winter season from may to october and a hot wet summer from november to april the precipitation regimes range from an average rainfall of 2010 mmyr 1 in the tropical north 1000 mmyr 1 in sub tropical southern extents to 500 mmyr 1 in the dry tropics central part of the catchment with 80 of rainfall occurring in the wetter summer months garzon garcia et al 2015 2 2 gbr geological history the geology of the gbr catchment dates back as far as the phanerozoic era with the rocks in the catchment ranging from palaeozoic to cainozoic eras fig s1 of the electronic supplementary material esm blake and kilgour 2012 the majority 60 of the catchment is covered by formations from the palaeozoic to mesozoic eras fig s1 of the esm bain and draper 1997 henderson and stephenson 1980 sedimentary rocks cover 41 of the gbr catchment followed by igneous rocks 30 unconsolidated sediments 27 and metamorphic rocks 2 fig 1 igneous rocks are the dominant rock types in the coastal borders while sedimentary rocks and sediments cover the vast majority of the west and north of the gbr catchment fig 1 the constant circulation of earth materials in the forearc regions as a result of subduction of the pacific plate oceanic floor subduction caused igneous rocks with a mixture of metamorphic and sedimentary sequences in eastern gbr catchment symonds et al 1983 while sedimentation from the queensland plateau south eastern cape york and the mossman orogen resulted in sedimentary rocks in the north gbr shaanan et al 2018 johnson 2016 turner et al 2009 reported that there were six major cycles of sedimentation in the central and southern gbr catchment between the jurassic to cretaceous periods the study reported that each of the cycles commenced with sandy deposits of high energy braided river systems and terminated with mudrock deposits of low energy meandering rivers lakes and mires which may explain the sedimentary rocks in the burdekin fitzroy and burnett regions fig 1 2 3 data collection and analysis 2 3 1 3d geological modelling drill log data from 49 605 wells fig s2a of the esm in the gbr catchment were obtained from the queensland government groundwater database www data qld gov au detailed data quality and consistency validations were conducted before using the data for 3d geologic modelling supplementary text 1 of the esm the data from each well included layer based lithological and stratigraphic information and well depths 3d lithological models and fence diagrams of the study area were built in rockworks 17 software rockworks 2017 for each of the six gbr regions fig 1 areas between the wells were interpolated using a lateral blending algorithm with a strong horizontal weighting component while defining the interpolation of values on the top boundary ground surface by the dem and below an imaginary bottom surface by the lowest points of the borehole data the algorithm assigned the borehole data to voxels immediately surrounding each borehole then the assignment moves progressively away from the boreholes using the nearest neighbour approach until reaching one third of the distance between boreholes at these distant voxels a randomizing algorithm in the centre areas minimizes abrupt changes between material types finally the superface filter of the rockworks 17 software was used to clip the block model of each region to the shape of the regions the lithologic uncertainty introduced by using different numbers of wells for each model area was analysed by quantifying the volume of each lithology as a function of the number of well logs used to create the geological model volume stability with the change in the number of wells was used as a confirmation of defendable models the distribution of wells with depth was also used to indicate areas or specific subsurface layers that need further investigations for detail understanding of the geological and hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifers 2 3 2 fault network mapping surface geology and faults network analyses were used to produce a detailed fault network map of the gbr catchment and to relate the faults to specific rock types the analysis incorporated a digital surface geological map geological survey of queensland 2012 queensland digital surface geological map scale1 2 000 000 department of natural resources and mines brisbane dem of the queensland state geological survey of queensland 2012 national geological contacts and faults data fig s3a of the esm geoscience australia 2012 fracture data from drill logs fig s3b of the esm and a review of published documents regarding the geology of the area the rock types were summarized into 26 layers from the approximately 500 geological units mapped by geological survey of queensland 2012 fig s4 of the esm previously developed fault maps in the gbr catchment show only the major faults fig s3a of the esm making it difficult to delineate fractured aquifers and conceptualize groundwater flow directions as both fault density and orientation affect groundwater flow green et al 2010 in order to build on this lineaments were extracted from 10 m by 10 m dem of the catchment using geomatica software geomatics enterprises 2018 fracture data from more than 2500 wells were overlaid with the faults previously mapped and lineament extracted in the gbr catchment on arcmap 10 5 to confirm that the extracted lineaments represent faults and fractures as lineaments could also represent ordinary geological contacts and to validate the locations of the previously mapped major faults fig s3b of the esm the spatial distributions of the faults and fractures were mapped using arcmap 10 5 and overlaid with the modified surface geological map fig s4 of the esm to relate the faults and extent of fracturing with specific rock types this was conducted to identify the highly fractured rock types which is important in fractured aquifer delineations combined with density and intersections of faults elfouly 2000 green et al 2010 in this case depths of the faults were constrained based on the fracture depths from the wells drilled in the fractured zones fig s3b of the esm rose diagrams of fault orientations and histograms of fault lengths were produced in rockworks 17 software to identify regional trends and connectivities that would likely affect groundwater flow 2 3 3 aquifer types groundwater catchments and development potentials the types of aquifers confined v unconfined and fractured v porous in each of the gbr regions were characterized by the 3d geological models faults map a 1 5 m scale hydrogeological map of australia lau et al 1987 and potentiometric surface maps developed based on the water level data from each of the aquifer layers to do this the aquifer systems were firstly classified into confined and unconfined units based on discrete geological units in the 3d geological models classifications of aquifers into confined and unconfined is a function of the subsurface geologic structures water table locations and hydraulic properties therefore the geological barriers and confining layers potentially continuous clay units and consolidated formations and the productive subsurface formations potential groundwater reservoirs fractured rocks and porous unconsolidated formations were first delineated using the characteristics of the lithotypes in the 3d geologic models then the potentiometric surface for each aquifer was interpolated from observed water levels using arcmap 10 5 since the potentiometric surface should be smooth we used it to validate the structural definition of aquifer types by comparing the misfit between the interpolated surface and the observations confined aquifers were delineated where the potentiometric surface was above the topmost elevation of the aquifer unit and unconfined aquifers were delineated where potentiometric surfaces were in equilibrium with atmospheric pressure for the potentiometric surface maps only water levels measured after 2005 were used the data was only used for regional evaluations and local assessments may need to consider seasonal borehole pressures the unconfined aquifers of each region were also classified as fracture dominated fractured unconfined and primary porosity dominated porous unconfined units using the fault network maps fracture data from drill logs and rock type similarities in the fractured unconfined units the spatial distribution of the faults and fractures was mapped using the natural neighbour interpolation technique of the fracture density in arcmap 10 5 using a maximum threshold of 1 fault per 5 km2 however rock type similarities were also used to manually manipulate the fault network maps unconsolidated formations were delineated separately while the consolidated formations located in a close neighbour of the highly fractured formations were considered as fractured aquifers the interpolated fracture density map was then combined appended with the 3d models of the aquifers in rockworks 17 software to delineate fracture dominated unconfined aquifers depths of the fractured aquifers were constrained based on the fracture depths from the drill log data as the drill log based faults and fractures data validated the locations of most of the faults in the gbr catchment fig 3b of the esm the depth of the faults was considered to be the same as the depth of the fully penetrating wells in the fractured areas aquifer connectivity was evaluated by using the structural information from the 3d geological models and the fault network maps aquifer connectivity was predicted where unconsolidated layers were continuous across two or more large scale regions in the gbr catchment and or faults cross the borders of aquifers in two different regions for the fractured aquifers potential groundwater pathways were estimated based on fault orientations and the direction of decreasing hydraulic head in the porous aquifers groundwater pathways were estimated based solely on the hydraulic gradients calculated from the interpolated potentiometric surface finally in order to compare groundwater and surface water catchments and to determine the influence of topography and the subsurface geologic setting on groundwater flow in the gbr catchment groundwater catchments were mapped based on the potentiometric surfaces while surface water catchments were delineated from the dem of the area using arcmap 10 5 groundwater development potentials of the regional aquifers in the gbr catchment were estimated by multiplying the volumes of the saturated aquifer formations from the 3d geological models and the regional average of the depth integrated specific yield values estimated from pumping test data fig s2b the saturated and unsaturated zones of the aquifers were separated using the measured depths of the water table 3 results 3 1 geological characterization 3 1 1 subsurface geology the 3d lithological models and fence diagrams fig 2 a f developed for the six surface topography based regional areas gbr regions showed no continuous layers throughout the gbr catchment however layers like the basalt basement which crossed three model areas fitzroy burdekin and mackay fig 2c d e continued up to 1500 km length covering the whole catchment areas across the central gbr regions the thick sediment and gravel layer overlaying the basements and the shale units underlain by the thick sediment and gravel layers in southern gbr fitzroy and burnett regions fig 2e f also continued up to 1000 km length covering the whole catchment areas across more than one region with varying thickness in the cape york region the majority of the subsurface geology was dominated by sedimentary rocks mainly sandstone and siltstone followed in decreasing volumetric extents by unconsolidated sediments and extrusive and intrusive igneous rocks respectively fig 2a intrusive igneous rocks mainly granite outcropped in the southeast and southwest while basalt formations outcrop in the northern and southern ends of the region fig 2a clay layers also appear on the surface and act as confining layers intercalated with the sandstones in the low elevation areas coastal borders the metamorphic and granitic rocks were overlain by gently dipping sediment and poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks the basement rock unclassified volcanics in the area was 1500 m below the surface the wet tropics region contained eleven major lithological layers fig 2b the late proterozoic cambrian metamorphic rocks located in the south west fig 2b were the oldest rock types fig s1 of the esm the volcanic and plutonic rocks in the region were extensively deformed fig 2b geoscience australia 2012 the region was highly stratified compared to the other areas with a heterogeneous geological structure fig 2b granite and basalt units dominated the geological layers in the south while the northern end was dominated by shale and the coastal borders by unconsolidated sediments the basement rock in the region was located 200 m below the ground surface in addition to sedimentary rocks the upper layer in the burdekin region consisted of regolith formations of weathered rock alluvium colluvium and volcanic rocks fig 2c the basement in the region averagely 100 32 m below the ground surface was modelled as basalt overlain by intrusive volcanic rock intruded from south to north in the southern half of the region fig 2c johnson 2016 this intrusive volcanic rock was separated from the basement in the southeast of the region by a thick clay layer fig 2c the basement rock outcrops in the north and northwest while the northeastern part of the region was dominated by sediment gravel and clay layers the mackay region was influenced by basalt flows originating from volcanism in the great dividing range fig 2d bain and draper 1997 plutonic rocks including diorite and granite sedimentary rocks comprised of shale intercalated with the sediments and gravel layer and clay were also found in the region fig 2d the top layer in the lower east and south of the region was dominated by sediment and gravel layers including weathered sedimentary and igneous rocks deposited from high elevation areas in the west the basement rock basalt 200 m below the ground surface was overlain by shale units in the majority of the region and by unclassified volcanic rocks in the south and north the geology of the fitzroy and burnett regions was distinctly different from the northern regions fig 2 a thick sediment and gravel layer 980 56 m in fitzroy and 896 46 m in burnett regions was modelled overlying the basements of both regions fig 2e f indicating mesozoic sediments extended from the southwest of the catchment in the fitzroy region the shale layer overlying this layer was relatively thinner 172 20 m fig 2e than that of in the burnett region 500 42 m fig 2f the dominant rock types in the uppermost unconfined unit of the fitzroy region were sedimentary rocks mainly sandstones siltstones and shales fig 2e while igneous rocks mainly basalt and granite were dominant in the burnett region fig 2f 3 1 2 uncertainty analysis the maximum available number of wells with drill log data used to produce the 3d lithological models of the cape york wet tropics mackay burdekin fitzroy and burnett regions were 1000 4 677 5 877 9 399 15 642 and 13 010 respectively fig s2 of the esm the distribution of well depths in each region indicated a higher density of wells in the upper quarter of the modelled geology fig 3 the number of wells then decreases with depth fig 3 likely leading to higher model uncertainty in the deeper layers the lithologic uncertainties of each of the 3d models were analysed by quantifying the volume of each lithotype as a function of the number of well logs used to create the geological model fig 4 figs s5 s9 of the esm using a small number of wells relative to the spatial complexity of the geology could lead to inaccurate predictions of unit extents and thicknesses which would lead to inaccurate volumes of each lithology therefore we sought to confirm that the numbers of well logs were sufficient for the volume of each lithology to converge to a representative volume for example the volume of geological units in the cape york region largely stabilizes after 750 wells were used fig 4 the volume of clay in the cape york region was overestimated by almost three times when using data from 600 wells compared to the data from 750 wells fig 4 and the volume of the basalt unit was underestimated by 25 using the same comparison the volumes of deeper units with less borehole data also stabilize as more wells are included in the analysis fig 4 figs s5 s9 of the esm in the cape york region for example fig 4 the changes in the volumes of the deeper lithological units sandstone siltstone and volcanic rocks stabilize after 750 wells are used this same steady state trend was also seen in most geological units in the other modelled regions even across the deeper layers were less data was available figs s5 s9 of the esm 3 1 3 fault network the number of previously mapped faults in the gbr catchment totalled 527 fig s3a of the esm while an additional 1056 lineament extracted faults were mapped by the dem fig 5 a the majority 60 of the faults were found on the eastern half of the gbr catchment fig 5b with densely faulted areas occurring in formations from palaeozoic to mesozoic eras fig s1 of the esm fault densities were also related to specific rock types most of the faults in the southern gbr were found within the arenite granitoid mafite and felsite rock types fig s4 of the esm the mackay and wet tropics regions which were mostly covered with granite and basalt rocks with a significant manifestation of arenites fig s4 of the esm were highly fractured with relatively short fault lengths fig 5b the central gbr catchments mainly fitzroy and burdekin regions were dominated by sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments fig 1 and had a relatively lower density of faults the density of faults was highest in the wet tropics 1 fault per 75 km2 followed by the burnett 1 per 141 km2 cape york 1 per 142 km2 mackay 1 per 163 km2 burdekin 1 per 508 km2 and fitzroy 1 per 701 km2 regions the lengths of the faults across the entire catchment ranged from 0 02 100 km with a mean length of 6 3 0 3 km fig s10 of the esm the majority of the faults trend in the nw se direction fig 6 the mean ray of the orientation of the faults passes through 338 7 nw and 158 7 se with a standard error of 5 8 calculated at a 99 confidence interval fig 6 3 2 hydrogeological characterization 3 2 1 aquifer types the types of aquifers in each regional area were characterized based on the 3d geological models fig 2 faults fig 5 and potentiometric surface maps figs 7 8 the cape york region was found to have three aquifer types fractured and porous unconfined aquifers located in the upper geological layer fig 9a and a lower confined aquifer that is bounded by volcanic rocks in the north and by an upper clay layer and a bottom volcanic rock layer in the south figs 2a 9 a a clay layer also acts as a semi confining unit within the porous unconfined aquifer in the south fig 2a the highest potentiometric surface elevation in the confined aquifer in the central and south of the region was 6 5 m above the land surface which is more than 500 m above the top surface of the aquifer unit while the maximum depth to the water table in the unconfined aquifer was 68 6 m below the ground surface fig 7a 8 a the wet tropics region contained a fractured aquifer in the higher elevation areas while the low elevation areas coastal borders were mainly comprised of a porous unconsolidated unconfined aquifer fig 9 b however the eastern side of the region had localized semi confined aquifers where a clay layer overlays sediment and gravel layers fig 2b the semi confining units in the region fig 2b caused the potentiometric surface to rise up to 1 m above the ground surface while the maximum depth to the water table was 78 6 m below the ground surface fig 7b the regional aquifer types in the burdekin region were porous unconfined and fractured unconfined aquifers fig 9c in the northeast and southwest of the region the aquifer was porous unconfined as it consisted of unconsolidated sediments gravel and weathered sedimentary rocks figs 2c 9 c the extensive clay layers in the region resulted in numerous localized confined and semi confined aquifers which are not visible in the 3d hydrogeologic models because of their small spatial coverage compared to the scale shown in the 3d models fig 9 however they are visible in the heterogeneous 3d lithologic models fig 2c the potentiometric surface elevation in the region fig 7c indicated that the local clay confining layers in the northeast northwest and southwest of the region caused the groundwater levels to reach a maximum of 16 m above the ground surface the mackay region aquifers were mostly fractured unconfined interspersed with areas of being porous unconfined fig 9d the porous unconfined aquifer in the region was in the lower floodplains bordering the coast the potentiometric surface map of the region fig 7d showed no confined units with water levels in the area corresponding to the local water table depth the fitzroy region was the only region in the gbr catchment where the fractured and porous unconfined units covered relatively similar areal extents fig 9e the confined aquifer fig 9e was overlain by a confining shale layer with an average thickness of 172 20 m the potentiometric surface of the confined aquifer fig 8e was as high as 1000 m above the ground surface indicative of high groundwater potential energy while the maximum depth to the water table in the unconfined aquifer was 152 m below the ground surface fig 7e in the burnett region the fractured and porous unconfined aquifers were separated from the confined aquifer by a thick shale confining unit average 500 42 m fig 9f groundwater in the confined aquifer rose up to a maximum of 7 4 m above the ground surface which is around 700 m above the top surface of the water bearing formation fig 8c while the maximum depth to the water table in the porous and fractured unconfined aquifers was 91 3 m below the ground surface fig 7f 3 2 2 aquifer geometries groundwater catchments and development potentials the upper aquifer spanning the whole gbr catchment consists of porous and fractured unconfined aquifers while regional confined aquifers were only identified in the cape york fitzroy and burnett regions fig 9 the upper porous unconfined aquifer covered 33 of the gbr catchment to an average depth of 130 9 m while the fractured aquifer covered 67 of the catchment with an average thickness of 54 5 m fig 9 regionally the porous unconfined aquifer in the fitzroy region covered 57 of the catchment area while it only covers 19 in the wet tropics table 1 the fitzroy region also had the thickest unconfined aquifer layer average 250 22 m while the shallowest was found in the mackay region average 60 7 m the fitzroy region also had the thickest confined aquifer average 980 56 m followed by burnett 896 46 m and cape york 546 41 m regions the largest confined aquifer volume was also found in fitzroy 173 227 5656 km3 followed by the burnett 40 558 1856 km3 and cape york 20 444 974 km3 regions further application of the 3d models assisted to estimate development potentials of the groundwater in the regional aquifers table 2 the estimated values show that the fitzroy region has a higher volume of estimated groundwater development potential followed by the burdekin and burnett regions table 2 however these values only show regional estimations further for the unconfined aquifers the values are principally based on the volumes of the saturated formations and average specific yield values of the aquifer systems for the confined aquifers the estimations show only porosity specific yield storages not considering the additional contribution due to elastic storage this was because of the lack of storativity and specific storage data that fairly represent the regional confined aquifers calculating the available groundwater volumes in the confined aquifers based on aquifer porosity values alone likely led to overestimated volume estimates in this study to address this limitation in future work more detailed local investigations may be required for a greater understanding of the spatial variabilities and the overall volumes of the groundwater resources in the confined aquifers within the gbr regions the areal extent of surface watersheds fig 10 a and groundwater catchments fig 10b in the gbr catchment did not always coincide the majority 78 of the gbr catchment system contained six major surface water catchments area 9000 km2 while the remaining 22 coastal borders is classified into 53 622 relatively small catchments area ranging from 0 01 to 3 000 km2 fig 10a however the groundwater catchments in the whole gbr catchment including areas with large area 150 000 km2 surface water catchments were predicted to have relatively small groundwatersheds area 14 000 km2 fig 10b these spatial differences indicate that surface topography does not solely control groundwater flow in the gbr regions where geology and recharge conditions likely influence the groundwater flow paths comparing the groundwater catchments developed from the potentiometric surfaces of the unconfined aquifers within the gbr catchment with the surficial geology the larger groundwater catchments area 1000 km2 were located in areas with formations with high porosity sediments and sedimentary rocks fig s11 of the esm in contrast the smallest groundwater catchments area 30 km2 were located in areas with igneous rocks these spatial patterns suggest the importance of geological controls on the behaviour of groundwater flow in the gbr catchment 4 discussion 4 1 3d geological modelling previous geological and hydrogeological studies in the gbr catchment have focused on constructing 2d spatial models and vertical geologic cross sections based on sparse data table s2 of the esm the limited number of 3d geologic models while setting important benchmarks for the development of the geological history of local aquifers do not directly show the spatial distribution of lithologic units stratifications or give volumetric assessments at regional scales table s2 of the esm constructing 3d models of the six management regions however showed distinct differences in the dominant lithological units and degree extents of stratifications in the region s geological structures the 3d models also provided insights into differences in the volume of each geological unit among the regions for example the volume of sandstone in the cape york region northern gbr was around 75 of the total volume of the region while it was only 4 of the total volume of the subsurface formations in the burdekin region on the other hand basalt was dominant 44 in the burdekin region while it occupies around 3 of the cape york region in general the 3d models indicated that sedimentary rocks dominate the northern gbr regions while volcanic rocks were dominant in the central and sediments and volcanic rocks exist in comparable volumes in the southern gbr regions fig 4 figs s5 s9 these results are needed as fundamental inputs to future research on the coastal and marine hydrogeological processes such as the geological controls of groundwater flow post et al 2013 ball et al 2014 and groundwater potential estimation shishaye et al 2019 the volumes of the different lithologic units and the overall subsurface geological settings of the gbr regions fig 2 varied based on the geological processes and deformation histories that had occurred for example most of the sub catchments in the cape york region were formed following the mossman orogenic cycle while the majority of the burdekin region was formed following the thomson orogenic cycle johnson 2016 leading to much more sedimentary rocks in the cape york region this suggests that the paleozoic metasedimentary strata of the queensland plateau south eastern cape york which correlates with rocks of the mossman orogen and was a result of the direct drainage of first cycle sediments shaanan et al 2018 formed the sedimentary rock dominated geological setting in the cape york region fig 2a the basalt flows from the thomson orogenic cycle and the formation of the great dividing range johnson 2016 also influenced the geology of the burdekin region leading to much higher volumes of basalt and other volcanic rocks fig 2c in contrast the wet tropics region was formed due to the deformation impacts of the two orogenic systems mossman in the north and thomson south orogenic cycles flood and jonathan 1993 leading to relatively expansive and thicker sedimentary rocks in the north and volcanic rocks in the south of the region fig 2b the wet tropics region was also influenced by several deformation events e g the formation of the great dividing range likely leading to the fine stratifications and sedimentations interrupted by mudrock shale deposition fig 2b the 3d geological models also showed that the southern gbr regions fitzroy and burnett regions have thick sediment and gravel rich lithological units overlain by sedimentary and volcanic rocks fig 2e f these sediment layers are attributed to the accretionary wedge of permian sediments that formed during major permian tectonic activities flood and jonathan 1993 following this period and during the new england orogen there were major pulses of deformation and metamorphism veevers et al 1993 resulting in erosion events that formed sediment and gravel layers the volcanic and sedimentary rock units overlaying the thick sediment and gravel layers in these regions fig 2e f were also formed as a result of different scale deformation processes in the triassic and jurassic ages turner et al 2009 johnson 2016 other basins surrounding orogenic belts have reported similar geological units li et al 2014 identified different basins dominated by sediments and volcanic rocks in the linxi area of inner mongolia and china and suggested that the depositional age and sedimentary provenance of the basins were controlled by similar permian and triassic orogenic cycles she et al 2006 also reported basins dominated by sediments and volcanic rocks in the songpan ganzi basin west china surrounding the qinling orogenic belt and suggested that the depositional age of flysches in the basin was controlled by the cycles the basement rock in most of the gbr regions was basalt except in the cape york and burnett regions where unclassified volcanic rock was found fig 2 understanding the type and characteristics of a basement rock is crucial to develop the geological history of an aquifer system which in turn provides important information on the geological controls of groundwater flow akanbi 2018 the basalt and volcanic rock floors in the gbr catchment were likely caused through ocean floor subduction when the floor of the ocean in the convergent zone dives below the less dense continental plate it can form an oceanic basaltic basement kazemi et al 2018 and can also cause basaltic plateaus parallel to the oceanic trench which is consistent with the basaltic plateaus seen along the coastal borders of the gbr regions fig 2 similar basaltic basements have been seen in the yamato basin in japan which was formed as a result of back arc magmatism hirahara et al 2015 and the subduction related sedimentary basins of the u s a and cordillera on the west coast of canada ingersoll 2008 the validity of the 3d models was visually compared with the existing 2d vertical geologic cross sections and more limited 3d geologic and groundwater flow models table s2 of the esm showing similar features the fact that volumes of the lithologic units reach steady state before all available well data were used fig 4 figs s5 9 also support their validity histograms of the well coverage in depth fig 3 indicated that fewer wells were located in the lower geological layers ranging from 1 well per 90 km2 in wet tropics to 1 well per 197 km2 in cape york compared to the upper half of the models ranging from 1 well per 3 km2 in mackay to 1 well per 40 km2 in cape york resulting in greater model uncertainty at deeper depths however when the variations in lithologic volumes even in the deep layers where less data is available were analysed using different numbers of wells most regions and most rock sediment types reached consistent values before all available well data were used fig 4 figs s5 9 therefore such convergence suggests that even the lower density of deep well data did not significantly vary the outcome of the models this model stability could be explained by the fact that there is less geological variability deeper in the subsurface compared to more heterogeneous surficial lithologies durr and meybeck 2005 4 2 fault network the fault network mapping in this study identified nearly three times as many faults as previously mapped fig 5 intensive rifting events in eastern australia occurred during the permian to triassic age when the eastern gondwana was rotated clockwise into higher southern latitudes turner et al 2009 leading to highly faulted areas associated with rift volcanism and thermal uplifts along the gbr coastline branquet et al 2012 reported similar hydro stratigraphic layers and faults associated with rift volcanism and thermal uplifts throughout eastern tianshan china they indicated that the intrusion of parent magmas revealed by the location and alignment of the mafic and ultramafic rocks along regional shear zones were controlled by tectonic processes this was consistent with the findings of this study as most of the faults in the gbr catchment were specific to mafic and ultramafic rocks and some sedimentary rocks like the arenites which were mostly found in the eastern half of the catchment fig s4 of the esm wadge et al 2016 also reported faults associated with thermal uplifts and rift volcanism in the east african rift system where they indicated that continental rifting controlled the geological setting of the region however unlike these studies the eastern half of the gbr catchment experienced further deformations resulting in dense faults fig 5 this could be due to the volcanism associated with a subducting plate margin and arc to the east occurred during the mid late jurassic age turner et al 2009 similar areas with dense faults caused by volcanism related to a subducting plate have been reported in north fiji basin in the central pacific ocean govers and wortel 2005 and the tyrrhenian sea and the apennine belt in italy rosenbaum et al 2008 the orientations of the faults in the gbr catchment trended in a nw se direction fig 6 and could form conduits for south easterly groundwater flow as opposed to the predominate easterly flow revealed using the potentiometric surface maps in the porous unconfined and confined aquifers figs 7 8 the faults within the regions could facilitate aquifer connectivity with the long and intersecting faults allowing regional groundwater flow along the prevailing fault direction previous geologic and hydrogeologic studies in the gbr catchment table s2 of the esm showed that the faults in the region are productive for example marshall et al 2015 indicated that the fractures in the southern region eastern burnett are productive potential fractured aquifer and showed the possible hydraulic connectivity between aquifers horn et al 1995 and leach 2014 also indicated that the faults in the cape york region are conductive a similar study by rajabpour et al 2016 in the north tabriz fault iran showed that the long faults 150 km length and intersecting faults in the area enabled regional groundwater flow along the fault another study in volcanic faulted areas in the queretaro mexico also revealed that faults in the area led to regional groundwater flow along the fault orientations as opposed to the regional hydraulic gradient ochoa gonzalez et al 2015 4 3 aquifer types and settings the large scale 3d hydrogeologic models revealed that while all gbr regions have an upper aquifer layer composed of fractured and porous unconfined aquifers regional confined aquifers were found only in the cape york fitzroy and burnett regions fig 9 as opposed to the previously developed 2d models that show the existence of regional confined aquifers covering only half of the fitzroy and burnett regions lau et al 1987 the 3d models revealed that the lower sediment and gravel layers confined aquifers in these regions extend to the coast and likely beyond previous studies have shown where thick confined aquifers exist at the coastline they can extend significant distances offshore in their review on the presence of offshore fresh groundwater lenses post et al 2013 reported several terrestrial confined aquifers that extend offshore and get freshwater recharge from inland further amir et al 2013 carried out two dimensional modelling of offshore aquifers on the mediterranean coast of israel where they showed that the significant thicknesses of the confined aquifers at the coast with upper and lower confining layers are possible indicators for an offshore extension of confined aquifers a conceptual study of offshore fresh groundwater behaviour in the perth basin australia by morgan et al 2018 also showed that the confined aquifers in the basin extend further offshore with a significant connection with the inland aquifers stieglitz 2005 also reported the existence of freshwater wonky holes offshore in the central and northern gbr lagoon indicating the offshore extensions of the regional confined aquifers in the gbr catchment the models also show that the aquifer systems in the gbr regions contain numerous confining layers and both consolidated and unconsolidated aquifers fig 9 the consolidated regional confined aquifers were located in the northern gbr cape york region while the unconsolidated confined aquifers were in the south mainly fitzroy and burnett regions figs 2 9 the sedimentation processes during the periodic tectonic uplifts of different orogenic cycles in the cape york region derrick 1982 may have formed the consolidated sedimentary confined aquifer in the region on the other hand sedimentation events terminated by shale depositions in the jurassic period turner et al 2009 formed the thick unconsolidated confined aquifers in the fitzroy and burnett regions fig 9e f the excessive sedimentation in the ocean side of the basins can also be attributed to the early toarcian peak in global sea level different confined aquifer systems in different parts of the globe were reported to be formed due to sedimentation processes during the jurassic period including the confined aquifers in northern atlantic coastal plains usa masterson et al 2013 and the great artesian basin in australia harrington et al 2014 the fractured aquifer systems in the wet tropics burdekin and mackay regions fig 9b c and 9d respectively were found to be dominated by volcanic rocks likely formed due to subduction processes in the convergent plate boundaries table s2 of the esm turner et al 2009 similar origins of the faulty volcanic rock which dominates subsurface formations in the sabzevar basin iran was related to the partial melting of mid ocean ridge basalt type slab and or depleted mantle wedge sources as a result of subduction related magmatism kazemi et al 2018 the cretaceous to quaternary volcanic activities that followed the sedimentation processes during the jurassic period and further erosional sedimentation from the high elevation environments of the southern gbr catchments turner et al 2009 likely led to the fractured and porous unconfined aquifers in the fitzroy and burnett regions fig 9 regional aquifer connectivities in the fractured unconfined aquifers of the gbr catchment were evaluated based on the faults crossing the boundaries of the gbr regions while it was based on the continues similar lithologic units crossing the regional boundaries in the porous unconfined and confined aquifers for example the transboundary sediment and gravel layers confined aquifers in the fitzroy and burnett regions are indications of connectivity of the aquifers in the regions while the faults crossing the gbr regions boundaries between fitzroy and burnett and burdekin and wet tropics regions indicate that the fractured aquifers in this regions have connectivities the thick sediment and gravel layers in the southern gbr regions resulted in high groundwater development potentials in the regional confined aquifers in the fitzroy and burnett regions table 2 aquifers that are filled by sediment and gravels primarily sand and gravel have high permeability that results in high groundwater development potentials hassen et al 2016 the groundwater development potentials in the unconsolidated unconfined aquifers in the fitzroy burdekin and burnett regions were also estimated to be relatively high due to the high permeability of the sediments aquifer thickness and areal coverages 4 4 groundwater catchments the difference between the groundwater and surface water catchments in the gbr catchment suggest that surface topography is not the sole controlling variable of groundwater flow in the area fig 10 while it can be a useful simplification to treat the water table as a replica of surface topography condon and maxwell 2015 it may lead to bias when topography is not the only controlling variable other factors such as geology and climate can also affect groundwater flow gleeson et al 2011 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 the results of this study showed that defining groundwater catchments based on potentiometric surfaces and comparing them with surface water catchments is an important way of describing which variables either surface topography or the geology may control groundwater flow in certain areas the use of this approach in this study indicated that geology based porosity differences could be the controlling variable for many areas within the gbr catchment however additional analysis of climatic topographic and geological drivers are required to classify the controlling variable at the watershed scale 5 conclusion and implications this study characterizes the 3d geological and hydrogeological settings of the gbr catchment and the connectivity of its aquifers porous unconsolidated formations and regional faults crossing more than one region were helpful to identify aquifer connectivities as the long faults could link the regional fractured and porous formations and the continuous unconsolidated formations show connectivities of aquifers between two regions accurately representing the subsurface hydrogeologic systems of such an important area is crucial to assure ecosystem resilience and sustainable development of the regional groundwater resources coastal land and marine managers and policymakers may be able to use these hydrogeologic models to design better coastal aquifer management strategies and groundwater allocation plans the study also highlights the distinctiveness of regional aquifer geometries and extents research on the current practice and future challenges of coastal aquifer management practices rely on accurate representations of the aquifer systems therefore the results from this study are fundamental inputs to future research on the coastal and marine hydrogeologic processes more specifically the 3d geological models and aquifer geometries can be used to guide local and regional submarine groundwater flow simulations and potentially identify non point pollution sources to coastal waters it also provides crucial information to determine sustainable yields development potentials and to evaluate sensitive groundwater areas and saltwater intrusion potentials by testing the influence of well log data density on the predicted geological structure we showed that the volume of each geology converged with 750 wells per lithology in the cape york region while convergence was seen with 3 500 4 000 7 000 13 000 and 10 000 wells in wet tropics burdekin mackay fitzroy and burnett regions respectively such an analysis can provide additional confidence in the accuracy of the resulting geological framework and can be used to quantify the uncertainty in the resulting geological models as more drill logs become available especially at greater depths the geological models can be updated and re computed for more accurate geological and hydrogeological representations

freshwater in densely populated countries in south asia like india currently ⅔ of the indian population relies on monsoonal precipitation and rivers for food production and their livelihood amrith 2018 biemans et al 2013 singh et al 2014 monsoon fed rivers provide not only trade and transport but also water supplies for agriculture industry and domestic use szabo et al 2016 varis et al 2012 however the future of river dynamics in indian monsoon regions is highly uncertain with more extreme precipitation and recurrent droughts resulting from climate change e g nair et al 2018 singh et al 2014 turner and annamalai 2012 for sustainable river basin management it is crucial to understand the sources and pathways of river water as well as tributary contributions to the final discharge and thus gain insights into seasonal and spatial changes in monsoonal rivers the stable isotopic composition δ18o and δd of river water is a powerful integrator of hydrological processes in a river basin e g dutton et al 2005 gibson et al 2002 kendall and coplen 2001 in general river water is assumed to reflect the isotopic variance of regional and large scale continental precipitation where the latter is predominantly a function of elevation amount of rainfall type and distance of its source e g dansgaard 1964 gibson et al 2002 halder et al 2015 kendall and coplen 2001 poage and chamberlain 2001 however the isotopic composition of monsoon fed rivers is unlikely to be static over space and time as these rivers may receive input from multiple moisture sources such as contributions by the southwest and northeast monsoon systems in south asia with the associated seasonal variability in hydrological conditions furthermore secondary processes such as evaporation and recycling can also substantially modify river isotopic signatures dutton et al 2005 kendall and coplen 2001 lambs et al 2011 ramesh and sarin 1992 sharma et al 2017 evaporation increases δ18o and δd values and decreases deuterium excess d excess and thus can be used to gain insight into water loss downstream in semi arid or arid environments or during dry periods in monsoon influenced regions gibson et al 2002 for instance a downstream increase in δ18o and δd values in the middle stretch of the ganges river 800 to 1600 km from its source at gomukh was attributed to high evaporation of river water kumar et al 2019 ramesh and sarin 1992 in addition artificial barriers such as dams are known to significantly alter river dynamics by regulation and fragmentation of the river flow in many basins worldwide nilsson et al 2005 however their effect on river water isotopic composition is often overlooked dutton et al 2005 the presence of dams may lead to isotopic enrichment of stagnant river water due to increased evaporation and or dams may buffer seasonal isotopic changes due to storage and mixing of isotopically different inputs into dammed reservoirs diamond and jack 2018 li et al 2016 hence river water isotopic patterns contain process based information on the governing hydrology within a river basin the contrasting flow regimes of monsoon fed rivers provide a natural laboratory to investigate seasonal wet and dry season and spatial longitudinal lateral and vertical variability in river water isotopic signatures the godavari river is the largest non himalayan river of india situated in the core monsoon zone of india it is fed by the southwest and northeast monsoon regimes global climate change has increased the variability in monsoonal rainfall with more extreme precipitation events on

isolated crater lake anoop et al 2013 revealed a potential sensitivity in response to changing monsoon rainfall patterns on geological time scales available records of past monsoon precipitation are

shift in monsoon dynamics however in depth knowledge on the variability of water isotopes in the godavari river basin is limited we hypothesise that water isotopes in the godavari river vary significantly on a spatial and seasonal scale in response to variability in monsoon rainfall patterns and dominant hydrological processes this information will lead to a better understanding of the hydrological dynamics in monsoon fed river systems and can contribute to future river management strategies e g flood and drought mitigation as well as sustainable use of the river as resource for irrigation and food production here we investigate river water isotopes δ18o and δd in the main stem tributaries and depth profiles of the godavari river in a pre monsoon dry and monsoon wet season to reveal governing hydrological processes and trace pathways from source to sea fundamental steps are 1 to identify the river water provenance i e monsoon rainfall source and tributary contributions and 2 assess to what extent hydrological processes such as evaporation water re cycling and mixing alter the river water isotopic composition during transit through the basin our data will be placed in a regional perspective by comparison of godavari river water isotopes with global and local meteoric water lines as well as with water isotopes reported in the literature on himalayan peninsular and coastal rivers in india this high resolution study on the godavari river will provide insights into monsoon variability and basin hydrology in the indian core monsoon zone and contribute to the global database on river water isotopes 2 materials and methods 2 1 godavari river basin the godavari river is the second longest river in india and flows 1500 km from its source in the western ghats mountain range 700 2500 m above sea level asl eastward through the core monsoon zone and drains into the bay of bengal fig 1 a c the godavari river is monsoon driven with large seasonal fluctuations in water levels between the monsoon season june sept and dry period oct may where the latter includes the post monsoon oct dec winter and pre monsoon season jan may imd 2015 the godavari discharges 93 96 of its total annual flow in the monsoon season biksham and subramanian 1988a b gupta et al 1997 across the godavari basin precipitation increases from 430 mm year 1 in the semi arid rain shadow of the western ghats to 2300 mm year 1 in the sub humid lower basin gunnell 1997 fig 1d the mean annual temperature is 24 c at the godavari s source and increases eastward to a maximum of 29 4 c at the mouth babar and kaplay 2018 prominent crops range from aridity adapted c4 plants e g sugar cane sorghum millet in the upstream region to paddy rice and rain dependent crops downstream krishna et al

godavari basin is here divided into 5 subbasins including the upper middle and lower godavari covering the main stem godavari river in addition to the north tributaries weiganga wardha and pranhita

rajahmundry and the tide influenced delta with an ecologically renowned mangrove system bouillon et al 2003 dehairs et al 2000 the middle and lower godavari north and east tributaries are defined here as the downstream godavari the upper subbasin represents the upstream godavari fig 1a the godavari river is fed by two seasonally separated monsoon sources where the southwest sw or indian summer monsoon june sept brings the majority 80 of rainfall balakrishna and probst 2005 rao 1998 by south westerly winds sourced over the north indian ocean and arabian sea fig 1a the northeast ne monsoon

araguás et al 1998 gadgil 2003 yihui and chan 2005 each monsoon system has a source specific isotopic signature owing to their different geographic origin the seawater sourced from the bay of bengal is 1 lower in δ18o and 8 in δd compared to that of the arabian sea due to the large inflow of isotopically depleted runoff from himalayan indus and ganges rivers delaygue et al 2001 kumar et al 2010

the lower godavari basin typical of seawater intrusion fig a1 in the monsoon season such high values are only measured in the main outlet gautami branch and progress less far inland fig a2 suggesting a river dominated outflow into the bay of bengal beyond the delta ec is higher in the pre monsoon 21 9 1013 μs cm 1 than in the monsoon season 44 0 526 4 μs cm 1 suggestive of increased evaporation in the former regional differences with lowest ec in the east 190 1 μs cm 1 and part of the north tributaries can be explained by them draining the solute depleted eastern ghats in the upper godavari river mean ec is higher pre monsoon 524 9 283 5 monsoon 389 8 98 8 μs cm 1 sd than in other subbasins besides the delta which can be linked to the weatherable deccan geology and suggests evaporative conditions in both seasons in situ water temperatures range from 23 0 to 35 9 c in the pre monsoon and from 25 0 to 32 7 c in the monsoon season 3 2 seasonal isotopic variability in the godavari river basin godavari surface water δ18o and δd values range respectively from 3 9 to 3 8 and 25 9 to 15 4 in the pre monsoon n 49 and from 7 7 to 4 3 and 57 0 to 20 7 in the monsoon season n 47 with significantly lower values in the monsoon season p 0 001 fig 3 a supporting information kirkels et al 2020 the δ18o and δd values are closely correlated p 0 001 and linear regression translates into a

below the gmwl for global and lmwls for local precipitation in both seasons p 0 001 except p 0 07 for the monsoonal godavari and the lmwl in hyderabad fig 3b the relative enrichment of godavari river waters compared to precipitation points towards evaporation across the godavari basin notably the regression slope in the monsoon season is significantly steeper than in the pre monsoon season 6 39 vs 4 74 p 0 001 fig 3b suggesting that the magnitude of evaporation varies on a seasonal scale and is larger in the pre monsoon season in the pre monsoon season the slope of the godavari river water line 4 74 0 33 is slightly higher than that of a fully evaporation controlled i e monsoon fed and subsequently evaporated open tank and pan in hyderabad 4 19 0 09 négrel et al 2011 figs 1a 3b but resembles the slope of a typical evaporation line which is theoretically close to 4 at very low relative humidity 25 and between 4 and 5 at moderate relative humidity 75 clark and fritz 1997 in addition low average d excess in the pre monsoon godavari waters 4 9 7 1 suggests direct river surface evaporation dutton et al 2005 in fig 3c displaying δ18o versus d excess monsoonal and pre monsoonal godavari waters plot between precipitation sampled across the basin green and an open tank sample magenta in hyderabad négrel et al 2011 the conceptual model based on these data fig 3d reveals an increasing influence of evaporation from the down to the upstream godavari basin in the monsoon season fig 3c samples taken in the upper godavari plot towards the open tank négrel et al 2011 in both seasons pointing out that this subbasin experiences a dominant year round evaporative effect on river water isotopes following this model fig 3d our data further suggest that the contribution of recycled water to the godavari river is negligible in both seasons as we do not observe the sharp increase in d excess relative to δ18o that would occur upon condensation of once evaporated moisture into precipitation araguás araguás et al 2000 3 3 moisture sources of river water in the godavari basin in the downstream godavari we observe an average seasonal shift in isotopic composition of 2 5 in δ18o min 0 1 to max 7 5 13 5 in δd 0 4 44 6 and 7 0 in d excess 0 3 27 3 from the pre monsoon to the monsoon season n 35 fig 4 back trajectory analysis shows that this shift relates to a change in atmospheric circulation patterns where moisture is dominantly sourced from the indian ocean arabian sea in the monsoon season and from the continent and the bay of bengal in the pre monsoon season fig 5 these findings match with the dual monsoon regime of the godavari basin where the southwest sw monsoon brings the majority 80 of basin wide rainfall sourced from the indian ocean arabian sea in the monsoon season june sept d excess 8 bhattacharya et al 2003 and the northeast ne monsoon brings heavy rains and erratic cyclones to the peninsular indian east coast by depressions formed in the bay of bengal oct dec i e prior to the pre monsoon season d excess 13 5 warrier et al 2010 in the pre monsoon season godavari waters show a high spatial variability in δ18o and δd values range 7 7 and 41 3 respectively fig 4a b coinciding with widely distributed origins in the back trajectories fig 5a c e g i k the upper godavari and north tributaries show mostly regional and subcontinental pathways fig 5a c i while for the other subbasins moisture originates from the persian region or arabian peninsula with long traverses over continental areas fig 5e g k pre monsoon water isotopes in the upper middle and lower godavari and north tributaries are enriched δ18o 0 0 1 5 and δd 5 8 8 5 n 43 fig 4a b compared to ne monsoon rainfall δ18o 7 and δd 45 warrier et al 2010 this likely results from deficient ne monsoon rainfall across the godavari basin average deficit 46 range 11 to 84 imd 2014 and evaporative enrichment of river waters in the year of sampling these findings on the godavari river contradict previous studies on south peninsular rivers and groundwater that report a significant contribution of the ne monsoon in the early pre monsoon season deshpande et al 2003 shivanna et al 2004 notably a part of the east tributaries waters i e sabari sileru and pumuleru rivers shows exceptionally low δ18o and δd values 3 5 and 23 respectively n 4 and high d excess max 8 in the pre monsoon season figs 4 a3 a5 rahul et al 2016 reported that tropical cyclones formed in the bay of bengal as part of the ne monsoon regime bring anomalously depleted precipitation 23 in δ18o to the indian east coast and can leave a temporary imprint spike effect on surface waters lambs et al 2018 rahul et al 2016 this suggests that the severe cyclone hudhud in october 2014 prior to sampling may have contributed to the observed anomalies in the east tributary waters as this cyclone brought intense rainfall to the eastern ghats subsequent evaporation that would have enriched surface waters was likely supressed by the dense forest cover in this region taken together our findings confirm that the ne monsoon mostly affects the downstream godavari although it may occasionally reach the godavari headwaters gupta et al 1997 2005 kumar et al 2010 the fact that the contribution by the ne monsoon was restricted to the east tributaries during this sampling campaign suggests a spatially and annually variable influence of this moisture source in the monsoon season isotopic values δ18o 3 4 1 6 δd 23 0 13 0 range 7 7 to 1 7 and 57 0 to 9 3 respectively n 35 and relatively high d excess 3 8 2 9 in the downstream godavari waters generally resemble sw monsoon precipitation signatures δ18o 2 2 to 2 8 δd 15 to 11 bowen 2017 figs 2 4a c this fits with back trajectory analysis showing a consistent origin in the indian ocean where the high trajectories 2 km agl follow a path over the gulf of aden or horn of africa and the other trajectories follow a marine path and all continue over the arabian sea fig 5b d f h j l together this suggests an effective pick up of moisture en route over the indian ocean arabian sea and a dominant sw monsoon input to the downstream godavari river consistent with the high rainfall amounts in this part of the basin in the monsoon season fig 2c f interestingly trajectories for the downstream godavari show a passage over the relatively lower northern part of the western ghats visualised by a moderate increase in trajectory heights and follow a path north of the godavari basin before turning south to the rainout location fig 5f h j l the upper godavari shows more southerly trajectories over the high altitude mountains with likely substantial rainout at the windward side this is in line with observations of low rainfall amounts in the upper godavari subbasin which is located in the western ghats rain shadow figs 1 2a b 5b d prior studies reported that mediterranean moisture contributes significantly to himalayan river discharges jeelani et al 2013 karim and veizer 2002 meese et al 2018 sharma et al 2017 and that its influence may reach southward along the western ghats to the godavari basin lambs et al 2011 nevertheless the low d excess in monsoonal godavari waters 10 9 fig 4c and back trajectories starting in the indian ocean and arabian peninsula fig 5 suggest that the input of mediterranean derived moisture which is typically characterised by a high d excess 22 is negligible 3 4 water isotopes in godavari surface waters in the monsoon season in the monsoon season the isotopic composition significantly differs between the subbasins of the godavari river p 0 001 linking to the spatial heterogeneity in monsoon precipitation at basin scale the north δ18o 5 3 2 0 δd 40 4 14 4 n 9 and east tributaries δ18o 3 6 0

δ18o 1 0 2 1 δd 2 5 11 0 n 12 fig 4 interestingly the north tributaries have the most depleted isotopic signatures even below the long term average for sw monsoon rainfall in this region δ18o 2 8 δd 15 fig 2e this strong depletion can be explained by a combination of factors including the amount effect this generally lowers isotopic values at high rainfall amounts especially in tropical regions bowen and revenaugh 2003 dansgaard 1964 feng et al 2009 gonfiantini et al 2001 and fits with the anomalous rainfall peak observed in june 2015 84 to 206 fig 2 also organised cloud convective activity due to an extensive cloud cover across the downstream godavari basin may have contributed to the extreme depletion in 18o as this was previously observed for precipitation in southern india and along the peninsular west coast lekshmy et al 2014 rahul et al 2016 rahul and ghosh 2019 in addition the low trajectory height mainly 1 5 km agl and upward motion shown by the back trajectory analysis for the north tributaries fig 5j are linked to increased pick up of moisture from the warm arabian sea and or sub cloud layer these trajectory features are reported to cause strong 18o depletion along india s west coast lekshmy et al 2014 furthermore the north tributary waters plot near the intersect of the gmwl lmwls and monsoonal godavari waters in the δ18o δd graph fig 3a b in the δ18o d excess graph they show a depletion in 18o i e shift towards left compared to sw monsoon precipitation estimates fig 3c from a process based perspective fig 3d this distinctive depletion in 18o compared to d excess points towards a dominant amount convective effect on the north tributary waters the upper godavari river has exceptionally high δ18o and δd values also compared to sw monsoon rainfall in this region δ18o 2 1 and 0 8 δd 7 0 and 2 0 at jalna and nashik respectively figs 2a b 4a b this enrichment points towards a reversed rainfall amount effect where low amounts cause an increase in δ18o and δd values gonfiantini et al 2001 this matches with the rainfall deficit in the upper godavari in the 2015 monsoon season 20 to 27 fig 2a b moreover d excess is typically low in the upper godavari 5 1 6 2 figs 3c 4c suggesting continuous river surface evaporation dutton et al 2005 in addition in the semi arid environment of the upper godavari light rainfall as experienced during sample collection in the monsoon season is known to cause evaporation of raindrops on their way to the ground i e cloud base evaporation araguás araguás et al 1998 this significantly lowers d excess in precipitation a phenomenon that is commonly noted at the leeward side of mountain ranges across south asia bershaw 2018 hence spatial isotopic patterns in the godavari basin closely reflect the observed sw monsoon rainfall distributions figs 2 4 a4 a6 in the downstream godavari region river water δ18o and δd values increase during transport from the north and east tributaries which receive high quantities of sw monsoon rainfall to the middle and the lower godavari by 0 44 and 4 0 100 km 1 respectively figs 2 6 a b similar trends were previously reported for other rivers gibson et al 2002 such as for the middle stretch of the ganges river where an increase in δ18o values of 0 15 100 km 1 800 1600 km from source kumar et al 2019 and of 1 1 100 km 1 in δd values 500 1700 km from source ramesh and sarin 1992 was observed this enrichment was attributed to the inflow of enriched water from tributaries ramesh and sarin 1992 in combination with river water evaporation and the input of isotopically enriched precipitation in the ganges river kumar et al 2019 the increasing enrichment of godavari river water downstream appears to be mainly caused by evaporation as tributaries and rainfall in the downstream region provide more depleted waters the relatively invariant d excess 3 8 2 9 may further suggest that the extent of in river evaporation is similar across the downstream godavari basin where river waters show consistently lower d excess than sw monsoon precipitation 8 at mumbai bhattacharya et al 2003 fig 6c interestingly godavari water isotopes have a similar regression slope 6 39 0 22 as groundwater in central 6 5 and southern 6 peninsular india deshpande et al 2003 gupta et al 2005 fig 3b this suggests that both the river and the groundwater are replenished by the same source i e the sw monsoon although quantification of groundwater inputs is challenging with the limited data available we note that the downriver enrichment observed here contrasts with earlier findings of a 2 depletion in 18o from west to east coast in groundwater in central india gupta et al 2005 and a 3 depletion in pre monsoonal river and groundwater in south india deshpande et al 2003 this discrepancy may imply limited groundwater input to the godavari river or other controlling mechanisms than gradual sw monsoon rainout and or ne monsoon inputs which were suggested to explain the depletion reported by earlier studies deshpande et al 2003 gupta et al 2005 finally the spatial variations in isotopic composition can be used to identify the pathway and provenance of water that is finally discharged by the godavari river to the bay of bengal the low δ18o and δd values of the north tributaries can be traced in downstream direction from the confluence with the middle godavari and then after joining with the east tributaries together providing the lower godavari signature figs 1b 6a b a4 a6 the low composite isotopic signature suggests an integrative effect in the downstream godavari with the north tributaries as most important source area the relatively depleted downstream godavari signature suggests a renewal of river water by the sw monsoon this would also imply that this precipitation drains rapidly into the river unaffected by soil percolation and or groundwater evaporative processes causing enrichment jasechko 2019 contrastingly the enriched signature of the upper godavari cannot be traced downriver implying negligible input to the downstream godavari this is likely due to low rainfall in combination with abundant dams in this upstream region pradhan et al 2014 fig a7 source apportionment by an end member model using mean d excess which integrates both precipitation and evaporation processes reveals that the majority 80 of river water in the middle godavari comes from the north tributaries while the east tributaries contribute a smaller amount 20 27 the lower godavari shows equal inputs by the north and east tributaries 50 23 to the final discharge at the dam in rajahmundry that regulates the flow to the godavari delta the reservoir lake and its outlet have similar isotopic signatures that do not change between the pre monsoon and monsoon season δ18o 2 6 0 6 δd 19 0 2 4 this suggests that reservoir lake waters are well mixed and buffer spatial seasonal and inter annual variations indeed the isotopic composition found in the delta is comparable to an estuary sample taken in the 2001 monsoon season δ18o 5 5 d excess 3 2 lambs et al 2005 which confirms a limited annual variability in the isotopic composition of water that is discharged to the bay of bengal however given the large year to year fluctuations in the godavari s discharge 6 8 130 km3 year 1 1969 2010 acharyya et al 2012 biksham and subramanian 1988b further monitoring at extended temporal scales is warranted the small range in isotopic composition in the godavari delta figs a4 a6 and along a δ18o salinity transect following the main branch gautami to the bay of bengal δ18o 2 2 to 2 9 salinity 0 06 3 6 g l 1 suggest that the river plume extends beyond the godavari mouth and that minimal river seawater mixing takes place within the estuary in the monsoon season 3 5 water isotopes in godavari surface waters in the pre monsoon season in the pre monsoon season godavari waters have high δ18o and δd values suggesting that they are primarily influenced by surface evaporation fig 4a b this is in line with the prevailing meteorological conditions with low humidity scarce rainfall and high temperatures across the godavari basin fig 2 enhancing large scale evaporation this evaporation may possibly exceed annual rainfall in the upstream region jhajharia et al 2014 significant isotopic differences between the subbasins p 0 01 suggest spatial variability in the magnitude of evaporation processes the most depleted signatures in this season are found in the east tributaries δ18o 2 0 2 7 δd 16 2 11 9 n 6 followed by the lower δ18o 1 1 0 7 δd 7 7 6 2 n 13 middle godavari δ18o 0 4 2 8 δd 10 0 13 0 n 4 and north tributaries δ18o 0 3 1 1 δd 8 6 5 3 n 11 most enriched signatures are found in the upper godavari waters δ18o 0 8 1 5 δd 1 0 9 2 n 15 this suggests an increase in the magnitude of evaporation towards the upstream godavari basin in particular the upper godavari shows a high variability in isotopic content δ18o 1 4 to 3 8 δd 13 d excess 15 7 to 6 6 the most extreme enrichment δ18o 2 and lowest d excess 5 is there found in the vicinity of dams where standing water likely facilitates evaporation as has been reported for rivers and reservoirs in monsoonal and semi arid climates e g diamond and jack 2018 li et al 2016 the relatively depleted signature of several east tributaries i e sileru sabari and pumuleru rivers is transferred downstream where their influence can be traced based on the lower δ18o and δd values in the main stem godavari after their confluence with the middle godavari and remains recognisable up to the reservoir lake in the lower godavari figs 1b d 6 a b a3 a5 however there is no consistent longitudinal trend from source to sea in this season which implies poor river connectivity within the godavari basin this is underlined by observations of pools with standing water interspersed with dry river beds the river flow in the upstream godavari is known to be disturbed by the proliferation of dams in this region pradhan et al 2014 dams influence 28 to 37 of the godavari river flow making it one of the most strongly affected rivers in asia nilsson et al 2005 pradhan et al 2014 and likely inhibit any recognisable contribution from the upper godavari to the isotopic signal in the downstream basin figs a3 a5 a7 together with recurrent droughts in the pre monsoon season and lean monsoonal rainfall causing falling reservoir levels cwc 2019 gdo 2019 dams further contribute to the extent of basin wide evaporation due to the limited input of direct precipitation groundwater may be an important source for the godavari river in the pre monsoon season gupta et al 2005 found that shallow groundwater may locally contribute to rivers based on the resemblance between river and groundwater isotopes in central india groundwater in the godavari region is enriched compared to sw and ne monsoon precipitation gupta et al 2005 this may be due to cloud base evaporation or more likely at low rainfall in the pre monsoon season to evaporation of soil moisture before it recharges groundwater the enriched isotopic signatures of godavari river waters δ18o mainly 1 compared to groundwater δ18o 1 to 3 gupta et al 2005 suggest that if groundwater substantially contributes this signal is further altered by in river evaporation similar findings for peninsular rivers in south india with enriched signatures compared to groundwater and low d excess 6 deshpande et al 2003 suggest that in river evaporation is a wide spread phenomenon in the pre monsoon season however quantitative estimations of groundwater to river inputs and subsequent evaporation would require detailed monitoring of the groundwater isotopic composition the water isotopes of lonar lake an isolated crater lake in the upstream godavari basin fed by groundwater springs and direct sw monsoon rainfall fig 1a revealed that groundwater supplies were lithologically controlled by the deccan trap basalts which consist of alternating high and low permeable layers that underlie the majority of the upstream godavari basin biksham and subramanian 1988b komatsu et al 2014 usman et al 2018 our sampling of lonar lake in the pre monsoon season δ18o 6 9 δd 30 6 shows more enriched values than groundwater δ18o 2 5 0 6 δd 16 6 4 3 and late pre monsoon signatures δ18o 4 3 0 1 δd 15 7 0 9 anoop et al 2013 extrapolating these values to the upstream godavari suggests that if the river water is derived from groundwater it has undergone significant surface evaporation currently evaporation estimates range from 5 to 16 mm day 1 from the lower to the upper godavari cwc 2015b where the yearly evaporative loss from the reservoir lake at rajahmundry in a sub humid climate is estimated at 46 bharati et al 2009 this highlights a significant loss from a reservoir surface purposed for water storage from the reservoir lake to the godavari delta river water signatures become more enriched towards the outlets i e three delta branches figs 1b c 6 a b a3 a5 the abundance of irrigated fields e g paddy rice and irrigated legumes in the delta region and their reported high evaporation rates bouwer et al 2008 may contribute to this enrichment when partially evaporated irrigation water drains back in the river in the godavari estuary δ18o and δd values progressively increase towards sea the δ18o values linearly increase with salinity r2 0 94 in the main branch similar to the conservative behaviour reported for other estuarine systems in monsoonal regions e g somayajulu et al 2002 zhang et al 1990 this is suggestive of efficient mixing of river and seawater within the godavari estuary and is consistent with seawater intrusion from the godavari mouth in the pre monsoon season 3 6 water isotopes along river depth profiles and cross sections previous studies in large river basins have shown that the confluence of tributaries results in complex mixing processes with characteristic vertical depth profiles for sediment following hydrodynamic sorting effects and solute distributions due to changed flow conditions e g bouchez et al 2010 feng et al 2016 freymond et al 2018 laraque et al 2009 stable water isotopes are an overlooked tracer in this perspective despite their proven applicability to examine lateral mixing at river cross sections to evaluate mixing processes in downstream direction fritz 1981 krouse and mackay 1971 matsui et al 1976 fritz 1981 reported on major seasonal rivers with fluctuating water levels including the rhine main germany rio solimões rio negro brasil and liard mackenzie canada all with tributaries with different isotopic signatures that a distance of respectively 50 120 and 300 km was needed for thorough lateral mixing of the river waters after their confluence for the godavari river the cross section in the main stem middle godavari river reveals that isotopic signatures in the monsoon season show little variation across the river and with depth δ18o 2 7 0 2 δd 18 0 0 7 d excess 3 9 1 3 figs 1b d 7a c this points towards efficient lateral mixing of tributary waters as this cross section is sampled only 100 km downstream of the confluence of the upper godavari and north tributaries which all drain via the pranhita river into the middle godavari and 60 km after joining of the indravati river a major tributary of the east tributaries subbasin and first to join the main stem middle godavari figs 1b d a4 a6 in the lower godavari the cross section in the monsoon season shows some minor variation laterally and with depth in δ18o δd and d excess values range 0 4 2 2 and 5 1 respectively figs 1c 7d f this variation is likely associated with a lower flow velocity near the river banks where shallowing of the river reduces vertical mixing nevertheless in both the pre monsoon and monsoon season the δd δ18o and d excess values of samples collected from depth profiles in the middle of the river are constant fig 7 this suggests that main stem godavari river waters are generally well mixed in the subsurface without column stratification diamond and jack 2018 or surface enrichment due to in river evaporation 3 7 a regional perspective the godavari basin and other indian rivers to provide a regional perspective on the water isotopic composition of indian rivers we compare the δ18o and δd values in surface waters of the godavari river this study n 96 with values reported in the literature for other in indian rivers n 399 supporting information kirkels 2020 this includes coastal rivers draining the western ghats into the arabian sea peninsular rivers flowing into the bay of bengal and major himalayan rivers such as the indus and ganges river in the pre monsoon and monsoon season fig 8 a b the godavari coastal and peninsular rivers are primarily fed by monsoon precipitation while the himalayan rivers receive additional inputs from meltwater within the indian subcontinent godavari river surface waters this study are relatively enriched particularly in the pre monsoon season fig 8a the himalayan rivers have more depleted signatures than godavari waters attributable to a strong elevation effect on sw monsoon moisture and its transient storage in snow glaciers feeding back into the indus pre monsoon δ18o 15 3 to 2 6 δd 108 0 to 17 0 monsoon δ18o 17 0 to 2 4 δd 122 8 to 12 0 karim and veizer 2002 sharma et al 2017 and ganges river pre monsoon δ18o 14 4 to 2 4 δd 103 to 19 0 monsoon δ18o 14 9 to 3 5 δd 103 to 19 0 kumar et al 2019 lambs et al 2005 ramesh and sarin 1992 isotopic signatures of peninsular rivers pre monsoon δ18o 5 3 to 0 7 δd 45 2 to 7 0 monsoon δ18o 6 1 to 1 0 δd 46 5 to 9 7 deshpande et al 2003 gupta et al 2005 lambs et al 2005 generally overlap with monsoonal godavari river waters the coastal rivers pre monsoon δ18o 4 4 to 1 4 δd 32 0 to 8 5 monsoon δ18o 4 0 to 1 6 δd 22 5 to 0 8 deshpande et al 2003 gupta et al 2005 lambs et al 2005 tripti et al 2013 2016 2019 show no linear δd δ18o correlation implying a different control on isotopic signatures the godavari river is characterised by a large seasonal difference in δd δ18o regression slope p 0 001 however the east flowing peninsular rivers e g cauvery krishna regression slope 6 7 6 9 as well as the himalayan indus 7 8 8 2 and ganges river 6 2 6 0 all show insignificant changes in slope at a seasonal scale p 0 11 as revealed by the data compilation fig 8b particularly in the pre monsoon season the godavari river slope is low 4 74 0 33 and plots significantly below the other indian rivers p 0 001 this highlights the large influence of evaporation in the godavari basin compared to other indian river basins fig 8a inset nevertheless in the monsoon season the godavari river slope 6 39 0 22 is comparable to other indian rivers draining into the bay of bengal the ganges river and peninsular rivers 5 98 0 24 and 6 89 0 31 p 0 20 and p 0 21 respectively signifying that they are fed by the same source i e the sw monsoon and subsequently experience similar hydrological processes 4 conclusions the godavari river the largest non himalayan river of india shows significant seasonal and spatial variability in δ18o and δd values in its surface waters seasonal differences in the godavari basin are primarily driven by the dual southwest and northeast monsoon systems and subsequently altered by evaporation processes godavari waters in the pre monsoon dry and monsoon wet season plot below the global and local meteoric water lines particularly in the pre monsoon season underlining the occurrence of basin wide evaporation a data compilation n 399 of δ18o and δd values in indian rivers reveals a stronger seasonality in the water isotopic composition for the godavari river than for other monsoon fed rivers in india in the monsoon season isotopic signatures in the downstream godavari basin reflect southwest monsoon rainfall back trajectory analysis confirms that this moisture is sourced from the indian ocean and arabian sea spatial differences within the godavari basin are linked to heterogeneity in rainfall patterns the upper godavari located in the rain shadow of the western ghats with a rainfall deficit in the 2015 monsoon season has highly enriched signatures suggesting year round evaporation moreover abundant dam building prevents any contribution to the downstream godavari s discharge the north and east tributaries have depleted signatures due to high rainfall quantities causing an amount convective effect these depleted signatures are traced downstream through the middle and lower godavari and show a well integrated signal where both tributaries contribute 50 to the final discharge river depth profiles and cross sections reveal well mixed tributary waters as well as well mixed surface and deeper waters in the godavari delta isotopic patterns and salinity measurements show that the river plume extends beyond the godavari mouth indicating high discharge into the bay of bengal in the monsoon season in the pre monsoon season river water isotopes across the godavari basin are enriched due to dominant in river evaporation evaporation is more pronounced in the godavari than for other indian rivers as shown by an extensive data compilation northeast monsoon inputs are spatially limited to the east tributaries and this signal is not transferred downstream observations of dry river beds and stagnant water behind dams underline poor river connectivity in the delta conservative mixing of river and seawater implies seawater intrusion and no discharge from the godavari river in the pre monsoon season this study on the godavari river showed that river water isotopic composition is a sensitive recorder of seasonal and spatial variability in monsoon rainfall patterns improved understanding of the basin hydrology of the monsoon fed godavari river and further monitoring of the spatio temporal evolution of river water isotopes in monsoonal rivers may help to develop integrated river management strategies for the future dealing with water scarcity flood and drought mitigation and

spatio temporal patterns in godavari river water isotopes confirm their suitability as sensitive recorders of monsoon precipitation variability and hydrological processes within monsoon fed rivers keywords water isotopes godavari river spatio temporal patterns water provenance river connectivity evaporation 1 introduction rivers originating from monsoonal rainfall are a major source of freshwater in densely populated countries in south asia like india currently ⅔ of the indian population relies on monsoonal precipitation and rivers for food production and their livelihood amrith 2018 biemans et al 2013 singh et al 2014 monsoon fed rivers provide not only trade and transport but also water supplies for agriculture industry and domestic use szabo et al 2016 varis et al 2012 however the future of river dynamics in indian monsoon regions is highly uncertain with more extreme precipitation and recurrent droughts resulting from climate change e g nair et al 2018 singh et al 2014 turner and annamalai 2012 for sustainable river basin management it is crucial to understand the sources and pathways of river water as well as tributary contributions to the final discharge and thus gain insights into seasonal and spatial changes in monsoonal rivers the stable isotopic composition δ18o and δd of river water is a powerful integrator of hydrological processes in a river basin e g dutton et al 2005 gibson et al 2002 kendall and coplen 2001 in general river water is assumed to reflect the isotopic variance of regional and large scale continental precipitation where the latter is predominantly a function of elevation amount of rainfall type and distance of its source e g dansgaard 1964 gibson et al 2002 halder et al 2015 kendall and coplen 2001 poage and chamberlain 2001 however the isotopic composition of monsoon fed rivers is unlikely to be static over space and time as these rivers may receive input from multiple moisture sources such as contributions by the southwest and northeast monsoon systems in south asia with the associated seasonal variability in hydrological conditions furthermore secondary processes such as evaporation and recycling can also substantially modify river isotopic signatures dutton et al 2005 kendall and coplen 2001 lambs et al 2011 ramesh and sarin 1992 sharma et al 2017 evaporation increases δ18o and δd values and decreases deuterium excess d excess and thus can be used to gain insight into water loss downstream in semi arid or arid environments or during dry periods in monsoon influenced regions gibson et al 2002 for instance a downstream increase in δ18o and δd values in the middle stretch of the ganges river 800 to 1600 km from its source at gomukh was attributed to high evaporation of river water kumar et al 2019 ramesh and sarin 1992 in addition artificial barriers such as dams are known to significantly alter river dynamics by regulation and fragmentation of the river flow in many basins worldwide nilsson et al 2005 however their effect on river water isotopic composition is often overlooked dutton et al 2005 the presence of dams may lead to isotopic enrichment of stagnant river water due to increased evaporation and or dams may buffer seasonal isotopic changes due to storage and mixing of isotopically different inputs into dammed reservoirs diamond and jack 2018 li et al 2016 hence river water isotopic patterns contain process based information on the governing hydrology within a river basin the contrasting flow regimes of monsoon fed rivers provide a natural laboratory to investigate seasonal wet and dry season and spatial longitudinal lateral and vertical variability in river water isotopic signatures the godavari river is the largest non himalayan river of india situated in the core monsoon zone of india it is fed by the southwest and northeast monsoon regimes global climate change has increased the variability in monsoonal rainfall with more extreme precipitation events on one hand deshpande et al 2016 goswami et al 2006 roxy et al 2017 turner and annamalai 2012 and prolonged periods with deficient rainfall on the other basu et al 2020 naidu et al 2009 nair et al 2018

which directly influences 28 to 37 of its flow rate nilsson et al 2005 pradhan et al 2014 so far single point analysis of water isotopes at the godavari mouth lambs et al 2005 and in lonar lake an isolated crater lake anoop et al 2013 revealed a potential sensitivity in response to changing monsoon rainfall patterns on geological time scales available records of past monsoon precipitation are based on shifts in the geochemical and isotopic composition of terrestrial materials stored in coastal marine sediments after mobilisation transport and discharge by the godavari river into the bay of bengal e g contreras rosales et al 2014 ponton et al 2012 usman et al 2018 these records suggest a change in sediment provenance and aridification starting around 4500 years ago likely caused by a shift in monsoon dynamics however in depth knowledge on the variability of water isotopes in the godavari river basin is limited we hypothesise that water isotopes in the godavari river vary significantly on a spatial and seasonal scale in response to variability in monsoon rainfall patterns and dominant hydrological processes this information will lead to a better understanding of the hydrological dynamics in monsoon fed river systems and can contribute to future river management strategies e g flood and drought mitigation as well as sustainable use of the river as resource for irrigation and food production here we investigate river water isotopes δ18o and δd in the main stem tributaries and depth profiles of the godavari river in a pre monsoon dry and monsoon wet season to reveal governing hydrological processes and trace pathways from source to sea fundamental steps are 1 to identify the river water provenance i e monsoon rainfall source and tributary contributions and 2 assess to what extent hydrological processes such as evaporation water re cycling and mixing alter the river water isotopic composition during transit through the basin our data will be placed in a regional perspective by comparison of godavari river water isotopes with global and local meteoric water lines as well as with water isotopes reported in the literature on himalayan peninsular and coastal rivers in india this high resolution study on the godavari river will provide insights into monsoon variability and basin hydrology in the indian core monsoon zone and contribute to the global database on river water isotopes 2 materials and methods 2 1 godavari river basin the godavari river is the second longest river in india and flows 1500 km from its source in the western ghats

the western ghats to 2300 mm year 1 in the sub humid lower basin gunnell 1997 fig 1d the mean annual temperature is 24 c at the godavari s source and increases eastward to a maximum of 29 4 c at the mouth babar and kaplay 2018 prominent crops range from aridity adapted c4 plants e g sugar cane sorghum millet in the upstream region to paddy rice and rain dependent crops downstream krishna et al

araguás et al 1998 gadgil 2003 yihui and chan 2005 each monsoon system has a source specific isotopic signature owing to their different geographic origin the seawater sourced from the bay of bengal is 1 lower in δ18o and 8 in δd compared to that of the arabian sea due to the large inflow of isotopically depleted runoff from himalayan indus and ganges rivers delaygue et al 2001 kumar et al 2010

the slope of a typical evaporation line which is theoretically close to 4 at very low relative humidity 25 and between 4 and 5 at moderate relative humidity 75 clark and fritz 1997 in addition low

waters plot between precipitation sampled across the basin green and an open tank sample magenta in hyderabad négrel et al 2011 the conceptual model based on these data fig 3d reveals an increasing influence of evaporation from the down to the upstream godavari basin in the monsoon season fig 3c samples taken in the upper godavari plot towards the open tank négrel et al 2011 in both seasons pointing out that this subbasin experiences a dominant year round evaporative effect on river water isotopes following this model fig 3d our data further suggest that the contribution of recycled water to the godavari river is negligible in both seasons as we do not observe the sharp increase in d excess relative to δ18o that would occur upon condensation of once evaporated moisture into precipitation araguás araguás et al 2000 3 3 moisture sources of river water in the godavari basin in the downstream godavari we observe an average seasonal shift in isotopic composition of 2 5 in

atmospheric circulation patterns where moisture is dominantly sourced from the indian ocean arabian sea in the monsoon season and from the continent and the bay of bengal in the pre monsoon season fig

middle and lower godavari and north tributaries are enriched δ18o 0 0 1 5 and δd 5 8 8 5 n 43 fig 4a b compared to ne monsoon rainfall δ18o 7 and δd 45 warrier et al 2010 this likely results from deficient ne monsoon rainfall across the godavari basin average deficit 46 range 11 to 84 imd 2014 and evaporative enrichment of river waters in the year of sampling these findings on the godavari river contradict previous studies on south peninsular rivers and groundwater that report a significant contribution of the ne monsoon in the early pre monsoon season deshpande et al 2003 shivanna et al 2004 notably a part of the east tributaries waters i e sabari sileru and pumuleru rivers shows exceptionally low δ18o and δd values 3 5 and 23 respectively n 4 and high d excess max 8 in the pre monsoon season figs 4 a3 a5 rahul et al 2016 reported that tropical cyclones formed in the bay of bengal as part of the ne monsoon regime bring anomalously depleted precipitation 23 in δ18o to the indian east coast and can leave a temporary imprint spike effect on surface waters lambs et al 2018 rahul et al 2016 this suggests that the severe cyclone hudhud in october 2014 prior to sampling may have contributed to the observed anomalies in the east tributary waters as this cyclone brought intense rainfall to the eastern ghats subsequent evaporation that would have enriched surface waters was likely supressed by the dense forest cover in this region taken together our findings confirm that the ne monsoon mostly affects the downstream godavari although it may occasionally reach the godavari headwaters gupta et al 1997 2005 kumar et al 2010 the fact that the contribution by the ne monsoon was restricted to the east tributaries during this sampling campaign suggests a spatially and annually variable influence of this moisture source in the monsoon season isotopic values δ18o 3 4 1 6 δd 23 0 13 0 range 7 7 to 1 7 and 57 0 to 9 3 respectively n 35 and relatively high d excess 3 8 2 9 in the downstream godavari waters generally resemble sw monsoon precipitation signatures δ18o 2 2 to 2 8 δd 15 to 11 bowen 2017 figs 2 4a c this fits with back trajectory analysis showing a consistent origin in the indian ocean where the high trajectories 2 km agl follow a path over the gulf of aden or horn of africa and the other trajectories follow a marine path and all continue over the arabian sea fig 5b d f h j l together this suggests an effective pick up of moisture en route over the indian ocean arabian sea and a dominant sw monsoon input to the downstream godavari river consistent with the high rainfall amounts in this part of the basin in the monsoon season fig 2c f interestingly trajectories for the downstream godavari show a passage over the relatively lower northern part of the western ghats visualised by a moderate increase in trajectory heights and follow a path north of the godavari basin before turning south to the rainout location fig 5f h j l the upper godavari shows more southerly trajectories over the high altitude mountains with likely substantial rainout at the windward side this is in line with observations of low rainfall amounts in the upper godavari subbasin which is located in the western ghats rain shadow figs 1 2a b 5b d prior studies reported that mediterranean moisture contributes significantly to himalayan river discharges jeelani et al 2013 karim and veizer 2002 meese et al 2018 sharma et al 2017 and that its influence may reach southward along the western ghats to the godavari basin lambs et al 2011 nevertheless the low d excess in monsoonal godavari waters 10 9 fig 4c and back trajectories starting in the indian ocean and arabian peninsula fig 5 suggest that the input of mediterranean derived moisture which is typically characterised by a high d excess 22 is negligible 3 4 water isotopes in godavari surface waters in the monsoon season in the monsoon season the isotopic composition significantly differs between the subbasins of the godavari river p 0 001 linking to the spatial heterogeneity in monsoon precipitation at basin scale the north δ18o 5 3 2 0 δd 40 4 14 4 n 9 and east tributaries δ18o 3 6 0

δ18o 1 0 2 1 δd 2 5 11 0 n 12 fig 4 interestingly the north tributaries have the most depleted isotopic signatures even below the long term average for sw monsoon rainfall in this region δ18o 2 8 δd 15 fig 2e this strong depletion can be explained by a combination of factors including the amount effect this generally lowers isotopic values at high rainfall amounts especially in tropical regions bowen and revenaugh 2003 dansgaard 1964 feng et al 2009 gonfiantini et al 2001 and fits with the anomalous rainfall peak observed in june 2015 84 to 206 fig 2 also organised cloud convective activity due to an extensive cloud cover across the downstream godavari basin may have contributed to the extreme depletion in 18o as this was previously observed for precipitation in southern india and along the peninsular west coast lekshmy et al 2014 rahul et al 2016 rahul and ghosh 2019 in addition the low trajectory height mainly 1 5 km agl and upward motion shown by the back trajectory analysis for the north tributaries fig 5j are linked to increased pick up of moisture from the warm arabian sea and or sub cloud layer these trajectory features are reported to cause strong 18o depletion along india s west coast lekshmy et al 2014 furthermore the north tributary waters plot near the intersect of the gmwl lmwls and monsoonal godavari waters in the δ18o δd graph fig 3a b in the δ18o d excess graph they show a depletion in 18o i e shift towards left compared to sw monsoon precipitation estimates fig 3c from a process based perspective fig 3d this distinctive depletion in 18o compared to d excess points towards a dominant amount convective effect on the north tributary waters the upper godavari river has exceptionally high δ18o and δd values also compared to sw monsoon rainfall in this region δ18o 2 1 and 0 8 δd 7 0 and 2 0 at jalna and nashik respectively figs 2a b 4a b this enrichment points towards a reversed rainfall amount effect where low amounts cause an increase in δ18o and δd values gonfiantini et al 2001 this matches with the rainfall deficit in the upper godavari in the 2015 monsoon season 20 to 27 fig 2a b moreover d excess is typically low in the upper godavari 5 1 6 2 figs 3c 4c suggesting continuous river surface evaporation dutton et al 2005 in addition in the semi arid environment of the upper godavari light rainfall as experienced during sample collection in the monsoon season is known to cause evaporation of raindrops on their way to the ground i e cloud base evaporation araguás araguás et al 1998 this significantly lowers d excess in precipitation a phenomenon that is commonly noted at the leeward side of mountain ranges across south asia bershaw 2018 hence spatial isotopic patterns in the godavari basin closely reflect the observed sw monsoon rainfall distributions figs 2 4 a4 a6 in the downstream godavari region river water δ18o and δd values increase during transport from the north and east tributaries which receive high quantities of sw monsoon rainfall to the middle and the lower godavari by 0 44 and 4 0 100 km 1 respectively figs 2 6 a b similar trends were previously reported for other rivers gibson et al 2002 such as for the middle stretch of the ganges river where an increase in δ18o values of 0 15 100 km 1 800 1600 km from source kumar et al 2019 and of 1 1 100 km 1 in δd values 500 1700 km from source ramesh and sarin 1992 was observed this enrichment was attributed to the inflow of enriched water from tributaries ramesh and sarin 1992 in combination with river water evaporation and the input of isotopically enriched precipitation in the ganges river kumar et al 2019 the increasing enrichment of godavari river water downstream appears to be mainly caused by evaporation as tributaries and rainfall in the downstream region provide more depleted waters the relatively invariant d excess 3 8 2 9 may further suggest that the extent of in river evaporation is similar across the downstream godavari basin where river waters show consistently lower d excess than sw monsoon precipitation 8 at mumbai bhattacharya et al 2003 fig 6c interestingly godavari water isotopes have a similar regression slope 6 39 0 22 as groundwater in central 6 5 and southern 6 peninsular india deshpande et al 2003 gupta et al 2005 fig 3b this suggests that both the river and the groundwater are replenished by the same source i e the sw monsoon although quantification of groundwater inputs is challenging with the limited data available we note that the downriver enrichment observed here contrasts with earlier findings of a 2 depletion in 18o from west to east coast in groundwater in central india gupta et al 2005 and a 3 depletion in pre monsoonal river and groundwater in south india deshpande et al 2003 this discrepancy may imply limited groundwater input to the godavari river or other controlling mechanisms than gradual sw monsoon rainout and or ne monsoon inputs which were suggested to explain the depletion reported by earlier studies deshpande et al 2003 gupta et al 2005 finally the spatial variations in isotopic composition can be used to identify the pathway and provenance of water that is finally discharged by the godavari river to the bay of bengal the low δ18o and δd values of the north tributaries can be traced in downstream direction from the confluence with the middle godavari and then after joining with the east tributaries together providing the lower godavari signature figs 1b 6a b a4 a6 the low composite isotopic signature suggests an integrative effect in the downstream godavari with the north tributaries as most important source area the relatively depleted downstream godavari signature suggests a renewal of river water by the sw monsoon this would also imply that this precipitation drains rapidly into the river unaffected by soil percolation and or groundwater evaporative processes causing enrichment jasechko 2019 contrastingly the enriched signature of the upper godavari cannot be traced downriver implying negligible input to the downstream godavari this is likely due to low rainfall in combination with abundant dams in this upstream region pradhan et al 2014 fig a7 source apportionment by an end member model using mean d excess which integrates both precipitation and evaporation processes reveals that the majority 80 of river water in the middle godavari comes from the north tributaries while the east tributaries contribute a smaller amount 20 27 the lower godavari shows equal inputs by the north and east tributaries 50 23 to the final discharge at the dam in rajahmundry that regulates the flow to the godavari delta the reservoir lake and its outlet have similar isotopic signatures that do not change between the pre monsoon and monsoon season δ18o 2 6 0 6 δd 19 0 2 4 this suggests that reservoir lake waters are well mixed and buffer spatial seasonal and inter annual variations indeed the isotopic composition found in the delta is comparable to an estuary sample taken in the 2001 monsoon season δ18o 5 5 d excess 3 2 lambs et al 2005 which confirms a limited annual variability in the isotopic composition of water that is discharged to the bay of bengal however given the large year to year fluctuations in the godavari s discharge 6 8 130 km3 year 1 1969 2010 acharyya et al 2012 biksham and subramanian 1988b further monitoring at extended temporal scales is warranted the small range in isotopic composition in the godavari delta figs a4 a6 and along a δ18o salinity transect following the main branch gautami to the bay of bengal δ18o 2 2 to 2 9 salinity 0 06 3 6 g l 1 suggest that the river plume extends beyond the godavari mouth and that minimal river seawater mixing takes place within the estuary in the monsoon season 3 5 water isotopes in godavari surface waters in the pre monsoon season in the pre monsoon season godavari waters have high δ18o and δd values suggesting that they are primarily influenced by surface evaporation fig 4a b this is in line with the prevailing meteorological conditions with low humidity scarce rainfall and high temperatures across the godavari basin fig 2 enhancing large scale evaporation this evaporation may possibly exceed annual rainfall in the upstream region jhajharia et al 2014 significant isotopic differences between the subbasins p 0 01 suggest spatial variability in the magnitude of evaporation processes the most depleted signatures in this season are found in the east tributaries δ18o 2 0 2 7 δd 16 2 11 9 n 6 followed by the lower δ18o 1 1 0 7 δd 7 7 6 2 n 13 middle godavari δ18o 0 4 2 8 δd 10 0 13 0 n 4 and north tributaries δ18o 0 3 1 1 δd 8 6 5 3 n 11 most enriched signatures are found in the upper godavari waters δ18o 0 8 1 5 δd 1 0 9 2 n 15 this suggests an increase in the magnitude of evaporation towards the upstream godavari basin in particular the upper godavari shows a high variability in isotopic content δ18o 1 4 to 3 8 δd 13 d excess 15 7 to 6 6 the most extreme enrichment δ18o 2 and lowest d excess 5 is there found in the vicinity of dams where standing water likely facilitates evaporation as has been reported for rivers and reservoirs in monsoonal and semi arid climates e g diamond and jack 2018 li et al 2016 the relatively depleted signature of several east tributaries i e sileru sabari and pumuleru rivers is transferred downstream where their influence can be traced based on the lower δ18o and δd values in the main stem godavari after their confluence with the middle godavari and remains recognisable up to the reservoir lake in the lower godavari figs 1b d 6 a b a3 a5 however there is no consistent longitudinal trend from source to sea in this season which implies poor river connectivity within the godavari basin this is underlined by observations of pools with standing water interspersed with dry river beds the river flow in the upstream godavari is known to be disturbed by the proliferation of dams in this region pradhan et al 2014 dams influence 28 to 37 of the godavari river flow making it one of the most strongly affected rivers in asia nilsson et al 2005 pradhan et al 2014 and likely inhibit any recognisable contribution from the upper godavari to the isotopic signal in the downstream basin figs a3 a5 a7 together with recurrent droughts in the pre monsoon season and lean monsoonal rainfall causing falling reservoir levels cwc 2019 gdo 2019 dams further contribute to the extent of basin wide evaporation due to the limited input of direct precipitation groundwater may be an important source for the godavari river in the pre monsoon season gupta et al 2005 found that shallow groundwater may locally contribute to rivers based on the resemblance between river and groundwater isotopes in central india groundwater in the godavari region is enriched compared to sw and ne monsoon precipitation gupta et al 2005 this may be due to cloud base evaporation or more likely at low rainfall in the pre monsoon season to evaporation of soil moisture before it recharges groundwater the enriched isotopic signatures of godavari river waters δ18o mainly 1 compared to groundwater δ18o 1 to 3 gupta et al 2005 suggest that if groundwater substantially contributes this signal is further altered by in river evaporation similar findings for peninsular rivers in south india with enriched signatures compared to groundwater and low d excess 6 deshpande et al 2003 suggest that in river evaporation is a wide spread phenomenon in the pre monsoon season however quantitative estimations of groundwater to river inputs and subsequent evaporation would require detailed monitoring of the groundwater isotopic composition the water isotopes of lonar lake an isolated crater lake in the upstream godavari basin fed by groundwater springs and direct sw monsoon rainfall fig 1a revealed that groundwater supplies were lithologically controlled by the deccan trap basalts which consist of alternating high and low permeable layers that underlie the majority of the upstream godavari basin biksham and subramanian 1988b komatsu et al 2014 usman et al 2018 our sampling of lonar lake in the pre monsoon season δ18o 6 9 δd 30 6 shows more enriched values than groundwater δ18o 2 5 0 6 δd 16 6 4 3 and late pre monsoon signatures δ18o 4 3 0 1 δd 15 7 0 9 anoop et al 2013 extrapolating these values to the upstream godavari suggests that if the river water is derived from groundwater it has undergone significant surface evaporation currently evaporation estimates range from 5 to 16 mm day 1 from the lower to the upper godavari cwc 2015b where the yearly evaporative loss from the reservoir lake at rajahmundry in a sub humid climate is estimated at 46 bharati et al 2009 this highlights a significant loss from a reservoir surface purposed for water storage from the reservoir lake to the godavari delta river water signatures become more enriched towards the outlets i e three delta branches figs 1b c 6 a b a3 a5 the abundance of irrigated fields e g paddy rice and irrigated legumes in the delta region and their reported high evaporation rates bouwer et al 2008 may contribute to this enrichment when partially evaporated irrigation water drains back in the river in the godavari estuary δ18o and δd values progressively increase towards sea the δ18o values linearly increase with salinity r2 0 94 in the main branch similar to the conservative behaviour reported for other estuarine systems in monsoonal regions e g somayajulu et al 2002 zhang et al 1990 this is suggestive of efficient mixing of river and seawater within the godavari estuary and is consistent with seawater intrusion from the godavari mouth in the pre monsoon season 3 6 water isotopes along river depth profiles and cross sections previous studies in large river basins have shown that the confluence of tributaries results in complex mixing processes with characteristic vertical depth profiles for sediment following hydrodynamic sorting effects and solute distributions due to changed flow conditions e g bouchez et al 2010 feng et al 2016 freymond et al 2018 laraque et al 2009 stable water isotopes are an overlooked tracer in this perspective despite their proven applicability to examine lateral mixing at river cross sections to evaluate mixing processes in downstream direction fritz 1981 krouse and mackay 1971 matsui et al 1976 fritz 1981 reported on major seasonal rivers with fluctuating water levels including the rhine main germany rio solimões rio negro brasil and liard mackenzie canada all with tributaries with different isotopic signatures that a distance of respectively 50 120 and 300 km was needed for thorough lateral mixing of the river waters after their confluence for the godavari river the cross section in the main stem middle godavari river reveals that isotopic signatures in the monsoon season show little variation across the river and with depth δ18o 2 7 0 2 δd 18 0 0 7 d excess 3 9 1 3 figs 1b d 7a c this points towards efficient lateral mixing of tributary waters as this cross section is sampled only 100 km downstream of the confluence of the upper godavari and north tributaries which all drain via the pranhita river into the middle godavari and 60 km after joining of the indravati river a major tributary of the east tributaries subbasin and first to join the main stem middle godavari figs 1b d a4 a6 in the lower godavari the cross section in the monsoon season shows some minor variation laterally and with depth in δ18o δd and d excess values range 0 4 2 2 and 5 1 respectively figs 1c 7d f this variation is likely associated with a lower flow velocity near the river banks where shallowing of the river reduces vertical mixing nevertheless in both the pre monsoon and monsoon season the δd δ18o and d excess values of samples collected from depth profiles in the middle of the river are constant fig 7 this suggests that main stem godavari river waters are generally well mixed in the subsurface without column stratification diamond and jack 2018 or surface enrichment due to in river evaporation 3 7 a regional perspective the godavari basin and other indian rivers to provide a regional perspective on the water isotopic composition of indian rivers we compare the δ18o and δd values in surface waters of the godavari river this study n 96 with values reported in the literature for other in indian rivers n 399 supporting information kirkels 2020 this includes coastal rivers draining the western ghats into the arabian sea peninsular rivers flowing into the bay of bengal and major himalayan rivers such as the indus and ganges river in the pre monsoon and monsoon season fig 8 a b the godavari coastal and peninsular rivers are primarily fed by monsoon precipitation while the himalayan rivers receive additional inputs from meltwater within the indian subcontinent godavari river surface waters this study are relatively enriched particularly in the pre monsoon season fig 8a the himalayan rivers have more depleted signatures than godavari waters attributable to a strong elevation effect on sw monsoon moisture and its transient storage in snow glaciers feeding back into the indus pre monsoon δ18o 15 3 to 2 6 δd 108 0 to 17 0 monsoon δ18o 17 0 to 2 4 δd 122 8 to 12 0 karim and veizer 2002 sharma et al 2017 and ganges river pre monsoon δ18o 14 4 to 2 4 δd 103 to 19 0 monsoon δ18o 14 9 to 3 5 δd 103 to 19 0 kumar et al 2019 lambs et al 2005 ramesh and sarin 1992 isotopic signatures of peninsular rivers pre monsoon δ18o 5 3 to 0 7 δd 45 2 to 7 0 monsoon δ18o 6 1 to 1 0 δd 46 5 to 9 7 deshpande et al 2003 gupta et al 2005 lambs et al 2005 generally overlap with monsoonal godavari river waters the coastal rivers pre monsoon δ18o 4 4 to 1 4 δd 32 0 to 8 5 monsoon δ18o 4 0 to 1 6 δd 22 5 to 0 8 deshpande et al 2003 gupta et al 2005 lambs et al 2005 tripti et al 2013 2016 2019 show no linear δd δ18o correlation implying a different control on isotopic signatures the godavari river is characterised by a large seasonal difference in δd δ18o regression slope p 0 001 however the east flowing peninsular rivers e g cauvery krishna regression slope 6 7 6 9 as well as the himalayan indus 7 8 8 2 and ganges river 6 2 6 0 all show insignificant changes in slope at a seasonal scale p 0 11 as revealed by the data compilation fig 8b particularly in the pre monsoon season the godavari river slope is low 4 74 0 33 and plots significantly below the other indian rivers p 0 001 this highlights the large influence of evaporation in the godavari basin compared to other indian river basins fig 8a inset nevertheless in the monsoon season the godavari river slope 6 39 0 22 is comparable to other indian rivers draining into the bay of bengal the ganges river and peninsular rivers 5 98 0 24 and 6 89 0 31 p 0 20 and p 0 21 respectively signifying that they are fed by the same source i e the sw monsoon and subsequently experience similar hydrological processes 4 conclusions the godavari river the largest non himalayan river of india shows significant seasonal and spatial variability in δ18o and δd values in its surface waters seasonal differences in the godavari basin are primarily driven by the dual southwest and northeast monsoon systems and subsequently altered by evaporation processes godavari waters in the pre monsoon dry and monsoon wet season plot below the global and local meteoric water lines particularly in the pre monsoon season underlining the occurrence of basin wide evaporation a data compilation n 399 of δ18o and δd values in indian rivers reveals a stronger seasonality in the water isotopic composition for the godavari river than for other monsoon fed rivers in india in the monsoon season isotopic signatures in the downstream godavari basin reflect southwest monsoon rainfall back trajectory analysis confirms that this moisture is sourced from the indian ocean and arabian sea spatial differences within the godavari basin are linked to heterogeneity in rainfall patterns the upper godavari located in the rain shadow of the western ghats with a rainfall deficit in the 2015 monsoon season has highly enriched signatures suggesting year round evaporation moreover abundant dam building prevents any contribution to the downstream godavari s discharge the north and east tributaries have depleted signatures due to high rainfall quantities causing an amount convective effect these depleted signatures are traced downstream through the middle and lower godavari and show a well integrated signal where both tributaries contribute 50 to the final discharge river depth profiles and cross sections reveal well mixed tributary waters as well as well mixed surface and deeper waters in the godavari delta isotopic patterns and salinity measurements show that the river plume extends beyond the godavari mouth indicating high discharge into the bay of bengal in the monsoon season in the pre monsoon season river water isotopes across the godavari basin are enriched due to dominant in river evaporation evaporation is more pronounced in the godavari than for other indian rivers as shown by an extensive data compilation northeast monsoon inputs are spatially limited to the east tributaries and this signal is not transferred downstream observations of dry river beds and stagnant water behind dams underline poor river connectivity in the delta conservative mixing of river and seawater implies seawater intrusion and no discharge from the godavari river in the pre monsoon season this study on the godavari river showed that river water isotopic composition is a sensitive recorder of seasonal and spatial variability in monsoon rainfall patterns improved understanding of the basin hydrology of the monsoon fed godavari river and further monitoring of the spatio temporal evolution of river water isotopes in monsoonal rivers may help to develop integrated river management strategies for the future dealing with water scarcity flood and drought mitigation and

8352,study region the five drainage systems of the congo river basin in central africa study focus this study aims to establish uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices and to provide a basis for transferring hydrologic indices from gauged to ungauged sub basins by identifying the most influential climate and physiographic attributes new insights for this region only limited information on individual sub basins natural hydrology exists across the congo river basin limiting the application of commonly used regionalization approaches for prediction in ungauged sub basins this study uses predictive equations for the hydrologic indices across all climate and physiographic regions based only on the aridity index the degree of uncertainty in the derived uncertainty bounds is less than 41 for both q10 mmq and q50 mmq indices across the basin a greater degree of uncertainty is associated with the runoff ratio and the q90 mmq indices the uncertainty is assumed to be due to uncertainty in rainfall and evapotranspiration estimates a lack of spatial representativeness of the available observed streamflow data and other factors e g geology that might control the hydrologic indices rather than the aridity index alone the uncertainty ranges provide the first estimates of hydrologic indices that are intended to constrain the outputs from hydrologic models and appropriately quantify prediction uncertainty and risks associated with water resources decision making keywords sub basin classification congo river basin hydrologic indices uncertainty ranges 1 introduction hydrologic indices or signatures are the characteristics of a sub basin s long term hydrologic behavior they reflect the dynamics of the different components of the catchment water balance such as climate water storage and different runoff processes they have been used in many hydrologic applications such as directly for runoff prediction kult et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 model evaluation and optimization shafii and tolson 2015 model selection jothityangkoon et al 2001 mcmillan et al 2011 uncertainty analysis westerberg and mcmillan 2015 westerberg et al 2016 environmental flow assessment olden and poff 2003 catchment classification ley et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 and ensemble predictions yadav et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 tumbo and hughes 2015 hughes 2016 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 there exists a large range of possible indices that can be derived from different sources and used for a wide range of applications olden and poff 2003 provide a large range of possible indices these include the flow distribution event frequency and duration flow dynamics rainfall runoff ratio and rainfall and other climate based indices flow distribution indices refer to the long term mean flow and flow percentiles the event frequency and duration indices cover high and low flow event frequencies and durations clausen and biggs 2000 olden and poff 2003 the flow dynamics include the slope of the normalized flow duration curve yadav et al 2007 overall flow variability the base flow clausen and biggs 2000 low and high flow variability and flow autocorrelation euser et al 2013 westerberg et al 2016 used 15 hydrologic signatures including 9 for flow distribution flow percentiles and 6 for flow dynamics base flow index coefficient of variability in streamflow etc for hydrologic similarity zhang et al 2018 used 13 runoff signatures including 3 for low flows 1 for high flows 4 for mean annual and mean seasonal flows and 5 for flow dynamics for assessing prediction accuracy in ungauged sub basins the use of hydrologic indices for constraining rainfall runoff model outputs in ungauged sub basins has been suggested as an alternative to traditional model calibration processes addor et al 2018 in a pilot study using 30 watersheds in the united kingdom yadav et al 2007 used streamflow indices such as high pulse count runoff ratio and the slope of the flow duration curve to constrain uncertainty ensemble outputs from a hydrologic model similarly zhang et al 2008 used a multi objective framework for identifying behavioral parameter ensembles for ungauged basins using suites of regionalized hydrologic indices and they concluded that regionalization of these streamflow characteristics provided an additional way to extrapolate information from gauged to ungauged sub basins for use in continuous basin scale modeling shafii and tolson 2015 used a large number of sub basin response indices in a multi objective optimization context to achieve a level of acceptability for each index in ungauged sub basins thus there has been a growing interest in the use of hydrologic indices in the context of ensemble model predictions to constrain the uncertainty of predictions in ungauged sub basins this study builds on a growing recognition of the utility of hydrologic indices for constraining rainfall runoff models in the data scarce regions of southern africa tumbo and hughes 2015 hughes 2016 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 a study in tanzania by tumbo and hughes 2015 quantified six hydrologic constraints from observed streamflow data and regionalized them using a limited amount of sub basin physical property e g land cover soil texture and topography and climate data although the results were encouraging there was a need to refine the constraint bounds the input parameter sets and assess suitable climate input data in order to achieve a more robust model of the basin ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 used pre existing model simulations for the quantification of indices and regionalized them based on the sub basins hydrologic similarities the indices were then used to constrain the uncertainty ensemble outputs from a new model and the results were assessed against the available observed data ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 all these studies used similar hydrologic constraints namely the mean monthly runoff volume mmq in m3 106 mean monthly groundwater recharge depth mmr in mm the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the flow duration curve expressed as a fraction of mmq q10 mmq q50 mmq q90 mmq and the percentage of time that zero flows are expected zero these were judged to be the minimum number of key indices that can discriminate between different hydrologic responses ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 in the congo river basin despite its major

al 2017 carr et al 2019 alsdorf et al 2016 reviewed the scope of some of these studies and identified the further research opportunities that exist tshimanga and hughes 2014 identified the main sources of uncertainty in the application of hydrologic models in the congo river basin and recommended the use of regionalized hydrologic indices to overcome some of the problems of data scarcity and to reduce uncertainty in hydrologic simulations their application to ungauged sub basins requires a thorough understanding of their likely ranges which are likely to be highly variable across climate and physiographic regions indices such as long term mean monthly flow volume and percentiles of the flow duration curve can be readily obtained from observed streamflow data however there are relatively few stations within the data scarce congo river basin and many of those that do exist are located on large rivers that represent heterogeneous upstream responses and therefore are not useful to quantify regional patterns of response in addition many of the available streamflow time series are short and the data from different stations rarely coincide in time representing different sequences of dry and wet flow conditions such that the derived indices at different stations may not be comparable with each other the key objective of this study is to establish uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices across the congo river basin specifically the study focuses on i providing a basis for extrapolating the hydrologic indices from gauged to ungauged sub basins ii identifying potential predictors of hydrologic behavior and iii quantifying uncertainty ranges of the hydrologic indices due to the largely ungauged nature of the congo river basin catchment classification offers an approach for reducing the complexity of the basin to a few groups of sub basins where the differences in climate and physiographic characteristics and hence the hydrologic indices are assumed to be greater between the groups than within each group the uncertainty ranges of the indices for each group are designed to reflect not only the internal homogeneity within the group but also our lack of knowledge associated with the limited amount of streamflow data that is available to quantify the indices ultimately the indices are intended to constrain the outputs from hydrologic models and consequently reduce the uncertainty in predictions and the risks associated with water resources decision making 2 the study area the congo river basin covers a drainage area of approximately 3 7 106 km2 it is the world s second largest in both size and discharge after the amazon in africa it is second only to the nile river in length the climate is warm and humid with two distinctive wet and dry seasons that vary with distance from the equator bultot 1974 samba et al 2008 the mean temperature is approximately 25 c the mean annual rainfall is 2 000 mm y 1 in the central parts of the basin decreasing both northward and southward to 1 100 mm y 1 the annual potential evapotranspiration is between 1 100 and 1 200 mm y 1 and varies little across the basin alsdorf et al 2016 land cover varies from tropical evergreen forest with little seasonal variation in the central parts to savannas in the north and south mayaux et al 2000 hansen et al 2008 similarly the heterogeneity of the soil types and geological settings are two of the factors affecting the spatial variability in hydrologic dynamics across the basin tshimanga and hughes 2014 the basin has four main drainage systems oubangui river in the north east sangha river in the north west kasai river in the south west and lualaba river in the south east that converge to form the main congo river the details of the basin topography are well documented in runge 2007 and are not repeated here a previous study delineated the basin into 99 modeling units 83 resulting from an analysis of the dominant slopes and elevations while 16 sub basins were based on the locations of the key gauging stations tshimanga 2012 as a result the smallest modeling unit was 533 km2 while the biggest was 185 835 km2 in a recent study tshimanga et al 2018 a similar delineation procedure was undertaken but using a revised digital elevation model merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 which was corrected to remove vegetation height effects this is particularly important for the congo river basin given the extent of dense tropical forest the new delineation resulted in 403 sub basins fig 1 that are considered appropriate to represent natural hydrologic variability and that account for the current water resources management needs within the basin 2 1 hydro climatological data streamflow time series for 58 gauging stations fig 1 with different periods of record were obtained from several sources including the global runoff data centre fekete et al 1999 the office national de recherche et du developpement lempicka 1971 hydrosciences montpellier système d informations environnementales sierem http hydrosciences fr sierem and the annuaire hydrologique du congo belge devroey 1951 1959 less than 25 15 gauging stations of the gauging stations represent non impacted headwater flow regimes fig 1 and table 1 while the majority are located in the downstream parts of the basin and represent cumulative streamflow characteristics from large catchment areas hydrologic indices obtained from headwater gauging station data are useful for establishing regional variations but indices obtained from downstream stations will include mixtures of different upstream sub basin hydrologic responses and will therefore be less directly useful gauging stations downstream of some known large wetland systems or any major water resources infrastructure were excluded and not used to quantify hydrologic indices the climate data used rainfall and evapotranspiration are from the climate research unit cru ts 3 10 data for the period of 1901 2014 harris et al 2014 at a spatial resolution of 0 5 they are used to derive an aridity index the ratio of mean annual evapotranspiration to mean annual rainfall as a potential predictor of hydrologic behavior as reported in many hydrologic studies beck et al 2015 tumbo and hughes 2015 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 zhang et al 2018 and the runoff ratio the unidel university of delaware rainfall dataset covering the same period and spatial resolution was used as to check the appropriateness of the cru rainfall data in specific areas sun et al 2018 the use of global climate datasets is justified by the lack of adequate ground based information available for long periods and with good spatial coverage however the paucity of rainfall gauges over the congo river basin suggests that only limited observed records are used to construct and validate the global datasets contributing to potential errors and input uncertainties tshimanga 2012 while these uncertainties are likely to be quite important for hydrologic modeling they are less likely to have a large impact on the derivation of climate indices 2 2 physiographic data physiographic data that have potential relationships with sub basin hydrologic response characteristics are used for the classification of the sub basins and include the topographic wetness index twi slope soil textures fractions of silt sand and clay and curve number cn the twi and the slope were derived from the 90 m merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 while soil texture data were obtained from isric the world soil information website batjes 2017 the curve number was extracted from the united states natural resources conservation service nrcs runoff curve number cn dataset zeng et al 2017 these physiographic properties table 2 have been previously reported as being important in understanding and regionalizing sub basin runoff responses the soil clay content has been used as a predictor for the base flow index beck et al 2015 while the topographic wetness index is widely used to approximate relative soil moisture patterns buchanan et al 2014 and quantify topographic control on hydrologic processes sørensen et al 2006 the curve number is used in many hydrologic models williams et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 peña arancibia et al 2019 yang et al 2019 to simulate surface runoff generation and is calculated based on factors such as hydrologic soil group type land use land cover hydrologic surface condition and antecedent moisture condition zeng et al 2017 3 methods the approach involves i pre processing of hydrologic data ii catchment classification iii quantification of hydrologic indices and development of regression relationships and iv establishing of uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices the steps are shown in fig 2 3 1 pre processing of hydrologic data the available observed streamflow time series are relatively short and have different record periods that might represent different sequences of dry and wet climatic conditions this situation can affect the representativeness of derived hydrologic indices and therefore the data were pre processed using a spatial interpolation approach hughes and smakhtin 1996 to extend the observed flow series to common record periods this approach is based on the assumption that flows occurring simultaneously at sites in reasonably close proximity to each other correspond to similar percentage points on their respective duration curves its application requires the identification of key gauging stations within each region that have the longest record periods so that they can be used as source gauges for extending the flow series of gauging stations in their vicinity while the method allows for the use of up to 5 source gauges with different weighting factors hughes and smakhtin 1996 only one source gauge has been used in the congo application due to the limited number of available gauges the outputs consist of both a patched filling missing data periods and extended time series as well as a time series representing estimates for all months substitute time series the latter can then be used to compare with the original observed flow data and the reliability of the method assessed using typical objective functions such as the nash coefficient of efficiency 3 2 catchment classification due to the largely ungauged nature of the congo river basin the available gauging stations are not sufficient to represent the variability of the hydrologic response characteristics across the different climate and physiographic regions it is therefore necessary to assume that more readily available climate and physiographic surrogate information can be used in a catchment classification approach to group sub basins into regions of expected similar hydrologic response the limited available gauging station data can then be used to quantify the expected response characteristics of the sub basins within the regions albeit with a degree of uncertainty self organizing maps som are able to analyze organize and cluster various types of data through non linear relationships which represent the internal similarity of the variables they have been used in many hydrologic applications hall et al 2002 srinivas et al 2008 herbst and casper 2008 toth 2009 di prinzio et al 2011 ley et al 2011 toth 2013 in this study the viscovery somine software https www viscovery net somine is used for the sub basin scale similarity analysis the details of som methods are well documented in previously reported studies ley et al 2011 di prinzio et al 2011 a som consists of two layers of interconnected neurons nodes the input and the output layers kalteh et al 2008 where the input layer represents the sub basin attributes used in the classification and the output layer corresponds to the number of classes to which the sub basins are assigned although there are no well defined guidelines on the appropriate number of clusters to be formed som allows for both automatic liu et al 2011 and user defined cluster numbers based on the dataset and the level of detail required in the classification for the classification to be coherent only a few parameters need to be specified during the training cycle of a som these are the map size training parameters and clustering method three types of clustering methods are imbedded in the viscovery somine software and include som ward ward and som single linkage the som ward is generally used because it is considered the most efficient technique kohonen 2001 and is implemented in this study the quality of a well trained som is evaluated by means of a quantization error known also as euclidean distance defined as the average of the squared distance of all data records associated with a node in the output layer it should be as small as possible and is often used as the basis for assigning input vectors sub basins to nodes therefore sub basins that have similar quantization error are assigned to the same class an independent evaluation of the accuracy of the classification is achieved with the anosim statistic r that provides a test whether there exists a significant difference between the identified clusters clarke 1993 warton et al 2012 prior to the som training all attributes need to be standardized in order to suppress the effect of their different orders of magnitude and ensure that they all have equal importance in calculating a meaningful euclidean distance between two points viscovery somine provides two scaling methods variance and range that work simultaneously depending on the internal distribution of each attribute in both methods the mean value of the attribute is subtracted from each value of the attribute so that the mean of the scaled attribute is zero however in the variance scaling the difference between the mean value of the attribute and each value of the attribute is divided by the standard deviation of the attribute so that the new variance of the scaled attribute will always be 1 in range scaling the difference is multiplied by 8 maximum minimum of the attribute such that the new range is always 8 this has an advantage of reducing the impacts of outliers in the training process thus speeding up learning and leading to faster convergence range scaling is automatically activated if the difference between the maximum and minimum values of an attribute is smaller than 8 times the standard deviation otherwise the variance scaling applies the classification strategy adopted here was achieved in a four step approach step 1 classifies the all 403 sub basins based on the climate and physiographic attributes step 2 identifies in the formed homogenous regions from step 1 all the selected headwater gauged sub basins step 3 performs two independent classifications of the selected headwater gauged sub basins the first was based on the climate and physiographic attributes and the second was based on the indices of hydrologic behavior the hydrologic classification was performed 5 times including each index separately and all indices together in order to identify indices responsible for the highest affinity with climate and physiographic attributes step 4 compares the two independent classifications obtained in step 3 to assess the level of overlap this was done using an index of affinity developed by rand 1971 the rand affinity index rand 1971 di prinzio et al 2011 ssegane et al 2012 was calculated using the following expression 1 r a b a b c d where r varies between 1 perfect agreement between the two pools of clusters and 0 no agreement the meaning of the terms a b c and d is given under the following assumptions consider two classifications c1 and c2 of the same dataset a pair of sub basins can be assigned to the same class or different clusters in c1 and c2 so a is defined as the number of sub basin pairs that are in the same cluster in classification c1 and in the same cluster in classification c2 b as the number of sub basin pairs that are in different clusters in c1 and in different in c2 c as the number of sub basin pairs that are in the same cluster in c1 but different clusters in c2 d as the number of sub basin pairs that are in different clusters in c1 but in the same cluster in c2 3 3 derivation of the indices and their relationships the choice of hydrologic indices depends on the objectives of the study which in this case are focused on establishing indices that are suitable for constraining the outputs of a specific rainfall runoff model the pitman model tumbo and hughes 2015 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 the hydrologic indices used in the current version of this model pitman model are the mean monthly runoff volume mmq in m3 106 the mean monthly groundwater recharge mmr in mm the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the flow duration curve fdc expressed as a fraction of mmq and the percentage of zero flow however this study is limited to the mean monthly runoff volume and the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the flow duration curve fdc because they can be directly estimated from the available streamflow data and zero flows are not relevant to the congo river basin at the scale of the sub basins used in the study we could have also used 33rd and 66th which are sometimes used to compute the slope of the flow duration curve however the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles are considered here to represent the minimum number of key indices that can characterise the complete flow duration curve for they consider more extreme high and low flows essentially we want to capture a wider range of flow behaviour than the 33rd and 66th percentiles represent these percentiles are also used within the modelling software that will be used the mean monthly runoff volume mmq was expressed as runoff ratio rr in order to suppress sub basin scale effects 2 r r m m q p where mmq is the long term average monthly streamflow and p the long term average monthly precipitation the rr represents the long term water balance separation between water being released from the sub basin as streamflow and as evapotranspiration the three percentiles of the flow duration curve represent the frequency distribution of flows of different magnitude the 10th percentile represent high flows the 50th medium flows and the 90th low flow conditions the classification approach used in this study assumes that streamflow indices exhibit some consistent relationships with sub basin climate and physiographic characteristics yadav et al 2007 however this study also follows the approach applied by tumbo and hughes 2015 and ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 where the relationships between the same hydrologic indices and the aridity index are explored it is assumed that any relationships used to estimate hydrologic indices in un gauged sub basins will necessarily be uncertain and therefore 90 regression confidence limits are used to quantify the degree of uncertainty 3 4 spatial disaggregation of flow time series due to the low number of gauging stations the relationships between the climate physiographic attributes and the hydrologic indices can result in high uncertainty however there are several gauging stations that include a relatively small number of sub basins 6 that can be included if an appropriate method of spatially disaggregating the total downstream response characteristics can be used while there may be several alternative approaches the current study adopted an iterative process two gauging stations in the north of the congo river basin which represent eleven sub basins were selected and used to derive estimates of the sub basin hydrologic indices none of these have any identified upstream anthropogenic impacts and are not influenced by wetland effects the iterative process essentially involves using the initial regression relationships developed from the gauged headwater sub basins to provide initial estimates for the 11 additional sub basins this step ensures that sub basin relative differences in response are consistent with the initial relationships the flow percentile indices are converted to absolute values i e not as fractions of mmq and are summed to give cumulative values at the gauging station all of the cumulative index values are compared to the observed gauging station values and correction factors determined for each index these correction factors are then applied to the sub basin initial estimates and the fdc indices converted back to fractional values by dividing by mmq clearly the indices for the additional 11 data points are less certain than those derived from the gauged headwaters however the approach is justified on the basis of the very limited number of gauged headwater sub basins and at least allows some of the response characteristics of the two larger gauged catchments to be included in a second round of regression analysis 3 5 validating the uncertainty ranges and assessing the uncertainty two types of independent information on hydrologic indices were used to validate the derived ranges of indices the first source is made up of published runoff ratios for specific areas across the basin snel 1957 laraque et al 1998 the aridity index values of these areas were used to check whether the runoff ratio could fit within the computed ranges the second source of information is based on the cumulative flow time series at downstream gauged stations that have no substantial attenuation effects the hydrologic indices were computed at these gauges and plotted against the area weighted values of the sub basin aridity indices one of the major sources of uncertainty in the quantified hydrologic indices involve the input rainfall data it has been acknowledged that the reliability of a rainfall dataset is mainly limited by the number and the spatial coverage of surface stations sun et al 2018 and the cru rainfall dataset used in this study is based on a very limited amount of observed rainfall data previous studies reported on the lack of agreement between different interpolated rainfall datasets sun et al 2018 the consistency of the cru and the unidel sun et al 2018 datasets is checked by computing ratios of unidel to cru mean annual rainfall regions where the computed ratio is high e g 1 2 were identified as potential areas of high uncertainty where the uncertainty ranges of the indices would need further refinement 4 results 4 1 extended streamflow series it was important to obtain common record periods of streamflow time series in order to ensure the representativeness of the computed hydrologic indices and minimize the differential effects of the number of wet and dry periods represented in short record periods table 3 lists the original and extended record periods as well as the source gauging stations used for the record extension fig 3 a shows a plot of two streamflow series at one gauging station l cb261 located in the upper lualaba sub basin and illustrates the reliability of the approach by comparing the observed flows with the substitute time series i e all months estimated from the source gauge the general pattern of the observed streamflow series is well reproduced and therefore the extended and infilled records should be adequately reliable similar results were obtained for all the gauging stations and their nash coefficients of efficiency based on comparisons between the observed and substitute flows are shown in fig 3b for the majority of gauging stations the nash coefficient of efficiency is above 0 6 for both low and high flows the final hydrologic indices were derived from the patched streamflow series i e a combination of observed patched and extended data 4 2 classification by climate and physiographic characteristics the classification of the 403 sub basins of the congo river basin was achieved by training a self organizing map som fig 4 a displays different levels of the quantization error qe obtained from using different map sizes the results show that the larger the map size number of nodes the smaller the quantization error which expresses the adequateness of representing the input vectors by a specific node out of seven attributes used for the classification only five were retained while the twi and sand attributes were removed because they were highly correlated with slope and clay respectively therefore a map size of 2 000 nodes qe 0 0003 was judged appropriate in representing the dataset and was used for the classification different numbers of clusters were also tested in order to obtain the number that maximize the within group similarity and between group dissimilarity the application of an independent quality measure anosim statistic r fig 4b suggests that six clusters are appropriate for the congo river basin these homogenous groups are significantly different with a global r of 0 7 at a p value of 0 001 the r statistic increases with an increase in the number of clusters but this increase is associated with low dissimilarity 0 25 r 0 48 between some clusters when greater than six clusters are used in contrast with six clusters all the between group dissimilarity values are above 0 53 table 4 displays the dissimilarity matrix of the six homogeneous groups where high values of r implies high dissimilarity between groups overall the average squared distances within groups were far smaller than the average squared distances between groups the spatial distribution of the six climate and physiographic regions resulting from the classification is shown in fig 5 the groups are coherent and preserve a high degree of spatial proximity approximately 28 of sub basins are assigned to region 1 19 4 to region 2 and 3 14 6 to region 4 11 6 to region 5 and 7 2 to region 6 fig 6 illustrates the spatial relationships between the climate and physiographic attributes across the six regions while table 5 provides descriptions of each homogenous region region 1 has the highest number of gauged headwater sub basins while region 6 has none 4 3 classification by hydrologic behavior based on the distribution of gauged sub basins two independent classifications each having five groups were performed using a similar approach as highlighted in section 3 2 the comparison between the physiographic classification and the five classifications based on hydrologic behavior is shown in fig 7 only the three fractions of the fdc indices and runoff ratio were used to represent sub basin response behavior while five climate and physiographic attributes represented sub basins physical properties overall there exists a high degree of affinity rand index 73 between the physiographic classification and the hydrologic classification when all indices of hydrologic behavior are used in the classification however the highest affinity rand index 82 is achieved when only the q50 mmq index is used this suggests that the climate and physiographic attributes used in this classification are able to capture different components of the sub basin s hydrologic response at different degrees due to the limited number of gauged headwater sub basins some clusters are made up of less than 3 sub basins table s1 in supplementary information the implication of this result is that predictive equations for the hydrologic indices in most of the clusters cannot be developed due to a lack of enough sample points for those clusters where there are 4 representative gauges table 6 illustrates that there are potentially strong relationships between the physiographic climate attributes and the hydrologic indices however the shape of the relationships is regionally variable and because of a lack of enough gauging stations to represent some clusters fig 8 we cannot extrapolate the relationships to all the sub basins in the congo in contrast when all the sub basins are included in the regression analysis the aridity index is revealed as the best single predictor of hydrologic behavior table 7 with cn second the other attributes do not appear to offer any additional predictive value table 7 4 4 aridity index as a control on hydrologic indices the spatial pattern of the aridity index fig 9 across the congo river basin exhibits some degree of similarity with the six homogenous regions fig 5 a concentric pattern of aridity index suggests the increase of the aridity index from the cuvette centrale towards headwater tributaries located in the north east and south parts of the basin fig 10 a shows the plot of the runoff ratio rr as a function of arity index ai overall a high aridity index results in a low runoff ratio and vice versa for instance the majority of gauging stations representing sub basins located in the southeast and north of the congo river basin region 1 show high values of aridity index indicating a low runoff ratio rr 0 25 potential the observed pattern in humid conditions ai 0 75 does not show a similar pattern of rr as in region 1 with very limited information in this region 4 we cannot confirm the apparent increase of rr with the increase of ai in general while two discernible relationships could have been established between the ai and the runoff ratio it would have been difficult to determine the basis on which ungauged sub basins could have been assigned to either relationship given the fact that observed gauging stations of the same region would be on different regression lines therefore a single regression relationship r2 0 63 is derived between the aridity index and the runoff ratio a positive power relationship r2 0 84 between the aridity index and the q10 mmq is shown in fig 10b sub basins of region 4 are located at the bottom end of the regression line indicating a slow to moderate response to rainfall inputs in contrast sub basins of region 1 are spread throughout the regression line the q50 mmq index fig 10c shows a positive power relationship r2 0 81 with the aridity index and follows a similar trend to the runoff ratio where high values of aridity index were associated with low indices the q90 mmq index also exhibits a positive power relationship fig 10d but with a higher degree of scatter r2 0 725 comparing fig 10b and d suggests that regions 2 and 4 have regimes with low variability while region 3 is more variable and region 1 is represented by flow regimes of different degrees of variability without more data points it is difficult to predict if areas with higher aridity indices would have very low q90 mmq indices and possibly zero flows for some of the time this could depend on the spatial scale of the sub basins in that aggregation of contributions from different parts of a large sub basin coupled with the effects of flow routing suggest that zero flow conditions are unlikely however small sub basins might experience zero flows but the majority of the sub basins used in the current modeling units tshimanga et al 2018 are greater than 2 000 km2 limiting the possibility of zero flow at a monthly time scale through the application of the spatial disaggregation procedure section 3 4 estimates of the hydrologic indice values are available for an additional 11 sub basins table s2 in supplementary information while these values are more uncertain than those based on the gauged headwater sub basins they have been included to expand the data set before calculating regression line confidence intervals to quantify the uncertainty ranges of the hydrologic indices 4 5 uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices fig 11 shows the 90 confidence intervals based on the updated regression relationships after the inclusion of the data for additional 11 sub basins disaggregated from downstream gauging station data a comparion between figs 10 and 11 suggests that the shape of the relationships has hardly changed while most of the r2 values have slightly decreased and therefore the final uncertainty bounds increased the degree of uncertainty varies according to the type of the hydrologic index with greater relative uncertainty in the runoff ratio and the q90 mmq indices while relatively low uncertainty characterizes the q10 mmq and q50 mmq indices given that the available data to quantify the hydrologic indices is very limited it is impossible to make any firm a priori statements about how representative these uncertainty bound relationships are for all of the sub basins of the congo river basin however ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 proposed that checks can only be made by using the uncertainty bounds to constrain the individual sub basin responses in a hydrological model and assess the outputs against observed data representing aggregated responses downstream some limited independent estimates of runoff ratio fig 12 suggest that many of the reported runoff ratios fit within the computed bounds notable exceptions are some estimates for the batéké plateau system in the western congo river basin region 5 and for the rift valley region eastern congo river basin there are quite large uncertainties in the rainfall data for these steep areas but even if a different rainfall data set is used unidel the estimated runoff ratios remain well outside the computed uncertainty bounds in contrast the independent estimates in flat to undulating topography 0 5 5 regions cuvette centrale northeast congo upper lualaba and southeast kasai generally fall within the uncertainty bounds regardless of which rainfall data set is used the average runoff ratio 0 24 for the whole congo river basin laraque and olivry 1996 also falls within the uncertainty bounds 5 discussion and conclusion it is a common practice in hydrology to use catchment classification as a means of extending hydrologic information from gauged to ungauged sub basins this procedure requires each region to have a predictive equation of hydrologic response based on potential climate and physiographic predictors yadav et al 2007 kapangaziwiri et al 2012 the success of this approach largely depends on the number of gauged sub basins with sufficiently long records the classification of the 403 sub basins of the congo river fig 5 and table 5 demonstrated that the climate and physiographic attributes used in this study can identify relatively homogeneous regions suggesting that there is a potential to interpret hydrologic similarity based on similarity in climate and physiography oudin et al 2010 ley et al 2011 furthermore the hydrologic classification based on the 15 gauged sub basins showed that the aridity index the surface slope the curve number the silt and clay contents are potential predictors of hydrologic response indices however the number of gauged sub basins even including the disaggregated data for a few larger gauged sub basins is not sufficient to develop individual predictive relationships between the hydrologic indices and the climate and or physiographic attributes for each of the identified regions some of the clusters identified in the hydrologic classification section 4 3 are represented by less than 3 sample gauged sub basins this is part of the challenge of data scarcity in many parts of the world including the congo river basin fortunately the alternative approach of developing generic predictive equations for the whole basin generated results that produce acceptable levels of uncertainty as measured by the width of the confidence intervals around the regression relationships while several approaches to developing these equations were assessed using combinations of the climate and physiographic attributes informed by the results of the hydrologic classification it transpired that the aridity index produced the best results for all of the hydrologic indices a comparison between the spatial patterns of climate physiographic regions fig 5 and the aridity index groups fig 9 shows some distinct similarities the areas where there are fewer similarities are mainly within or across those regions that are less distinguishable based on the anosim statistics in table 4 from other regions regions 1 2 and 3 have low anosim statistics and also cover a wide range of aridity groups 2 6 while regions 4 and 5 have the highest anosim statistics and all the sub basins have generally low aridity values similarly region 6 is generally distinguishable from the other regions and most sub areas fall within aridity groups 3 and 4 the conclusion is that although the original climate physiographic regionalization results are not used in the developed predictive equations for the hydrologic indices the spatial patterns of variability in hydrologic response are not too dissimilar to the originally identified regions the fact that the aridity index emerges as the best available predictor of hydrologic indices table 7 in the congo river basin is perhaps not surprising as the same index has been used successfully in other parts of southern africa tumbo and hughes 2015 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 and elsewhere zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 found that the aridity index was one of the most influential attributes and was well correlated with mean discharge as well as the 10th and 50th percentiles of the flow duration curve similarly ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 determined relationships between the aridity index and the runoff ratio however they also found distinct regional differences across eswatini swaziland that are less evident in the congo river basin part of this difference may be related to the substantial topographic and climate variations across the small country of eswatini while the much larger number of sample points based on previous simulations used by ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 could also play a major role tumbo and hughes 2015 also found regional differences in the link between aridity and hydrologic response indices but they were not able to quantify regression relastionships and their final result was based on simple index ranges for each identified region in the great ruaha river basin of tanzania the main limitation for extending the predictive equations of the hydrologic indices to ungauged sub basins is related to the spatial representativeness of the observed streamflow gauging stations the majority of the final sub basins used to develop the uncertainty ranges are found in region 1 even after the inclusion of the disaggregated gauging station data while the developed uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices can be applied with high confidence in sub basins representing the climate and physiographic properties of region 1 upper lualaba and northern oubangui less confidence can be ascribed to their application in the other regions where some aspects of the hydrologic behavior may not have been captured the fact that the range of the aridity index values 0 66 1 59 used to develop the predictive equations represent most of the climate variability across all 403 sub basins of the congo river basin suggests that the approach may be quite robust in representing the diverse climate conditions within the basin however fig 12 shows some examples where some independent estimates of runoff ratio for some steep sub basins fall well outside the uncertainty range while these may be isolated examples of outliers the lack of enough data seriously constrains any attempts to further validate the applicability of the relationships and the ranges of uncertainty across the whole basin gnann et al 2019 have shown that the variability of low flow in humid sub basins of the united kingdom and the united states could not be primarily attributed to the aridity index and that the aridity index is the key determinant of low flows only in arid regions the congo data tend to support this conclusion in that the uncertainty range for q90 mmq index is quite large and there is no real trend in the values for region 4 fig 9d according to laraque et al 1998 the hydrologic response of the sub group batéké plateaux of region 4 sub basins is characterized by very little seasonal variation between the low and high flows indicating the presence of a high storage capacity groundwater system that contributes to the regulation of flows physical attributes describing the geological settings might have been informative in terms of including the role of sub surface processes but a consistent database of groundwater characteristics for the whole congo river basin is not yet available inevitably the developed uncertainty ranges of the hydrologic indices account for several different sources of uncertainty these uncertainties could be due to the uncertainty in rainfall maidment et al 2015 sun et al 2018 and evapotranspiration estimates the length of the streamflow records the number of the gauging stations used and their spatial distribution the percentage of missing data the reliability of rating curves kiang et al 2018 used to convert raw stage data into streamflows and stage observational errors maidment et al 2015 found considerable differences in trend sign and magnitude 10 and 39 mm yr 1 per decade between different sets of global rainfall over central africa they reported that the spurious negative trends identified in cru rainfall dataset were due to the decline in rainfall gauge density across central africa including the congo river basin our results have shown that substantial differences between global interpolated rainfall datasets cru and unidel are observed in the batéké plateau and rift valley sub regions located in the western and eastern parts of the congo river basin respectively it is shown that these differences were more pronounced in steep topography section 4 5 and constitute a common problem facing interpolated global rainfall datasets especially in complex mountain areas due to the limited number and spatial coverage of surface stations as well as the types of algorithms and data assimilation models used to generate the interpolated rainfall data sun et al 2018 this type of uncertainty clearly affects both the aridity index and the runoff ratio translating the uncertainty in instantaneous discharge observations into potential errors in monthly streamflow volumes is more difficult particularly if the raw stage data and rating curves are not accessible as is often the case in many countries of southern africa in the congo river basin the lower and upper bounds of these errors for the gauging stations in the southern part of the basin kasai and lualaba drainage systems were estimated to be between 12 and 29 charlier 1955 and lempicka 1971 the average uncertainty obtained for the q10 mmq and q50 mmq indices are less than this total value of 41 38 and 32 for q10 mmq and q50 mmq indices respectively these results are consistent with previous studies on the uncertainty in hydrologic signatures westerberg and mcmillan 2015 westerberg et al 2016 reported that the uncertainty in hydrologic signatures varied with signature type with the highest uncertainties 30 40 found in high and low flow characteristics due to the uncertainty in the observed discharge and the regionalization procedures in the northern part of the congo river basin sangha and oubangui drainage systems previous studies laraque and olivry 1996 mahé 1995 noted a decrease in streamflow from the main tributaries of the right bank of the congo river for the period of 1953 1993 an average 28 5 decrease was observed in the oubangui drainage system 15 in sangha 11 in the cuvette centrale and very little change in the batékés plateau system therefore any data records that only fall within this period would be expected to generate lower mean monthly flow mmq indices than would be appropriate for a longer simulation period thus adding further levels of uncertainty the presence of any extreme flows over the record periods as is the case for the congo river in the 1960s would also impact on the mmq indices the majority of the gauging stations used in this study have short record periods around the 1960s however it is argued that the extension and infilling of missing data section 4 1 has at least partially overcome these effects the uncertainty ranges of the hydrologic indices presented in this study are not affected by wetland and channel routing effects because any gauging stations located below wetlands were not represented in the 26 sub basins used in the development of these uncertainty bounds the overall conclusion is that the developed relationships and uncertainty bounds between aridity index and the hydrologic indices are appropriate for constraining sub basin hydrologic simulations for the whole of the congo river basin with the likely exception of some areas of very steep topography on the eastern borders of the basin and the batéké plateaux the ultimate test of these relationships and their uncertainty bounds will be to assess the results of the constrained simulations at downstream gauging stations which have not been used in their development it is likely that they will not work in areas downstream of the identified steep sub basins and therefore will need to be re calibrated for those areas author statement the authors

8352,study region the five drainage systems of the congo river basin in central africa study focus this study aims to establish uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices and to provide a basis for transferring hydrologic indices from gauged to ungauged sub basins by identifying the most influential climate and physiographic attributes new insights for this region only limited information on individual sub basins natural hydrology exists across the congo river basin limiting the application of commonly used regionalization approaches for prediction in ungauged sub basins this study uses predictive equations for the hydrologic indices across all climate and physiographic regions based only on the aridity index the degree of uncertainty in the derived uncertainty bounds is less than 41 for both q10 mmq and q50 mmq indices across the basin a greater degree of uncertainty is associated with the runoff ratio and the q90 mmq indices the uncertainty is assumed to be due to uncertainty in rainfall and evapotranspiration estimates a lack of spatial representativeness of the available observed streamflow data and other factors e g geology that might control the hydrologic indices rather than the aridity index alone the uncertainty ranges provide the first estimates of hydrologic indices that are intended to constrain the outputs from hydrologic models and appropriately quantify prediction uncertainty and risks associated with water resources decision making keywords sub basin classification congo river basin hydrologic indices uncertainty ranges 1 introduction hydrologic indices or signatures are the characteristics of a sub basin s long term hydrologic behavior they reflect the dynamics of the different components of the catchment water balance such as climate water storage and different runoff processes they have been used in many hydrologic applications such as directly for runoff prediction kult et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 model evaluation and optimization shafii and tolson 2015 model selection jothityangkoon et al 2001 mcmillan et al 2011 uncertainty analysis westerberg and mcmillan 2015 westerberg et al 2016 environmental flow assessment olden and poff 2003 catchment classification ley et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 and ensemble predictions yadav et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 tumbo and hughes 2015 hughes 2016 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 there exists a large range of possible indices that can be derived from different sources and used for a wide range of applications olden and poff 2003 provide a large range of possible indices these include the flow distribution event frequency and duration flow dynamics rainfall runoff ratio and rainfall and other climate based indices flow distribution indices refer to the long term mean flow and flow percentiles the event frequency and duration indices cover high and low flow event frequencies and durations clausen and biggs 2000 olden and poff 2003 the flow dynamics include the slope of the normalized flow duration curve yadav et al 2007 overall flow variability the base flow clausen and biggs 2000 low and high flow variability and flow autocorrelation euser et al 2013 westerberg et al 2016 used 15 hydrologic signatures including 9 for flow distribution flow percentiles and 6 for flow dynamics base flow index coefficient of variability in streamflow etc for hydrologic similarity zhang et al 2018 used 13 runoff signatures including 3 for low flows 1 for high flows 4 for mean annual and mean seasonal flows and 5 for flow dynamics for assessing prediction accuracy in ungauged sub basins the use of hydrologic indices for constraining rainfall runoff model outputs in ungauged sub basins has been suggested as an alternative to traditional model calibration processes addor et al 2018 in a pilot study using 30 watersheds in the united kingdom yadav et al 2007 used streamflow indices such as high pulse count runoff ratio and the slope of the flow duration curve to constrain uncertainty ensemble outputs from a hydrologic model similarly zhang et al 2008 used a multi objective framework for identifying behavioral parameter ensembles for ungauged basins using suites of regionalized hydrologic indices and they concluded that regionalization of these streamflow characteristics provided an additional way to extrapolate information from gauged to ungauged sub basins for use in continuous basin scale modeling shafii and tolson 2015 used a large number of sub basin response indices in a multi objective optimization context to achieve a level of acceptability for each index in ungauged sub basins thus there has been a growing interest in the use of hydrologic indices in the context of ensemble model predictions to constrain the uncertainty of predictions in ungauged sub basins this study builds on a growing recognition of the utility of hydrologic indices for constraining rainfall runoff models in the data scarce regions of southern africa tumbo and hughes 2015 hughes 2016 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 a study in tanzania by tumbo and hughes 2015 quantified six hydrologic constraints from observed streamflow data and regionalized them using a limited amount of sub basin physical property e g land cover soil texture and topography and climate data although the results were encouraging there was a need to refine the constraint bounds the input parameter sets and assess suitable climate input data in order to achieve a more robust model of the basin ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 used pre existing model simulations for the quantification of indices and regionalized them based on the sub basins hydrologic similarities the indices were then used to constrain the uncertainty ensemble outputs from a new model and the results were assessed against the available observed data ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 all these studies used similar hydrologic constraints namely the mean monthly runoff volume mmq in m3 106 mean monthly groundwater recharge depth mmr in mm the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the flow duration curve expressed as a fraction of mmq q10 mmq q50 mmq q90 mmq and the percentage of time that zero flows are expected zero these were judged to be the minimum number of key indices that can discriminate between different hydrologic responses ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 in the congo river basin despite its major contribution to regional and global ocean circulation and climate santini and caporaso 2018 spencer et al 2016 dargie et al 2017 dyer et al 2017 less is known about its hydrology alsdorf et al 2016

al 2017 carr et al 2019 alsdorf et al 2016 reviewed the scope of some of these studies and identified the further research opportunities that exist tshimanga and hughes 2014 identified the main sources of uncertainty in the application of hydrologic models in the congo river basin and recommended the use of regionalized hydrologic indices to overcome some of the problems of data scarcity and to reduce uncertainty in hydrologic simulations their application to ungauged sub basins requires a thorough understanding of their likely ranges which are likely to be highly variable across climate and physiographic regions indices such as long term mean monthly flow volume and percentiles of the flow duration curve can be readily obtained from observed streamflow data however there are relatively few stations within the data scarce congo river basin and many of those that do exist are located on large rivers that represent heterogeneous upstream responses and therefore are not useful to quantify regional patterns of response in addition many of the available streamflow time series are short and the data from different stations rarely coincide in time representing different sequences of dry and wet flow conditions such that the derived indices at different stations may not be comparable with each other the key objective of this study is to establish uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices across the congo river basin specifically the study focuses on i providing a basis for extrapolating the hydrologic indices from gauged to ungauged sub basins ii identifying potential predictors of hydrologic behavior and iii quantifying uncertainty ranges of the hydrologic indices due to the largely ungauged nature of the congo river basin catchment classification offers an approach for reducing the complexity of the basin to a few groups of sub basins where the differences in climate and physiographic characteristics and hence the hydrologic indices are assumed to be greater between the groups than within each group the uncertainty ranges of the indices for each group are designed to reflect not only the internal homogeneity within the group but also our lack of knowledge associated with the limited amount of streamflow data that is available to quantify the indices ultimately the indices are intended to constrain the outputs from hydrologic models and consequently reduce the uncertainty in predictions and the risks associated with water resources decision making 2 the study area the congo river basin covers a drainage area of approximately 3 7 106 km2 it is the world s second largest in both size and discharge after the amazon in africa it is second only to the nile river in length the climate is warm and humid with two distinctive wet and dry seasons that vary with distance from the equator bultot 1974 samba et al 2008 the mean temperature is approximately 25 c the mean annual rainfall is 2 000 mm y 1 in the central parts of the basin decreasing both northward and southward to 1 100 mm y 1 the annual potential evapotranspiration is between 1 100 and 1 200 mm y 1 and varies little across the basin alsdorf et al 2016 land cover varies from tropical evergreen forest with little seasonal variation in the central parts to savannas in the north and south mayaux et al 2000 hansen et al 2008 similarly the heterogeneity of the soil types and geological settings are two of the factors affecting the spatial variability in hydrologic dynamics across the basin tshimanga and hughes 2014 the basin has four main drainage systems oubangui river in the north east sangha river in the north west kasai river in the south west and lualaba river in the south east that converge to form the main congo river the details of the basin topography are well documented in runge 2007 and are not repeated here a previous study delineated the basin into 99 modeling units 83 resulting from an analysis of the dominant slopes and elevations while 16 sub basins were based on the locations of the key gauging stations tshimanga 2012 as a result the smallest modeling unit was 533 km2 while the biggest was 185 835 km2 in a recent study tshimanga et al 2018 a similar delineation procedure was undertaken but using a revised digital elevation model merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 which was corrected to remove vegetation height effects this is particularly important for the congo river basin given the extent of dense tropical forest the new delineation resulted in 403 sub basins fig 1 that are considered appropriate to represent natural hydrologic variability and that account for the current water resources management needs within the basin 2 1 hydro climatological data streamflow time series for 58 gauging stations fig 1 with different periods of record were obtained from several sources including the global runoff data centre fekete et al 1999 the office national de recherche et du developpement lempicka 1971 hydrosciences montpellier système d informations environnementales sierem http hydrosciences fr sierem and the annuaire hydrologique du congo belge devroey 1951 1959 less than 25 15 gauging stations of the gauging stations represent non impacted headwater flow regimes fig 1 and table 1 while the majority are located in the downstream parts of the basin and represent cumulative streamflow characteristics from large catchment areas hydrologic indices obtained from headwater gauging station data are useful for establishing regional variations but indices obtained from downstream stations will include mixtures of different upstream sub basin hydrologic responses and will therefore be less directly useful gauging stations downstream of some known large wetland systems or any major water resources infrastructure were excluded and not used to quantify hydrologic indices the climate data used rainfall and evapotranspiration are from the climate research unit cru ts 3 10 data for the period of 1901 2014 harris et al 2014 at a spatial resolution of 0 5 they are used to derive an aridity index the ratio of mean annual evapotranspiration to mean annual rainfall as a potential predictor of hydrologic behavior as reported in many hydrologic studies beck et al 2015 tumbo and hughes 2015 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 zhang et al 2018 and the runoff ratio the unidel university of delaware rainfall dataset covering the same period and spatial resolution was used as to check the appropriateness of the cru rainfall data in specific areas sun et al 2018 the use of global climate datasets is justified by the lack of adequate ground based information available for long periods and with good spatial coverage however the paucity of rainfall gauges over the congo river basin suggests that only limited observed records are used to construct and validate the global datasets contributing to potential errors and input uncertainties tshimanga 2012 while these uncertainties are likely to be quite important for hydrologic modeling they are less likely to have a large impact on the derivation of climate indices 2 2 physiographic data physiographic data that have potential relationships with sub basin hydrologic response characteristics are used for the classification of the sub basins and include the topographic wetness index twi slope soil textures fractions of silt sand and clay and curve number cn the twi and the slope were derived from the 90 m merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 while soil texture data were obtained from isric the world soil information website batjes 2017 the curve number was extracted from the united states natural resources conservation service nrcs runoff curve number cn dataset zeng et al 2017 these physiographic properties table 2 have been previously reported as being important in understanding and regionalizing sub basin runoff responses the soil clay content has been used as a predictor for the base flow index beck et al 2015 while the topographic wetness index is widely used to approximate relative soil moisture patterns buchanan et al 2014 and quantify topographic control on hydrologic processes sørensen et al 2006 the curve number is used in many hydrologic models williams et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 peña arancibia et al 2019 yang et al 2019 to simulate surface runoff generation and is calculated based on factors such as hydrologic soil group type land use land cover hydrologic surface condition and antecedent moisture condition zeng et al 2017 3 methods the approach involves i pre processing of hydrologic data ii catchment classification iii quantification of hydrologic indices and development of regression relationships and iv establishing of uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices the steps are shown in fig 2 3 1 pre processing of hydrologic data the available observed streamflow time series are relatively short and have different record periods that might represent different sequences of dry and wet climatic conditions this situation can affect the representativeness of derived hydrologic indices and therefore the data were pre processed using a spatial interpolation approach hughes and smakhtin 1996 to extend the observed flow series to common record periods this approach is based on the assumption that flows occurring simultaneously at sites in reasonably close proximity to each other correspond to similar percentage points on their respective duration curves its application requires the identification of key gauging stations within each region that have the longest record periods so that they can be used as source gauges for extending the flow series of gauging stations in their vicinity while the method allows for the use of up to 5 source gauges with different weighting factors hughes and smakhtin 1996 only one source gauge has been used in the congo application due to the limited number of available gauges the outputs consist of both a patched filling missing data periods and extended time series as well as a time series representing estimates for all months substitute time series the latter can then be used to compare with the original observed flow data and the reliability of the method assessed using typical objective functions such as the nash coefficient of efficiency 3 2 catchment classification due to the largely ungauged nature of the congo river basin the available gauging stations are not sufficient to represent the variability of the hydrologic response characteristics across the different climate and physiographic regions it is therefore necessary to assume that more readily available climate and physiographic surrogate information can be used in a catchment classification approach to group sub basins into regions of expected similar hydrologic response the limited available gauging station data can then be used to quantify the expected response characteristics of the sub basins within the regions albeit with a degree of uncertainty self organizing maps som are able to analyze organize and cluster various types of data through non linear relationships which represent the internal similarity of the variables they have been used in many hydrologic applications hall et al 2002 srinivas et al 2008 herbst and casper 2008 toth 2009 di prinzio et al 2011 ley et al 2011 toth 2013 in this study the viscovery somine software https www viscovery net somine is used for the sub basin scale similarity analysis the details of som methods are well documented in previously reported studies ley et al 2011 di prinzio et al 2011 a som consists of two layers of interconnected neurons nodes the input and the output layers kalteh et al 2008 where the input layer represents the sub basin attributes used in the classification and the output layer corresponds to the number of classes to which the sub basins are assigned although there are no well defined guidelines on the appropriate number of clusters to be formed som allows for both automatic liu et al 2011 and user defined cluster numbers based on the dataset and the level of detail required in the classification for the classification to be coherent only a few parameters need to be specified during the training cycle of a som these are the map size training parameters and clustering method three types of clustering methods are imbedded in the viscovery somine software and include som ward ward and som single linkage the som ward is generally used because it is considered the most efficient technique kohonen 2001 and is implemented in this study the quality of a well trained som is evaluated by means of a quantization error known also as euclidean distance defined as the average of the squared distance of all data records associated with a node in the output layer it should be as small as possible and is often used as the basis for assigning input vectors sub basins to nodes therefore sub basins that have similar quantization error are assigned to the same class an independent evaluation of the accuracy of the classification is achieved with the anosim statistic r that provides a test whether there exists a significant difference between the identified clusters clarke 1993 warton et al 2012 prior to the som training all attributes need to be standardized in order to suppress the effect of their different orders of magnitude and ensure that they all have equal importance in calculating a meaningful euclidean distance between two points viscovery somine provides two scaling methods variance and range that work simultaneously depending on the internal distribution of each attribute in both methods the mean value of the attribute is subtracted from each value of the attribute so that the mean of the scaled attribute is zero however in the variance scaling the difference between the mean value of the attribute and each value of the attribute is divided by the standard deviation of the attribute so that the new variance of the scaled attribute will always be 1 in range scaling the difference is multiplied by 8 maximum minimum of the attribute such that the new range is always 8 this has an advantage of reducing the impacts of outliers in the training process thus speeding up learning and leading to faster convergence range scaling is automatically activated if the difference between the maximum and minimum values of an attribute is smaller than 8 times the standard deviation otherwise the variance scaling applies the classification strategy adopted here was achieved in a four step approach step 1 classifies the all 403 sub basins based on the climate and physiographic attributes step 2 identifies in the formed homogenous regions from step 1 all the selected headwater gauged sub basins step 3 performs two independent classifications of the selected headwater gauged sub basins the first was based on the climate and physiographic attributes and the second was based on the indices of hydrologic behavior the hydrologic classification was performed 5 times including each index separately and all indices together in order to identify indices responsible for the highest affinity with climate and physiographic attributes step 4 compares the two independent classifications obtained in step 3 to assess the level of overlap this was done using an index of affinity developed by rand 1971 the rand affinity index rand 1971 di prinzio et al 2011 ssegane et al 2012 was calculated using the following expression 1 r a b a b c d where r varies between 1 perfect agreement between the two pools of clusters and 0 no agreement the meaning of the terms a b c and d is given under the following assumptions consider two classifications c1 and c2 of the same dataset a pair of sub basins can be assigned to the same class or different clusters in c1 and c2 so a is defined as the number of sub basin pairs that are in the same cluster in classification c1 and in the same cluster in classification c2 b as the number of sub basin pairs that are in different clusters in c1 and in different in c2 c as the number of sub basin pairs that are in the same cluster in c1 but different clusters in c2 d as the number of sub basin pairs that are in different clusters in c1 but in the same cluster in c2 3 3 derivation of the indices and their relationships the choice of hydrologic indices depends on the objectives of the study which in this case are focused on establishing indices that are suitable for constraining the outputs of a specific rainfall runoff model the pitman model tumbo and hughes 2015 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 the hydrologic indices used in the current version of this model pitman model are the mean monthly runoff volume mmq in m3 106 the mean monthly groundwater recharge mmr in mm the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the flow duration curve fdc expressed as a fraction of mmq and the percentage of zero flow however this study is limited to the mean monthly runoff volume and the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the flow duration curve fdc because they can be directly estimated from the available streamflow data and zero flows are not relevant to the congo river basin at the scale of the sub basins used in the study we could have also used 33rd and 66th which are sometimes used to compute the slope of the flow duration curve however the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles are considered here to represent the minimum number of key indices that can characterise the complete flow duration curve for they consider more extreme high and low flows essentially we want to capture a wider range of flow behaviour than the 33rd and 66th percentiles represent these percentiles are also used within the modelling software that will be used the mean monthly runoff volume mmq was expressed as runoff ratio rr in order to suppress sub basin scale effects 2 r r m m q p where mmq is the long term average monthly streamflow and p the long term average monthly precipitation the rr represents the long term water balance separation between water being released from the sub basin as streamflow and as evapotranspiration the three percentiles of the flow duration curve represent the frequency distribution of flows of different magnitude the 10th percentile represent high flows the 50th medium flows and the 90th low flow conditions the classification approach used in this study assumes that streamflow indices exhibit some consistent relationships with sub basin climate and physiographic characteristics yadav et al 2007 however this study also follows the approach applied by tumbo and hughes 2015 and ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 where the relationships between the same hydrologic indices and the aridity index are explored it is assumed that any relationships used to estimate hydrologic indices in un gauged sub basins will necessarily be uncertain and therefore 90 regression confidence limits are used to quantify the degree of uncertainty 3 4 spatial disaggregation of flow time series due to the low number of gauging stations the relationships between the climate physiographic attributes and the hydrologic indices can result in high uncertainty however there are several gauging stations that include a relatively small number of sub basins 6 that can be included if an appropriate method of spatially disaggregating the total downstream response characteristics can be used while there may be several alternative approaches the current study adopted an iterative process two gauging stations in the north of the congo river basin which represent eleven sub basins were selected and used to derive estimates of the sub basin hydrologic indices none of these have any identified upstream anthropogenic impacts and are not influenced by wetland effects the iterative process essentially involves using the initial regression relationships developed from the gauged headwater sub basins to provide initial estimates for the 11 additional sub basins this step ensures that sub basin relative differences in response are consistent with the initial relationships the flow percentile indices are converted to absolute values i e not as fractions of mmq and are summed to give cumulative values at the gauging station all of the cumulative index values are compared to the observed gauging station values and correction factors determined for each index these correction factors are then applied to the sub basin initial estimates and the fdc indices converted back to fractional values by dividing by mmq clearly the indices for the additional 11 data points are less certain than those derived from the gauged headwaters however the approach is justified on the basis of the very limited number of gauged headwater sub basins and at least allows some of the response characteristics of the two larger gauged catchments to be included in a second round of regression analysis 3 5 validating the uncertainty ranges and assessing the uncertainty two types of independent information on hydrologic indices were used to validate the derived ranges of indices the first source is made up of published runoff ratios for specific areas across the basin snel 1957 laraque et al 1998 the aridity index values of these areas were used to check whether the runoff ratio could fit within the computed ranges the second source of information is based on the cumulative flow time series at downstream gauged stations that have no substantial attenuation effects the hydrologic indices were computed at these gauges and plotted against the area weighted values of the sub basin aridity indices one of the major sources of uncertainty in the quantified hydrologic indices involve the input rainfall data it has been acknowledged that the reliability of a rainfall dataset is mainly limited by the number and the spatial coverage of surface stations sun et al 2018 and the cru rainfall dataset used in this study is based on a very limited amount of observed rainfall data previous studies reported on the lack of agreement between different interpolated rainfall datasets sun et al 2018 the consistency of the cru and the unidel sun et al 2018 datasets is checked by computing ratios of unidel to cru mean annual rainfall regions where the computed ratio is high e g 1 2 were identified as potential areas of high uncertainty where the uncertainty ranges of the indices would need further refinement 4 results 4 1 extended streamflow series it was important to obtain common record periods of streamflow time series in order to ensure the representativeness of the computed hydrologic indices and minimize the differential effects of the number of wet and dry periods represented in short record periods table 3 lists the original and extended record periods as well as the source gauging stations used for the record extension fig 3 a shows a plot of two streamflow series at one gauging station l cb261 located in the upper lualaba sub basin and illustrates the reliability of the approach by comparing the observed flows with the substitute time series i e all months estimated from the source gauge the general pattern of the observed streamflow series is well reproduced and therefore the extended and infilled records should be adequately reliable similar results were obtained for all the gauging stations and their nash coefficients of efficiency based on comparisons between the observed and substitute flows are shown in fig 3b for the majority of gauging stations the nash coefficient of efficiency is above 0 6 for both low and high flows the final hydrologic indices were derived from the patched streamflow series i e a combination of observed patched and extended data 4 2 classification by climate and physiographic characteristics the classification of the 403 sub basins of the congo river basin was achieved by training a self organizing map som fig 4 a displays different levels of the quantization error qe obtained from using different map sizes the results show that the larger the map size number of nodes the smaller the quantization error which expresses the adequateness of representing the input vectors by a specific node out of seven attributes used for the classification only five were retained while the twi and sand attributes were removed because they were highly correlated with slope and clay respectively therefore a map size of 2 000 nodes qe 0 0003 was judged appropriate in representing the dataset and was used for the classification different numbers of clusters were also tested in order to obtain the number that maximize the within group similarity and between group dissimilarity the application of an independent quality measure anosim statistic r fig 4b suggests that six clusters are appropriate for the congo river basin these homogenous groups are significantly different with a global r of 0 7 at a p value of 0 001 the r statistic increases with an increase in the number of clusters but this increase is associated with low dissimilarity 0 25 r 0 48 between some clusters when greater than six clusters are used in contrast with six clusters all the between group dissimilarity values are above 0 53 table 4 displays the dissimilarity matrix of the six homogeneous groups where high values of r implies high dissimilarity between groups overall the average squared distances within groups were far smaller than the average squared distances between groups the spatial distribution of the six climate and physiographic regions resulting from the classification is shown in fig 5 the groups are coherent and preserve a high degree of spatial proximity approximately 28 of sub basins are assigned to region 1 19 4 to region 2 and 3 14 6 to region 4 11 6 to region 5 and 7 2 to region 6 fig 6 illustrates the spatial relationships between the climate and physiographic attributes across the six regions while table 5 provides descriptions of each homogenous region region 1 has the highest number of gauged headwater sub basins while region 6 has none 4 3 classification by hydrologic behavior based on the distribution of gauged sub basins two independent classifications each having five groups were performed using a similar approach as highlighted in section 3 2 the comparison between the physiographic classification and the five classifications based on hydrologic behavior is shown in fig 7 only the three fractions of the fdc indices and runoff ratio were used to represent sub basin response behavior while five climate and physiographic attributes represented sub basins physical properties overall there exists a high degree of affinity rand index 73 between the physiographic classification and the hydrologic classification when all indices of hydrologic behavior are used in the classification however the highest affinity rand index 82 is achieved when only the q50 mmq index is used this suggests that the climate and physiographic attributes used in this classification are able to capture different components of the sub basin s hydrologic response at different degrees due to the limited number of gauged headwater sub basins some clusters are made up of less than 3 sub basins table s1 in supplementary information the implication of this result is that predictive equations for the hydrologic indices in most of the clusters cannot be developed due to a lack of enough sample points for those clusters where there are 4 representative gauges table 6 illustrates that there are potentially strong relationships between the physiographic climate attributes and the hydrologic indices however the shape of the relationships is regionally variable and because of a lack of enough gauging stations to represent some clusters fig 8 we cannot extrapolate the relationships to all the sub basins in the congo in contrast when all the sub basins are included in the regression analysis the aridity index is revealed as the best single predictor of hydrologic behavior table 7 with cn second the other attributes do not appear to offer any additional predictive value table 7 4 4 aridity index as a control on hydrologic indices the spatial pattern of the aridity index fig 9 across the congo river basin exhibits some degree of similarity with the six homogenous regions fig 5 a concentric pattern of aridity index suggests the increase of the aridity index from the cuvette centrale towards headwater tributaries located in the north east and south parts of the basin fig 10 a shows the plot of the runoff ratio rr as a function of arity index ai overall a high aridity index results in a low runoff ratio and vice versa for instance the majority of gauging stations representing sub basins located in the southeast and north of the congo river basin region 1 show high values of aridity index indicating a low runoff ratio rr 0 25 potential the observed pattern in humid conditions ai 0 75 does not show a similar pattern of rr as in region 1 with very limited information in this region 4 we cannot confirm the apparent increase of rr with the increase of ai in general while two discernible relationships could have been established between the ai and the runoff ratio it would have been difficult to determine the basis on which ungauged sub basins could have been assigned to either relationship given the fact that observed gauging stations of the same region would be on different regression lines therefore a single regression relationship r2 0 63 is derived between the aridity index and the runoff ratio a positive power relationship r2 0 84 between the aridity index and the q10 mmq is shown in fig 10b sub basins of region 4 are located at the bottom end of the regression line indicating a slow to moderate response to rainfall inputs in contrast sub basins of region 1 are spread throughout the regression line the q50 mmq index fig 10c shows a positive power relationship r2 0 81 with the aridity index and follows a similar trend to the runoff ratio where high values of aridity index were associated with low indices the q90 mmq index also exhibits a positive power relationship fig 10d but with a higher degree of scatter r2 0 725 comparing fig 10b and d suggests that regions 2 and 4 have regimes with low variability while region 3 is more variable and region 1 is represented by flow regimes of different degrees of variability without more data points it is difficult to predict if areas with higher aridity indices would have very low q90 mmq indices and possibly zero flows for some of the time this could depend on the spatial scale of the sub basins in that aggregation of contributions from different parts of a large sub basin coupled with the effects of flow routing suggest that zero flow conditions are unlikely however small sub basins might experience zero flows but the majority of the sub basins used in the current modeling units tshimanga et al 2018 are greater than 2 000 km2 limiting the possibility of zero flow at a monthly time scale through the application of the spatial disaggregation procedure section 3 4 estimates of the hydrologic indice values are available for an additional 11 sub basins table s2 in supplementary information while these values are more uncertain than those based on the gauged headwater sub basins they have been included to expand the data set before calculating regression line confidence intervals to quantify the uncertainty ranges of the hydrologic indices 4 5 uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices fig 11 shows the 90 confidence intervals based on the updated regression relationships after the inclusion of the data for additional 11 sub basins disaggregated from downstream gauging station data a comparion between figs 10 and 11 suggests that the shape of the relationships has hardly changed while most of the r2 values have slightly decreased and therefore the final uncertainty bounds increased the degree of uncertainty varies according to the type of the hydrologic index with greater relative uncertainty in the runoff ratio and the q90 mmq indices while relatively low uncertainty characterizes the q10 mmq and q50 mmq indices given that the available data to quantify the hydrologic indices is very limited it is impossible to make any firm a priori statements about how representative these uncertainty bound relationships are for all of the sub basins of the congo river basin however ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 proposed that checks can only be made by using the uncertainty bounds to constrain the individual sub basin responses in a hydrological model and assess the outputs against observed data representing aggregated responses downstream some limited independent estimates of runoff ratio fig 12 suggest that many of the reported runoff ratios fit within the computed bounds notable exceptions are some estimates for the batéké plateau system in the western congo river basin region 5 and for the rift valley region eastern congo river basin there are quite large uncertainties in the rainfall data for these steep areas but even if a different rainfall data set is used unidel the estimated runoff ratios remain well outside the computed uncertainty bounds in contrast the independent estimates in flat to undulating topography 0 5 5 regions cuvette centrale northeast congo upper lualaba and southeast kasai generally fall within the uncertainty bounds regardless of which rainfall data set is used the average runoff ratio 0 24 for the whole congo river basin laraque and olivry 1996 also falls within the uncertainty bounds 5 discussion and conclusion it is a common practice in hydrology to use catchment classification as a means of extending hydrologic information from gauged to ungauged sub basins this procedure requires each region to have a predictive equation of hydrologic response based on potential climate and physiographic predictors yadav et al 2007 kapangaziwiri et al 2012 the success of this approach largely depends on the number of gauged sub basins with sufficiently long records the classification of the 403 sub basins of the congo river fig 5 and table 5 demonstrated that the climate and physiographic attributes used in this study can identify relatively homogeneous regions suggesting that there is a potential to interpret hydrologic similarity based on similarity in climate and physiography oudin et al 2010 ley et al 2011 furthermore the hydrologic classification based on the 15 gauged sub basins showed that the aridity index the surface slope the curve number the silt and clay contents are potential predictors of hydrologic response indices however the number of gauged sub basins even including the disaggregated data for a few larger gauged sub basins is not sufficient to develop individual predictive relationships between the hydrologic indices and the climate and or physiographic attributes for each of the identified regions some of the clusters identified in the hydrologic classification section 4 3 are represented by less than 3 sample gauged sub basins this is part of the challenge of data scarcity in many parts of the world including the congo river basin fortunately the alternative approach of developing generic predictive equations for the whole basin generated results that produce acceptable levels of uncertainty as measured by the width of the confidence intervals around the regression relationships while several approaches to developing these equations were assessed using combinations of the climate and physiographic attributes informed by the results of the hydrologic classification it transpired that the aridity index produced the best results for all of the hydrologic indices a comparison between the spatial patterns of climate physiographic regions fig 5 and the aridity index groups fig 9 shows some distinct similarities the areas where there are fewer similarities are mainly within or across those regions that are less distinguishable based on the anosim statistics in table 4 from other regions regions 1 2 and 3 have low anosim statistics and also cover a wide range of aridity groups 2 6 while regions 4 and 5 have the highest anosim statistics and all the sub basins have generally low aridity values similarly region 6 is generally distinguishable from the other regions and most sub areas fall within aridity groups 3 and 4 the conclusion is that although the original climate physiographic regionalization results are not used in the developed predictive equations for the hydrologic indices the spatial patterns of variability in hydrologic response are not too dissimilar to the originally identified regions the fact that the aridity index emerges as the best available predictor of hydrologic indices table 7 in the congo river basin is perhaps not surprising as the same index has been used successfully in other parts of southern africa tumbo and hughes 2015 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 and elsewhere zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 found that the aridity index was one of the most influential attributes and was well correlated with mean discharge as well as the 10th and 50th percentiles of the flow duration curve similarly ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 determined relationships between the aridity index and the runoff ratio however they also found distinct regional differences across eswatini swaziland that are less evident in the congo river basin part of this difference may be related to the substantial topographic and climate variations across the small country of eswatini while the much larger number of sample points based on previous simulations used by ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 could also play a major role tumbo and hughes 2015 also found regional differences in the link between aridity and hydrologic response indices but they were not able to quantify regression relastionships and their final result was based on simple index ranges for each identified region in the great ruaha river basin of tanzania the main limitation for extending the predictive equations of the hydrologic indices to ungauged sub basins is related to the spatial representativeness of the observed streamflow gauging stations the majority of the final sub basins used to develop the uncertainty ranges are found in region 1 even after the inclusion of the disaggregated gauging station data while the developed uncertainty ranges of hydrologic indices can be applied with high confidence in sub basins representing the climate and physiographic properties of region 1 upper lualaba and northern oubangui less confidence can be ascribed to their application in the other regions where some aspects of the hydrologic behavior may not have been captured the fact that the range of the aridity index values 0 66 1 59 used to develop the predictive equations represent most of the climate variability across all 403 sub basins of the congo river basin suggests that the approach may be quite robust in representing the diverse climate conditions within the basin however fig 12 shows some examples where some independent estimates of runoff ratio for some steep sub basins fall well outside the uncertainty range while these may be isolated examples of outliers the lack of enough data seriously constrains any attempts to further validate the applicability of the relationships and the ranges of uncertainty across the whole basin gnann et al 2019 have shown that the variability of low flow in humid sub basins of the united kingdom and the united states could not be primarily attributed to the aridity index and that the aridity index is the key determinant of low flows only in arid regions the congo data tend to support this conclusion in that the uncertainty range for q90 mmq index is quite large and there is no real trend in the values for region 4 fig 9d according to laraque et al 1998 the hydrologic response of the sub group batéké plateaux of region 4 sub basins is characterized by very little seasonal variation between the low and high flows indicating the presence of a high storage capacity groundwater system that contributes to the regulation of flows physical attributes describing the geological settings might have been informative in terms of including the role of sub surface processes but a consistent database of groundwater characteristics for the whole congo river basin is not yet available inevitably the developed uncertainty ranges of the hydrologic indices account for several different sources of uncertainty these uncertainties could be due to the uncertainty in rainfall maidment et al 2015 sun et al 2018 and evapotranspiration estimates the length of the streamflow records the number of the gauging stations used and their spatial distribution the percentage of missing data the reliability of rating curves kiang et al 2018 used to convert raw stage data into streamflows and stage observational errors maidment et al 2015 found considerable differences in trend sign and magnitude 10 and 39 mm yr 1 per decade between different sets of global rainfall over central africa they reported that the spurious negative trends identified in cru rainfall dataset were due to the decline in rainfall gauge density across central africa including the congo river basin our results have shown that substantial differences between global interpolated rainfall datasets cru and unidel are observed in the batéké plateau and rift valley sub regions located in the western and eastern parts of the congo river basin respectively it is shown that these differences were more pronounced in steep topography section 4 5 and constitute a common problem facing interpolated global rainfall datasets especially in complex mountain areas due to the limited number and spatial coverage of surface stations as well as the types of algorithms and data assimilation models used to generate the interpolated rainfall data sun et al 2018 this type of uncertainty clearly affects both the aridity index and the runoff ratio translating the uncertainty in instantaneous discharge observations into potential errors in monthly streamflow volumes is more difficult particularly if the raw stage data and rating curves are not accessible as is often the case in many countries of southern africa in the congo river basin the lower and upper bounds of these errors for the gauging stations in the southern part of the basin kasai and lualaba drainage systems were estimated to be between 12 and 29 charlier 1955 and lempicka 1971 the average uncertainty obtained for the q10 mmq and q50 mmq indices are less than this total value of 41 38 and 32 for q10 mmq and q50 mmq indices respectively these results are consistent with previous studies on the uncertainty in hydrologic signatures westerberg and mcmillan 2015 westerberg et al 2016 reported that the uncertainty in hydrologic signatures varied with signature type with the highest uncertainties 30 40 found in high and low flow characteristics due to the uncertainty in the observed discharge and the regionalization procedures in the northern part of the congo river basin sangha and oubangui drainage systems previous studies laraque and olivry 1996 mahé 1995 noted a decrease in streamflow from the main tributaries of the right bank of the congo river for the period of 1953 1993 an average 28 5 decrease was observed in the oubangui drainage system 15 in sangha 11 in the cuvette centrale and very little change in the batékés plateau system therefore any data records that only fall within this period would be expected to generate lower mean monthly flow mmq indices than would be appropriate for a longer simulation period thus adding further levels of uncertainty the presence of any extreme flows over the record periods as is the case for the congo river in the 1960s would also impact on the mmq indices the majority of the gauging stations used in this study have short record periods around the 1960s however it is argued that the extension and infilling of missing data section 4 1 has at least partially overcome these effects the uncertainty ranges of the hydrologic indices presented in this study are not affected by wetland and channel routing effects because any gauging stations located below wetlands were not represented in the 26 sub basins used in the development of these uncertainty bounds the overall conclusion is that the developed relationships and uncertainty bounds between aridity index and the hydrologic indices are appropriate for constraining sub basin hydrologic simulations for the whole of the congo river basin with the likely exception of some areas of very steep topography on the eastern borders of the basin and the batéké plateaux the ultimate test of these relationships and their uncertainty bounds will be to assess the results of the constrained simulations at downstream gauging stations which have not been used in their development it is likely that they will not work in areas downstream of the identified steep sub basins and therefore will need to be re calibrated for those areas author statement the authors

8353,study region brixenbach catchment 10 km² kitzbuehel alps tyrol austria study focus this study presents the data of one of the rare soil moisture networks in the alps a 9 year soil moisture time series recorded at 8 sites with in situ measurements six pasture and two forest sites we aim at understanding the soil moisture behaviour in general its reaction to rainfall considering the site characteristics and the runoff reaction depending on the antecedent soil moisture content we analysed soil moisture rainfall and discharge data with a temporal resolution of one hour summer months and two hours autumn to spring respectively and interpreted the results in terms of land use and topographical features new hydrological insights for the region the medians of the soil moisture positively correlate with the sites altitude comparing spatial standard deviation of soil moisture versus spatial mean shows a high scatter of the standard deviations contrary to previous studies which use considerably shorter time series the spatial variability increases with spatial mean thus the highest spatial variability is recorded at wet conditions the catchment shows clear threshold behaviour runoff coefficients above 0 23 only occurred when the soil moisture spatial mean of the eight sites overrun 43 5 vol which can be translated into a saturation deficit of 0 28 keywords soil moisture in situ measurements land use runoff threshold soil moisture monitoring 1 introduction the magnitude of a flash flood resulting from a specific precipitation event may strongly depend on the antecedent soil moisture within a catchment e g merz and blöschl 2009 marchi et al 2010 rainfall of a certain sum and intensity may cause a strong runoff reaction in case of high initial soil moisture soil water content at the beginning of the rainfall event whereas the runoff reaction to the same rainfall event may be minor if the storage capacity of the catchment is high due to low initial soil moisture this is especially the case for catchments dominated by subsurface flow lacking an efficient drainage network scherrer et al 2007 however also surface flow can react to increased initial soil moisture mayerhofer et al 2017 against this background information on initial soil moisture conditions is essential for understanding flood generation as a basis of flood risk management although installing and maintaining a soil moisture measurement network in order to capture the soil moisture dynamics in a catchment involves considerable effort it has a high value due to missing alternatives the antecedent rainfall sum proved to be a proxy of only limited quality as it cannot be translated directly into the related soil moisture content which strongly depends on land use as well as pedological and geological characteristics of the catchment brocca et al 2008 merz and blöschl 2009 hagen et al 2020 area wide soil moisture estimates based on space borne sensors e g synthetic

vegetation brocca et al 2013 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 studying soil moisture dynamics from precipitation runoff modelling can be very helpful rößler and löffler 2010 however as precipitation runoff models are usually validated by runoff data the quality of the soil moisture information can hardly be assessed without in situ measurements despite the scaling problem connected with soil moisture measurement data representing only very small areas western and blöschl 1999 they are therefore still indispensable in order to understand a catchment s runoff response due to the spatial

claduègne catchment 3 4 and 43 km² south eastern france huza et al 2014 uber et al 2018 thereby several authors found a threshold behaviour with a certain soil moisture value above which substantially higher runoff coefficients are possible in dependence of the rainfall characteristics while below the threshold only small runoff coefficients occur huza et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2014 penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 alpine soils show a high spatial variability resulting from the local topography which controls geomorphologic processes and thus soil parent material as well as micro climate conditions all together strongly influencing pedogenesis baruck et al 2016 thus also the soil moisture content can vary remarkably within short distances measuring soil moisture contents at single points within transects or large scale networks as carried out by public meteorologic hydrographic service institutions as well as research groups e g pellet and hauck 2017 hagen et al 2020 delivers valuable information however capturing the small scale variability of soil moisture which is characteristic for alpine soils and thus understanding a catchment s runoff reaction is only possible with the aid of sensor networks within hydrological catchments their installation and maintenance is very time consuming also due to the limited accessibility thus hardly any alpine catchments have been equipped with permanent soil moisture measurement networks aiming at runoff analysis however the potential of such studies with regard to increasing process understanding is shown by penna et al 2011 who found a relationship between the antecedent wetness conditions and the runoff response time of a small sub catchment 0 14 km² in the dolomitic region italy southern alps while during dry periods streamflow peaked prior to hillslope soil moisture the opposite was the case for wet conditions during dry periods overland flow from the saturated riparian zone was considered to produce low stormflow amounts during wet conditions higher stormflow values were triggered by rainfall events with subsurface flow activated on the hillslopes being a major contributor to runoff here we report on one of the rare and long term alpine soil moisture measurement networks which has been installed in 2009 in the brixenbach valley 9 2 km² in tyrol austria it is a typical catchment in the eastern alps with medium altitude summits nearly 2000 m a s l used for cattle grazing forestry and tourism like in many other catchments its torrents are incised in quite easily erodible quaternary sediments wherefore floods are usually accompanied by intensive bed load transport or even debris flows regarding its characteristics as well as its runoff response the brixenbach catchment can be seen as a prototype for an eastern alpine torrent catchment of medium altitude our soil moisture network consists of eight sites between 1000 and 1700 m a s l with three sensors each additionally precipitation and runoff data of the hydrographic service of tyrol are available analysing this 9 year soil moisture time series in combination with the precipitation and runoff data we aim at answering to the following research questions how pronounced is the spatial and temporal variability of the soil moisture content in this small alpine catchment which site specific characteristics may cause these differences how does the soil moisture content react to different types of rainfall events regarding the magnitude of the reaction and the reaction time how does the relationship between the soil moisture content at rainfall onset and the runoff reaction during rainfall events look like previous studies in mostly non alpine catchments delivered a threshold behaviour for the catchment s runoff response referring to the soil moisture content at rainfall onset below the soil moisture threshold the runoff coefficients are low above the threshold both low and high runoff coefficients can be recorded depending on the precipitation characteristics the reported threshold values differ in mediterranean catchments 22 vol topsoil ascat satellite data huza et al 2014 and 34 vol profile mean 0 40 cm in situ measurements uber et al 2018 were found penna et al 2011 reported a higher threshold value of 45 vol 0 30 cm in situ measurements in a southern alpine catchment mcmillan et al 2014 identified thresholds between 27 vol and 58 vol in a 50 km² catchment 60 cm in situ measurements in new zealand thus for the study area of the brixenbach valley we also aim at investigating if the catchment shows a threshold behaviour of the runoff reaction as reported for other mostly non alpine catchments for analysing our soil moisture time series as well as the discharge and rainfall data provided by the hydrographic service of tyrol we used statistical methods interpretation of the results was supported by additional fieldwork in the catchment comprising vegetation mapping pedological field and laboratory analysis long lasting research activities in the catchment such as infiltration measurements sprinkling experiments discontinuous discharge measurements earth worm population studies etc e g mayerhofer et al 2017 ruggenthaler et al 2016 geitner et al 2014 helped us to understand the catchment system 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study catchment the study area the brixenbach catchment fig 1 is a headwater catchment of the brixentaler ache a tributary of the river inn in tyrol austria the brixenbach catchment covers an area of 9 2 km² with a mean elevation of 1370 m a s l its highest point gampenkogel rises up to 1957 m a s l the discharge gauge installed in 2004 by the hydrographic service of tyrol is situated on the alluvial fan at the catchment s outlet 818 m a s l the catchment is part of the palaeozoic greywacke zone and is thus dominated by porphyroids as well as shales slightly metamorphic sand silt and claystones partly overlain by mesozoic dolomites nevertheless most of the soils are developed from unconsolidated quaternary deposits covering most of the bedrock such as till slope debris talus deposits fluvial and aeolian sediments depending on these parent materials in combination with vegetation type and water supply the following soil types can be found see figs 1 and 4 cambisols widespread on different unconsolidated parent materials podzols on deposits free from carbonates partly under coniferous forests and usually under draw shrub heath gleysols near the wider channels and in some areas dominated by slope water rendzic leptosols on dolomitic debris or bedrock regosols on carbonate silicate mixed loose material lithic leptosols on bedrock with different mineralogic compositions and histosols in wet depressions in terms of land use the catchment area is mainly characterized by cattle pastures 44 and forests 35 rock faces and talus slopes cover 14 and only small areas are used as hay meadows for settlements ski slopes and forest roads meißl et al 2017 the forests are dominated by conifers with spruce picea abies being the predominant tree species silver firs abies alba european larch larix decidua swiss stone pines pinus cembra mountain pines pinus mugo grey and green alders alnus incana alnus viridis occur in smaller proportions förster et al 2018 the mean annual precipitation sum at the precipitation gauge talkaser 1450 m a s l in the upper catchment is about 1550 mm 2010 2018 data provided by hydrographic service of tyrol being a small catchment 10 km² the brixenbach shows its strongest runoff reaction during local convective rainfall events when the cattle pastures produce high amounts of hortonian overland flow due to the topsoil compaction additionally the forested southeastern part of the catchment is characterised by shallow soils on less permeable silt and claystones producing subsurface stormflow meißl et al 2011 2017 fig 2 summarizes data used for this study as well as the processing steps which are described more in detail in the following sections 2 2 soil moisture measurements the soil moisture measurement network in the brixenbach catchment has been installed in july 2009 between 1000 and 1700 m a s l it consists of four pairs of sites thus eight sites altogether table 1 fig 1 fig 3 each of them equipped with three soil moisture sensors delta t thetaprobe ml2x and one soil temperature sensor skye skts 200 the thetaprobe is a frequency domain fd sensor using the impedance method at 100 hz the sensor accuracy is reported to be within 0 05 m³ m³ delta t devices 1999 according to the producers it could be improved to 0 01 m³ m³ by site specific sensor calibrations however due to the high gravel content and the small scale spatial variability of alpine soils it was not possible to enhance the accuracy by calibration all sensors have been installed 10 cm beneath soil surface within a perimeter of maximum 10 m aiming at understanding the soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil which are highly relevant for the runoff generation and capturing the local variability of soil moisture each site is equipped with a logger located in a plastic case in a soil hole covered by sods and or stones soil moisture is recorded at 1 h intervals from july to september and 2 h intervals from oktober to june logger maintenance and data readings have to be done on the spot the data used for this study comprise the time period from july 2009 to october 2018 six sites are situated on cattle pastures two of them west faced p1w p2w two east faced p1e p2e and two on relatively wet areas near the upper catchment borders p1h p2h two sites are located in the forest however due to timber harvesting f1 and mainly natural breakdown of the surrounding trees f2 both forest sites have developed more or less to clearing sites within the last years this leads to a reduction of the interception storage at both sites but the soil characteristics have remained more or less unchanged until now soil characteristics of the sites were recorded by soil profile description and laboratory analysis according to blume et al 2010 table 2 and fig 3 fig 4 shows the temporal data coverage of the soil moisture sensors due to the high gravel content of alpine soils installing the thetaprobes proved to be difficult in order to avoid biased measurement conditions with modified grain size distribution and bulk density by embedding the sensors in sieved soil material the sensors were pushed horizontally into the natural soil at p2h the rods of two sensors obviously did not get an adequate connection to the soil matrix and may have been situated in pores thus the data of two of the three sensors cannot be used at location p2e data has been recorded until 2014 when water intruding the logger caused technical problems as can be seen from fig 4 at p1e one sensor did not work from the beginning individual sensors at other sites stopped working later on except for the forest sites where all sensors are still working obviously cattle grazing increases the risk for sensor failures mainly because of cable damages the runoff time series are available from may 2004 to august 2016 as the trench regulating the torrent at the alluvial fan was completely rebuilt and widened between september 2016 and summer 2018 the runoff gauge had to be removed during the construction period in the course of quality control outliers in the long term soil moisture time series were identified and removed to describe the temporal concordance between the measurements of the sensors installed at the sites the synchronicity of the respective time series was calculated this is commonly done in dendrochronology to describe the agreement between individual tree ring series fritts 1976 schweingruber 1988 the synchronicity s xy compares the succession of the sign of the trend in each measurement interval increase or decrease of measured values in a time interval of two time series x and y the trend δ i of the interval i is computed from δ i x i 1 x i w h e n δ i 0 s i x 0 5 δ i 0 s i x 0 0 δ i 0 s i x 0 5 s xy is a relative value typically provided in percent and is derived from s x y 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 s i x s i y where n is the overlapping length of the two time series and s ix and s iy are the signs of the trend of the measurement interval i the synchronicity provides the relative proportion of cases where the interval trend s signs of both time series are similar i e synchronous schweingruber 1988 here the synchronicity returns the proportion of synchronic soil moisture increase or decrease for the multiple sensors installed at each site it can be used as an indicator showing if all sensors respond to wetting or drying in the same way likewise the mean soil moisture time series of each measurement site were compared based on their synchronicity for the calculation the dplr package bunn et al 2019 was used available for the r open source statistical software r core team 2019 2 3 analysis of precipitation data on the basis of the precipitation time series of the rainfall gauge talkaser provided with a temporal resolution of 15 min for the period from 07 2009 to 10 2018 rainfall events were identified based on the following criteria adopted for the characteristics of the study area in order to exclude winterly snowfall and springtime snowmelt events the analysis period was restricted to 1 may to 31 october of each year only events with a duration greater than or equal to half an hour at least two precipitation readings and a precipitation sum of at least 4 0 mm were considered rainfall events were separated if no precipitation was recorded for at least two hours precipitation readings of 0 1 mm 15 min and below were not included for each identified rainfall event the following parameters were extracted from the precipitation and runoff time series and the mean soil moisture time series of the 8 measurement sites rainfall duration h precipitation sum mm maximum precipitation intensity mm 15 min soil moisture at the rainfall onset vol maximum soil moisture occurring during the event or up to 4 h after the end of the rainfall event vol time lag between rainfall onset and soil moisture increase of at least 0 5 vol h peak runoff m³ s total runoff m³ see 2 4 in order to differentiate the rainfall events according to their characteristics they were clustered using a k means clustering algorithm hartigan and wong 1979 based on the precipitation sum mm rainfall duration h and maximum intensity mm 15 min 2 4 determination of the event runoff coefficients to estimate the total event runoff for a particular rainfall event the respective base flow component must be eliminated for the base flow separation a recursive digital filter rdf proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 was applied the filter of the form f t α f t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 allows to separate the quick runoff response f t from the original stream flow q t based on a selectable filter parameter α the rdf can be applied iteratively forward and reverse preventing distortions of the resulting data nathan and mcmahon 1990 identified the range of 0 90 to 0 95 for the filter parameter α to provide acceptable results for a study area in south eastern australia ladson et al 2013 compared modelled and measured base flow components concluding that using a value of 0 98 for the filter parameter α yields the best agreement for our data this value also led to the most plausible results following ladson et al 2013 the uncertainty of the modelled base flow was accounted for by systematically testing 100 filter parameter values centring around 0 98 0 005 1 standard deviation resulting in a range of 0 969 to 0 993 subsequently the event runoff qi was estimated by subtracting the median of the modelled base flow ensemble from the actual stream flow the upper and lower bound of the event runoff i e uncertainty of the modelled base flow component was considered by taking into account the 5 and 95 quantile of the modelled base flow the base flow separation was conducted with the ecohydrology package fuka et al 2018 available for the r open source statistical software r core team 2019 assuming homogeneous precipitation in space the event based runoff coefficient qci of event i was calculated from qci qi pi a where pi is precipitation sum of event i and a is the catchment area 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in order to capture the local variability of soil moisture each site has been equipped with three soil moisture sensors placed 10 cm beneath soil surface as expected these sensors show different medians and ranges fig 5 at five sites p2w p1e p2e p1h f1 two of the three sensors feature quite similar values with a clearly higher median for the third sensor except p1e where the third sensor did not work at the sites p1w and f2 all three sensors differ regarding the level of the median it cannot be ruled out that the different values are caused by an insufficient connection between single sensors and the surrounding soil matrix more likely they mirror the high local variability of soil characteristics which is typical especially for alpine soils the high relative relief induces gravitational and fluvial processes which are responsible for the high small scale variability of the topography resulting in different microclimates and the initial substrates for soil formation geitner et al 2011 in accordance with huza et al 2014 our results show that the within site variability is greater than the between site variability although the measurements of the three sensors at each site differ regarding the level of the absolute values they show a high synchronicity 0 83 fig 6 a that means the temporal course of the values is characteristic for the site thus for further analysis we used for each site the arithmetic means of the three sensors for all time steps see boxplots with black outlines in fig 5 regarding the temporal relationship of the soil moisture time series between the eight sites fig 6b shows the highest synchronicity 0 82 for the two west faced pasture sites p1w and p2w also the two east faced pasture sites p1e and p2e have highly synchronous soil moisture time series 0 81 a lower synchronicity results for the wet pasture site pair p1h and p2h 0 75 as well as for the forest site pair f1 and f2 0 76 the individual sites of these two pairs have differing aspects f2 shows the smallest synchronicity values with all other sites while f1 has been transformed into a clearing by forestry work quite soon after the installation of the sensors the reduction of forest canopy by natural forest degradation at f2 took longer so f2 is the only site in this study with more or less continuous forest conditions the effect of interception and the existence of a very loose humus rich forest soil may explain the smaller synchronicity with the other sites having a look at the sites characteristics we found the medians of the site sensor arithmetic means see boxplots with black outlines in fig 5 increase with the sites altitude fig 7 a for the pasture sites the regression of the medians of the soil moisture site sensor means depending on altitude has a coefficient of determination of 0 74 starting from a higher level also the forest sites show an increase of soil moisture with altitude only two sites thus no meaningful r² available the increase in soil moisture with increasing altitude can be explained by reduced evapotranspiration because of the decreasing air temperature additionally a comparison of the daily precipitation sums of the two precipitation gauges talkaser in the brixenbach catchment 1450 m a s l and am nachtsöllberg 995 m a s l about 2 km west of the western catchment border shows different gradients but in the majority of the cases the rainfall sum increases with altitude thus the sites at higher altitudes get more rainfall contrary to qiu et al 2001 penna et al 2011 and brocca et al 2007 our data showed no correlation between the soil moisture and the sites slope topographic index and upslope area according to the soil characteristics we found the sites soil moisture median decreasing with increasing gravel content r² 0 74 and bulk density r² 0 40 and increasing with increasing organic matter content r² 0 32 all values referring to the upper soil horizon until 10 cm depth fig 7 b d while increasing organic matter content leads to increased storage capacity of the soil increasing gravel content reduces the latter in general the soil hydrological impact of high gravel contents can have different effects on the one hand soils rich in stones are often more permeable and thus the can easier dry out on the other hand the incoming water amount is limited to less space of the soil matrix which could result in a higher water content of the remaining fine earth brakensiek and rawls 1994 cousin et al 2003 in our case the first impact seems to be more relevant increasing bulk density reduces infiltration capacity resulting in increased surface runoff and thus decreased soil moisture to investigate the spatial variability of the soil moisture values the spatial standard deviation is plotted as a function of the spatial mean of all eight sites in other studies the pattern of their interrelationship for catchments with different sizes and characteristics showed a convex shape for the topsoil which could be described by a third order polynomial function ryu and famiglietti 2005 teuling and troch 2005 choi and jacobs 2007 lawrence and hornberger 2007 rosenbaum et al 2012 this means soil moisture differs most between the sites for medium soil moisture values while during wet and dry phases all sites have similar soil moisture values similarly korres et al 2015 found negative relationships between the spatial soil moisture mean and the coefficient of variation implying lower spatial variability at higher mean soil moisture a different linear relationship was found by huza et al 2014 in a small 3 4 km² french catchment on basalt and limestone with pastures and vineyards and by de lannoy et al 2006 for the upper soil layer 10 cm in an intensively monitored corn field in maryland usa they observed a lower spatial variability during dry conditions and a higher one during wet conditions for the brixenbach catchment the picture is not so clear fig 8 a the first thing to notice is the strong scattering of the standard deviation values the time series of the above cited studies are much shorter between a few days and three years longer measurement periods may lead to stronger scattering of the standard deviations as there is some inter annual variability especially the standard deviation values in 2018 are markedly higher fig 8c in this year the highest annual mean temperature occurred in the region of interest within the observation period 2009 2018 station kitzbühel zamg 2018 the alternation of drying and wetting periods may explain the high median and variability of the standard deviations in this year despite of the scatter fig 8 shows that the soil moisture contents during rainfall periods grey dots are concentrated in the right hand side of the diagram as precipitation causes higher soil moisture values during rainless periods orange dots two different behaviours can be seen at mean soil moisture values 40 vol progressing drying leads to increasing spatial variability of the soil moisture contents in contrary above about 42 vol spatial mean progressing drying leads to decreasing spatial variability of the soil moisture contents furthermore shallow interflow which may occur at high soil moisture levels might support spatially homogeneous soil moisture conditions however this is very speculative regarding the course of the year the four west and east faced pasture sites show an increase of the soil moisture values at the beginning of the year the maximum is reached in march due to melting of the hibernal snow cover fig 9 a d subsequently soil moisture decreases until july which is the month with the soil moisture minimum and the largest interquartile range thus also the highest soil moisture variability a slight increase of soil moisture is recorded in autumn the four sites show a quite moderate fluctuation during the year on the contrary at p1h which is the highest located site at 1680 m a s l the most pronounced course of the year was recorded fig 9e additionally the site shows the highest soil moisture level among all eight sites it is situated near the upper ridge of the catchment at the scarp of a deep seated gravitational mass movement the podzol at p1h has a thick and biologically inactive humus layer and is overgrown by rhododendron ferrugineum and other shrubs fig 3 the site is very moist throughout the year which might be caused by the quaternary till covering this site in contradiction the soil moisture course of the year of the corresponding high elevation site p2h is very similar to the ones at the other pasture sites with the only difference that the soil moisture maximum is reached in april due to the combination of high altitude 1550 m a s l and the shading of southern catchment ridge fig 9f the forest sites show an even more damped course of the year due to the canopy which is responsible for rainfall interception and reduces evaporation by shading and wind shelter fig 9g h 3 2 reaction of soil moisture to rainfall events the soil moisture behaviour described in section 3 1 can be considered as long term characteristics of the brixenbach catchment on a shorter time scale soil moisture is strongly influenced by precipitation events thus we took a closer look on these wetting periods and analysed the reaction of soil moisture to rainfall events in total 547 rainfall events were extracted from 07 2009 to 10 2018 considering the period from the beginning of may to the end of october to prevent any hydrological effects of a snow cover clustering led to the differentiation into four types fig 10 c1 rainfall events with low precipitation sum short duration and low intensity unspecific rainfall events n 394 c2 rainfall events with medium precipitation sum medium duration and low intensity medium rainfall events n 93 c3 rainfall events with high precipitation sum long duration and low intensity larger advective rainfall events n 21 c4 rainfall events with medium precipitation sum short duration and high intensity short convective rainfall events thunder storms n 39 as fig 11 shows most of the events analysed are unspecific namely short events with low intensity cluster 1 fig 11a thus compared to their large number their precipitation sum is relatively low fig 11b the rainfall events with potentially severe consequences show either a high precipitation sum cluster 3 or a high maximum intensity cluster 4 despite their comparably rare occurrence fig 11a their fraction of the total precipitation sum is conversely high fig 11b as expected most of the convective rainfall events cluster 4 short duration high intensity occur in the summer months with a peak in august for each rainfall event we analysed the soil moisture increase in form of the difference between the maximum soil moisture and the soil moisture at the beginning of the event in vol as the events of the rainfall cluster 1 are characterised by small rainfall sums they usually cause low soil moisture increases fig 12 a the levels of soil moisture increase rise from cluster 2 fig 12b to 3 fig 12c the highest soil moisture increases occur in the course of rainfall events of cluster 3 larger advective rainfall events and cluster 4 short convective rainfall events fig 12d with the latter group showing a higher variability of soil moisture increase p1e reveals the largest soil moisture increase in all four clusters this site is situated on a long relatively planar slope shallow subsurface flow might lead to additional moisture supply f1 stands out because the median of the soil moisture increase values declines from cluster 3 to cluster 4 as the tree canopy of this site has successively been removed in the first years after the installation of the soil moisture sensors f1 has been covered by the typical dense successional vegetation of woodland clearings with high interception capacity which might be responsible for the smaller soil moisture increase during the short events of cluster 4 fig 13 shows the time span between the rainfall onset and the start of soil moisture increase according to the high rainfall intensity this reaction time is shortest for rainfall events of cluster 4 and reveals the smallest variability comparing the sites p1h and the two forest sites show longer reaction times at these three sites a thick humus layer may operate like a sponge and absorb the rainfall water first passing it on with delay 3 3 runoff reaction and antecedent soil moisture conditions 3 3 1 rainfall runoff events examples the runoff reaction of the brixenbach catchment is illustrated by means of four rainfall runoff events fig 14 the highest peak flow recorded by the runoff gauge occurred on 03 august 2014 fig 14c a short convective rainfall event rainfall event of cluster 4 with a maximum intensity of 15 mm 15 min a duration of one hour and a precipitation sum of 30 3 mm caused a peak flow of 17 5 m³ s the event was accompanied by hail jenner 2015 and resulted in intensive erosion processes and voluminous bedload transport destroying several torrent control structures and completely filling the retention basin at the top of the alluvial fan interestingly a few days before on 29 july 2014 another thunderstorm with similar intensity recorded at the rainfall gauge produced a peak flow of only 2 9 m³ s although the precipitation characteristics spatial distribution occurrence of hail are unknown and might had been different from the event on 03 august 2014 maybe the antecedent soil moisture also played an important role for the differing runoff responses between the two events during the seven days before the first event only three short convective rainfall events were recorded with a total rainfall sum of 41 1 mm after the first event advective rainfall filled the soil storage the 7 days antecedent rainfall sum was 196 5 mm for the second event even though our topsoil measurements do not show significant differences for the soil moisture content at precipitation begin fig 14c the storage capacities of the subsoil might had been exceeded before the second event the largest event in rainfall cluster 3 took place at increased topsoil antecedent soil moisture fig 14b between 01 and 03 june 2013 a rainfall event occured with a return period of 100 years for the 2 days to 4 days precipitation sum during a so called vb weather situation a low pressure area on the path from the adria to poland seibert et al 2007 it caused a significant peak flow at the runoff gauge brixenbach as well as a flood event with a return period of about 40 years in the river brixentaler ache the receiving stream of the brixenbach torrent and large inundations in neighboured catchments hydrographic service of tyrol 2013 on the contrary fig 14d displays another event of rainfall cluster 3 with also a quite high rainfall sum but low antecedent precipitation an exceptional event which however might occur more often in future belongs to rainfall cluster 2 fig 14a it is the rain on snow event of 10 october 2011 leading to catastrophic inundations in switzerland badoux et al 2013 and also causing significantly increased discharge further east from 08 to 09 october 2011 incoming cold air was responsible for a precipitation event with the snow fall line declining to about 800 m a s l a heavy rainfall on 10 october 2011 remobilised the stored water content by rapid melting of the snow cover 3 3 2 runoff coefficients in total 244 rainfall events caused a distinct increase of soil moisture 0 5 vol and a total event runoff of at least three cubic metres the calculated runoff coefficients range between 0 02 and 0 91 fig 15 blöschl et al 2004 analysed about 50 000 rainfall runoff events between 1981 and 2002 in 345 austrian catchments and found average runoff coefficients between 0 36 and 0 44 for the catchment of the river brixentaler ache receiving stream of the brixenbach torrent and neighboured catchments aschauer ache kelchsauer ache with catchment sizes between 134 and 377 km² no information on the variance of the runoff coefficients is given in their study comparing to the values of blöschl et al 2004 the runoff coefficients calculated for the brixenbach catchment in our study are mostly lower with an average of 0 11 this is probably due to the significantly shorter time series in our study containing few large events three events stand out runoff coefficient 0 66 although their runoff coefficient might be slightly overestimated due to the limitations of the hydrograph separation method they had exceptional event characteristics the largest runoff coefficient belongs to the june 2013 event described above fig 14b and the second largest to a heavy regional rainfall on 2 june 2010 produced by a continental low hydrographic service of tyrol 2010 rainfall cluster 3 the rain on snow event october 2011 fig 14a is responsible for the third largest runoff coefficient thus also the runoff coefficient outliers are explicable 3 3 3 soil moisture threshold for runoff reaction as also reported by other authors e g uber et al 2018 the correlation between soil moisture at rainfall beginning and runoff coefficient fig 15 is not very strong the result may to some part be associated with limitations of the precipitation measurement measurement errors lacking spatial representativeness of the singular gauge in the catchment by the choice of hydrograph separation method and by the fact that the antecedent soil moisture is just one among several factors influencing runoff reaction therefore minor runoff coefficients occur at low and high antecedent soil moisture contents however the scatterplot of fig 15 shows a noticeable arrangement of the dots adding the dashed lines we can graphically define a threshold value for soil moisture runoff coefficients above 0 23 were only recorded when the spatial mean of the soil moisture content was above 43 5 vol thus the brixenbach catchment shows a clear threshold behaviour with a threshold close to the one reported by penna et al 2011 in a southern alpine catchment 45 vol 0 30 cm depth at seven of the eight individual sites an individual threshold could be identified due to the differing soil moisture levels and soil characteristics of the sites also the threshold has different absolute values between 31 and 52 vol this range is nearly as large as the one found by mcmillan et al 2014 who identified thresholds between 27 vol and 58 vol in a 50 km² catchment in new zealand though they used subsoil measurements 60 cm this means if in situ measurements are used for deriving the threshold it has to be considered that the level of the soil moisture spatial mean is strongly dependent on the choice of the measurement sites due to the small scale variability of soil moisture content so in the same catchment different threshold values may be identified depending on the number and location of the measurement sites accordingly uber et al 2018 state that threshold values cannot be transferred to ungauged catchments e g in order to install a flood warning system if we assume that the maximum soil moisture content measured during the nine years measurement period is a fair approximation to the maximum natural water uptake the absolute soil moisture content at rainfall onset can be transferred into a relative value in the form of its proportion of the maximum soil moisture content its difference to 1 can be interpreted as saturation deficit the west and east faced pasture sites and the forest site f2 show a threshold at a relative soil moisture content of between 0 71 and 0 75 fig 16 the threshold at p1h is lower 0 65 for the forest site f1 it is slightly higher namely at 0 80 no threshold can be found for p2h the spatial mean of all eight sites reveals a threshold at a relative soil moisture of 0 72 and a saturation deficit of 0 28 respectively the influence of the antecedent soil moisture on the runoff reaction of the brixenbach catchment here clearly shown by the identified threshold was also detected with the aid of other methods in previous studies ruggenthaler et al 2016 conducted double ring infiltrometer measurements at different soil moisture conditions and found an increase of the amount of total infiltrated water with increasing soil moisture deficit for the east and west faced pasture sites while there in other words the infiltration decreased with increasing soil moisture no correlation was found at the upland sites p1h p2h as well as at the forest sites mayerhofer et al 2017 used sprinkling experiments on small 1 m² and large 50 80 m² plots to determine the surface runoff coefficient at short rainfall events with high intensity in the brixenbach valley the repetition of the experiments after a short break of about an hour helped to simulate very moist antecedent soil moisture conditions the pasture sites investigated for this study showed a clear increase of the surface runoff coefficient for increased antecedent soil moisture uber et al 2018 suggest a multivariate regression analysis to examine different controls on the runoff coefficient such as meteorological forcing and the antecedent soil moisture content at rainfall onset applying this for the brixenbach catchment the precipitation sum and the antecedent soil moisture spatial mean appear to be significant predictors while the maximum and mean precipitation intensity the precipitation duration the soil moisture spatial standard deviant and the increase of soil moisture during the event spatial mean do not show significant influence on the runoff coefficient however r² of the linear multivariate regression model is only 0 29 thus its explanatory power is limited 3 3 4 temporal sequence of soil moisture maximum and runoff peak during rainfall events of cluster 3 and 4 soil moisture mostly peaked before the event discharge fig 17 a while for rainfall events of cluster 1 and 2 this was only the case for 50 of the events and the other way round for the second half of the events the latter is also true for dry and medium initial soil moisture states however for those 25 of the events with the highest initial soil moisture discharge peaked before soil moisture fig 17b this can be explained as followed saturated conditions lead to a higher amount of fast surface flow which was also shown by sprinkling experiments in the catchment mayerhofer et al 2017 additionally the flow paths in the soil are already filled with water enabling a faster initiation of subsurface flow both leads to a faster development of peak discharge than at dryer conditions when the amount of the fast surface flow is smaller and water has to replace air in the flow paths first interestingly our results contradict those of penna et al 2011 who found the soil moisture peaks to occur prior to the streamflow peaks at wet conditions and the opposite behaviour at dry conditions they attributed streamflow during dry periods mainly to overland flow from the saturated riparian zone while streamflow during wet periods was considered to stem from hillslope subsurface flow with a lower flow velocity the difference might also result from the position of the soil moisture sensors while penna et al 2011 instrumented several transects from the riparian zone to the hillslopes in a relatively small area a few ares we tried to cover a 9 km² catchment with distributed sensors all of them situated at the hillslopes outside of the riparian zone as the soil moisture peak at hillslopes probably also at moist conditions occurs later than in the riparian zone soil moisture spatially averaged over hillslopes including riparian zones peaks earlier than soil moisture averages over hillslopes distant to streams only 4 conclusions the soil moisture measurement network in the typical eastern alpine torrent catchment of the brixenbach is one of the rare networks with a high spatial resolution and long measurement duration it consists of eight sites with three sensors 10 cm below soil surface continuously measuring the soil moisture content since july 2009 the analysis of the resulting data gives valuable insights into the precipitation runoff reaction of the catchment depending on the antecedent soil moisture content the following conclusions can be drawn the three sensors at each site show the small scale local variability of soil moisture in alpine soils at some sites their soil moisture levels differ significantly as the synchronicity of data of the three sensors is high the usage of a site mean value can be justified comparing the median of the site sensor means with the catchment characteristics our data showed no correlation between the soil moisture and the sites slope the topographic index and the specific upslope area for the pasture sites soil moisture showed a strong positive correlation with altitude this is also the case for the two forest sites on a higher level plotting spatial standard deviation of soil moisture versus spatial mean shows a high scatter of the standard deviations contrary to previous studies which analyse considerably shorter time series while the resulting plot often showed a convex shape implying the highest spatial variability of soil moisture at medium soil moisture contents we found that during rainless periods progressing drying leads to increasing spatial variability of the soil moisture contents at mean soil moisture values 40 vol on the contrary above about 42 vol spatial mean progressing drying leads to decreasing spatial variability of the soil moisture contents we analysed 547 rainfall runoff events divided into four clusters with different rainfall duration sum and intensity the most exceptional runoff events belong to cluster 3 high precipitation sum and long duration but low intensity and 4 rainfall events with medium precipitation sum short duration but high intensity 244 rainfall events caused a distinct increase of soil moisture 0 5 vol and a total event runoff of at least three cubic metres for these events the brixenbach catchment showed a clear threshold behaviour runoff coefficients above 0 23 only occurred when the soil moisture spatial mean of the eight sites overrun 43 5 vol regarding the singular sites this threshold is more or less clear but situated at different levels thus the level of the spatial mean strongly depends on the number and casual location of the sites used if we take a look at the relative soil moisture as proportion of the maximum soil moisture content of the site during the whole measurement period the threshold ranges between 0 65 and 0 80 with the sites mean of 0 72 which can be interpreted as saturation deficit of 0 28 at moist conditions event streamflow peaked prior to soil moisture which can be explained by increased surface flow volumes at higher soil moisture as well as already initialized subsurface flow paths the analyses of the long term soil moisture time series provide a valuable insight into the hydrological system of the brixenbach catchment and may help to identify critical conditions which may lead to floods in future credit authorship contribution statement gertraud meißl conceptualization data curation investigation

8353,study region brixenbach catchment 10 km² kitzbuehel alps tyrol austria study focus this study presents the data of one of the rare soil moisture networks in the alps a 9 year soil moisture time series recorded at 8 sites with in situ measurements six pasture and two forest sites we aim at understanding the soil moisture behaviour in general its reaction to rainfall considering the site characteristics and the runoff reaction depending on the antecedent soil moisture content we analysed soil moisture rainfall and discharge data with a temporal resolution of one hour summer months and two hours autumn to spring respectively and interpreted the results in terms of land use and topographical features new hydrological insights for the region the medians of the soil moisture positively correlate with the sites altitude comparing spatial standard deviation of soil moisture versus spatial mean shows a high scatter of the standard deviations contrary to previous studies which use considerably shorter time series the spatial variability increases with spatial mean thus the highest spatial variability is recorded at wet conditions the catchment shows clear threshold behaviour runoff coefficients above 0 23 only occurred when the soil moisture spatial mean of the eight sites overrun 43 5 vol which can be translated into a saturation deficit of 0 28 keywords soil moisture in situ measurements land use runoff threshold soil moisture monitoring 1 introduction the magnitude of a flash flood resulting from a specific precipitation event may strongly depend on the antecedent soil moisture within a catchment e g merz and blöschl 2009 marchi et al 2010 rainfall of a certain sum and intensity may cause a strong runoff reaction in case of high initial soil moisture soil water content at the beginning of the rainfall event whereas the runoff reaction to the same rainfall event may be minor if the storage capacity of the catchment is high due to low initial soil moisture this is especially the case for catchments dominated by subsurface flow lacking an efficient drainage network scherrer et al 2007 however also surface flow can react to increased initial soil moisture mayerhofer et al 2017 against this background information on initial soil moisture conditions is essential for understanding flood generation as a basis of flood risk management although installing and maintaining a soil moisture measurement network in order to capture the soil moisture dynamics in a catchment involves considerable effort it has a high value due to missing alternatives the antecedent rainfall sum proved to be a proxy of only limited quality as it cannot be translated directly into the related soil moisture content which strongly depends on land use as well as pedological and geological characteristics of the catchment brocca et al 2008 merz and blöschl 2009 hagen et al 2020 area wide soil moisture estimates based on space borne sensors e g synthetic

2 61 km² central germany chifflard and zepp 2008 the wüstebach catchment 27 ha northwestern germany rosenbaum et al 2012 an umbrian catchment 1 6 km² morbidelli et al 2015 as well as the gazel and claduègne catchment 3 4 and 43 km² south eastern france huza et al 2014 uber et al 2018 thereby several authors found a threshold behaviour with a certain soil moisture value above which substantially higher runoff coefficients are possible in dependence of the rainfall characteristics while below the threshold only small runoff coefficients occur huza et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2014 penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 alpine soils show a high spatial variability resulting from the local topography which controls geomorphologic processes and thus soil parent material as well as micro climate conditions all together strongly influencing pedogenesis baruck et al 2016 thus also the soil moisture content can vary remarkably within short distances measuring soil moisture contents at single points within transects or large scale networks as carried out by public meteorologic hydrographic service institutions as well as research groups e g pellet and hauck 2017 hagen et al 2020 delivers valuable information however capturing the small scale variability of soil moisture which is characteristic for alpine soils and thus understanding a catchment s runoff reaction is only possible with the aid of sensor networks within hydrological catchments their installation and maintenance is very time consuming also due to the limited accessibility thus hardly any alpine catchments have been equipped with permanent soil moisture measurement networks aiming at runoff analysis however the potential of such studies with regard to increasing process understanding is shown by penna et al 2011 who found a relationship between the antecedent wetness conditions and the runoff response time of a small sub catchment 0 14 km² in the dolomitic region italy southern alps while during dry periods streamflow peaked prior to hillslope soil moisture the opposite was the case for wet conditions during dry periods overland flow from the saturated riparian zone was considered to produce low stormflow amounts during wet conditions higher stormflow values were triggered by rainfall events with subsurface flow activated on the hillslopes being a major contributor to runoff here we report on one of the rare and long term alpine soil moisture measurement networks which has been installed in 2009 in the brixenbach valley 9 2 km² in tyrol austria it is a typical catchment in the eastern alps with medium altitude summits nearly 2000 m a s l used for cattle grazing forestry and tourism like in many other catchments its torrents are incised in quite easily erodible quaternary sediments wherefore floods are usually accompanied by intensive bed load transport or even debris flows regarding its characteristics as well as its runoff response the brixenbach catchment can be seen as a prototype for an eastern alpine torrent catchment of medium altitude our soil moisture network consists of eight sites between 1000 and 1700 m a s l with three sensors each additionally precipitation and runoff data of the hydrographic service of tyrol are available analysing this 9 year soil moisture time series in combination with the precipitation and runoff data we aim at answering to the following research questions how pronounced is the spatial and temporal variability of the soil moisture content in this small alpine catchment which site specific characteristics may cause these differences how does the soil moisture content react to different types of rainfall events regarding the magnitude of the reaction and the reaction time how does the relationship between the soil moisture content at rainfall onset and the runoff reaction during rainfall events look like previous studies in mostly non alpine catchments delivered a threshold behaviour for the catchment s runoff response referring to the soil moisture content at rainfall onset below the soil moisture threshold the runoff coefficients are low above the threshold both low and high runoff coefficients can be recorded depending on the precipitation characteristics the reported threshold values differ in mediterranean catchments 22 vol topsoil ascat satellite data huza et al 2014 and 34 vol profile mean 0 40 cm in situ measurements uber et al 2018 were found penna et al 2011 reported a higher threshold value of 45 vol 0 30 cm in situ measurements in a southern alpine catchment mcmillan et al 2014 identified thresholds between 27 vol and 58 vol in a 50 km² catchment 60 cm in situ measurements in new zealand thus for the study area of the brixenbach valley we also aim at investigating if the catchment shows a threshold behaviour of the runoff reaction as reported for other mostly non alpine catchments for analysing our soil moisture time series as well as the discharge and rainfall data provided by the hydrographic service of tyrol we used statistical methods interpretation of the results was supported by additional fieldwork in the catchment comprising vegetation mapping pedological field and laboratory analysis long lasting research activities in the catchment such as infiltration measurements sprinkling experiments discontinuous discharge measurements earth worm population studies etc e g mayerhofer et al 2017 ruggenthaler et al 2016 geitner et al 2014 helped us to understand the catchment system 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study catchment the study area the brixenbach catchment fig 1 is a headwater catchment of the brixentaler ache a tributary of the river inn in tyrol austria the brixenbach catchment covers an area of 9 2 km² with a mean elevation of 1370 m a s l its highest point gampenkogel rises up to 1957 m a s l the discharge gauge installed in 2004 by the hydrographic service of tyrol is situated on the alluvial fan at the catchment s outlet 818 m a s l the catchment is part of the palaeozoic greywacke zone and is thus dominated by porphyroids as well as shales slightly metamorphic sand silt and claystones partly overlain by mesozoic dolomites nevertheless most of the soils are developed from unconsolidated quaternary deposits covering most of the bedrock such as till slope debris talus deposits fluvial and aeolian sediments depending on these parent materials in combination with vegetation type and water supply the following soil types can be found see figs 1 and 4 cambisols widespread on different unconsolidated parent materials podzols on deposits free from carbonates partly under coniferous forests and usually under draw shrub heath gleysols near the wider channels and in some areas dominated by slope water rendzic leptosols on dolomitic debris or bedrock regosols on carbonate silicate mixed loose material lithic leptosols on bedrock with different mineralogic compositions and histosols in wet depressions in terms of land use the catchment area is mainly characterized by cattle pastures 44 and forests 35 rock faces and talus slopes cover 14 and only small areas are used as hay meadows for settlements ski slopes and forest roads meißl et al 2017 the forests are dominated by conifers with spruce picea abies being the predominant tree species silver firs abies alba european larch larix decidua swiss stone pines pinus cembra mountain pines pinus mugo grey and green alders alnus incana alnus viridis occur in smaller proportions förster et al 2018 the mean annual precipitation sum at the precipitation gauge talkaser 1450 m a s l in the upper catchment is about 1550 mm 2010 2018 data provided by hydrographic service of tyrol being a small catchment 10 km² the brixenbach shows its strongest runoff reaction during local convective rainfall events when the cattle pastures produce high amounts of hortonian overland flow due to the topsoil compaction additionally the forested southeastern part of the catchment is characterised by shallow soils on less permeable silt and claystones producing subsurface stormflow meißl et al 2011 2017 fig 2 summarizes data used for this study as well as the processing steps which are described more in detail in the following sections 2 2 soil moisture measurements the soil moisture measurement network in the brixenbach catchment has been installed in july 2009 between 1000 and 1700 m a s l it consists of four pairs of sites thus eight sites altogether table 1 fig 1 fig 3 each of them equipped with three soil moisture sensors delta t thetaprobe ml2x and one soil temperature sensor skye skts 200 the thetaprobe is a frequency domain fd sensor using the impedance method at 100 hz the sensor accuracy is reported to be within 0 05 m³ m³ delta t devices 1999 according to the producers it could be improved to 0 01 m³ m³ by site specific sensor calibrations however due to the high gravel content and the small scale spatial variability of alpine soils it was not possible to enhance the accuracy by calibration all sensors have been installed 10 cm beneath soil surface within a perimeter of maximum 10 m aiming at understanding the soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil which are highly relevant for the runoff generation and capturing the local variability of soil moisture each site is equipped with a logger located in a plastic case in a soil hole covered by sods and or stones soil moisture is recorded at 1 h intervals from july to september and 2 h intervals from oktober to june logger maintenance and data readings have to be done on the spot the data used for this study comprise the time period from july 2009 to october 2018 six sites are situated on cattle pastures two of them west faced p1w p2w two east faced p1e p2e and two on relatively wet areas near the upper catchment borders p1h p2h two sites are located in the forest however due to timber harvesting f1 and mainly natural breakdown of the surrounding trees f2 both forest sites have developed more or less to clearing sites within the last years this leads to a reduction of the interception storage at both sites but the soil characteristics have remained more or less unchanged until now soil characteristics of the sites were recorded by soil profile description and laboratory analysis according to blume et al 2010 table 2 and fig 3 fig 4 shows the temporal data coverage of the soil moisture sensors due to the high gravel content of alpine soils installing the thetaprobes proved to be difficult in order to avoid biased measurement conditions with modified grain size distribution and bulk density by embedding the sensors in sieved soil material the sensors were pushed horizontally into the natural soil at p2h the rods of two sensors obviously did not get an adequate connection to the soil matrix and may have been situated in pores thus the data of two of the three sensors cannot be used at location p2e data has been recorded until 2014 when water intruding the logger caused technical problems as can be seen from fig 4 at p1e one sensor did not work from the beginning individual sensors at other sites stopped working later on except for the forest sites where all sensors are still working obviously cattle grazing increases the risk for sensor failures mainly because of cable damages the runoff time series are available from may 2004 to august 2016 as the trench regulating the torrent at the alluvial fan was completely rebuilt and widened between september 2016 and summer 2018 the runoff gauge had to be removed during the construction period in the course of quality control outliers in the long term soil moisture time series were identified and removed to describe the temporal concordance between the measurements of the sensors installed at the sites the synchronicity of the respective time series was calculated this is commonly done in dendrochronology to describe the agreement between individual tree ring series fritts 1976 schweingruber 1988 the synchronicity s xy compares the succession of the sign of the trend in each measurement interval increase or decrease of measured values in a time interval of two time series x and y the trend δ i of the interval i is computed from δ i x i 1 x i w h e n δ i 0 s i x 0 5 δ i 0 s i x 0 0 δ i 0 s i x 0 5 s xy is a relative value typically provided in percent and is derived from s x y 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 s i x s i y where n is the overlapping length of the two time series and s ix and s iy are the signs of the trend of the measurement interval i the synchronicity provides the relative proportion of cases where the interval trend s signs of both time series are similar i e synchronous schweingruber 1988 here the synchronicity returns the proportion of synchronic soil moisture increase or decrease for the multiple sensors installed at each site it can be used as an indicator showing if all sensors respond to wetting or drying in the same way likewise the mean soil moisture time series of each measurement site were compared based on their synchronicity for the calculation the dplr package bunn et al 2019 was used available for the r open source statistical software r core team 2019 2 3 analysis of precipitation data on the basis of the precipitation time series of the rainfall gauge talkaser provided with a temporal resolution of 15 min for the period from 07 2009 to 10 2018 rainfall events were identified based on the following criteria adopted for the characteristics of the study area in order to exclude winterly snowfall and springtime snowmelt events the analysis period was restricted to 1 may to 31 october of each year only events with a duration greater than or equal to half an hour at least two precipitation readings and a precipitation sum of at least 4 0 mm were considered rainfall events were separated if no precipitation was recorded for at least two hours precipitation readings of 0 1 mm 15 min and below were not included for each identified rainfall event the following parameters were extracted from the precipitation and runoff time series and the mean soil moisture time series of the 8 measurement sites rainfall duration h precipitation sum mm maximum precipitation intensity mm 15 min soil moisture at the rainfall onset vol maximum soil moisture occurring during the event or up to 4 h after the end of the rainfall event vol time lag between rainfall onset and soil moisture increase of at least 0 5 vol h peak runoff m³ s total runoff m³ see 2 4 in order to differentiate the rainfall events according to their characteristics they were clustered using a k means clustering algorithm hartigan and wong 1979 based on the precipitation sum mm rainfall duration h and maximum intensity mm 15 min 2 4 determination of the event runoff coefficients to estimate the total event runoff for a particular rainfall event the respective base flow component must be eliminated for the base flow separation a recursive digital filter rdf proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 was applied the filter of the form f t α f t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 allows to separate the quick runoff response f t from the original stream flow q t based on a selectable filter parameter α the rdf can be applied iteratively forward and reverse preventing distortions of the resulting data nathan and mcmahon 1990 identified the range of 0 90 to 0 95 for the filter parameter α to provide acceptable results for a study area in south eastern australia ladson et al 2013 compared modelled and measured base flow components concluding that using a value of 0 98 for the filter parameter α yields the best agreement for our data this value also led to the most plausible results following ladson et al 2013 the uncertainty of the modelled base flow was accounted for by systematically testing 100 filter parameter values centring around 0 98 0 005 1 standard deviation resulting in a range of 0 969 to 0 993 subsequently the event runoff qi was estimated by subtracting the median of the modelled base flow ensemble from the actual stream flow the upper and lower bound of the event runoff i e uncertainty of the modelled base flow component was considered by taking into account the 5 and 95 quantile of the modelled base flow the base flow separation was conducted with the ecohydrology package fuka et al 2018 available for the r open source statistical software r core team 2019 assuming homogeneous precipitation in space the event based runoff coefficient qci of event i was calculated from qci qi pi a where pi is precipitation sum of event i and a is the catchment area 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in order to capture the local variability of soil moisture each site has been equipped with three soil moisture sensors placed 10 cm beneath soil surface as expected these sensors show different medians and ranges fig 5 at five sites p2w p1e p2e p1h f1 two of the three sensors feature quite similar values with a clearly higher median for the third sensor except p1e where the third sensor did not work at the sites p1w and f2 all three sensors differ regarding the level of the median it cannot be ruled out that the different values are caused by an insufficient connection between single sensors and the surrounding soil matrix more likely they mirror the high local variability of soil characteristics which is typical especially for alpine soils the high relative relief induces gravitational and fluvial processes which are responsible for the high small scale variability of the topography resulting in different microclimates and the initial substrates for soil formation geitner et al 2011 in accordance with huza et al 2014 our results show that the within site variability is greater than the between site variability although the measurements of the three sensors at each site differ regarding the level of the absolute values they show a high synchronicity 0 83 fig 6 a that means the temporal course of the values is characteristic for the site thus for further analysis we used for each site the arithmetic means of the three sensors for all time steps see boxplots with black outlines in fig 5 regarding the temporal relationship of the soil moisture time series between the eight sites fig 6b shows the highest synchronicity 0 82 for the two west faced pasture sites p1w and p2w also the two east faced pasture sites p1e and p2e have highly synchronous soil moisture time series 0 81 a lower synchronicity results for the wet pasture site pair p1h and p2h 0 75 as well as for the forest site pair f1 and f2 0 76 the individual sites of these two pairs have differing aspects f2 shows the smallest synchronicity values with all other sites while f1 has been transformed into a clearing by forestry work quite soon after the installation of the sensors the reduction of forest canopy by natural forest degradation at f2 took longer so f2 is the only site in this study with more or less continuous forest conditions the effect of interception and the existence of a very loose humus rich forest soil may explain the smaller synchronicity with the other sites having a look at the sites characteristics we found the medians of the site sensor arithmetic means see boxplots with black outlines in fig 5 increase with the sites altitude fig 7 a for the pasture sites the regression of the medians of the soil moisture site sensor means depending on altitude has a coefficient of determination of 0 74 starting from a higher level also the forest sites show an increase of soil moisture with altitude only two sites thus no meaningful r² available the increase in soil moisture with increasing altitude can be explained by reduced evapotranspiration because of the decreasing air temperature additionally a comparison of the daily precipitation sums of the two precipitation gauges talkaser in the brixenbach catchment 1450 m a s l and am nachtsöllberg 995 m a s l about 2 km west of the western catchment border shows different gradients but in the majority of the cases the rainfall sum increases with altitude thus the sites at higher altitudes get more rainfall contrary to qiu et al 2001 penna et al 2011 and brocca et al 2007 our data showed no correlation between the soil moisture and the sites slope topographic index and upslope area according to the soil characteristics we found the sites soil moisture median decreasing with increasing gravel content r² 0 74 and bulk density r² 0 40 and increasing with increasing organic matter content r² 0 32 all values referring to the upper soil horizon until 10 cm depth fig 7 b d while increasing organic matter content leads to increased storage capacity of the soil increasing gravel content reduces the latter in general the soil hydrological impact of high gravel contents can have different effects on the one hand soils rich in stones are often more permeable and thus the can easier dry out on the other hand the incoming water amount is limited to less space of the soil matrix which could result in a higher water content of the remaining fine earth brakensiek and rawls 1994 cousin et al 2003 in our case the first impact seems to be more relevant increasing bulk density reduces infiltration capacity resulting in increased surface runoff and thus decreased soil moisture to investigate the spatial variability of the soil moisture values the spatial standard deviation is plotted as a function of the spatial mean of all eight sites in other studies the pattern of their interrelationship for catchments with different sizes and characteristics showed a convex shape for the topsoil which could be described by a third order polynomial function ryu and famiglietti 2005 teuling and troch 2005 choi and jacobs 2007 lawrence and hornberger 2007 rosenbaum et al 2012 this means soil moisture differs most between the sites for medium soil moisture values while during wet and dry phases all sites have similar soil moisture values similarly korres et al 2015 found negative relationships between the spatial soil moisture mean and the coefficient of variation implying lower spatial variability at higher mean soil moisture a different linear relationship was found by huza et al 2014 in a small 3 4 km² french catchment on basalt and limestone with pastures and vineyards and by de lannoy et al 2006 for the upper soil layer 10 cm in an intensively monitored corn field in maryland usa they observed a lower spatial variability during dry conditions and a higher one during wet conditions for the brixenbach catchment the picture is not so clear fig 8 a the first thing to notice is the strong scattering of the standard deviation values the time series of the above cited studies are much shorter between a few days and three years longer measurement periods may lead to stronger scattering of the standard deviations as there is some inter annual variability especially the standard deviation values in 2018 are markedly higher fig 8c in this year the highest annual mean temperature occurred in the region of interest within the observation period 2009 2018 station kitzbühel zamg 2018 the alternation of drying and wetting periods may explain the high median and variability of the standard deviations in this year despite of the scatter fig 8 shows that the soil moisture contents during rainfall periods grey dots are concentrated in the right hand side of the diagram as precipitation causes higher soil moisture values during rainless periods orange dots two different behaviours can be seen at mean soil moisture values 40 vol progressing drying leads to increasing spatial variability of the soil moisture contents in contrary above about 42 vol spatial mean progressing drying leads to decreasing spatial variability of the soil moisture contents furthermore shallow interflow which may occur at high soil moisture levels might support spatially homogeneous soil moisture conditions however this is very speculative regarding the course of the year the four west and east faced pasture sites show an increase of the soil moisture values at the beginning of the year the maximum is reached in march due to melting of the hibernal snow cover fig 9 a d subsequently soil moisture decreases until july which is the month with the soil moisture minimum and the largest interquartile range thus also the highest soil moisture variability a slight increase of soil moisture is recorded in autumn the four sites show a quite moderate fluctuation during the year on the contrary at p1h which is the highest located site at 1680 m a s l the most pronounced course of the year was recorded fig 9e additionally the site shows the highest soil moisture level among all eight sites it is situated near the upper ridge of the catchment at the scarp of a deep seated gravitational mass movement the podzol at p1h has a thick and biologically inactive humus layer and is overgrown by rhododendron ferrugineum and other shrubs fig 3 the site is very moist throughout the year which might be caused by the quaternary till covering this site in contradiction the soil moisture course of the year of the corresponding high elevation site p2h is very similar to the ones at the other pasture sites with the only difference that the soil moisture maximum is reached in april due to the combination of high altitude 1550 m a s l and the shading of southern catchment ridge fig 9f the forest sites show an even more damped course of the year due to the canopy which is responsible for rainfall interception and reduces evaporation by shading and wind shelter fig 9g h 3 2 reaction of soil moisture to rainfall events the soil moisture behaviour described in section 3 1 can be considered as long term characteristics of the brixenbach catchment on a shorter time scale soil moisture is strongly influenced by precipitation events thus we took a closer look on these wetting periods and analysed the reaction of soil moisture to rainfall events in total 547 rainfall events were extracted from 07 2009 to 10 2018 considering the period from the beginning of may to the end of october to prevent any hydrological effects of a snow cover clustering led to the differentiation into four types fig 10 c1 rainfall events with low precipitation sum short duration and low intensity unspecific rainfall events n 394 c2 rainfall events with medium precipitation sum medium duration and low intensity medium rainfall events n 93 c3 rainfall events with high precipitation sum long duration and low intensity larger advective rainfall events n 21 c4 rainfall events with medium precipitation sum short duration and high intensity short convective rainfall events thunder storms n 39 as fig 11 shows most of the events analysed are unspecific namely short events with low intensity cluster 1 fig 11a thus compared to their large number their precipitation sum is relatively low fig 11b the rainfall events with potentially severe consequences show either a high precipitation sum cluster 3 or a high maximum intensity cluster 4 despite their comparably rare occurrence fig 11a their fraction of the total precipitation sum is conversely high fig 11b as expected most of the convective rainfall events cluster 4 short duration high intensity occur in the summer months with a peak in august for each rainfall event we analysed the soil moisture increase in form of the difference between the maximum soil moisture and the soil moisture at the beginning of the event in vol as the events of the rainfall cluster 1 are characterised by small rainfall sums they usually cause low soil moisture increases fig 12 a the levels of soil moisture increase rise from cluster 2 fig 12b to 3 fig 12c the highest soil moisture increases occur in the course of rainfall events of cluster 3 larger advective rainfall events and cluster 4 short convective rainfall events fig 12d with the latter group showing a higher variability of soil moisture increase p1e reveals the largest soil moisture increase in all four clusters this site is situated on a long relatively planar slope shallow subsurface flow might lead to additional moisture supply f1 stands out because the median of the soil moisture increase values declines from cluster 3 to cluster 4 as the tree canopy of this site has successively been removed in the first years after the installation of the soil moisture sensors f1 has been covered by the typical dense successional vegetation of woodland clearings with high interception capacity which might be responsible for the smaller soil moisture increase during the short events of cluster 4 fig 13 shows the time span between the rainfall onset and the start of soil moisture increase according to the high rainfall intensity this reaction time is shortest for rainfall events of cluster 4 and reveals the smallest variability comparing the sites p1h and the two forest sites show longer reaction times at these three sites a thick humus layer may operate like a sponge and absorb the rainfall water first passing it on with delay 3 3 runoff reaction and antecedent soil moisture conditions 3 3 1 rainfall runoff events examples the runoff reaction of the brixenbach catchment is illustrated by means of four rainfall runoff events fig 14 the highest peak flow recorded by the runoff gauge occurred on 03 august 2014 fig 14c a short convective rainfall event rainfall event of cluster 4 with a maximum intensity of 15 mm 15 min a duration of one hour and a precipitation sum of 30 3 mm caused a peak flow of 17 5 m³ s the event was accompanied by hail jenner 2015 and resulted in intensive erosion processes and voluminous bedload transport destroying several torrent control structures and completely filling the retention basin at the top of the alluvial fan interestingly a few days before on 29 july 2014 another thunderstorm with similar intensity recorded at the rainfall gauge produced a peak flow of only 2 9 m³ s although the precipitation characteristics spatial distribution occurrence of hail are unknown and might had been different from the event on 03 august 2014 maybe the antecedent soil moisture also played an important role for the differing runoff responses between the two events during the seven days before the first event only three short convective rainfall events were recorded with a total rainfall sum of 41 1 mm after the first event advective rainfall filled the soil storage the 7 days antecedent rainfall sum was 196 5 mm for the second event even though our topsoil measurements do not show significant differences for the soil moisture content at precipitation begin fig 14c the storage capacities of the subsoil might had been exceeded before the second event the largest event in rainfall cluster 3 took place at increased topsoil antecedent soil moisture fig 14b between 01 and 03 june 2013 a rainfall event occured with a return period of 100 years for the 2 days to 4 days precipitation sum during a so called vb weather situation a low pressure area on the path from the adria to poland seibert et al 2007 it caused a significant peak flow at the runoff gauge brixenbach as well as a flood event with a return period of about 40 years in the river brixentaler ache the receiving stream of the brixenbach torrent and large inundations in neighboured catchments hydrographic service of tyrol 2013 on the contrary fig 14d displays another event of rainfall cluster 3 with also a quite high rainfall sum but low antecedent precipitation an exceptional event which however might occur more often in future belongs to rainfall cluster 2 fig 14a it is the rain on snow event of 10 october 2011 leading to catastrophic inundations in switzerland badoux et al 2013 and also causing significantly increased discharge further east from 08 to 09 october 2011 incoming cold air was responsible for a precipitation event with the snow fall line declining to about 800 m a s l a heavy rainfall on 10 october 2011 remobilised the stored water content by rapid melting of the snow cover 3 3 2 runoff coefficients in total 244 rainfall events caused a distinct increase of soil moisture 0 5 vol and a total event runoff of at least three cubic metres the calculated runoff coefficients range between 0 02 and 0 91 fig 15 blöschl et al 2004 analysed about 50 000 rainfall runoff events between 1981 and 2002 in 345 austrian catchments and found average runoff coefficients between 0 36 and 0 44 for the catchment of the river brixentaler ache receiving stream of the brixenbach torrent and neighboured catchments aschauer ache kelchsauer ache with catchment sizes between 134 and 377 km² no information on the variance of the runoff coefficients is given in their study comparing to the values of blöschl et al 2004 the runoff coefficients calculated for the brixenbach catchment in our study are mostly lower with an average of 0 11 this is probably due to the significantly shorter time series in our study containing few large events three events stand out runoff coefficient 0 66 although their runoff coefficient might be slightly overestimated due to the limitations of the hydrograph separation method they had exceptional event characteristics the largest runoff coefficient belongs to the june 2013 event described above fig 14b and the second largest to a heavy regional rainfall on 2 june 2010 produced by a continental low hydrographic service of tyrol 2010 rainfall cluster 3 the rain on snow event october 2011 fig 14a is responsible for the third largest runoff coefficient thus also the runoff coefficient outliers are explicable 3 3 3 soil moisture threshold for runoff reaction as also reported by other authors e g uber et al 2018 the correlation between soil moisture at rainfall beginning and runoff coefficient fig 15 is not very strong the result may to some part be associated with limitations of the precipitation measurement measurement errors lacking spatial representativeness of the singular gauge in the catchment by the choice of hydrograph separation method and by the fact that the antecedent soil moisture is just one among several factors influencing runoff reaction therefore minor runoff coefficients occur at low and high antecedent soil moisture contents however the scatterplot of fig 15 shows a noticeable arrangement of the dots adding the dashed lines we can graphically define a threshold value for soil moisture runoff coefficients above 0 23 were only recorded when the spatial mean of the soil moisture content was above 43 5 vol thus the brixenbach catchment shows a clear threshold behaviour with a threshold close to the one reported by penna et al 2011 in a southern alpine catchment 45 vol 0 30 cm depth at seven of the eight individual sites an individual threshold could be identified due to the differing soil moisture levels and soil characteristics of the sites also the threshold has different absolute values between 31 and 52 vol this range is nearly as large as the one found by mcmillan et al 2014 who identified thresholds between 27 vol and 58 vol in a 50 km² catchment in new zealand though they used subsoil measurements 60 cm this means if in situ measurements are used for deriving the threshold it has to be considered that the level of the soil moisture spatial mean is strongly dependent on the choice of the measurement sites due to the small scale variability of soil moisture content so in the same catchment different threshold values may be identified depending on the number and location of the measurement sites accordingly uber et al 2018 state that threshold values cannot be transferred to ungauged catchments e g in order to install a flood warning system if we assume that the maximum soil moisture content measured during the nine years measurement period is a fair approximation to the maximum natural water uptake the absolute soil moisture content at rainfall onset can be transferred into a relative value in the form of its proportion of the maximum soil moisture content its difference to 1 can be interpreted as saturation deficit the west and east faced pasture sites and the forest site f2 show a threshold at a relative soil moisture content of between 0 71 and 0 75 fig 16 the threshold at p1h is lower 0 65 for the forest site f1 it is slightly higher namely at 0 80 no threshold can be found for p2h the spatial mean of all eight sites reveals a threshold at a relative soil moisture of 0 72 and a saturation deficit of 0 28 respectively the influence of the antecedent soil moisture on the runoff reaction of the brixenbach catchment here clearly shown by the identified threshold was also detected with the aid of other methods in previous studies ruggenthaler et al 2016 conducted double ring infiltrometer measurements at different soil moisture conditions and found an increase of the amount of total infiltrated water with increasing soil moisture deficit for the east and west faced pasture sites while there in other words the infiltration decreased with increasing soil moisture no correlation was found at the upland sites p1h p2h as well as at the forest sites mayerhofer et al 2017 used sprinkling experiments on small 1 m² and large 50 80 m² plots to determine the surface runoff coefficient at short rainfall events with high intensity in the brixenbach valley the repetition of the experiments after a short break of about an hour helped to simulate very moist antecedent soil moisture conditions the pasture sites investigated for this study showed a clear increase of the surface runoff coefficient for increased antecedent soil moisture uber et al 2018 suggest a multivariate regression analysis to examine different controls on the runoff coefficient such as meteorological forcing and the antecedent soil moisture content at rainfall onset applying this for the brixenbach catchment the precipitation sum and the antecedent soil moisture spatial mean appear to be significant predictors while the maximum and mean precipitation intensity the precipitation duration the soil moisture spatial standard deviant and the increase of soil moisture during the event spatial mean do not show significant influence on the runoff coefficient however r² of the linear multivariate regression model is only 0 29 thus its explanatory power is limited 3 3 4 temporal sequence of soil moisture maximum and runoff peak during rainfall events of cluster 3 and 4 soil moisture mostly peaked before the event discharge fig 17 a while for rainfall events of cluster 1 and 2 this was only the case for 50 of the events and the other way round for the second half of the events the latter is also true for dry and medium initial soil moisture states however for those 25 of the events with the highest initial soil moisture discharge peaked before soil moisture fig 17b this can be explained as followed saturated conditions lead to a higher amount of fast surface flow which was also shown by sprinkling experiments in the catchment mayerhofer et al 2017 additionally the flow paths in the soil are already filled with water enabling a faster initiation of subsurface flow both leads to a faster development of peak discharge than at dryer conditions when the amount of the fast surface flow is smaller and water has to replace air in the flow paths first interestingly our results contradict those of penna et al 2011 who found the soil moisture peaks to occur prior to the streamflow peaks at wet conditions and the opposite behaviour at dry conditions they attributed streamflow during dry periods mainly to overland flow from the saturated riparian zone while streamflow during wet periods was considered to stem from hillslope subsurface flow with a lower flow velocity the difference might also result from the position of the soil moisture sensors while penna et al 2011 instrumented several transects from the riparian zone to the hillslopes in a relatively small area a few ares we tried to cover a 9 km² catchment with distributed sensors all of them situated at the hillslopes outside of the riparian zone as the soil moisture peak at hillslopes probably also at moist conditions occurs later than in the riparian zone soil moisture spatially averaged over hillslopes including riparian zones peaks earlier than soil moisture averages over hillslopes distant to streams only 4 conclusions the soil moisture measurement network in the typical eastern alpine torrent catchment of the brixenbach is one of the rare networks with a high spatial resolution and long measurement duration it consists of eight sites with three sensors 10 cm below soil surface continuously measuring the soil moisture content since july 2009 the analysis of the resulting data gives valuable insights into the precipitation runoff reaction of the catchment depending on the antecedent soil moisture content the following conclusions can be drawn the three sensors at each site show the small scale local variability of soil moisture in alpine soils at some sites their soil moisture levels differ significantly as the synchronicity of data of the three sensors is high the usage of a site mean value can be justified comparing the median of the site sensor means with the catchment characteristics our data showed no correlation between the soil moisture and the sites slope the topographic index and the specific upslope area for the pasture sites soil moisture showed a strong positive correlation with altitude this is also the case for the two forest sites on a higher level plotting spatial standard deviation of soil moisture versus spatial mean shows a high scatter of the standard deviations contrary to previous studies which analyse considerably shorter time series while the resulting plot often showed a convex shape implying the highest spatial variability of soil moisture at medium soil moisture contents we found that during rainless periods progressing drying leads to increasing spatial variability of the soil moisture contents at mean soil moisture values 40 vol on the contrary above about 42 vol spatial mean progressing drying leads to decreasing spatial variability of the soil moisture contents we analysed 547 rainfall runoff events divided into four clusters with different rainfall duration sum and intensity the most exceptional runoff events belong to cluster 3 high precipitation sum and long duration but low intensity and 4 rainfall events with medium precipitation sum short duration but high intensity 244 rainfall events caused a distinct increase of soil moisture 0 5 vol and a total event runoff of at least three cubic metres for these events the brixenbach catchment showed a clear threshold behaviour runoff coefficients above 0 23 only occurred when the soil moisture spatial mean of the eight sites overrun 43 5 vol regarding the singular sites this threshold is more or less clear but situated at different levels thus the level of the spatial mean strongly depends on the number and casual location of the sites used if we take a look at the relative soil moisture as proportion of the maximum soil moisture content of the site during the whole measurement period the threshold ranges between 0 65 and 0 80 with the sites mean of 0 72 which can be interpreted as saturation deficit of 0 28 at moist conditions event streamflow peaked prior to soil moisture which can be explained by increased surface flow volumes at higher soil moisture as well as already initialized subsurface flow paths the analyses of the long term soil moisture time series provide a valuable insight into the hydrological system of the brixenbach catchment and may help to identify critical conditions which may lead to floods in future credit authorship contribution statement gertraud meißl conceptualization data curation investigation

8354,study region kathmandu valley nepal study focus in the context of rapid urbanization in kathmandu valley kv this study quantifies spatial distribution of recharge and changes in drawdown under pumping rate and land use cover change scenarios both scenarios are incorporated in a groundwater flow model in modflow new hydrological insights for this region current groundwater recharge rate is spatially distributed across the basin in a range of 95 3 85 3 of precipitation in dry season and 48 38 of precipitation in wet season as per recharge area distributions this results in groundwater recharge of 1 052 mcm and 1 949 mcm in dry and wet seasons respectively in the case of increase in both pumping rate and encroachment of recharge areas due to land use cover change and only encroachment of recharge areas drawdown is projected to change respectively by 5 25 m in dry season and 7 39 m in wet season and 1 09 m in dry season and 3 63 m in wet season in 2050 the central urban northern foothills and southern parts are projected to observe more draw down meanwhile the boundary forest area has the potential to increase the water table in the future keywords groundwater kathmandu valley modflow recharge urbanization 1 introduction urbanization the process that increases population density as well as social changes in the area un desa 2018 is the result of both pull and push factors that encourage people to migrate those factors could be economic socio political environmental and cultural van hear et al 2018 by 2030 number of mega cities are expected to be 41 that will occupy only 2 of the world s land area but will accommodate more than half of the global population and consume 75 of the global resources nambiar et al 2018 urbanization may increase the global water and food demands by 30 and 60 respectively by 2050 boretti and rosa 2019 the rates of increase in water and food demands are higher in africa and asia nepal is among the 10 least urbanized countries in the world however it is among the top ten countries with highest rate of urbanization un desa 2018 kathmandu valley kv in central nepal is the most populated and rapidly growing urban areas in nepal that incorporates about 29 of urban population in the country moud 2017 the urbanization pattern can be observed in terms of increase in population density changes in land use cover lulc and change in urban facilities and environment lamichhane and shakya 2019a the kv has the population density of over 10 000 people sq km whereas the core city area has much higher than the average population density cbos 2011 for example the population densities of kathmandu lalitpur and bhaktapur cities are 19 726 people sq km 14 574 people sq km and 12 662 people sq km respectively similarly the rate of increase in population in the kv is more than two times more than that the national population growth rate cbos 2011 peri urban areas of the kv also have high population density of 4445 people sq km in an average which is expected to increase rapidly in the near future the water demand in kv has increased from 35 51 million liter per day mld in 1988 to 155 mld in 2000 320 mld in 2009 and 370 mld in 2015 due to increase in population thapa et al 2016b the kathmandu upatyaka khanepani limited kukl the water supply utility for the kv is supplying only 115 and 69 mld water in the wet and dry seasons respectively kukl 2015 meanwhile the deficit is being managed by the groundwater extraction through private wells water vendors and traditional water spouts thapa et al 2016a the deficit is increasing with urbanization and changing life style gautam and prajapati 2014 shrestha et al 2020 appropriate management of groundwater resources in the kv is crucial for ensuring water security in the area it requires elaborated understanding of groundwater storage and recharge potentials as well as optimal groundwater pumping rates government of nepal is implementing the melamchi water supply project mwsp to bring additional water from off the valley sources however due to delay in its completion even after the complication of the first and second phase of mwsp overall water security will not be achieved and therefore exploitation of the groundwater will continue ojha et al 2018 thapa et al 2018 udmale et al 2016 being the major source of water supply in the kv groundwater resources are under high pressure in the urban areas previous model based studies have shown that base flow and lateral flow of the river in the kv increase while increasing the groundwater recharge aryal et al 2017 bajracharya et al 2018 thapa et al 2017 groundwater reservoirs are technically feasible efficient environmentally friendly and economically viable alternatives to store surplus monsoon runoff for dry periods storage capacity mainly depends upon the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifers climatic conditions and land use cover type of the watershed the urbanization process transforms permeable land surfaces into impervious ones and changes regional hydrological characteristics of basin zhou et al 2013 various studies in the lulc change pattern in the kv indicated that the open land cultivated bush area open field and water body has decreased due to increase in built up area e g lamichhane and shakya 2019a similarly changes in projected lulc has shown that management of land water food and energy will be more crucial in future dahal et al 2019 lamichhane and shakya 2019a groundwater use is governed by various factors such as availability accessibility transportability and cost effectiveness reliable sources and affordable cost are the primary factors that prompt people to use the subsurface water shrestha et al 2016 groundwater storage and recharge indicate availability of groundwater resources studies have estimated groundwater recharge in kv at the range of 4 6 14 6 million cubic meters mcm per year pandey et al 2013 shrestha et al 2017 to maintain the natural recharge in the basin for future the areas with maximum recharge capacity are to be demarcated and protected the plain areas of the valley especially foothills are considered as the most suitable recharge areas however they are rapidly urbanizing kaliraj et al 2014 therefore it is important to identify other suitable pockets of recharge areas in the kv so that they can be protected for continuing groundwater recharge the groundwater pumping rate in the kv is six times greater than the recharge rate and it is declining the groundwater table approximately 2 5 m year and the scenario is predicted to be more prominent in the future shrestha 2009 overexploitation of groundwater has lowered the groundwater level by 13 33 m during 1980 2000 and 1 38 7 5 m during 2000 2008 pandey et al 2010 thapa et al 2019 found that the average rate of drawdown in the basin is 2 97 m due to rise in pumping rate pandey et al 2010 highlighted that anthropogenic activities are the main driving forces that pressurize the change in the groundwater environment shrestha et al 2020 revealed that groundwater in most of the core urban areas of the kv are more vulnerable in comparison with the peri urban areas due to rapidity of urbanization the groundwater system is overstressed due to lack of effective management of the resources such as over pumping population growth urbanization lulc change reduced recharge and the climate change foster and macdonald 2014 so by effective groundwater management within feasible limits economic and social benefits can be achieved through the knowledge of past and present performance of the groundwater system and behavior of the users cao et al 2005 when the extraction surpasses the availability of water it creates the shrinkage effect in the basin in terms of both quality and quantity boretti and rosa 2019 for the sustainable management and planning of the groundwater resources groundwater models play a significant role to satisfy the planning of demand and supply by maintaining groundwater hydrology refsgaard et al 2010 extensive research has been conducted in the field of groundwater modeling to balance the groundwater ecosystem in the changed context adhikari 2017 pandey and kazama 2014 shrestha et al 2020 zipper et al 2017 groundwater flow models are generally customized to suit the local conditions and phenomenon for producing results per the objectives modflow harbaugh 2005 is a numerical groundwater model which can simulate groundwater flow ground and surface water interaction solute transport and land subsidence among others after the release of free version of the modflow 2005 it is widely used in many basins worldwide adhikari 2017 loudyi 2005 shrestha et al 2020 zipper et al 2017 after the application of the gis tools for the generation of the input data storage and processing pre and post of the model modflow gained surprising momentum previous studies e g adhikari 2017 basnet 2016 considered uniform capacity and characteristics of recharge for the entire basin area of the kv similarly thapa et al 2019 also generated the surface recharge dynamics that varies between 16 46 mm year of the basin using the swat model however owing to spatial distribution of lulc some locations are likely to have more recharge capacities compared to others the encroachment of open areas or potential recharge areas further affects recharge dynamics and these aspects are not incorporated by previous studies for the kv owing to the distressing situation in groundwater due to urbanization present and future pumping rate with respect to population increase it is imperative to understand the variable recharge dynamics and its corresponding impacts in the drawdown in the kv this study therefore aims to identify spatial distribution of potential recharge rates in the kv and assess impacts of future changes i e lulc and pumping rates in groundwater level and corresponding drawdown in the area using modflow 2 study area kathmandu valley kv is headwater of the bagmati basin that covers the main city of the three districts kathmandu lalitpur and bhaktapur bagmati river located in central nepal between 27 32 13 and 27 49 10 n and 85 11 31 and 85 31 38 e fig 1 is the main drainage of the valley with the total watershed area of 613 km2 the kv is bowel shaped valley with flat land in the central part and mountainous terrains ranging from 1212 to 2722 m above the mean sea level in the periphery the outer periphery mountainous part of the valley is covered by forest peri urban areas comprise agricultural and built up areas and the core valley is comprised by built up areas only thapa et al 2017 the monthly average maximum and minimum temperature vary between 29 8 c to 3 4 c and the average humidity of the basin is 75 dhm 2015 weather of the kathmandu valley is mainly categorized into two periods one is dry september february and the other is wet march august and the average monthly maximum and minimum precipitation ranges from 4 2 mm in december to 402 1 mm in july the total average annual rainfall in the basin is 1533 mm yr and more than 80 of the total rainfall occurs during the monsoon period june september so the river has high variation in dry and wet flows and the runoff of the basin is drained through the tributaries of the basin bisnumati hanumante dhobi khola manohara balkhu and nakhhu the groundwater system of the kathmandu valley is considered as a closed and isolated groundwater basin with irregular and discontinuous aquifers kathmandu valley basin is filled with the quaternary fluvio lacustrine sediments having the maximum depth more than 600 m the central part of the basin comprises lower pleistocene lacustrine clays and gravels sediments regarded as the lukundol formation yoshida and igarashi 1984 the lukundol formation is overlain by a lignite member dongol 1985 which is in turn succeeded by thick black lacustrine clay unit locally known as the kalimati clay sakai 2001 the topmost layer of the groundwater basin is filled by the fluvio lacustrine terraces and fan deposits mostly sands and gravels of the patan gokarna itahiti and thimi formations sakai 2001 yoshida and igarashi 1984 the northern part of the basin is a delta deposit that contains mainly the coarse sediments see figs 2 and 3 a the groundwater system of kv is classified into three layers shallow aquifer aquitard and deep aquifer as reported by several researchers e g cresswell et al 2001 metcalf and eddy 2000 pandey et al 2010 japan international cooperation agency jica reported that the central kathmandu valley has a thick clay layer acting as aquitard in the basin jica 1990 groundwater basin of the valley is divided into three districts as shown in fig 3 b the northern groundwater district ndg 156 km2 is comprised by the gokarna and tokha geological formations having high recharge capacity meanwhile the central groundwater district cgd 114 km2 basin has the kalimati formation having thick clay aquitard layer leading to less recharge capacity the southern groundwater district sgd 56 km2 has the integrated combination of chapagaun lukundol alluvial fan deposit and the colluvium soil formation that have moderate recharge capacity previous studies also mark the same location as the potential groundwater recharge area as shown in fig 4 a and b e g jica 1990 lamichhane and shakya 2019a pandey et al 2013 hydraulic properties including horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities are the key components to calibrate a groundwater model the hydraulic properties for the kathmandu aquifer system are derived from previously published sources eg k c 2011 pandey and kazama 2011 the hydraulic conductivity of shallow aquifer ranges from 12 4 to 44 9 m day with an average of 23 7 m day the shallow aquifer has higher conductivity than deep aquifer the hydraulic conductivity of the deep aquifer is reported to be 0 3 8 8 m day with an average value of 4 5 m day the hydraulic conductivity of shallow aquifer is found to be five times higher than that of the deep aquifer the transmissivity of shallow aquifer varies from 163 2 1056 6 m2 day with an average of 609 9 m2 day whereas that for the deep aquifer varies from 22 6 to 737 m2 day with an average of 379 9 m2 day the transmissivity of shallow aquifer is found to be 1 6 times higher than that of the deep aquifer the storage coefficient of the shallow aquifer is almost constant 0 2 throughout the study area the storage coefficient of the deep aquifer varies from 0 00023 to 0 07 3 data and methods effects of urbanization in the groundwater aquifers can be reflected in the form of increase in groundwater pumping and decrease in recharge areas to assess this groundwater model for the kv was developed using modflow 2005 engine and simulations were performed under the scenarios of change in pumping rate and lulc from the base year map and future potential recharge map the future encroachments of potential recharge area were accounted for recharge estimation using gis tool the effects on groundwater table due to reduction of the recharge capacity and increment in the pumping rate were evaluated by coupling decadal potential recharge map with lulc change in the calibrated and validated groundwater flows model in modflow environment future pumping rates were calculated based on population growth rate and the current demand the decadal pumping rate was simulated using the population growth rate the overall methodological framework is demonstrated in fig 5 3 1 groundwater flow modeling 3 1 1 model description groundwater flow model was set up in the modflow 2005 environment which is widely used due to its simplicity in understanding modification use and enhancement of the output from the groundwater simulation the model is fortran 90 based programming language subdivided into packages for the groundwater flow process american institute national standards 1992 the entire package solves the groundwater flow process using three dimensional finite difference equations the operating partial differential equation is described in the principle of mass balance in the movement of groundwater under constant density through the porous material as depicted by eq 1 which describes groundwater flow under non equilibrium conditions in a heterogeneous medium harbaugh 2005 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z axes that are assumed to be parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity l t h is hydraulic head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources sinks of water w 0 0 for flow out of the groundwater system and w 0 0 for flow into the system t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 and t is time t in general ss kxx kyy and kzz are the functions of space and w is the function of space and time the head and flow magnitudes from the equation vary in all three directions x y and z to solve the equation with respect to space and time the initial steady and unsteady state and boundary conditions specific head specific flow and head dependent flow must exist and the solution is not simple so the finite difference method is used for solving such numerical problems by a finite set of discrete points in space and time with the assumption that each discrete block is rectangular in both horizontal and vertical directions in the steady state there is no change in storage within the basin which leads the right hand side of the equation to be zero the details of the model can be found in elsewhere see harbaugh 2005 groundwater flow computer program has gotten a high capability to solve the hydrological problems by solving the different codes as per the hydrological problems such codes are called the packages the selection of packages is based on what type of problem the modeler wants to solve and which solver package gets the better results after simulation basnet 2016 loudyi 2005 shrestha et al 2020 3 1 2 model set up the kv watershed boundary with an area of 613 km2 as shown in fig 1 is considered as the modeling domain entire modeling domain is divided into three vertical layers viz shallow aquifer aquitard and deep aquifer each layer is assumed as one vertical block in the model depth to each layer is assigned based on the recommendations by pandey and kazama 2011 the modeling domain in horizontal plane is discretized into 500 m 500 m grid cell having the unique surface and subsurface characteristics which results a total of 62 rows and the 66 columns to cover the entire modeling domain the object layers ground surface shallow aquifer layer aquitard deep aquifer initial water level hydraulic conductivity river reach recharge pumping well observation well etc are set up for the initial input to the model the active and passive grids are assigned through the object layers the recharge in the basin is assigned in terms of fraction of precipitation the stress period simulation is conducted through the head observation hob river riv recharge rch unsaturated zone flow uzf and well wel package in the modflow nwt model the initial values of hydraulic conductivity for each subsurface layer are taken from study by pandey et al 2010 the present and the future recharge areas and their capacities are taken from the study by lamichhane and shakya 2019a pumping rate in each grid cell is obtained from the surface hydrological analysis of the basin performed by adhikari 2017 the hydro geological properties hydraulic conductivity of sub surface layers and river reach and recharge factor are estimated through model calibration 3 1 3 model calibration and validation the groundwater flow model was calibrated against observed groundwater level data from 41 monitoring wells see fig 1 in 2016 the dry season october to march data was used for model calibration and wet season april to september data for validation the model was calibrated by minimizing the error between observed and simulated heads at the observation wells in the steady state condition calibration was performed manually and performance was evaluated based on statistical indicators such as root mean square rms nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 mean error me moriasi et al 2007 and mean absolute error mae moriasi et al 2007 multiple indicators as well as scatter plots were also used to evaluate the model performance because indicators like nse and pbias may show good performance even when model outputs are not reasonably good as indicated in literature adhikari 2017 aghlmand and abbasi 2019 3 2 development of spatially distributed recharge rate map the spatial variation in lulc change and soil characteristics affect the present and future recharge capacities the maximum recharge capacity in each grid cell can be obtained by the field test or the theoretical potential recharge technique the theoretical potential recharge capacity defined as the maximum recharge capacity of the soil without any obstruction is the unitless or non dimensional value that can be updated with field data average deviation factor or adjustment factor af between observed and simulated infiltration value from theoretical method is obtained by the simple mean deviation factor as per eq 2 2 a f 1 n k 1 n r f k r t k where r f k r t k and n refer the field test recharge capacity value theoretical recharge capacity and number of field test respectively the unique value of the af represents the perfect evaluation of recharge infiltration capacity between the field and theoretical process if the value of af is greater than one it signifies under estimation from the theoretical method and less than one means over estimation theoretically generated recharge map of the modelling domain was compared with the field test data map the unitless grid recharge was converted into the field recharge as shown in eq 3 3 r i r t i a f where r i and r t i represent the adjusted recharge capacity and theoretical recharge capacity of the soil in grid cell i respectively we developed an equation to express the groundwater recharge capacity as a fraction of precipitation which depends up on the seasonal variability the maximum recharge capacity of each grid value was standardized based on normalization technique as shown in eq 4 4 r v i n p i n α n m i n r i n r m i n n r m a x n r m i n n α n m a x α n m i n where r v i n p i n α n m a x α n m i n r i n r m i n n and r m a x n represent the actual recharge from the grid i in n year seasons months precipitation maximum permissible limit factor minimum permissible limit factor adjusted recharge capacity in the grid i in n year seasons months minimum recharge capacity value in the n year seasons months and minimum recharge capacity value in the n year seasons months respectively the grid precipitation was calculated from the observed precipitation data and recharge capacity in each grid was calculated from eq 4 the maximum and minimum recharge values i e rmax and rmin were taken from lamichhane and shakya 2019a the spatially distributed precipitation map was prepared based on station based precipitation data in the study domain the calibrated parameters of recharge minimum and maximum factors the recharge capacity and the spatially distributed precipitation of each grid cell values were used to generate the actual recharge depth in spatial raster map or the object the obtained object is used as the recharge input parameter for simulation 3 3 future scenarios considered for future projection the decadal analysis was conducted for both seasons two future scenarios considered are i increased pumping rate based on the rate of increase in population due to future urbanization and ii change in both pumping rate and lulc recharge area change the gap between the two scenarios is estimated as the impact of only lulc change 3 3 1 pumping rate scenario the pumping of groundwater from unconfined shallow aquifer is increasing rapidly at the household level there are no actual records of such pumping and neither much is known about its future due to the lack of database shallow water pumping rate is analyzed by the water balance equation in surface hydrology from the rainfall runoff model as per eqs 5 6 and 7 adhikari 2017 5 δ h w h i n h s i n k h l a t f l o w h p u m p 6 δ h w δ h s a

change in depth total infiltration depth deep aquifer recharge depth of water lateral flow water depth shallow water pumping depth and change in groundwater table depth in each cell respectively the rate of change in the water demand is calculated as the product of linear population growth rate and the per capita demand with the base pumping the base shallow aquifer pumping rate was taken from the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model outputs as per the eqs 5 to 7 and the projection rate is taken based on the population growth rate scenarios as reported by adhikari 2017 future pumping scenario is taken by using three growth rates 1 for the areas with greater pumping rate and developed areas 100 m3 day 1 5 for newly developing areas pumping rate between 50 to 100 m3 day and 3 pumping rate less than the 50 m3 day for the areas in the peripheral parts of the valley 3 3 2 lulc change scenario encroachments of the potential recharge areas and their impacts to the surface runoff and recharge were taken from previous studies e g lamichhane and shakya 2019a 2019b previous studies highlighted that 6 3 99 km2 of the rechargeable areas would be converted to the impermeable surface due to growth of the physical infrastructures the simulated annual average and minimum river runoff from the model including the lulc change resulted the average increment of 1 3 and decrement of 3 45 per year respectively the groundwater recharge is projected to decrease by 2 in every decade in the groundwater basin lamichhane and shakya 2019a delineated the potential groundwater recharge area and the projection of the future scenario as per the urbanization pattern the main principle of the scenario is that the recharge tendency in each grid will vary with the lulc change the surface recharge capacity will decrease with the changed context due to urbanization so recharge depth of the cell is the function of the precipitation and the potential groundwater recharge map of the basin the maximum recharge capacity of the cell was estimated through model calibration process the spatially distributed raster or object outputs for spatially distributed recharge obtained from the analysis are assigned in the model for the future analysis 3 4 assessment of the impacts of future scenarios on drawdown due to projected changes in lulc and pumping rates drawdown or depth of groundwater table from ground surface is also expected to change both spatially and temporally increase in pumping rate and encroachment of potential recharge areas are likely to increase drawdown in the future under both scenarios changes in drawdown and its spatial distribution are estimated by subtracting future drawdown from baseline drawdown the outputs are presented in the form of geo spatial maps and tables 3 5 data and sources both geo spatial and temporal data such as bio physical climate socio economic hydrological hydrogeological water supply and gw pumping were collected from various sources and are listed in table 1 3 6 limitations projected future groundwater level variation in the changed context is quantified by using the universal groundwater model modflow the complex phenomenon of the aquifer is represented through the simple water balance of the groundwater due to the lack of observed data only one seasonal data is used for calibration and validation of the model for the better understanding transient model simulation provides the temporal response of the hydraulic head but due to the lack of data availability simple steady state condition is used in this study in addition the aquifer hydro geological characteristics are taken from previous studies jica 1990 k c 2011 pandey et al 2010 which may be eventually replaced by field measurements for better results similarly river information slope width hydraulic conductivity recharge dynamics etc was taken from previous studies adhikari 2017 basnet 2016 thapa et al 2019 which could be improved with the field measurements for precise results for the collection of actual field shallow groundwater extraction data is more time consuming costly and tedious so the base year pumping rate is calculated using the rainfall runoff model thus experimental database may be considered for more representative results 4 results and discussions 4 1 groundwater model performance groundwater flow model was calibrated against the observed groundwater level well data developed by working group wg 2 of wash mia satreps project the model was calibrated in two stages at the first stage hydraulic conductance of sub surface layers and rivers and the recharge factor was calibrated to the extent of reasonable performance it gave that recharge factor for the dry and wet periods as 91 and 41 of the precipitation respectively based on the recharge depth of each grid cells corresponding recharge volumes for dry and wet seasons were calculated as 1 07 and 1 91 million cubic meters mcm respectively at the second stage keeping almost same volume of recharge in both seasons recharge depth was varied across the grid cells based on recharge capacity of different lulc types using eq 4 since recharge volume was kept constant and all other parameters were unchanged from the first stage the model performance was almost same as in the first stage the model performance statistics of the calibrated and validated models are shown in table 2 and residual and scatter plots are presented in fig 6 the model performance indicators table 2 and residual and scatter plots fig 6 indicate that the model performance in reasonably good for further analysis in the residual head plot except some wells like dry w39 and wet w47 w39 and w8 most of the wells depicted comparable heads in the case of simulated and observed scenarios hydraulic properties of the aquifer and the river system were found to be more sensitive meanwhile the recharge value influenced the overall water balance of basin model calibration was performed manually using trial and error approach and variation of the groundwater levels were quantified for the base year simulation the wells at northern and central parts performed relatively better compared to the wells from eastern and western parts the zero value of the me mae and rmse indicates the absolute performance of model and the minimum values of the indexes lead to better results the nominal values of mae and rmse table 2 indicate that the performance in the model is quite good and can be used for analysis of drawdown under various scenarios final values of calibrated parameters are reported in table 3 the hydraulic head and its drawdown due to pumping are varied with the hydraulic properties of layers riverbeds and the recharge volume of the basin high value means the high recharge and less drawdown 4 2 spatial distribution of groundwater recharge the recharge rates and their spatial distribution were estimated through calibration of groundwater flow model the recharge depths for dry period fig 7 a and wet period fig 7b vary from 1 22 to 2 19 mm and 2 22 3 76 mm respectively as expected its spatial distribution corresponds to precipitation distribution and the northern part of the model domain has higher recharge depth compared to the southern part at the second stage maintaining the recharge volume more or less equal to the first stage the recharge rates were distributed spatially across the grid cell as per eq 4 and corresponding depth of recharge mm were estimated for each cell the model performance at this stage was considered as acceptable and therefore recharge rates corresponding to this calibration are reported as recharge depths across the grid cells in dry and wet seasons at this stage recharge volume or depth is the function of precipitation as well as lulc of the grid cell the results for dry and wet seasons are depicted in figs 8 and 9 respectively the recharge depth in each grid cell was found with spatially distributed precipitation and recharge factor by the eq 4 from the fig 7 a and b the northern part of the valley has high tendency to precipitation whereas other parts have moderate tendency similarly the northern and eastern part of the valley have also high potential recharge area but the south east part has less precipitation however it has greater open and forest areas so it contributes to significant recharge in 2020 recharge depth varies from 1 14 to 2 22 mm in dry season fig 8a and 2 25 4 09 mm in wet season fig 8b during this period the total volumes of recharge in dry and wet seasons are found as 1 052 and 1 949 mcm respectively table 4 due to precipitation characteristics of the basin in the wet season more than 75 of precipitation is occurred in wet season only more volume was recharged compared to the dry season in the dry season the recharge tendency is high due to low intensity frequency and duration of precipitation and dry surface condition compare to the wet season in the 2050 the land use and recharge area change would affect the recharge tendency of the grid cells significantly the recharge depth variation across the grids is 1 13 2 22 mm in the dry season fig 9a and 2 25 4 09 mm in the wet season fig 9b volumes of recharge in dry and wet seasons are estimated to be 1 048 and 1 947 mcm respectively table 4 the maximum and average recharge depth variation from 2020 to 2050 across the grid cells are estimated as 0 033 and 0 006 mm respectively for the dry season and 0 100 and 0 003 respectively for the wet season such variation creates the change in recharge volume during the period with the changed context at least 6 open area in each decade would be encroached by urbanization lamichhane and shakya 2019a which generates the significant impact in the river runoff as well as recharge at different locations lamichhane and shakya 2019b as shown in figs 8 and 9 the northern and north eastern part of the valley are potential recharge areas that would be encroached by urbanization in the future and therefore the recharge depth or volume will be affected notably the nature of recharge variation in the dry and wet is more or less same however projected changes in recharge volume are likely to get affected due to projected changes in future precipitation from climate change which is not considered in this study 4 3 impacts of future scenarios on gw drawdown 4 3 1 drawdown due to pumping dynamics though pumping rates for 258 deep wells in the valley were available and are used in the model calibration data of pumping from shallow aquifer is not available to this end theoretical water balance techniques are adopted to calculate the shallow pumping rate in which the change in storage of the basin was considered for the shallow pumping value as done by adhikari 2017 pumping volume and rate were distributed in each grid value with reference to the population density simulated hydraulic head after model calibration and assigned pumping rates are shown in fig 10 it is assumed that the pumping well is in the center of gravity of the cell and effect is equally distributed throughout the average annual pumping rates were considered to vary spatially at the rates of 1 1 5 and 3 for the locations with pumping rates greater than 100 m3 day 100 to 50 m3 day and less than 50 m3 day respectively as suggested by adhikari 2017 future groundwater scenarios were developed at decadal scale i e 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 considering increase in pumping rates as per population growth rate and keeping other conditions climatic geological land use land cover etc constant results depicted in fig 11 indicate that the hydraulic head changes from 2020 to 2050 within the modeling domain for dry as well as wet seasons in observation wells the head in the dry season goes down due to peak pumping and again recovers during the wet season for the simulation period the wet season drawdown was higher than the dry season similar output was also reported by other studies e g thapa et al 2019 in certain pocket areas where the aquitard is exposed with high pumping rate or less hydraulic conductivity the drawdown was rapid in the dry season excess rainfall in the wet season raised the groundwater level to the surface and such large variation in groundwater level during wet and dry seasons was prominent in pocket areas mostly the outer part of the valley has less pumping rate and moderate recharge capacity however the groundwater table was still the same but in the semi urban areas and the core areas of the valley the level declined significantly as shown in fig 11 the observation wells located at the central and northern parts have significant changes due to high pumping rate high potential recharge areas and good transmissivity characteristics of the sub soil 4 3 2 drawdown due to both pumping rate and lulc change the pumping rate change scenario incorporates the groundwater condition with respect to population growth and water demand of the basin the effects of urbanization or population growth in the basin change the lulc as well as the recharge condition encroachment of the open land or rechargeable area will affect the recharge volume of sub surface water recharge capacity of the surface was quantified as the product of rainfall recharge area map of respective decades figs 7 and 8 and recharge properties of that area with eq 4 results of change in drawdown during 2020 and 2050 for both increase in pumping rate and lulc change are shown in fig 12 it is clearly observed that the outermost part of the valley which has forest and agricultural open land cover together with less pumping rate contributes in stabilization of water table in both seasons and scenarios at the observation wells in the core and peri urban areas the groundwater level was rapidly declining for both pumping scenarios the dry pocket area from the grid cell was increased more in the dry season compared to the wet season the rate of drawdown in the wet season was quite higher than the dry season but the bottom level of the elevation in dry season was low upper hilly part of the valley has forest cover thus the elevation of water table at its foothill is quite similar but in the core areas and the northern foothills the drawdown was quite high less recharge and high pumping rate may cause extensive drawdown in the future and may lead to other secondary effects the difference in the results of two scenarios figs 11 and 12 are considered as the changes in drawdown due to only lulc change the results of all the scenarios are tabulated in table 5 for comparative analysis the data for the extreme dry pocket area was excluded in the analysis the results highlight that high drawdown locations are mostly the peri urban and core urban areas the maximum water head declination in the basin in dry season in three scenarios only pumping both pumping and lulc and only lulc change were 162 33 175 00 and 36 33 mm year respectively similarly for wet season the maximum water head declination was 111 33 106 03 and 86 83 mm year respectively for only pumping both pumping and lulc and only lulc change this highlights that the water table declination in dry season is more than the wet season similarly the average variation of the water table throughout the basin during dry and wet periods for only pumping both pumping and lulc and only lulc change were 1 33 and 5 5 mm year 2 5 and 8 82 mm year and 1 and 3 66 mm year respectively the results highlight that lucl change has significant effect on the groundwater for the kathmandu valley variation of the water table in both seasons and scenarios creates the voids in the bottom layer that may cause land subsidence in the core valley as well the haphazard urbanization in the valley led to the synergetic effects on the groundwater depletion due to population growth and encroachments of recharge areas or lulc change 5 conclusion in the context of population growth urbanization and subsequent increase in pumping rates and decrease in recharge areas this study adopted model based approach to identify spatial distribution of potential recharge rates and assess the impacts of future changes in groundwater level and drawdown in the kathmandu valley pumping rate increase due to increase in the population and lulc change and pumping rate increase due to urbanization and increase in population are considered as two analysis scenarios the groundwater flow model was developed in modflow environment the model was calibrated and validated with observed groundwater data in 2016 the key conclusions of the study are as follows recharge rates for the grids covering the entire kv watershed ranges between 95 35 85 34 of precipitation for dry season and 48 to 38 of precipitation in the wet season corresponding recharge depths in 2020 varies in a range of 1 14 2 22 mm in the dry season and 2 25 4 09 mm in the wet season that results in total groundwater recharge of 1 052 mcm and 1 949 mcm in the dry and wet seasons respectively the northern parts of kv have relatively more recharge potential compared to the southern parts between 2020 and 2050 the recharge volume in both seasons is projected to decrease considering change in pumping rates due to population growth change in simulated drawdown during 2020 and 2050 varies widely within the study area high drawdown is located at the foothills of northern and southern parts of the valley the projected changes in maximum drawdown are 4 27 m and 3 34 m in the dry and wet seasons respectively the changes in average drawdown are 0 04 m and 0 16 m in the dry and wet seasons respectively in the case of change in both pumping rate and lulc and corresponding change in recharge areas change in simulated maximum and average drawdown during 2020 and 2050 are 5 25 and 0 07 m for the dry season and 7 34 to 0 26 m for the wet season the lulc change contributes 1 09 and 3 63 m drawn respectively in the dry and wet seasons the maximum change in drawdown is located at the foothills of northern and northeast parts of the valley the results of this study quantify the spatial distribution of recharge rate and depth impact of recharge area encroachment and increase in pumping rate in groundwater level and drawdown are useful in planning

8354,study region kathmandu valley nepal study focus in the context of rapid urbanization in kathmandu valley kv this study quantifies spatial distribution of recharge and changes in drawdown under pumping rate and land use cover change scenarios both scenarios are incorporated in a groundwater flow model in modflow new hydrological insights for this region current groundwater recharge rate is spatially distributed across the basin in a range of 95 3 85 3 of precipitation in dry season and 48 38 of precipitation in wet season as per recharge area distributions this results in groundwater recharge of 1 052 mcm and 1 949 mcm in dry and wet seasons respectively in the case of increase in both pumping rate and encroachment of recharge areas due to land use cover change and only encroachment of recharge areas drawdown is projected to change respectively by 5 25 m in dry season and 7 39 m in wet season and 1 09 m in dry season and 3 63 m in wet season in 2050 the central urban northern foothills and southern parts are projected to observe more draw down meanwhile the boundary forest area has the potential to increase the water table in the future keywords groundwater kathmandu valley modflow recharge urbanization 1 introduction urbanization the process that increases population density as well as social changes in the area un desa 2018 is the result of both pull and push factors that encourage people to migrate those factors could be economic socio political environmental and cultural van hear et al 2018 by 2030 number of mega cities are expected to be 41 that will occupy only 2 of the world s land area but will accommodate more than half of the global population and consume 75 of the global resources nambiar et al 2018 urbanization may increase the global water and food demands by 30 and 60 respectively by 2050 boretti and rosa 2019 the rates of increase in water and food demands are higher in africa and asia nepal is among the 10 least urbanized countries in the world however it is among the top ten countries with highest rate of urbanization un desa 2018 kathmandu valley kv in central nepal is the most populated and rapidly growing urban areas in nepal that incorporates about 29 of urban population in the country moud 2017 the urbanization pattern can be observed in terms of increase in population density changes in land use cover lulc and change in urban facilities and environment lamichhane and shakya 2019a the kv has the population density of over 10 000 people sq km whereas the core city area has much higher than the average population density cbos 2011 for example the population densities of kathmandu lalitpur and bhaktapur cities are 19 726 people sq km 14 574 people sq km and 12 662 people sq km respectively similarly the rate of increase in population in the kv is more than two times more than that the national population growth rate cbos 2011 peri urban areas of the kv also have high population density of 4445 people sq km in an average which is expected to increase rapidly in the near future the water demand in kv has increased from 35 51 million liter per day mld in 1988 to 155 mld in 2000 320 mld in 2009 and 370 mld in 2015 due to increase in population thapa et al 2016b the kathmandu upatyaka khanepani limited kukl the water supply utility for the kv is supplying only 115 and 69 mld water in the wet and dry seasons respectively kukl 2015 meanwhile the deficit is being managed by the groundwater extraction through private wells water vendors and traditional water spouts thapa et al 2016a the deficit is increasing with urbanization and changing life style gautam and prajapati 2014 shrestha et al 2020 appropriate management of groundwater resources in the kv is crucial for ensuring water security in the area it requires elaborated understanding of groundwater storage and recharge potentials as well as optimal groundwater pumping rates government of nepal is implementing the melamchi water supply project mwsp to bring additional water from off the valley sources however due to delay in its completion even after the complication of the first and second phase of mwsp overall water security will not be achieved and therefore exploitation of the groundwater will continue ojha et al 2018 thapa et al 2018 udmale et al 2016 being the major source of water supply in the kv groundwater resources are under high pressure in the urban areas previous model based studies have shown that base flow and lateral flow of the river in the kv increase while increasing the groundwater recharge aryal et al 2017 bajracharya et al 2018 thapa et al 2017 groundwater reservoirs are technically feasible efficient environmentally friendly and economically viable alternatives to store surplus monsoon runoff for dry periods storage capacity mainly depends upon the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifers climatic conditions and land use cover type of the watershed the urbanization process transforms permeable land surfaces into impervious ones and changes regional hydrological characteristics of basin zhou et al 2013 various studies in the lulc change pattern in the kv indicated that the open land cultivated bush area open field and water body has decreased due to increase in built up area e g lamichhane and shakya 2019a similarly changes in projected lulc has shown that management of land water food and energy will be more crucial in future dahal et al 2019 lamichhane and shakya 2019a groundwater use is governed by various factors such as availability accessibility transportability and cost effectiveness reliable sources and affordable cost are the primary factors that prompt people to use the subsurface water shrestha et al 2016 groundwater storage and recharge indicate availability of groundwater resources studies have estimated groundwater recharge in kv at the range of 4 6 14 6 million cubic meters mcm per year pandey et al 2013 shrestha et al 2017 to maintain the natural recharge in the basin for future the areas with maximum recharge capacity are to be demarcated and protected the plain areas of the valley especially foothills are considered as the most suitable recharge areas however they are rapidly urbanizing kaliraj et al 2014 therefore it is important to identify other suitable pockets of recharge areas in the kv so that they can be protected for continuing groundwater recharge the groundwater pumping rate in the kv is six times greater than the recharge rate and it is declining the groundwater table approximately 2 5 m year and the scenario is predicted to be more prominent in the future shrestha 2009 overexploitation of groundwater has lowered the groundwater level by 13 33 m during 1980 2000 and 1 38 7 5 m during 2000 2008 pandey et al 2010 thapa et al 2019 found that the average rate of drawdown in the basin is 2 97 m due to rise in pumping rate pandey et al 2010 highlighted that anthropogenic activities are the main driving forces that pressurize the change in the groundwater environment shrestha et al 2020 revealed that groundwater in most of the core urban areas of the kv are more vulnerable in comparison with the peri urban areas due to rapidity of urbanization the groundwater system is overstressed due to lack of effective management of the resources such as over pumping population growth urbanization lulc change reduced recharge and the climate change foster and macdonald 2014 so by effective groundwater management within feasible limits economic and social benefits can be achieved through the knowledge of past and present performance of the groundwater system and behavior of the users cao et al 2005 when the extraction surpasses the availability of water it creates the shrinkage effect in the basin in terms of both quality and quantity boretti and rosa 2019 for the sustainable management and planning of the groundwater resources groundwater models play a significant role to satisfy the planning of demand and supply by maintaining groundwater hydrology refsgaard et al 2010 extensive research has been conducted in the field of groundwater modeling to balance the groundwater ecosystem in the changed context adhikari 2017 pandey and kazama 2014 shrestha et al 2020 zipper et al 2017 groundwater flow models are generally customized to suit the local conditions and phenomenon for producing results per the objectives modflow harbaugh 2005 is a numerical groundwater model which can simulate groundwater flow ground and surface water interaction solute transport and land subsidence among others after the release of free version of the modflow 2005 it is widely used in many basins worldwide adhikari 2017 loudyi 2005 shrestha et al 2020 zipper et al 2017 after the application of the gis tools for the generation of the input data storage and processing pre and post of the model modflow gained surprising momentum previous studies e g adhikari 2017 basnet 2016 considered uniform capacity and characteristics of recharge for the entire basin area of the kv similarly thapa et al 2019 also generated the surface recharge dynamics that varies between 16 46 mm year of the basin using the swat model however owing to spatial distribution of lulc some locations are likely to have more recharge capacities compared to others the encroachment of open areas or potential recharge areas further affects recharge dynamics and these aspects are not incorporated by previous studies for the kv owing to the distressing situation in groundwater due to urbanization present and future pumping rate with respect to population increase it is imperative to understand the variable recharge dynamics and its corresponding impacts in the drawdown in the kv this study therefore aims to identify spatial distribution of potential recharge rates in the kv and assess impacts of future changes i e lulc and pumping rates in groundwater level and corresponding drawdown in the area using modflow 2 study area kathmandu valley kv is headwater of the bagmati basin that covers the main city of the three districts kathmandu lalitpur and bhaktapur bagmati river located in central nepal between 27 32 13 and 27 49 10 n and 85 11 31 and 85 31 38 e fig 1 is the main drainage of the valley with the total watershed area of 613 km2 the kv is bowel shaped valley with flat land in the central part and mountainous terrains ranging from 1212 to 2722 m above the mean sea level in the periphery the outer periphery mountainous part of the valley is covered by forest peri urban areas comprise agricultural and built up areas and the core valley is comprised by built up areas only thapa et al 2017 the monthly average maximum and minimum temperature vary between 29 8 c to 3 4 c and the average humidity of the basin is 75 dhm 2015 weather of the kathmandu valley is mainly categorized into two periods one is dry september february and the other is wet march august and the average monthly maximum and minimum precipitation ranges from 4 2 mm in december to 402 1 mm in july the total average annual rainfall in the basin is 1533 mm yr and more than 80 of the total rainfall occurs during the monsoon period june september so the river has high variation in dry and wet flows and the runoff of the basin is drained through the tributaries of the basin bisnumati hanumante dhobi khola manohara balkhu and nakhhu the groundwater system of the kathmandu valley is considered as a closed and isolated groundwater basin with irregular and discontinuous aquifers kathmandu valley basin is filled with the quaternary fluvio lacustrine sediments having the maximum depth more than 600 m the central part of the basin comprises lower pleistocene lacustrine clays and gravels sediments regarded as the lukundol formation yoshida and igarashi 1984 the lukundol formation is overlain by a lignite member dongol 1985 which is in turn succeeded by thick black lacustrine clay unit locally known as the kalimati clay sakai 2001 the topmost layer of the groundwater basin is filled by the fluvio lacustrine terraces and fan deposits mostly sands and gravels of the patan gokarna itahiti and thimi formations sakai 2001 yoshida and igarashi 1984 the northern part of the basin is a delta deposit that contains mainly the coarse sediments see figs 2 and 3 a the groundwater system of kv is classified into three layers shallow aquifer aquitard and deep aquifer as reported by several researchers e g cresswell et al 2001 metcalf and eddy 2000 pandey et al 2010 japan international cooperation agency jica reported that the central kathmandu valley has a thick clay layer acting as aquitard in the basin jica 1990 groundwater basin of the valley is divided into three districts as shown in fig 3 b the northern groundwater district ndg 156 km2 is comprised by the gokarna and tokha geological formations having high recharge capacity meanwhile the central groundwater district cgd 114 km2 basin has the kalimati formation having thick clay aquitard layer leading to less recharge capacity the southern groundwater district sgd 56 km2 has the integrated combination of chapagaun lukundol alluvial fan deposit and the colluvium soil formation that have moderate recharge capacity previous studies also mark the same location as the potential groundwater recharge area as shown in fig 4 a and b e g jica 1990 lamichhane and shakya 2019a pandey et al 2013 hydraulic properties including horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities are the key components to calibrate a groundwater model the hydraulic properties for the kathmandu aquifer system are derived from previously published sources eg k c 2011 pandey and kazama 2011 the hydraulic conductivity of shallow aquifer ranges from 12 4 to 44 9 m day with an average of 23 7 m day the shallow aquifer has higher conductivity than deep aquifer the hydraulic conductivity of the deep aquifer is reported to be 0 3 8 8 m day with an average value of 4 5 m day the hydraulic conductivity of shallow aquifer is found to be five times higher than that of the deep aquifer the transmissivity of shallow aquifer varies from 163 2 1056 6 m2 day with an average of 609 9 m2 day whereas that for the deep aquifer varies from 22 6 to 737 m2 day with an average of 379 9 m2 day the transmissivity of shallow aquifer is found to be 1 6 times higher than that of the deep aquifer the storage coefficient of the shallow aquifer is almost constant 0 2 throughout the study area the storage coefficient of the deep aquifer varies from 0 00023 to 0 07 3 data and methods effects of urbanization in the groundwater aquifers can be reflected in the form of increase in groundwater pumping and decrease in recharge areas to assess this groundwater model for the kv was developed using modflow 2005 engine and simulations were performed under the scenarios of change in pumping rate and lulc from the base year map and future potential recharge map the future encroachments of potential recharge area were accounted for recharge estimation using gis tool the effects on groundwater table due to reduction of the recharge capacity and increment in the pumping rate were evaluated by coupling decadal potential recharge map with lulc change in the calibrated and validated groundwater flows model in modflow environment future pumping rates were calculated based on population growth rate and the current demand the decadal pumping rate was simulated using the population growth rate the overall methodological framework is demonstrated in fig 5 3 1 groundwater flow modeling 3 1 1 model description groundwater flow model was set up in the modflow 2005 environment which is widely used due to its simplicity in understanding modification use and enhancement of the output from the groundwater simulation the model is fortran 90 based programming language subdivided into packages for the groundwater flow process american institute national standards 1992 the entire package solves the groundwater flow process using three dimensional finite difference equations the operating partial differential equation is described in the principle of mass balance in the movement of groundwater under constant density through the porous material as depicted by eq 1 which describes groundwater flow under non equilibrium conditions in a heterogeneous medium harbaugh 2005 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z axes that are assumed to be parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity l t h is hydraulic head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources sinks of water w 0 0 for flow out of the groundwater system and w 0 0 for flow into the system t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 and t is time t in general ss kxx kyy and kzz are the functions of space and w is the function of space and time the head and flow magnitudes from the equation vary in all three directions x y and z to solve the equation with respect to space and time the initial steady and unsteady state and boundary conditions specific head specific flow and head dependent flow must exist and the solution is not simple so the finite difference method is used for solving such numerical problems by a finite set of discrete points in space and time with the assumption that each discrete block is rectangular in both horizontal and vertical directions in the steady state there is no change in storage within the basin which leads the right hand side of the equation to be zero the details of the model can be found in elsewhere see harbaugh 2005 groundwater flow computer program has gotten a high capability to solve the hydrological problems by solving the different codes as per the hydrological problems such codes are called the packages the selection of packages is based on what type of problem the modeler wants to solve and which solver package gets the better results after simulation basnet 2016 loudyi 2005 shrestha et al 2020 3 1 2 model set up the kv watershed boundary with an area of 613 km2 as shown in fig 1 is considered as the modeling domain entire modeling domain is divided into three vertical layers viz shallow aquifer aquitard and deep aquifer each layer is assumed as one vertical block in the model depth to each layer is assigned based on the recommendations by pandey and kazama 2011 the modeling domain in horizontal plane is discretized into 500 m 500 m grid cell having the unique surface and subsurface characteristics which results a total of 62 rows and the 66 columns to cover the entire modeling domain the object layers ground surface shallow aquifer layer aquitard deep aquifer initial water level hydraulic conductivity river reach recharge pumping well observation well etc are set up for the initial input to the model the active and passive grids are assigned through the object layers the recharge in the basin is assigned in terms of fraction of precipitation the stress period simulation is conducted through the head observation hob river riv recharge rch unsaturated zone flow uzf and well wel package in the modflow nwt model the initial values of hydraulic conductivity for each subsurface layer are taken from study by pandey et al 2010 the present and the future recharge areas and their capacities are taken from the study by lamichhane and shakya 2019a pumping rate in each grid cell is obtained from the surface hydrological analysis of the basin performed by adhikari 2017 the hydro geological properties hydraulic conductivity of sub surface layers and river reach and recharge factor are estimated through model calibration 3 1 3 model calibration and validation the groundwater flow model was calibrated against observed groundwater level data from 41 monitoring wells see fig 1 in 2016 the dry season october to march data was used for model calibration and wet season april to september data for validation the model was calibrated by minimizing the error between observed and simulated heads at the observation wells in the steady state condition calibration was performed manually and performance was evaluated based on statistical indicators such as root mean square rms nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 mean error me moriasi et al 2007 and mean absolute error mae moriasi et al 2007 multiple indicators as well as scatter plots were also used to evaluate the model performance because indicators like nse and pbias may show good performance even when model outputs are not reasonably good as indicated in literature adhikari 2017 aghlmand and abbasi 2019 3 2 development of spatially distributed recharge rate map the spatial variation in lulc change and soil characteristics affect the present and future recharge capacities the maximum recharge capacity in each grid cell can be obtained by the field test or the theoretical potential recharge technique the theoretical potential recharge capacity defined as the maximum recharge capacity of the soil without any obstruction is the unitless or non dimensional value that can be updated with field data average deviation factor or adjustment factor af between observed and simulated infiltration value from theoretical method is obtained by the simple mean deviation factor as per eq 2 2 a f 1 n k 1 n r f k r t k where r f k r t k and n refer the field test recharge capacity value theoretical recharge capacity and number of field test respectively the unique value of the af represents the perfect evaluation of recharge infiltration capacity between the field and theoretical process if the value of af is greater than one it signifies under estimation from the theoretical method and less than one means over estimation theoretically generated recharge map of the modelling domain was compared with the field test data map the unitless grid recharge was converted into the field recharge as shown in eq 3 3 r i r t i a f where r i and r t i represent the adjusted recharge capacity and theoretical recharge capacity of the soil in grid cell i respectively we developed an equation to express the groundwater recharge capacity as a fraction of precipitation which depends up on the seasonal variability the maximum recharge capacity of each grid value was standardized based on normalization technique as shown in eq 4 4 r v i n p i n α n m i n r i n r m i n n r m a x n r m i n n α n m a x α n m i n where r v i n p i n α n m a x α n m i n r i n r m i n n and r m a x n represent the actual recharge from the grid i in n year seasons months precipitation maximum permissible limit factor minimum permissible limit factor adjusted recharge capacity in the grid i in n year seasons months minimum recharge capacity value in the n year seasons months and minimum recharge capacity value in the n year seasons months respectively the grid precipitation was calculated from the observed precipitation data and recharge capacity in each grid was calculated from eq 4 the maximum and minimum recharge values i e rmax and rmin were taken from lamichhane and shakya 2019a the spatially distributed precipitation map was prepared based on station based precipitation data in the study domain the calibrated parameters of recharge minimum and maximum factors the recharge capacity and the spatially distributed precipitation of each grid cell values were used to generate the actual recharge depth in spatial raster map or the object the obtained object is used as the recharge input parameter for simulation 3 3 future scenarios considered for future projection the decadal analysis was conducted for both seasons two future scenarios considered are i increased pumping rate based on the rate of increase in population due to future urbanization and ii change in both pumping rate and lulc recharge area change the gap between the two scenarios is estimated as the impact of only lulc change 3 3 1 pumping rate scenario the pumping of groundwater from unconfined shallow aquifer is increasing rapidly at the household level there are no actual records of such pumping and neither much is known about its future due to the lack of database shallow water pumping rate is analyzed by the water balance equation in surface hydrology from the rainfall runoff model as per eqs 5 6 and 7 adhikari 2017 5 δ h w h i n h s i n k h l a t f l o w h p u m p 6 δ h w δ h s a

change in depth total infiltration depth deep aquifer recharge depth of water lateral flow water depth shallow water pumping depth and change in groundwater table depth in each cell respectively the rate of change in the water demand is calculated as the product of linear population growth rate and the per capita demand with the base pumping the base shallow aquifer pumping rate was taken from the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model outputs as per the eqs 5 to 7 and the projection rate is taken based on the population growth rate scenarios as reported by adhikari 2017 future pumping scenario is taken by using three growth rates 1 for the areas with greater pumping rate and developed areas 100 m3 day 1 5 for newly developing areas pumping rate between 50 to 100 m3 day and 3 pumping rate less than the 50 m3 day for the areas in the peripheral parts of the valley 3 3 2 lulc change scenario encroachments of the potential recharge areas and their impacts to the surface runoff and recharge were taken from previous studies e g lamichhane and shakya 2019a 2019b previous studies highlighted that 6 3 99 km2 of the rechargeable areas would be converted to the impermeable surface due to growth of the physical infrastructures the simulated annual average and minimum river runoff from the model including the lulc change resulted the average increment of 1 3 and decrement of 3 45 per year respectively the groundwater recharge is projected to decrease by 2 in every decade in the groundwater basin lamichhane and shakya 2019a delineated the potential groundwater recharge area and the projection of the future scenario as per the urbanization pattern the main principle of the scenario is that the recharge tendency in each grid will vary with the lulc change the surface recharge capacity will decrease with the changed context due to urbanization so recharge depth of the cell is the function of the precipitation and the potential groundwater recharge map of the basin the maximum recharge capacity of the cell was estimated through model calibration process the spatially distributed raster or object outputs for spatially distributed recharge obtained from the analysis are assigned in the model for the future analysis 3 4 assessment of the impacts of future scenarios on drawdown due to projected changes in lulc and pumping rates drawdown or depth of groundwater table from ground surface is also expected to change both spatially and temporally increase in pumping rate and encroachment of potential recharge areas are likely to increase drawdown in the future under both scenarios changes in drawdown and its spatial distribution are estimated by subtracting future drawdown from baseline drawdown the outputs are presented in the form of geo spatial maps and tables 3 5 data and sources both geo spatial and temporal data such as bio physical climate socio economic hydrological hydrogeological water supply and gw pumping were collected from various sources and are listed in table 1 3 6 limitations projected future groundwater level variation in the changed context is quantified by using the universal groundwater model modflow the complex phenomenon of the aquifer is represented through the simple water balance of the groundwater due to the lack of observed data only one seasonal data is used for calibration and validation of the model for the better understanding transient model simulation provides the temporal response of the hydraulic head but due to the lack of data availability simple steady state condition is used in this study in addition the aquifer hydro geological characteristics are taken from previous studies jica 1990 k c 2011 pandey et al 2010 which may be eventually replaced by field measurements for better results similarly river information slope width hydraulic conductivity recharge dynamics etc was taken from previous studies adhikari 2017 basnet 2016 thapa et al 2019 which could be improved with the field measurements for precise results for the collection of actual field shallow groundwater extraction data is more time consuming costly and tedious so the base year pumping rate is calculated using the rainfall runoff model thus experimental database may be considered for more representative results 4 results and discussions 4 1 groundwater model performance groundwater flow model was calibrated against the observed groundwater level well data developed by working group wg 2 of wash mia satreps project the model was calibrated in two stages at the first stage hydraulic conductance of sub surface layers and rivers and the recharge factor was calibrated to the extent of reasonable performance it gave that recharge factor for the dry and wet periods as 91 and 41 of the precipitation respectively based on the recharge depth of each grid cells corresponding recharge volumes for dry and wet seasons were calculated as 1 07 and 1 91 million cubic meters mcm respectively at the second stage keeping almost same volume of recharge in both seasons recharge depth was varied across the grid cells based on recharge capacity of different lulc types using eq 4 since recharge volume was kept constant and all other parameters were unchanged from the first stage the model performance was almost same as in the first stage the model performance statistics of the calibrated and validated models are shown in table 2 and residual and scatter plots are presented in fig 6 the model performance indicators table 2 and residual and scatter plots fig 6 indicate that the model performance in reasonably good for further analysis in the residual head plot except some wells like dry w39 and wet w47 w39 and w8 most of the wells depicted comparable heads in the case of simulated and observed scenarios hydraulic properties of the aquifer and the river system were found to be more sensitive meanwhile the recharge value influenced the overall water balance of basin model calibration was performed manually using trial and error approach and variation of the groundwater levels were quantified for the base year simulation the wells at northern and central parts performed relatively better compared to the wells from eastern and western parts the zero value of the me mae and rmse indicates the absolute performance of model and the minimum values of the indexes lead to better results the nominal values of mae and rmse table 2 indicate that the performance in the model is quite good and can be used for analysis of drawdown under various scenarios final values of calibrated parameters are reported in table 3 the hydraulic head and its drawdown due to pumping are varied with the hydraulic properties of layers riverbeds and the recharge volume of the basin high value means the high recharge and less drawdown 4 2 spatial distribution of groundwater recharge the recharge rates and their spatial distribution were estimated through calibration of groundwater flow model the recharge depths for dry period fig 7 a and wet period fig 7b vary from 1 22 to 2 19 mm and 2 22 3 76 mm respectively as expected its spatial distribution corresponds to precipitation distribution and the northern part of the model domain has higher recharge depth compared to the southern part at the second stage maintaining the recharge volume more or less equal to the first stage the recharge rates were distributed spatially across the grid cell as per eq 4 and corresponding depth of recharge mm were estimated for each cell the model performance at this stage was considered as acceptable and therefore recharge rates corresponding to this calibration are reported as recharge depths across the grid cells in dry and wet seasons at this stage recharge volume or depth is the function of precipitation as well as lulc of the grid cell the results for dry and wet seasons are depicted in figs 8 and 9 respectively the recharge depth in each grid cell was found with spatially distributed precipitation and recharge factor by the eq 4 from the fig 7 a and b the northern part of the valley has high tendency to precipitation whereas other parts have moderate tendency similarly the northern and eastern part of the valley have also high potential recharge area but the south east part has less precipitation however it has greater open and forest areas so it contributes to significant recharge in 2020 recharge depth varies from 1 14 to 2 22 mm in dry season fig 8a and 2 25 4 09 mm in wet season fig 8b during this period the total volumes of recharge in dry and wet seasons are found as 1 052 and 1 949 mcm respectively table 4 due to precipitation characteristics of the basin in the wet season more than 75 of precipitation is occurred in wet season only more volume was recharged compared to the dry season in the dry season the recharge tendency is high due to low intensity frequency and duration of precipitation and dry surface condition compare to the wet season in the 2050 the land use and recharge area change would affect the recharge tendency of the grid cells significantly the recharge depth variation across the grids is 1 13 2 22 mm in the dry season fig 9a and 2 25 4 09 mm in the wet season fig 9b volumes of recharge in dry and wet seasons are estimated to be 1 048 and 1 947 mcm respectively table 4 the maximum and average recharge depth variation from 2020 to 2050 across the grid cells are estimated as 0 033 and 0 006 mm respectively for the dry season and 0 100 and 0 003 respectively for the wet season such variation creates the change in recharge volume during the period with the changed context at least 6 open area in each decade would be encroached by urbanization lamichhane and shakya 2019a which generates the significant impact in the river runoff as well as recharge at different locations lamichhane and shakya 2019b as shown in figs 8 and 9 the northern and north eastern part of the valley are potential recharge areas that would be encroached by urbanization in the future and therefore the recharge depth or volume will be affected notably the nature of recharge variation in the dry and wet is more or less same however projected changes in recharge volume are likely to get affected due to projected changes in future precipitation from climate change which is not considered in this study 4 3 impacts of future scenarios on gw drawdown 4 3 1 drawdown due to pumping dynamics though pumping rates for 258 deep wells in the valley were available and are used in the model calibration data of pumping from shallow aquifer is not available to this end theoretical water balance techniques are adopted to calculate the shallow pumping rate in which the change in storage of the basin was considered for the shallow pumping value as done by adhikari 2017 pumping volume and rate were distributed in each grid value with reference to the population density simulated hydraulic head after model calibration and assigned pumping rates are shown in fig 10 it is assumed that the pumping well is in the center of gravity of the cell and effect is equally distributed throughout the average annual pumping rates were considered to vary spatially at the rates of 1 1 5 and 3 for the locations with pumping rates greater than 100 m3 day 100 to 50 m3 day and less than 50 m3 day respectively as suggested by adhikari 2017 future groundwater scenarios were developed at decadal scale i e 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 considering increase in pumping rates as per population growth rate and keeping other conditions climatic geological land use land cover etc constant results depicted in fig 11 indicate that the hydraulic head changes from 2020 to 2050 within the modeling domain for dry as well as wet seasons in observation wells the head in the dry season goes down due to peak pumping and again recovers during the wet season for the simulation period the wet season drawdown was higher than the dry season similar output was also reported by other studies e g thapa et al 2019 in certain pocket areas where the aquitard is exposed with high pumping rate or less hydraulic conductivity the drawdown was rapid in the dry season excess rainfall in the wet season raised the groundwater level to the surface and such large variation in groundwater level during wet and dry seasons was prominent in pocket areas mostly the outer part of the valley has less pumping rate and moderate recharge capacity however the groundwater table was still the same but in the semi urban areas and the core areas of the valley the level declined significantly as shown in fig 11 the observation wells located at the central and northern parts have significant changes due to high pumping rate high potential recharge areas and good transmissivity characteristics of the sub soil 4 3 2 drawdown due to both pumping rate and lulc change the pumping rate change scenario incorporates the groundwater condition with respect to population growth and water demand of the basin the effects of urbanization or population growth in the basin change the lulc as well as the recharge condition encroachment of the open land or rechargeable area will affect the recharge volume of sub surface water recharge capacity of the surface was quantified as the product of rainfall recharge area map of respective decades figs 7 and 8 and recharge properties of that area with eq 4 results of change in drawdown during 2020 and 2050 for both increase in pumping rate and lulc change are shown in fig 12 it is clearly observed that the outermost part of the valley which has forest and agricultural open land cover together with less pumping rate contributes in stabilization of water table in both seasons and scenarios at the observation wells in the core and peri urban areas the groundwater level was rapidly declining for both pumping scenarios the dry pocket area from the grid cell was increased more in the dry season compared to the wet season the rate of drawdown in the wet season was quite higher than the dry season but the bottom level of the elevation in dry season was low upper hilly part of the valley has forest cover thus the elevation of water table at its foothill is quite similar but in the core areas and the northern foothills the drawdown was quite high less recharge and high pumping rate may cause extensive drawdown in the future and may lead to other secondary effects the difference in the results of two scenarios figs 11 and 12 are considered as the changes in drawdown due to only lulc change the results of all the scenarios are tabulated in table 5 for comparative analysis the data for the extreme dry pocket area was excluded in the analysis the results highlight that high drawdown locations are mostly the peri urban and core urban areas the maximum water head declination in the basin in dry season in three scenarios only pumping both pumping and lulc and only lulc change were 162 33 175 00 and 36 33 mm year respectively similarly for wet season the maximum water head declination was 111 33 106 03 and 86 83 mm year respectively for only pumping both pumping and lulc and only lulc change this highlights that the water table declination in dry season is more than the wet season similarly the average variation of the water table throughout the basin during dry and wet periods for only pumping both pumping and lulc and only lulc change were 1 33 and 5 5 mm year 2 5 and 8 82 mm year and 1 and 3 66 mm year respectively the results highlight that lucl change has significant effect on the groundwater for the kathmandu valley variation of the water table in both seasons and scenarios creates the voids in the bottom layer that may cause land subsidence in the core valley as well the haphazard urbanization in the valley led to the synergetic effects on the groundwater depletion due to population growth and encroachments of recharge areas or lulc change 5 conclusion in the context of population growth urbanization and subsequent increase in pumping rates and decrease in recharge areas this study adopted model based approach to identify spatial distribution of potential recharge rates and assess the impacts of future changes in groundwater level and drawdown in the kathmandu valley pumping rate increase due to increase in the population and lulc change and pumping rate increase due to urbanization and increase in population are considered as two analysis scenarios the groundwater flow model was developed in modflow environment the model was calibrated and validated with observed groundwater data in 2016 the key conclusions of the study are as follows recharge rates for the grids covering the entire kv watershed ranges between 95 35 85 34 of precipitation for dry season and 48 to 38 of precipitation in the wet season corresponding recharge depths in 2020 varies in a range of 1 14 2 22 mm in the dry season and 2 25 4 09 mm in the wet season that results in total groundwater recharge of 1 052 mcm and 1 949 mcm in the dry and wet seasons respectively the northern parts of kv have relatively more recharge potential compared to the southern parts between 2020 and 2050 the recharge volume in both seasons is projected to decrease considering change in pumping rates due to population growth change in simulated drawdown during 2020 and 2050 varies widely within the study area high drawdown is located at the foothills of northern and southern parts of the valley the projected changes in maximum drawdown are 4 27 m and 3 34 m in the dry and wet seasons respectively the changes in average drawdown are 0 04 m and 0 16 m in the dry and wet seasons respectively in the case of change in both pumping rate and lulc and corresponding change in recharge areas change in simulated maximum and average drawdown during 2020 and 2050 are 5 25 and 0 07 m for the dry season and 7 34 to 0 26 m for the wet season the lulc change contributes 1 09 and 3 63 m drawn respectively in the dry and wet seasons the maximum change in drawdown is located at the foothills of northern and northeast parts of the valley the results of this study quantify the spatial distribution of recharge rate and depth impact of recharge area encroachment and increase in pumping rate in groundwater level and drawdown are useful in planning groundwater management groundwater allocation and design of interventions for sustainable management of groundwater resources in the kathmandu valley future studies may consider more data to improve
