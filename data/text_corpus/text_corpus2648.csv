13240,over the past few decades the indiscriminate use of a large variety of synthetic dyes and their continuous input into aquatic environments has constituted a serious risk to human health and ecological systems among a variety of treatment methods for dye removal from the aqueous environment sonophotocatalysis has recently received a lot of attention due to its green and environmental friendly properties the aim of this review is to present an in depth study of the sonophotocatalytic process for the degradation of various dyes in aqueous matrices in the present study the fundamentals of sonolysis and photocatalysis for wastewater treatment and their merits and drawbacks are explained in detail along with a detailed discussion on the benefits that can be obtained using the combined approach additionally operational parameters the pathway and kinetics of the sonophotocatalytic dye degradation the cost estimation as well as the application of sonophotocatalysis for the textile wastewater treatment are discussed based on recently published works it is observed that sonophotocatalysis indeed results in the remarkable enhancement of the oxidation intensity and thus the degradation rates of dyes however its applicability in large scale wastewater treatment is limited according to findings most of the sonophotocatalytic optimization processes can achieve high removal efficiency with low concentrations of dyes i e 0 1 100 μm low ultrasound frequencies i e 20 200 khz and acidic ph values over a temperature range of 20 40 c though the exact recommended value would be dependent on the compound characteristics and the reactor geometry graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sonophotocatalysis dye degradation decolorization advanced oxidation process

extensively consumed in various industries e g textiles printing papers rubber paints cosmetics plastics leather food etc for products coloration 1 3 dyes usually have a wide structural diversity and are generally classified into various groups according to their source chemical structure and solubility as shown in fig 1 basically dyes can be divided into natural and synthetic dyes 4 5 natural dyes are frequently utilized in food industries and separated into three main categories based on their sources as plants animals and minerals 6 7 while synthetic dyes are widely used in textile industries and classified by chromophore groups in their chemical structures as azo dyes anthraquinone dyes phthalein dyes and phthalocyanine dyes etc 8 9 azo dyes containing azo bonds nn are the largest group of synthetic organic dyes 3000 different varieties and over 50 of all the dyes used in textile processing are azo dyes 1 10 in practice dyes are classified into acid dyes basic dyes cationic dyes direct dyes substantive dyes disperse dyes non ionic dyes reactive dyes vat dyes and sulfur dyes as shown in fig 1 11 despite the noticeable benefits of using dyes in different branches of industries they can be considered as a serious threat to the environment human health and aquatic ecosystems 12 13 over 700 000 tons of dye are annually produced for various industrial activities remarkable amounts of these dyes 1 20 are discharged along with effluents into main water bodies after dyeing processes 11 14 dye contaminants in water cause eutrophication reduction of photosynthesis and perturbation of aquatic life by preventing sunlight penetration into water 15 16 in other words dyes affect the photosynthetic mechanism of the aquatic ecosystem by inhibiting light penetration and reducing the amount of dissolved oxygen as a result of preventing the oxygen interchange at the surface 17 18 in addition to adverse environmental impacts most of these dyes cause health risks due to their toxic carcinogenic and xenobiotic nature 19 20 consequently there is a crying need to develop effective approaches for the treatment of dye effluents before they are released into water bodies dyes are photostable and not biologically degradable they are resistant to aerobic digestion thus implying that they are major difficult groups to be eliminated from the industrial wastewater 21 22 so far numerous physical chemical and biological treatment techniques have been investigated to decolorize dye effluents 23 conventional physical techniques such as activated carbon 24 adsorption 25 membrane filtration 26 reverse osmosis 27 pose various disadvantages such as long processing time high operating costs need for specialized equipment and generation of secondary pollution 28 29 these methods only transfer the pollutant to another phase and lack in the degradation or mineralization of dyes 30 31 unstable metabolites of chemical processes such as electrochemical 32 chlorination 33 ozonation 34 cause adverse health impacts 11 biological methods including microbiological 35 and enzymatic 36 treatments result in the incomplete degradation and the poor mineralization of by products 11 37 38 to overcome such obstacles researchers focused on developing an efficient economic and eco friendly treatment method for the degradation of dyes the physicochemical methods based on the production of reactive oxygen species ros e g h2o2 ho o2 and o3 named advanced oxidation processes aops have shown to be highly capable of oxidizing a wide range of pollutants 39 aops and their combinations such as ozonation fenton and photo fenton process ultraviolet uv h2o2 tio2 mediated photocatalysis sonolysis and sonophotocatalysis have been applied for this goal at different operational conditions 40 among various aops sonolysis as well as photocatalysis have recently received considerable attention from researchers for the elimination of organic pollutants from wastewater due to several potential advantages over conventional treatment methods 41 42 however the individual sonolysis or photolysis suffers in the lower production of ho radicals and also requires a long reaction time for complete degradation 43 44 moreover the transparency of wastewater containing dyes is low which prevents the light penetration to appreciable depth in contrast ultrasonic irradiations can penetrate deeply into the polluted wastewater to degrade organic pollutants 45 46 recent studies revealed that the combination of sonolysis and heterogeneous photocatalysis i e sonophotocatalysis helps to overcome the limitations of individual treatments and enhances the degradation rate of some organic compounds 47 during the sonophotocatalysis ultrasonic waves and light irradiation are implemented simultaneously to a system containing a photocatalyst in the sonophotocatalytic process the cavitation phenomenon possesses numerous benefits i e uniform distribution of a catalyst in the liquid medium enhancement of the surface area increasing the mass transfer cleaning the catalyst surface regeneration of active sites and enhancement of catalytic activities 48 50 hence this has led to sonophotocatalysis being the preferred approach for degrading organic pollutants among all other oxidation processes recently many researchers have studied the elimination of different dyes using sonophotocatalytic processes thus a comprehensive review of dye decolorization by sonophotocatalysis is important because the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes is influenced significantly by their unique properties as well as water quality sonication conditions and catalysts although there is an article entitled a review of the application of sonophotocatalytic process based on advanced oxidation process for degrading organic dye by zewde et al 51 it is mostly limited to the mechanism of sonophotocatalysis and also not relatively presented with detailed up to date information to the best of our knowledge such a comprehensive up to date and systematic review information on the destruction and decolorization of various dyes in aquatic systems by sonophotocatalysis has not yet been conducted this is an important gap in knowledge that the current paper intends to fill the new aspect of this review article is to cover up to date research result presentation on sonophotocatalytic degradation of various dyes and also to analyze and identify various operation conditions optimized conditions degradation pathways by products and kinetics of dye degradation by sonophotocatalysis the authors also tried to analyze the scattered available information on dye decolorization by sonophotocatalysis for the last two decades the present state of the art on the application of sonophotocatalysis in the elimination of dyes from aqueous solution is presented in this paper the present review article aims to judge the potential use of sonophotocatalysis for the decolorization of various dyes from aqueous solutions and investigates the applicability of the sonophotocatalytic process in the water treatment the first part provides a comprehensive overview of sonophotocatalysis for the decolorization of dyes and describes the synergistic effects of sonolysis combined with photocatalysis as well as the induced phenomena and the mechanism of sonophotocatalytic dye degradation then a detailed analysis of published reports in the field of sonophotocatalytic dye degradation is also provided in the next part operational parameters and optimized conditions by products degradation pathways the kinetics of sonophotocatalytic dye degradation cost estimation and feasibility of sonophotocatalysis for the treatment of the real textile wastewater are discussed in detail finally present challenges and future perspectives of sonophotocatalytic dye decolorization will be discussed as well the paper tries to present the fundamental scientific principles and useful guidelines for future research works and large scale utilization of sonophotocatalytic dye decolorization 2 sonolytic photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation mechanisms ultrasound us is a sound wave possessing frequencies greater than the human hearing threshold approximately 20 khz 52 53 the passage of ultrasound through a liquid medium causes acoustic cavitation phenomenon which consists of nucleation the rapid growth of cavities during the rarefaction cycle negative pressure period and transient implosion of the cavities during the compression phase positive pressure period 54 56 depending on the intensity and frequency of ultrasound there are two categories of acoustic cavitation bubbles namely stable and transient at high frequencies 1 mhz cavitational activity is stable and bubbles only oscillate around their resonance radius for many acoustic cycles and do not implode 57 59 the motion of gas filled bubbles during stable cavitation results in the micro streaming and eddy currents which can provide more extensive mass transfer in the medium surrounding 60 61 at low frequency ultrasound 20 khz 1 mhz transient vaporous cavities exist for a few acoustic cycles and then implode violently 57 59 fig 2a shows a schematic illustration of stable and transient cavitation 57 the propagation of low frequency ultrasound results in the enhancement of mass transfer by different hydrodynamic phenomena such as shear forces shock waves microturbulence and high speed microjets within the immediate surroundings 62 65 in addition the violent implosion of transient cavitation bubbles generates extremely high temperature and pressure 100 mpa 5000 k which leads to the degradation and pyrolytic dissociation of molecules including water in the vicinity or inside a collapsing bubble 57 66 inside the collapsing bubbles water and oxygen molecules are thermally fragmented into highly reactive free radicals h ho 2 and ho these primary radicals diffuse into bulk solutions and directly degrade some contaminants via hydroxylation and oxidation reactions 67 68 the following reactions occur during sonolysis of water reactions 1 5 69 1 h 2 o us h ho 2 o 2 us 2 o 3 o h 2 o 2 ho 4 h o 2 ho o 5 h o 2 ho 2 the trapped compounds in the cavities either undergo thermolytic degradation or react with the highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals 70 71 in the interfacial region of the cavitation bubble high temperature gradient results in condense hydroxyl radicals thereby initiating the degradation process in the liquid phase 72 73 though the temperature in the bubble liquid interface is lower than the core temperature there is an adequate high temperature to pyrolysis of the substrate hence there are two parallel pathways in the interfacial region of collapsing bubbles involving oh radical attack and pyrolysis which depends on the nature of the substrate in the bulk solution phase the reactions are basically between dissolved organic compounds and active radicals that migrate from the interfacial regions in the bulk solution free radical reactions are mainly promoted by shear forces turbulence and micro streaming moreover hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can be generated by combining oh radicals during sonolysis of the aqueous solution which is not effective in oxidizing the contaminant molecules due to its lower redox potential than oh radical reaction 6 74 77 6 2 ho h 2 o 2 generally there are two pathways for ultrasonic decomposition which depend on the basis of the physical chemical properties of the pollutants the first mechanism is pyrolysis inside the transient cavitation bubbles as well as in the interfacial region which is expected to be the main pathway for the decomposition of hydrophobic or apolar and more volatile substances the second mechanism is the hydroxyl radical generation in the cavities which subsequently diffuse into the bulk phase and oxidize the pollutants which are hydrophilic or polar and non volatile substances 78 79 fig 2b depicts the schematic illustration of the sonochemical reaction zones sonolysis operates at ambient conditions it is chemical free and does not generate secondary pollutants to the environmental matrices 41 the sonochemical methods have significant advantages such as safety cleanliness and low operating cost furthermore ultrasound is not affected by the biodegradability and toxicity of the pollutant solution 80 additionally the sonochemical process is known as a compatible and attachable technique to other treatment processes in terms of enhancing the efficiency of treatment processes 81 although ultrasonic irradiation is convenient for the removal of organic pollutants complete degradation is not achieved over short irradiation times this might be because of several reasons such as higher polarity of the organic compounds low accessibility of oh radicals or lack of dissipated power hydrophilic and or low volatile compounds treatment volume limitations and long processing time are the main drawbacks of sonochemical degradation which make it ineffective when used alone 82 83 to overcome such limitations the utilization of the sonochemical process coupled with other aop techniques can be a good choice among various combined treatment processes the combination of sonolysis with heterogeneous photocatalysis i e sonophotocatalysis has received much attention for the removal of hazardous pollutants from wastewater in the last few years 84 85 photocatalysis includes homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysis in homogeneous photocatalysis the catalysts and the reactants are in the same phase and various oxidants are employed hydrogen peroxide ozone fenton reagent sodium hypochlorite either alone or combined with uv light to generate radicals 86 87 in the heterogeneous photocatalytic process the catalyst is utilized in a different phase from the reactants this process is based on the use of semiconductor material as a catalyst and uv solar radiation to activate the catalyst to initiate a redox reaction for the intended contaminants 23 51 a semiconductor material has an electronic band structure that consists of the highest and lowest energy levels known as the valence band vb and conduction band cb respectively that are separated by band gap energy 88 89 when a photon of energy equal or greater than the band gap energy is absorbed by a semiconductor photocatalyst an electron from the valence band is excited to the conduction band with simultaneous production of a hole in the valence band hvb 11 valance band holes are able to oxidize the contaminant molecules or they can react with water and hydroxide ions to form hydroxyl radicals while at the conduction band the interaction between electrons and adsorbed molecular oxygen results in the production of superoxide radical anion o2 which can also lead to the formation of hydroxyl radical 2 48 the superoxide radical anion gets protonated forming hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and subsequently h2o2 which further dissociates into oh radicals 11 7 photo excitation tio 2 hv tio 2 e h 8 h vb oh ads ho 9 e cb o 2 oh 2 10 o 2 h ho 2 11 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 12 h 2 o 2 hv 2 ho 13 dye ho co 2 h 2 o 14 dye h vb oxidation products 15 dye e cb reduction products apart from the indirect photocatalytic oxidation of dyes by reactive radicals direct excitation of dye molecules may also occur under visible light due to their ability to absorb some of the visible lights in other words direct photolysis is another mechanism for photocatalytic dye degradation involving the dye excitation from the ground state dye to the triplet excited state dye under visible light λ 400 nm the excited dye is further converted into an oxidized radical cation dye by ejecting an electron from itself to the conduction band of the semiconductor the electron is then taken up by the oxygen molecule in the system resulting in the formation of superoxide radical anion and hydroxyl radical which are mainly responsible for the dye degradation 11 90 91 16 dye hv dye 17 dye tio 2 dye tio 2 according to several studies the indirect mechanism predominates over the direct mechanism and its contribution to the decomposition of dye is much more pronounced than the direct photolysis in comparison to the indirect mechanism photolytic decolorization proceeds very slowly due to the absence of sufficient hydroxyl radicals 92 93 the major defect of photocatalysis is the reduction of system efficiency under the long term operation this is mainly because of limited oxidation capacity and blocking of catalytically active sites by adsorption of pollutant molecules at the surface additionally the immobilized catalyst suffers from mass transfer limitation which can affect photocatalytic oxidation 2 51 other limitations of photocatalysis are including e h pair recombination rate long reaction time large amount of catalysts poor light penetration high cost of uv lamps and operational electricity 11 50 81 hence photocatalysis coupled with sonolysis sonophotocatalysis would help to overcome the drawbacks of the individual processes and synergistically combine the benefits of these techniques sonolysis induces splitting of water molecules into reactive h and oh radicals while in the case of photocatalysis oh radicals are produced from the interaction of holes and water molecules the integration of sonolysis photolysis and semiconductor catalysts results in the generation of electron hole pairs at high temperature and pressure and consequently higher formation of hydroxyl radical 84 94 therefore sonophotocatalysis results in the formation of sufficient free radicals through both band gap excitation and water dissociation and leads to completely oxidizing the majority of the pollutants compared to individual methods sonophotocatalysis offers substantial advantages such as improvement in the light penetration uniform distribution of catalyst particles acceleration of the cleavage of h2o2 and more generation of highly reactive radicals 95 97 moreover the acoustic cavitation process increases the catalyst surface due to particle fragmentation and deagglomeration and continuously cleans the photocatalyst surface during the operation 11 88 98 schematic representation of degradation mechanism by photocatalytic and sono photocatalytic processes are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively 3 research study design the primary literature survey in international electronic databases google scholar web of science science direct scopus pubmed and springer s databases was performed to find articles associated with the subject of this study from 2000 to 2020 our systematic search was conducted using english keywords search keywords in all databases included sonophotocatalysis photocatalysis sonolysis ultrasound dye removal degradation decolorization aqueous and advanced oxidation process in addition a manual search of bibliographies of potentially relevant articles was carried out to identify further papers which were not retrieved by online searches the and and or operators were used in combining the terms to make the primary outcome inclusive and restrictive article selection strategy included the title reading abstract reading and full text reading steps articles that meet the following criteria are included in the review i original research papers ii reporting of sonophotocatalysis for the dye degradation in aqueous solutions iii published in the english language iv full text articles were available in the identification step according to the title and abstract literature that mention other pollutants or approaches in their titles were excluded from the study in addition books thesis literature review non english papers papers without available full text as well as papers published prior to 2000 were rejected afterward from 673 articles collected 628 articles were eliminated by reviewing their titles or abstracts and only 45 documents were selected as probably suitable in the next stage the remaining papers were evaluated thoroughly and relevant articles were included in the study after assessing eligibility 38 papers were selected for the in depth analysis fig 5 illustrates the systematic review process in detail the main information of included studies for the sonophotocatalytic decomposition of dyes is summarized in table 1 4 sonophotocatalytic degradation of various dyes 4 1 sonophotocatalytic degradation efficiency sonophotocatalytic degradation and mineralization of various dyes have been reported recently in table 1 the degradation efficiency is determined based on the dye concentration change by measuring the characteristic absorbance peak at different reaction times as seen in table 1 all common dyes have distinct characteristic absorptions in the visible range 400 700 nm the degradation efficiency is calculated using the following equation 18 degradation efficiency c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 and c denote the dye concentration at the beginning of the process and after the specified treatment time respectively the studies show that the sonophotocatalytic process has great potential for the degradation of dyes for instance eshaq and elmetwally 94 investigated sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in the presence of bmim oac cu2o g c3n4 as a heterogeneous catalyst they found that only 30 min of sonophotocatalysis was enough to achieve a complete degradation at 25 c and ph 7 in another study eren 119 reported that complete color removal was obtained after 10 min treatment using us uv zno h2o2 system the reaction mechanism of sonophotocatalysis for the removal of dyes is mainly due to the synergistic effect between sonolysis and photocatalysis as mentioned earlier sonolysis of the aqueous solution resulted in the formation of h and oh radicals as a consequence of the pyrolysis of water molecules within the cavitation bubbles during the sonochemical decolorization of dyes in the aqueous solution oxidative degradation generally occurs via free radical attack 128 while in the case of photocatalysis the primary degradation pathway of dyes involves hydroxyl radicals and that direct oxidation by photogenerated holes therefore the combination of photocatalysis and sonolysis i e sonophotocatalysis seems to improve the decolorization rate by the increased formation of free radicals in addition sonophotocatalysis can overcome the limitations associated with each individual process 95 the main disadvantage of photocatalysis is a reduction in the catalytic activity due to the blockage of active sites on the catalyst surface by contaminants molecules the use of ultrasound in the photocatalytic system enhances turbulence in the solution thus reducing mass transfer limitations and regenerating the catalyst surface due to particle fragmentation and deagglomeration 129 furthermore the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst contributes to the enhancement in the rate of the generation of cavitation bubbles by providing additional nuclei which in turn increases the cleavage of water molecules and hydroxyl radical production the synergistic effect between sonolysis and photocatalysis enhances reactive radical production increases the generation of bubble cavities accelerates the mass transfer of dye molecules onto the catalyst surface and eliminates any impurities from its surface 130 131 during sonophotocatalysis the adsorbed dye molecule on the catalyst surface reacts with the free radicals formed through photocatalysis subsequently the shock waves created by cavitation bubbles desorb the dye molecules from the catalyst surface 105 107 on the other hand the reactive radicals produced by the implosion of cavities in the neighborhood of the photocatalyst particles can cause degradation of the dye molecules in general nanoparticles with smaller sizes and larger surface areas have more active sites which are more beneficial for sonophotocatalysis 131 4 2 evaluation of the synergistic effect during sonophotocatalytic process in order to evaluate the synergistic enhancement in the dye decolorization during sonophotocatalysis the synergistic index can be used which is the ratio of the sonophotocatalytic rate constant to the sum of the rate constants of the separate processes i e sonolysis and photocatalysis however there are variations in the calculations based on the individual processes studied the general representation of the synergy index can be given as eq 19 43 132 133 19 synergy index k sonophotocatalysis k sonolysis or sonocatalysis k photocatalysis where k reflects the pseudo first order rate constant of dye decolorization in the separate activation sonolysis or sonocatalysis and photocatalysis and hybrid activation sonophotocatalysis synergy index values 1 imply that the efficiency of the integrated approach is more than the cumulative values of the individual processes for instance marković et al 101 reported that the pseudo first order rate constant for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of acid orange 7 was 25 01 10 3 min 1 whereas the sum of rate constants for the individual approaches was 10 26 10 3 min 1 giving a synergistic index of 2 44 in another study by sathishkumar et al 99 a synergy index of 1 4 was reported for sonophotocatalytic degradation of acid blue 113 in the presence y3 tio2 nanocatalysts the rate constant of the combined treatment was reported to be 18 10 5 s 1 while the sum of rate constants for the individual sonocatalytic and photocatalytic processes was 12 8 10 5 s 1 which signifies a greater value of the rate constant during the sonophotocatalytic decolorization processes than the individual processes eshaq and elmetwally 94 reported a synergy of 30 66 during the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of methylene blue which was calculated using the following equation 20 synergy k sonophotocatalysis k sonocatalysis k photocatalysis k sonophotocatalysis 100 the decolorization rate constant k 0 151 min 1 of methylene blue was found to be higher than the sum of the rate constants of the individual processes kus tio2 kuv tio2 0 1047 min 1 berberidou et al 108 reported that the pseudo first order rate constants for the sonocatalytic photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation of malachite green under air were 11 6 10 3 112 6 10 3 and 1136 7 10 3 min 1 respectively and the synergy of 10 was obtained 4 3 influence of the operating variables the sonophotocatalytic degradation of different dyes showed that the performance of sonophotocatalysis is affected by many parameters therefore it is important to discuss the effects of operating variables in detail to optimize and apply them in the future operating conditions such as reactor design initial dye concentration light intensity type and concentration of catalyst ultrasonic frequency ultrasonic power solution temperature solution ph and operation time have been widely studied because of their remarkable influence on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes the process variables require to be properly quantified and optimized for achieving the best decolorization results with the minimum energy consumption and economic costs in this section some possible directions for optimization of all variables affecting sonophotocatalysis are outlined based on the thorough analysis of relevant studies 4 3 1 influence of catalyst dose from an economical point of view the catalyst dosage plays a crucial role in any sonophotocatalytic degradation process that should be evaluated several studies have investigated the degradation rate as a function of catalyst loading during sonophotocatalysis in general an increase in catalyst concentration enhances the available surface area or the population of active sites and intensifies the photocatalytic oxidation capability thus the enhanced loading of the catalyst in the reaction solution results in an enhancement in the production of oxidizing radicals by providing more fractions of the incident absorbed light furthermore the increment in the catalyst loading at the optimum level would contribute to the cavitational activity promotion by providing additional nuclei 44 48 however further increase in the catalyst dose beyond the optimum value increases the aggregation of particles and the extent of light scattering which results in the reduction of light absorption and photodegradation efficiency it also appears that ultrasound irradiation enhances the catalytic activity by improving the surface area of the catalyst and preventing the aggregation of the catalyst particles nevertheless sonocatalysis process does not change the pattern of dependence of the degradation rate on the catalyst dosage observed in photocatalysis 48 103 at excessive photocatalyst dosage even in the presence of ultrasound the amount of suspension turbidity increases and consequently the penetration of uv radiation decreases hence the sonophotocatalytic degradation efficiency decreases 51 131 therefore it is recommended to optimize the catalyst dosage based on the laboratory scale investigations as the optimal value is strongly dependent on the amount and the nature of the dye reactor configuration light intensity and the type as well as structural characteristics of the catalyst numerous studies have investigated the effect of catalyst dosage on the extent of dye degradation for instance asgari et al 50 investigated the effects of catalyst dosages 0 2 1 g l 1 on the decolorization of acid blue they reported 0 88 g l 1 as the optimum initial dosage of zno for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of ab113 the results revealed that following an increment in the initial concentration of zno up to 0 88 g l 1 the decolorization efficiency of ab113 also showed a linearly increasing rate and at a higher amount of catalyst concentration the decolorization rate showed a relatively constant trend in another study bagheri et al 21 investigated the effects of different loadings 1 6 mg l 1 of mwcnts zno nps and zno nps mwcnts on rb203 decolorization the results demonstrated that the optimum catalyst concentration for the dye removal with zno nps and zno nps mwcnts was 5 mg l 1 similar results were observed by ahmedchekkat et al 44 yetim and tekin 48 ertugay and acar 82 verma et al 103 abdul et al 121 kaur and singh 122 gonzalez and martinez 104 sabzehmeidani et al 125 and bokhale et al 126 a study conducted by ertugay and acar 106 reported that the yield of direct blue 71 decolorization increased from 23 to 74 with an increase in the photocatalyst loading from 0 to 1 g l 1 4 3 2 influence of catalyst design a variety of photocatalysts have been widely evaluated for the decolorization of dyes from aqueous solutions which can be classified into three categories the first category of photocatalysts is composed of single component materials e g tio2 zno and zro2 recently tio2 has attracted great interest in the photocatalytic decolorization processes owing to its non toxic nature high electrical conductivity high structural stability low cost and broad availability 134 136 however these conventional photocatalysts are activated only in the presence of uv light irradiation 250 350 nm due to their wide band gap 3 2 ev cationic and anionic dyes and dyes with various chromophores are decomposed using tio2 2 137 numerous studies have been carried out using tio2 sonophotocatalytic systems for the decolorization of different dyes for instance acid blue 113 99 100 acid red 88 83 alizarin reactive red 103 direct blue 71 106 malachite green 45 108 109 methyl orange 66 116 reactive black 5 118 reactive blue 19 120 reactive red dye 198 122 reactive red 2 123 basic blue 9 104 rhodamine b 44 and rhodamine 6g 127 were degraded by sonophotocatalytic treatment using tio2 other than tio2 zno has been extensively applied as a photocatalytic material for the degradation of organic pollutants due to its stability low cost high photosensitivity high catalytic activity and higher light absorption spectrum compared to tio2 29 direct blue 71 82 methylene blue 112 methyl orange 117 rhodamine b 49 124 were degraded using zno photocatalyst under sonophotocatalysis the disadvantage of single material photocatalysts is their wide band gap ranging from 3 to 5 ev which makes them only uv excited 28 137 in response to this limitation doping can be a good choice to promote the performance of the photocatalyst and develop the second category of photocatalysts 89 doping or surface modification decreases the band gap energy of single component materials to shift the photoabsorption band from uv to visible range 11 dinesh et al 102 investigated the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of acid yellow 23 with fe doped with zno they reported that the removal efficiencies of 91 and 98 were achieved for individual zno catalyst and fe zno composite catalyst respectively after 60 min sonophotocatalytic treatment the high performance of the fe zno composite was attributed to its uniform shape significant surface area and high capacity of uv light absorption in another work wantala et al 115 studied the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of methyl orange mo using pure and doped tio2 they observed that mo degraded completely after 1 h sonophotocatalytic process using 0 1 fe tio2 catalyst similarly kristianto et al 111 wang et al 113 sabzehmeidani et al 125 and shah 92 improved the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes using multi component photocatalysts the use of multi component photocatalysts in suspension mode suffers from the agglomeration of the photocatalyst and requires extra equipment and energy for separating and recycling the photocatalysts 104 these drawbacks could be minimized by immobilizing the catalyst on support or thin film like glass substrates metallic supports zeolites photoelectrodes etc photocatalysts immobilized over solid support materials are considered as the third category of photocatalysts immobilization of catalysts results in improved removal efficiency thereby reducing overall operating costs 138 139 yuan et al 45 studied the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue using a tio2 nanotube array they reported that the synergistic effect was found to be 22 1 at 27 khz and the catalyst also showed good recyclability eshaq and elmetwally 94 demonstrated that preparation of ionic liquid 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium acetate modified cuprous oxide immobilized over graphitic carbon nitride bmim oac cu2o g c3n4 ensured the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dye methylene blue saponjic et al 101 reported that ag tio2 nanoparticles immobilized on corona pre treated polypropylene non woven fabric provided excellent dye removal efficiency and superior reusability during sonophotocatalysis 4 3 3 influence of light intensity photocatalytic activity depends on the energy supplied by light irradiation electron hole pairs are produced in the conduction band and valence band of photocatalysts when they absorb energy equal to or higher than the band gap the photon energy absorbed by the photocatalyst depends on its wavelength and light source intensity therefore the selection of energy light sources such as solar and visible and many others with the appropriate light intensity and wavelength is a crucial factor in efficient photocatalysis 89 124 the effect of light sources i e conventional blacklight fluorescent lamp uv bl light emitting diode uv led and solar light on photocatalytic dye degradation have been extensively studied uv leds are utilized in various photocatalytic based mechanisms as a strong and environment friendly light source additionally leds are cost effective options with a longer working lifespan compared to conventional light supplies the light intensity is a major factor in the photodegradation that can affect the absorption performance of the catalyst and photocatalytic activity of the e h pairs 21 89 obviously the enhancement of uv intensity causes higher electrons to be excited from the catalyst and higher oh radicals to be generated resulting in increased photocatalytic oxidation 140 however at higher light intensities the photodegradation rate is independent of the irradiation intensity and the increment of irradiation intensity enhances the photocatalytic activity only up to a certain degree 2 this phenomenon occurs due to the e h recombination competitiveness on the catalyst surface with varying the light intensity and leads to a reduction in the photocatalytic efficiency 141 research studies have found that at low irradiation intensities the photocatalytic performance of e h pairs is predominant and the recombination rate of charge carriers is negligible whereas the recombination rate is enhanced at greater intensities 51 as an example yetim and tekin 48 examined the effect of light intensity on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of an artificial effluent solution containing acid black 1 and acid blue 62 dyestuffs they found that the photodegradation rate increased with an increment of the light intensity they explained that the increase of light intensity provided more possibility of hydroxyl radical production on the catalyst surface and led to the increased extent of degradation 4 3 4 influence of ultrasound frequency many researchers have studied the effect of ultrasound frequency on dye decolorization for instance yuan et al 45 evaluated the effect of us frequency in the range from 18 to 30 khz on sonophotocatalytic decolorization of methylene blue and they reported that the optimal frequency for the mb degradation was 27 khz wang et al 113 reported that the change of ultrasonic frequency over the range of 20 48 khz frequency showed a negligible effect on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of methyl orange from these results it can be concluded that the us frequency may influence the decolorization efficiency the impact of frequency on dye decolorization can be described by the fact that acoustic cavitation activity and rates of hydroxyl radical production are directly related to the us frequency in general the lifetime and size of the acoustic bubbles diminish with increasing the us frequency which result in the reduction of cavitation intensity and maximum temperature created inside a collapsed cavitation bubble the consequence of these conditions is usually a lower yield of oh radicals 142 143 the magnitude of the optimal frequency to achieve maximum sonochemical effects is not only dependent on the type of the pollutant but also the reactor design and the operating conditions according to several studies sonolysis in the frequency range of 200 500 khz results in the maximum hydroxyl radicals production which is suited for effective pollutant degradation 144 145 additionally at relatively high us frequency intensified mass transfer caused by acoustic streaming eddy currents turbulent convection and other physical effects leads to faster release of reactive free radicals into the bulk liquid solution and also helps in cleaning the catalyst however as the frequency of ultrasound rises the power required to initiate cavitation events increases and thus the sonolysis may become uneconomical in a high frequency operation the use of multiple frequencies generates more intense cavitation and thus results in higher sonochemical reaction yields hence dual or triple frequency sonoreactors should be used to achieve comparable outcomes to a single very high frequency transducer in other words the use of multiple frequency operation could be a better option than the single frequency operation when higher cavitational intensities are required for the application 146 for degradation of hydrophobic organic contaminants the optimal ultrasonic frequency is related to the optimal oh yield and also the effective mass transfer of a reactive solute from the bulk liquid to the vapor phase 147 overall it is recommended that a combination of low frequency ultrasound typically 20 khz with other frequencies in the range of 50 200 khz should be utilized for dye degradation for providing enhanced cavitational activity and the mass transfer rates 43 146 4 3 5 influence of acoustic power based on the papers reviewed acoustic power is a crucial parameter in the performance of the sonophotocatalytic system for dye degradation the results indicate that sonophotocatalytic activity is enhanced proportionately with an increment of acoustic power an increase in the acoustic power results in an improvement in the rate and the number of cavities and consequently enhances the concentration of the h and oh radicals by dissociation of water molecules furthermore as acoustic power increases the bubble size increases resulting in a higher implosion temperature 148 150 additionally the intensity of turbulence is effectively intensified at enhanced acoustic power which promotes the mass transfer rate of target pollutant molecules between the bulk solution and the catalyst surface 149 finally the higher power density of us induces the fragmentation and deaggregation of the photocatalyst which results in the increment of its surface area and the quantity of absorbed photons by the catalyst in other words higher acoustic power increases the generation rate of hydroxyl radicals arising from the catalyst surface and thus accelerates the sonophotocatalytic reaction by both activating and continuously cleaning the catalyst surface overall in terms of acoustic power it is suggested that an optimum level of ultrasonic power is required for sonophotocatalytic decolorization which depends on the dye type and the reactor geometry the effect of acoustic power on dye decolorization has been a subject of numerous studies asgari et al 50 studied the effect of acoustic power 100 300 w l 1 on the degradation of acid blue 113 ab113 dye by the us uv zno ps process and also reported that high degradation efficiency of ab113 was achieved by rising the us power density in the range of 100 300 w l 1 they explained these results by the enhancement in the number of cavities and consequently concentration of free radicals under the circumstances of the larger acoustic power similar results were reported by abdul et al 121 madhavan et al 83 berberidou et al 108 bejarano pe and sua 109 cheng et al 116 and ahmedchekkat et al 44 from the research carried out by siddique et al 120 on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of reactive blue 19 rb19 using tio2 catalyst with ultrasonic power range of 120 300 w the maximum 73 dye decolorization was obtained at 240 w however by enhancing us power from 240 to 300 w no remarkable improvement in the dye decolorization was observed 4 3 6 influence of initial dye concentration based on the studies examined the sonophotocatalytic decomposition efficiency can be strongly affected by the initial dye concentration the initial rate of decomposition in sonophotocatalysis increases with an increment of the initial dye concentration till an optimum value at low concentrations of dye the recombination of oh radicals in the cavity is more remarkable than the oh radical interaction with pollutants in the solution bulk however as the concentration of dye is enhanced the portion of hydroxyl radicals that take part in recombination reactions would diminish and the possibility of collision between dye molecules and hydroxyl radical increases leading to an enhancement of the decolorization efficiency 151 152 however further increase in the dye concentration beyond the optimum value results in a decrease in the decolorization efficiency because more dye molecules compete for the reaction with oh radicals in the bulk liquid alternatively at higher dye concentrations the formation of reaction intermediates increases so the competition for the occupation of limited active sites increases 2 additionally at high dye loading the main portion of light be absorbed by dye molecules rather than by the catalyst surface reducing photocatalytic activity in other words at high initial dye concentration dye molecules act as internal filters which avoid the distribution of light and make the small fraction of photons reach the surface active sites 49 51 it is necessary to properly optimize the dye loading through the pilot scale experiments as the optimum concentration will be strongly dependent on the dye structure numerous experimental studies have also demonstrated that the maximum decolorization efficiency can be achieved using an optimized initial dye loading over a range of 0 1 100 μm in literature there are several research investigating the impact of initial dye loading on the sonophotocatalytic degradation efficiency for instance ahmedchekkat et al 44 observed a reduction in the decolorization percentage from 94 to 60 when the rhodamine b loading was enhanced from 10 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 similar decreasing trends in the decolorization rate with an increment of initial concentration during sonophotocatalysis were obtained by ertugay and akar 106 berberidou et al 108 wang et al 113 kritikos et al 118 abdul et al 121 and zhang et al 153 in another study kumawat et al 47 investigated sonophotocatalytic degradation of nigrosine dye with initial concentrations of 1 0 10 5 m to 4 5 10 5 m they reported 3 0 10 5 m as the optimum initial loading of nigrosine dye for the highest decolorization rate also they attributed the higher degradation rates of nigrosine dye at a concentration of 3 0 10 5 m to more availability of dye molecules for the degradation they declared that further increase in dye concentration beyond 3 0 10 5 m caused retardation of the reaction because of reduction in collisions between the dye molecules and oh radicals additionally matto ghasemi et al 46 observed an optimum initial concentration of 60 mg l 1 for the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of begazol black b siddique et al 120 conducted an experiment on the decolorization of reactive blue 19 using sonophotocatalysis in aqueous solutions experiment outcomes showed that the decolorization rate was reduced with an increase in the initial dye loading and the optimum dye loading was found 100 mg l 1 4 3 7 influence of solution ph according to the literature review the solution ph is another important parameter affecting the decomposition rate and the overall efficiency of the sonophotocatalytic dye degradation initial solution ph plays a crucial role in the photocatalytic characteristics ionization state of a contaminant activity and solubility of oxidative agents 50 the effect of ph is mainly attributed to the electrostatic attractive forces between the semiconductor surface organic molecules and reactive radicals during the sonophotocatalysis surface charge properties and the aggregation of the photocatalysts particles are associated with the ph of a given solution 2 51 the ph effect on the catalyst surface charge could be described on the basis of the point of zero charge pzc below phpzc the catalyst surface is positively charged whereas above phpzc the surface is negatively charged 50 for instance the point of zero charge for tio2 particles is about 6 8 therefore below phpzc ph 6 8 or under acidic medium the catalyst surface gets positively charged while above that it is negatively charged according to eqs 21 and 22 given below 11 21 tioh surface h tioh 2 surface 22 tioh surface oh tio surface h 2 o hence ph values below phpzc would contribute to the electrostatic attractive force between the positively charged tio2 and the anionic dye resulting in strong dye adsorption and subsequently the photodegradation efficiency is enhanced an additional explanation for the effect of varied initial ph can be related to the protonation or deprotonation state of the organic pollutants which change their adsorption characteristics and degradation rate 102 the initial solution ph also influences the generation rate of hydroxyl radicals during sono degradation and hence affects the decolorization efficiency acidic ph leads to a higher formation rate of oh radicals by minimizing their recombination in other words at higher ph higher quantities of oh radical self recombine to generate h2o2 leading to a reduction in the quantum of the oh radicals available for the desired removal reaction 154 155 moreover the oxidizing potential of the oh radical in an acidic medium is higher than the basic condition where the standard potential of oh radical has been reported to be 2 59 and 1 64 v at ph of zero and 14 respectively 50 furthermore high ph solutions may create more free radical scavengers and results in the diminution of the oh concentration 156 157 therefore higher quantities and higher reactivity of oh radicals in the acidic medium than that at neutral and alkaline ph promote removal kinetics under ultrasonic irradiation similar trends of an enhancement in the extent of dye decolorization under acidic conditions during sonophotocatalysis were observed in literature saponjic et al 101 studied the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of dye acid orange7 ao7 in acidic ph 4 0 and alkaline ph 9 0 conditions and reported that discoloration of the solution was enhanced in acidic conditions they attributed this to the contribution of electrostatic interaction on dye adsorption under acidic conditions another study of the ph effect on the dye removal was conducted by ertugay and acar 82 they observed that the complete decolorization of direct blue 71 db71 was achieved at an operating ph of 2 5 whereas at ph 5 5 the degradation rate was reduced up to 29 similarly verma et al 103 he et al 66 abdul et al 121 kaur and singh 122 also revealed that the best efficiency of the sonophotocatalytic dye degradation was achieved at acidic ph dhanasekar et al 110 studied sonophotocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue mb at various initial ph values 3 5 9 and 11 they found that the dye decolorization was not much influenced by the initial ph and the variation observed was only 2 3 the ph 7 near the point of zero charge of the catalyst was found to be favorable for the efficient decolorization of mb dye the result showed a good agreement with the reports by gonzález and martínez 104 and sabzehmeidani et al 125 4 3 8 influence of temperature recent studies have shown that the rate of sonophotocatalytic decolorization is strongly temperature dependent in general the solution temperature influences important factors during sonolysis such as cavitation energy cavitational threshold the quantity of dissolved gas and vapor pressure an increment of bulk liquid temperature causes a reduction in the viscosity and surface tension of the bulk liquid liquid with low viscosity and surface tension generally has a lower cavitation threshold so that cavities are more readily generated moreover the high reaction temperature improves the mass transfer of the generated free radicals to the bulk solution and promotes the oxidation rate of dye molecules thus resulting in a higher extent of degradation on the other hand high operating temperature causes the generation of cavities that have more vaporous nature and consequently reduces the intensity of the cavitation in fact the vapor content within the cavity increases as the temperature rises for reactants that are volatile in nature the reduction in the collapse intensity in terms of temperature and pressure is mainly on account of the increase in the vapor pressure thus increasing operating temperature could lead to a decline in the temperature of the hot spot thereby reducing the sono degradation efficiency 158 160 it should be noted that the use of the raised temperature delays the e h recombination a detailed analysis of the published papers indicates that the substantial extent of dye degradation can be obtained using sonophotocatalysis over a range of 20 40 c many researchers have examined the influences of temperature on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes for instance mokhtar et al 112 studied the effect of operating temperature on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue they found that the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue increased by increasing temperature and 100 degradation was achieved in 40 min at 45 c they attributed the increased degradation to the retard of e h recombination at high solution temperature by the production of cavities on the catalyst surface which led to the generation of greater amounts of free radicals and catalyst surface cleaning the effect of reaction temperature on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue was studied by eshaq and elmetwally 94 their study revealed that the first order degradation rate constant of mb increased from 0 0938 min 1 to 0 2649 min 1 with increasing the reaction temperature from 15 c to 55 c furthermore similar results were reported by wu 123 and ahmedchekkat et al 44 4 3 9 influence of time in general the sonophotochemical degradation efficiency is a function of time and the extent of dye decolorization is enhanced with increasing the reaction time the positive effects of irradiation and sonication time on the dye degradation can be attributed to the more exposure of the dye molecules to the ultrasonication and the light irradiation as well as more yielding of reactive radicals which result in higher dye removal efficiency furthermore prolonging the irradiation time improves the photocatalytic performance by increasing the sensitivity of the photocatalyst nanoparticle in fact prolonged reaction times provide a larger opportunity for more electrons to jump from the vb to the cb thereby increasing photogenerated active species 21 in addition the results of sonophotocatalytic degradation of dye show that the decolorization profile could be considered in three distinct regimes the first step step 1 is represented by a sharp enhancement in the dye decolorization efficiency which is caused by the high concentrations of dyes however with the prolonging of the reaction time step 2 the decolorization proceeds at slower rates at the end of the sonophotocatalytic degradation process step 3 the yield of dye decolorization remains relatively unchanged in other words since the dye content is comparatively high at the beginning of the process the reaction is accelerated as prolonging the degradation time the less concentration of dye is available as a result the dyes molecules undergo decolorization much slower 161 furthermore various intermediates produced during the decolorization process make limitations in the dye degradation by increasing the competitiveness with dye molecules for oxidative species it is necessary to identify the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of dyes in terms of reaction kinetics to optimize the treatment time the typical range of required reaction time for using sonophotocatalysis systems would be anywhere between 15 min and 1 h mosleh et al 96 studied the effect of radiation time 10 30 min on sonophotocatalytic decolorization of trypan blue tb and vesuvine they found that irradiation sound and or light time has a positive influence on sonophotocatalytic decolorization percentage of dyes and reported 25 min of irradiation and sonication time as an optimum treatment time in another study asgari et al 50 investigated the degradation efficiency of acid blue 113 ab113 for various treatment times and reported that degradation efficiency increased by 75 with the increment of the treatment time from 5 to 25 min they also observed that the removal efficiency of ab113 dye increased sharply during the first 20 min and then it proceeded with a slower kinetic rate zhang et al 153 guzma et al 162 observed similar results in their survey 4 3 10 influence of carbon tetrachloride ccl4 the presence of carbon tetrachloride can result in the intensification of oxidation of dye molecules under the sonophotocatalytic decolorization process by way of generation of various active species ccl4 as a hydrophobic organic compound tends to enter the collapsing bubble and undergoes degradation by direct pyrolytic dissociation resulting in large yields of highly reactive chlorine radicals 143 inside a cavitation bubble thermolytic cleavage of ccl bond in ccl4 occurs to form a large amount of cl radicals compared to the hoh bond in h2o due to the lower bond dissociation energy of ccl in ccl4 73 kcal mol 1 compared to that of hoh in h2o 119 kcal mol 1 154 the formed chlorine radicals can initiate a series of chain reactions generating highly reactive agents such as hypochlorous acid hclo chlorine and its oxidant species cl ccl3 and ccl2 which will significantly promote the degradation of pollutants in the solution reactions 23 30 143 163 23 ccl 4 us ccl 3 cl 24 ccl 4 us ccl 2 cl 2 25 ccl 3 us ccl 2 cl 26 ccl 3 ccl 3 ccl 4 ccl 2 27 ccl 3 ccl 3 c 2 cl 6 28 ccl 2 ccl 2 c 2 cl 4 29 cl cl cl 2 30 cl 2 h 2 o hclo hcl along with oh attack the additional active oxidizing agents independently attack the target organics present in the bulk solution or at interfacial regions of the cavitation bubbles and thus remarkably improve the destruction rate of contaminants 164 furthermore it has been reported that ccl4 acts as a good hydrogen atom scavenger and it has no tendency to react with oh radicals in other words ccl4 inhibits the recombination of hydrogen atoms to reform water hence the concentration of oh radicals increases in the presence of ccl4 156 165 166 however uddin and okitsu 167 recently suggested that ccl4 did not act as a hydrogen atom scavenger and explained the enhancement effect of ccl4 on the degradation of phenolic compounds by the chlorine radicals and chlorine species formed in the sonolysis of ccl4 it is also important to notice that the initial concentration of ccl4 can influence the final toxicity levels of the reaction medium if it is not utilized totally during the treatment process moreover the excessive addition of ccl4 beyond the optimum level in the medium leads to the formation of vaporous cavities due to its volatile nature consequently the great amount of ccl4 diminishes the net distribution of energy during the cavity implosion and leads to a decrease in the formation of oxidants on the other hand the high amount of intermediaries resulting from the pyrolysis of ccl4 can act as scavengers of free radicals obstructing in this way the reaction between them and pollutant molecules 44 109 hence in order to prevent the interference effects of the residual ccl4 minimize additive losses and toxicity as well as achieve maximum intensification of the extent of dye decolorization selecting the optimum dosage is a necessary design consideration the optimum level of ccl4 is mainly dependent on the type of dye reactor configuration characteristics and operating conditions especially ultrasonic intensity 156 similar results about the intensification are available in the literature for the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of different dyes bejarano perez and suarez herrera 109 performed the sonochemical and sonophotocatalytic degradation of malachite green mg and found that the rate of sonochemical and sonophotocatalytic decolorization increased about 2 5 times by the addition of 0 5 ml of ccl4 per liter of water ahmedchekkat et al 44 also observed similar results for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of rhb solution in the presence of ccl4 4 3 11 influence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the addition of hydrogen peroxide as a strong oxidizing agent during sonophotocatalysis often leads to an increment in the extent of decolorization efficiency h2o2 increases the generation rate of oh radicals which in turn promotes the extent of degradation h2o2 enhances the production rate of oh radicals in two routes firstly the reduction of h2o2 at the conduction band would generate oh radicals secondly the dissociation of h2o2 under uv irradiation or sonication would also generate oh radicals according to eqs 31 and 32 46 82 31 h 2 o 2 us 2 ho 32 h 2 o 2 hv 2 ho furthermore the added h2o2 prevents the electron hole pair e cb e vb recombination by trapping the conductive band electrons and subsequently compensates for oxygen deficiency eqs 33 and 34 46 33 h 2 o 2 e oh ho 34 h 2 o 2 o 2 ho oh o 2 while at high concentrations h2o2 can scavenge oh thus decreasing the hydroxyl radicals availability in the bulk solution h2o2 can also be directly oxidized to oxygen and proton by the valence band holes hence it is essential to determine the optimum h2o2 loading to achieve high degradation efficiency 118 35 h 2 o 2 ho h 2 o ho 2 36 ho 2 ho h 2 o o 2 37 h 2 o 2 2 h vb o 2 2 h therefore there exists an optimum h2o2 dosage where the extent of destruction of h2o2 into oh is the dominant and the scavenging effect of residual h2o2 is not significant the optimum h2o2 dosage depends on operating conditions such as ultrasonic power intensity initial concentration of pollutants type of pollutant and reactor configuration many researchers have studied the effect of the addition of hydrogen peroxide on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes for instance ghasemi et al 46 investigated the effect of initial h2o2 concentration on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of begazol black b and reported that the optimum concentration of h2o2 was 160 mg l 1 they observed that the extent of degradation increased with the addition of hydrogen peroxide up to 200 mg l 1 in other experiments reddy et al 84 reported that the degradation of naphthol blue black nbb increased with the increment in loading of h2o2 of 8 82 17 64 26 46 35 28 44 1 mmol l 1 and decreased with the further increase in h2o2 loading of 52 92 mmol l 1 a similar effect of h2o2 addition on the sonophotocatalytic degradation yield was reported by verma et al 30 and ahmedchekkat et al 44 additionally eshaq and elmetwally 94 studied the effect of hydrogen peroxide on sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in the range of 5 30 mm they found that the removal extent of mb was directly proportional to the quantity of h2o2 and the complete destruction of mb was obtained when the hydrogen peroxide was 30 mm the enhancement in the removal rate with an increment in the initial h2o2 concentration was also reported by ertugay and acar 82 kritikos et al 118 and dinesh et al 102 4 3 12 influence of dissolved gas the existence of dissolved gases in the reaction medium is an important parameter for dye degradation using sonophotocatalysis 168 some thermophysical properties of dissolved gases considerably influence the sonochemical activity namely specific heat ratio gas thermal conductivity and gas solubility higher temperatures and pressures upon cavity implosion are achieved with monatomic gases with a higher specific heat ratio than those with polyatomic gases with a lower specific heat ratio gas thermal conductivity is another crucial factor affecting cavitational collapse although compression is assumed as an adiabatic procedure during sonolysis small amounts of heat are dissipated to the bulk liquid therefore a gas with low thermal conductivity diminishes heat energy dissipation favoring increased implosion temperatures as mentioned earlier the gas solubility in a liquid medium is also an important aspect nucleation rate is enhanced by increasing gas solubility thus facilitating cavitation soluble gases provide a large number of cavitation nuclei and extensive bubble collapse and thus the oh radicals generated also enrich in general dissolved gas correlates to both the intensity of the sonochemical field and the yield of free radical production under sonolytic irradiation 70 160 169 170 in addition the rate of photooxidation upon electronic excitation of the organic substrate depends on the dissolved oxygen level as explained earlier the oxygen adsorbed on the catalyst surface reacts with photogenerated conduction band electrons e and produces superoxide o2 radicals which are responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of the contaminant 93 108 171 recently some studies have been conducted to explore the influence of dissolved gases on degradation efficiency in sonophotocatalytic systems for instance reddy et al 84 studied the impact of dissolved gas species ar o2 n2 and air on the sonophotolysis treatment of naphthol blue black nbb dye they reported that the highest decolorization 17 was achieved in the argon atmosphere as it has a high specific heat ratio of 1 66 while the lowest decolorization 6 was obtained in the nitrogen atmosphere oxygen and air atmosphere resulted in 12 and 8 decolorization respectively besides cheng et al 116 reported that the removal rate constants k of methyl orange without air was only 2 35 10 2 min 1 however even only 0 1 l min 1 gas enters to the medium the k increased to 3 27 10 2 min 1 they explained that the air flow rate significantly influenced the electron acceptor dissolved oxygen in the reaction mixture the increase of the air flow rate enhances the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the solution 4 3 13 influence of water matrix water matrix is a critical factor that can affect the sonophotocatalytic degradation kinetics a mixture of various inorganic anions and organic matter was commonly found in both natural water and wastewaters depending on the concentration and characteristics of inorganic species sonophotocatalysis can take different routes generally inorganic matrices can accelerate or inhibit the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dye molecules through the following mechanisms driving the organic compounds towards the interfacial zone of the cavitation bubbles through salting out effects scavenging action on the highly reactive radicals and or decrease catalyst s activity by filtering light as well as occupying the active superficial sites of photocatalyst 123 172 in other words the presence of the specific inorganic anion can saturate the bulk liquid medium thereby dye molecules migrate from the bulk solution to the bubble bulk interface where degradation is accelerated 173 174 on the other hand the presence of certain anions can result in serious inhibitions on sonophotocatalytic reactions anions can act as a radical scavenger competing with dye molecules for the reaction with oxidative radicals less reactive radicals are produced as a result of the scavenging reaction between inorganic anions and oxidative radicals reducing the overall degradation efficiency 175 177 the anions can also cause deactivation of the photocatalyst towards dye molecules by clogging many active sites via adsorption on the catalyst surface 178 in addition organic matrices may inhibit the sonophotochemical degradation of target contaminants the natural organic matters are not only able to compete with dye molecules for reactive oxidizing radicals but also can decrease the cavitation threshold by changing the vapor pressure thus ultimately reducing the intensity of the collapse and degradation rates 172 due to the common presence of bicarbonate phosphate sulfate nitrate and chloride ions in real dye wastewaters asgari et al 50 investigated their effect on the sonophotocatalytic ab113 decolorization efficiency under the us uv zno ps process they found that all anions caused a decrease in removal efficiency by possible quenching the reactive radicals and or by competitive adsorption on active sites of the photocatalyst their inhabitation effects on the ab113 degradation efficiency followed the order bicarbonate sulfate phosphate nitrate chloride in another study shah et al 92 evaluated the effect of sample matrix on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization efficiency of two textile dyes in the presence of cu zno as a catalyst they reported that the addition of carbonate sulfate and chloride as common anions reduced the sonophotocatalytic degradation efficiency from 100 to 92 94 and 92 respectively in the study of the sonophotocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b dye by zno in presence of salts such as na2so4 and nahco3 lops et al 49 reported similar results they claimed that the addition of common salts caused a reduction in the dye decolorization rate 4 3 14 influence of reactor configuration the configuration of the sono photoreactor is an essential factor affecting the synergistic effects and efficiency of the sonophotocatalytic process and should be aimed at providing a uniform distribution of both the cavitation activity and uv irradiation sonophotocatalytic degradation studies have been generally carried out in batch or continuous systems batch reactors are generally divided into three designs bath probe horn and cup horn system bath type sonicator is a low intensity system and a very little amount of energy is supplied to the gravitational activity within the sample in addition controlling the temperature is not easy in this approach and the cavitational activity is also limited due to the attenuation of ultrasound by the location of the reaction vessel the bath size beaker geometric dimensions diameter and wall thickness and the height of the bath liquid and the solution within the beaker hence the replicability and scalability of this configuration are very poor nevertheless sonication bath systems are usually employed for cleaning processes degassing of solution and organic synthesis owing to their availability operability and flexibility 179 180 in bath type sono photoreactor the transducer is located at the bottom of the reactor and the uv light source can be installed at either the top or aside of the reactor or immersed inside the reactors using quartz tubes reddy et al 84 employed a cylindrical 500 ml borosilicate glass for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of naphthol blue black nbb dye fig 6a the reactor was placed in the ultrasonic bath of 37 khz frequency and 200 w power uv lamp of 4 w which emitted 256 nm uv light was placed over the reactor wu 123 investigated the degradation of reactive red 2 rr2 using a similar geometry reactor which generates 49 khz frequency and 400 w power the uv lamp placed inside the quartz tube was vertically immersed inside the reactor as shown in fig 6b this type of sono photoreactor provides direct photolysis and avoids the loss of photons in the surrounding an ultrasonic horn or probe device is directly immersed into the reaction mixture and provides intense local cavitation the probe system is proper for processing relatively small volumes due to the high intensity ultrasound wave is generated more focused and not transmitted as in the case of bath sonicator 169 the probe type sonicator is characterized by providing intense local cavitation however controlling the temperature is necessary here furthermore ultrasonic probes present a risk of sample contamination by surface active impurities due to cavitational erosion of the sonicator tip and results in some chemical interference 180 the ultrasonic probe is generally used for cell disruption 55 disinfection process 181 degassing of liquids 182 crystallization processes 183 dispersion of solids into liquids 184 and emulsification of immiscible liquids 185 a probe type sono photoreactor consists of an ultrasonic probe for the generation of the ultrasonic wave and the uv light source installed either aside or inside of the reactor this type of sono photoreactor provides higher energy directly to the system as compared to the bath type sonicator chen and huang 186 used a probe type sono photoreactor having 88 w power and 20 khz frequency fig 7a twelve uv lamps which emitted 254 nm uv light were vertically installed surrounding the reactor this configuration was used for providing uniform uv light irradiation ertugay and acar 106 studied the sonophotocatalytic degradation of direct blue 71 by a probe type sono photoreactor which generates 20 khz frequency and 750 w power fig 7b two ultraviolet lamps of 254 nm wavelength were submerged in the reactor to avoid the emission of uv light to the surrounding berberidou et al 108 investigated the degradation of malachite green using a unique sono photoreactor fig 7c in which the ultrasonic probe was immersed in the axial position inside the sono photoreactor while the uv lamp of 9 w with the maximum wavelength of 365 nm was kept at the lowermost side of the reactor fig 7d represents the reactor geometry employed by ahmedchekkat et al 44 to study the sonophotocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b the reactor was configured with an ultrasonic probe of 20 khz frequency at the bottom side a 15 w uv lamp that emitted 352 nm wavelength was submerged inside the reactor they reported that the propagation of ultrasound through the novel sono photoreactor improves photocatalytic decolorization the cup horn system is a combination of bath and probe systems which can deliver direct and indirect sonication a cup horn improves temperature control and provides powerful sonication without any contamination by the metal impurity 169 181 187 multiple samples can be sonicated indirectly when the cup is filled with water and samples are placed in vials just above the titanium horn therefore the ultrasonic energy is produced in water then crosses the wall of the sample tube and is transferred indirectly to the sample medium 70 182 alternatively samples can be placed within the cup for direct sonication cup horn type sonoreactor provides the maximum degradation of contaminants as compared to the probe and bath type reactors under the same condition due to the uniform energy distribution and the lower spatial variation in the solution 188 ahmedchekkat et al 44 investigated the sonophotocatalytic destruction of rhb using three different sono photoreactor configurations i e horn bath and cup horn type ultrasonicators they reported that the best rhb degradation rate in the aqueous solution occurred in the cup horn reactor they explained their observations by the strong turbulence of catalyst nanoparticles due to the intense acoustic streaming in the focal region the continuous flow reactors are useful for the treatment of large scale wastewater gonzalez and martinez 104 used a 150 ml capacity continuous sono photoreactor included an ultrasonic probe of 20 khz frequency and 76 w power a 15 w uv lamp with an emission wavelength of 352 nm was combined with the probe system in recirculation operation this configuration is shown in fig 8a this type of sono photoreactor allowed the evaluation of the sono photo and sonophotocatalytic degradation of basic blue 9 and provided the uniform distribution and high penetration of uv light to the solution mosleh and rahimi 96 employed a continuous flow loop sono photoreactor which consisted of a 25 khz ultrasonic bath and blue led with 465 470 nm wavelength and aeration pump as presented in fig 8b the continuous flow loop reactor increased turbulence and agitation in the system and consequently enhanced the mass transfer rate most of the studies describing the sonophotocatalytic destruction of dyes have been performed in the laboratory scale using either high intensity probe or bath systems using the novel design or configuration of the sonoreactor is one of the effective ways for commercial operations since large volumes of effluents must be processed continuous reactors rather than batch reactors or at least reactors running in a recirculating mode are preferred for wastewater applications it is recommended to enhance the efficiency of acoustic energy over a large volume using multiple transducers multiple transducers with multi frequency irradiations in the range of 20 200 khz significantly promote the uniformity and intensity of the acoustic cavitation in comparison to the single piezoelectric transducer operation and thus this design is a promising alternative for scale up of conventional sonoreactors to achieve synergism it is better to use ultrasound and uv or solar irradiation at the same time this procedure would also keep the catalyst clean in the process resulting in better degradation efficiency it is preferable to use configurations that result in a uniform distribution of uv irradiation an annular placement of uv and ultrasonic irradiation sources would be a suitable geometry to consider large scale designs can also involve parabolic type reflectors for use in direct sunlight 4 4 mineralization and degradation pathway in order to precisely evaluate the mineralization of dyes during the degradation total organic carbon toc analyses are usually utilized the most common way of estimating the mineralization is to monitor the reduction in toc which is performed via a toc analyzer toc is an indicative measure of the carbon amount in organic compounds which can accurately reflect the total amount of organic compounds in the solution the efficiency of toc removal is determined using eq 38 90 189 38 toc removal t 0 t t t 0 100 where t0 and tt represent the toc content in the initial and degraded samples at the specified treatment time respectively the studies show that the sonophotocatalytic process has great potential for the mineralization of dyes for instance sathishkumar et al 100 reported that 2 03 and 2 20 fold enhancement in the mineralization was achieved for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of acid blue 113 in the presence of pr3 loaded tio2 when compared with the sonolysis and photocatalysis processes eren 119 observed 43 5 and 62 8 of dye mineralization after 2 h treatment using us uv zno h2o2 and us uv fe2 systems respectively whereas mineralization was not seen in individual processes i e sonolysis or photocatalysis even for a long treatment period 4 h the analysis of dye intermediates and the investigation of sonophotocatalytic degradation pathways are conducted by lc ms ms hplc esi ms or gc ms the sonophotocatalytic degradation pathways of dyes have been widely reported for instance madhavan et al 83 proposed the degradation pathway of acid red 88 after 0 2 h treatment by sonophotocatalytic process under the following conditions ar88 0 09 mm tio2 1 g l 1 acoustic power 55 mw ml 1 and ph 2 7 the degradation products of acid red 88 were analyzed according to the mass spectrometer analysis and a possible reaction network was proposed fig 9a based on the results of ms the formation of mono and di hydroxylated products was identified for the ar88 degradation by the sonophotocatalytic process they reported that sonophotocatalysis resulted in the formation of products with m z values of 175 223 239 255 378 394 396 412 and 428 the hydroxylation and hydroxyl radical attack were commonly suggested as the major routes for the formation of intermediates based on the results of gc ms analysis berberidou et al 108 proposed a degradation pathway of malachite green by the sonophotocatalytic process after 30 min treatment at the conditions of mg 0 09 mm tio2 0 5 g l 1 ultrasonic power 135 w and ph of 5 5 fig 9b they reported that radical attack to the central carbon atom and the dimethylamino group of mg and subsequent demethylation and oxidation were the typical fragmentation pathway of mg moreover they found that mg decomposition resulted in the formation of n n dimethyl benzenamine 4 dimethylamino benzophenone n n dimethyl benzenamine benzenamine nitrobenzene and 4 amino benzophenone 4 nitro benzophenone benzophenone benzaldehyde and benzene he et al 66 proposed seven main products generated during the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methyl orange fig 9c analysis of the structure and the m z values of intermediates indicated that hydroxylation and or demethylation were responsible for the sonolytic photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation of mo molecules they also analyzed by products from the degradation of mo after 60 min sonophotocatalysis at ph 2 the tio2 loading the ultrasonic frequency and the power were 1 mg ml 1 213 khz and 55 mw ml 1 respectively they reported that seven organic intermediates were detected with the peak of m z 276 m z 290 m z 292 m z 306 m z 308 m z 320 and m z 322 respectively siddique et al 120 conducted a comprehensive by product analysis of the sonophotocatalytic degradation of reactive blue 19 using gc ms under the following reaction conditions initial ph 4 dye 100 mg l 1 tio2 300 mg l 1 us power 240 w and treatment time 120 min they illustrated the degradation pathway of rb19 for the obtaining of selected by products including isobenzofuran 1 3 dione 2 3 dihydronaphthalene 1 4 dione benzoic acid benzaldehyde and acetic acid fig 9d 4 5 kinetics of sonophotocatalytic dye degradation based on several experimental results the kinetics of sonolysis photocatalysis and sonophotocatalysis for the decolorization of various dyes can be explained by langmuir hinshelwood l h which is the most suitable kinetic model for investigating the destruction process of pollutants and reaction rates obey pseudo first order kinetics by considering steady state conditions 190 191 mohamed et al 112 indicated that the degradation of methylene blue dye at zno 70 cnt hybrid by the sono photo and sonophotocatalysis followed a first order kinetic model and rate constants were 0 015 0 0193 and 0 017 min 1 respectively a similar study conducted by wang et al 114 showed that the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methyl orange in the presence of carbon nanotube tio2 followed the first order kinetics and the kinetic constant of the photocatalysis and sonophotocatalysis were 0 00787 and 0 01118 min 1 respectively degradation kinetics of the sonophotocatalysis was a first order kinetic model in the study examined by eren 119 kaur and singh 122 wu 123 and ahmad et al 124 the general formula of the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model is given by eq 39 39 r d d c d dt k a i a k d c d 1 k d c d where rd reflects the degradation rate of the dye mg l min 1 cd corresponds to the dye concentration mg l 1 specified reaction time ka is the reaction rate constant mg m2 l w min 1 kd is the adsorption constant of the dye l mg 1 onto the catalyst ia is light intensity w m 2 and t is the irradiation time min if the competition of by products for adsorption is considered 192 40 r d d c d dt k a i a k d c d 1 k d c d k i c i where ki and ci reflect the adsorption equilibrium constant and the concentration of various intermediates respectively beltran heredia et al 193 proposed the assumption of equal adsorption coefficients for all organic species and intermediates as follows 41 k d c d k i c i k d c d 0 in this equation cd0 represents the primary dye concentration mg l 1 by introducing eq 41 into eq 40 we will have 42 r d d c d dt k a i a k d c d 1 k d c d 0 k p c d ln c 0 c k p t 43 k p k a i a k d 1 k d c d 0 if the light intensity used is considered to be constant 44 k c k a i a eq 43 can therefore be rewritten as 45 k p k c k d 1 k d c d 0 the linear form of eq 45 can be expressed as 46 1 k p 1 k c k d 1 k c c d 0 the arrhenius expression which shows the relationship between the pseudo first order kinetic constant and the reaction temperature is represented as follows eq 47 47 k a exp e a rt where k a ea r and t reflect the rate constant min 1 the frequency factor the activation energy kj mol 1 the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k 1 and the reaction s absolute temperature k respectively the dependence of reaction kinetics on sonolysis power is usually expressed by the following relation 194 195 48 e w 1 b w u c where b c are constants wu represents ultrasonic power and ew reflects the ultrasonic enhancement factor calculated as 49 e w k utrasound k non ultrasound by combining eqs 47 48 and 49 the following is obtained 50 k a 0 1 b w u c exp e rt by combining eqs 50 and 43 are

appropriate for use in the industry an economically viable technology requires low investments and operating costs for its commercialization as well as a short treatment time for the degradation of the organic pollutant several studies have shown that using a sonophotocatalytic process for wastewater treatment is technically feasible however there are a few reports that discuss cost estimation analysis and economical feasibility of sonophotocatalysis for large scale operations 197 mahamuni and adewuyi 198 estimated the cost of wastewater treatment using sono based advanced oxidation processes they calculated the costs of a treatment plant with a capacity of 1000 l min 1 the cost estimate was performed based upon rate constants the time required for 90 elimination of pollutants and specific energy the total cost was estimated by taking into account the capital and operating and maintenance costs of wastewater treatment they found that ultrasound in conjunction with various aops for the treatment of dye containing wastewater was more cost effective than the use of ultrasound alone whereas the total costs for 90 degradation of reactive azo dye by sonolysis and photocatalysis were estimated as 4203 7 and 739 8 respectively it was only 234 2 for the sonophotocatalytic process in another study asgari et al 50 assessed the cost needed to reach 90 elimination of ab113 by the sonophotocatalytic treatment process the cost to achieve the target degradation by us uv zno and ps processes were estimated as 214 2 43 8 1690 5 and 1064 per cubic meter respectively the total cost of electrical energy and chemicals for such a treatment using the us uv zno ps process were estimated to be 7 1 and 147 5 per cubic meter respectively hence it can be concluded from the analysis that sonophotocatalysis is economically more attractive than individual approaches for wastewater treatment sonophotocatalysis remarkably reduces the contact time needed to achieve the desired dye degradation efficiency compared to single approaches thus it results in a reasonable reduction in the reactor capacity required for treatment on an industrial scale and consequently in the capital cost of the equipment involved for the treatment process 50 131 4 7 treatment of textile wastewater by sonophotocatalysis as mentioned earlier the textile industry is a major industry that largely releases dye containing effluents affecting the environment and human health 8 textile effluents are rich in salts metals total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total organic carbon toc and have a quite low bod cod ratio hence after the treatment processes it is essential to compare physico chemical parameters with the standard values for discharging color containing wastewater to the aquatic system 26 35 table 2 summarizes the typical characteristics of the actual textile effluent it should be mentioned that characteristics of textile wastewater vary and depend on the process equipment fabric chemicals etc 199 some authors have examined the potential of sonophotocatalysis for the treatment of real textile effluents for instance reddy et al 84 studied the practical applicability of the us fe tio2 uv system for the treatment of actual textile effluents they reported that the sonophotocatalysis was effective in the term of toc removal and 91 toc removal was achieved with 3 g l 1 of fe tio2 1 7 similarly dinesh et al 201 treated real textile wastewater using the sonophotocatalytic technique in the presence of 3 g l 1 fe doped bi2o3 and 6 g l 1 peroxymonosulfate results showed that 77 and 91 reduction of the toc and cod were achieved respectively in 180 min the study of shah et al 92 indicated that sonophotocatalysis could remove 91 of industrial sample under optimal conditions asgari et al 50 assessed the performance of the us uv zno ps process for the treatment of real textile wastewater they reported that the 96 6 and 97 1 reduction of cod and toc was obtained after 5 and 7 h of sonophotocatalysis respectively in addition the us uv zno ps process increased the bod cod ratio from 0 15 to 0 61 after 90 min reaction time in another study chen and huang 186 evaluated the feasibility of nitrotoluene degradation in industrial wastewater using sonophotocatalysis their findings demonstrated a complete degradation after 8 h sonophotocatalysis at tio2 3000 mg l 1 us power 110 w cm 2 light intensity 96 w and o2 300 ml min 1 the results indicate the great potential of sonophotocatalysis to enhance the mineralization and biodegradability of wastewater along with the dye degradation finally it can be concluded that sonophotocatalysis can be proposed as an efficient and promising approach both for decolorization and destruction of complex compounds in the dye effluent 5 path forward and research needs there are multiple aspects in the practical utilization of sonophotocatalysis for dye decolorization that need to be considered in the future numerous important subjects where future research should be addressed are pointed below a detailed overview of the existing literature related to the sonophotocatalytic destruction of dyes demonstrates that remarkable improvement in terms of increased decolorization efficiency the decrement in the treatment time and the elimination of the drawbacks associated with individual operations can be obtained by the sonophotocatalytic processes currently conventional configurations of batch sonoreactors namely bath and horn type are the most common reactor design used which may not be effective at a large scale operation as mentioned earlier probe sonicators operating at high intensities and low frequencies suffer from the drawback that the acoustic energy cannot be transmitted more than a few centimeters beyond the delivery tip surface another limitation for the industrialization of sonolysis is the cavitational erosion of the horn surface and the particle shedding with the continuous operation resulting in the possibility of failure and the need for frequent costly maintenance or the replacement of the probe therefore there is a fundamental requirement to improve not only the high power sonicator but also suitable reactor designs that can be operated simply and reliably for large scale dye treatments thus further investigations should be directed towards the improvement of sonicators which will be technically sophisticated and have a higher power intensity a larger radiating surface and substantial cavitation efficiency besides at the full scale the sono photoreactor should provide a uniform distribution of the acoustic cavitation and photon energy effective interactions between the dye and the photocatalyst and residence time to destroy a large amount of wastewater through the sonophotocatalytic process there is a need to improve the novel scaled up units using multiple low output transducers irradiating either the same or different frequencies over an extended area around the medium being sonicated continuous flow sonoreactors with multiple frequency transducers mounted in the reactor wall are recommended for larger scale processes hence running several units in parallel ensures the maximum and uniform acoustic energy distribution and eliminates scale up problems the exhaustive analysis of the relevant literature indicates that most studies commonly used low dye concentrations in laboratory synthetic solutions however the real effluent often contains high concentrations of dye additionally when treating actual wastewater there will be competition for the adsorption photocatalysis or the reaction with hydroxyl radical between different materials during the treatment process due to the actual wastewater containing other contaminants such as other organic matter the use of natural water solution is an important factor for verifying the reliability of sonophotocatalytic decolorization yield as it provides the study of conditions close to the industrial wastewater thereby paving the way for large scale application of sonophotocatalysis there is a need for theoretical and parametric investigations for the optimization of the process for industrial scale and long term applications the simulation of sonophotocatalytic decolorization allows studies of mass transfer coefficient acoustic pressure and temperature distribution liquid circulations etc in any new sono photoreactor with varying geometries and reaction conditions with substantial savings in time and economics cost modeling investigations provide valuable data for the process control and contribute to optimization for the maximum distribution of acoustic energy from this review it is clear that most of the investigated photocatalysts for sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes are uv active the replacement of conventional uv lamps with sunlight illumination should be considered for an energy efficient and economical sonophotocatalysis in the future doping and composite semiconductors provide the possibility of using solar irradiation which can lead to a cost effective operation especially for industrial scale operations consequently the use of multi component photocatalytic systems is suggested as compared to the conventional single oxide forms thus various catalysts should be assessed for the improvement of sunlight photo decolorization for the commercialization of sonophotocatalysis it is also necessary to utilize the photocatalyst with high stability and recyclability that can be efficiently reused in the treatment process recycling remarkably decreases the cost of photocatalysis especially for large scale operations therefore further researches are required to establish efficient photocatalyst separation recovery and recycling at an industrial scale to promote the recyclability of photocatalyst and overcome the post separation difficulties related to the first and second categories of photocatalyst the immobilized catalysts can be an effective alternative approach the third category of photocatalyst holds enormous potential for industrial applications particularly in the dye removal process however there is a lack of literature on different immobilization techniques such as sol gel solvent deposition thermal spraying electrophoresis and chemical and physical vapor deposition to develop a pure and composite photocatalytic system furthermore few studies evaluate various support materials such as glass clay ceramics zeolites metallic agents polymers carbonaceous materials and cellulosic materials on photocatalytic activity therefore more investigation into these immobilization methods and support materials using continuous flow reactors will help assess their applicability to dye degradation and determine which is more appropriate for dye removal applications additionally more investigations could be conducted for synthesizing new supporting materials that can minimize the mass transfer restriction of immobilized photocatalysis from the perspective of industrial scale applications of sonophotocatalysis for the destruction of dyes an essential aspect that needs to be evaluated is the possible formation of intermediates and harmful by products hence the identification and toxicological assessments of by products are required as a final remark the feasibility of sonophotocatalysis at full scale requires consideration undoubtedly economic viability is the main objective to achieve to be able to consider sonophotocatalytic treatment as a competitive approach towards conventional methods poor attention to energy consumption levels can be found in the literature and only a few research studies have provided economical results detailed information on overall treatment costs such as investments operating and maintenance chemicals and energy consumption costs should be estimated in future work therefore more evaluations should be carried out in order to ensure the technical and economic competitiveness of sonophotocatalysis towards conventional processes for the dye removal treatment on an industrial scale 6 conclusions in recent years there has been a growing demand for alternative and innovative techniques for dye decolorization from aqueous solutions this paper comprehensively reviewed different aspects of sonophotocatalytic dye destruction such as the mechanism its advantages and disadvantages and effects of operating parameters this review clearly indicates that sonophotocatalysis as an effective and lucrative treatment process has great potentials in the decolorization of various types of dyes the main principle of using sonophotocatalysis is to promote the generation of highly reactive radicals in water and also resolve the limitations of individual approaches according to experimental results from recent researches the efficiency of sonophotocatalytic decolorization is greatly affected by features of the pollutant reactor configuration operational parameters and water quality the maximum sonophotocatalytic decolorization can be achieved at the optimum acoustic power and catalyst dose which vary depending on the amount and the nature of the dye reactor configuration as well as the type structural characteristics of the catalyst and most of the sonophotocatalytic optimization processes can obtain high removal efficiency with low concentrations of dyes i e 0 1 100 μm low ultrasound frequencies i e 20 200 khz and acidic ph values over a temperature range of 20 40 c though the exact recommended value would be dependent on the nature of compounds and the reactor geometry furthermore the presence of additives providing additional sources of free radicals or increasing the generation rate of free radicals in the sonophotocatalytic system results in the enhancement of degradation rates this review article also reveals that the kinetics of sonophotocatalysis for decolorization of various dyes can be explained by langmuir hinshelwood l h and reaction rates usually follow the pseudo first order kinetics model most previous investigations on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of dyes were the laboratory oriented and these cannot be scaled up directly to industrial operations therefore much attention should be focused on the future on the kinetics reactor configurations energy consumption levels commercialization and scale up for practical applications declaration of competing interest

13240,over the past few decades the indiscriminate use of a large variety of synthetic dyes and their continuous input into aquatic environments has constituted a serious risk to human health and ecological systems among a variety of treatment methods for dye removal from the aqueous environment sonophotocatalysis has recently received a lot of attention due to its green and environmental friendly properties the aim of this review is to present an in depth study of the sonophotocatalytic process for the degradation of various dyes in aqueous matrices in the present study the fundamentals of sonolysis and photocatalysis for wastewater treatment and their merits and drawbacks are explained in detail along with a detailed discussion on the benefits that can be obtained using the combined approach additionally operational parameters the pathway and kinetics of the sonophotocatalytic dye degradation the cost estimation as well as the application of sonophotocatalysis for the textile wastewater treatment are discussed based on recently published works it is observed that sonophotocatalysis indeed results in the remarkable enhancement of the oxidation intensity and thus the degradation rates of dyes however its applicability in large scale wastewater treatment is limited according to findings most of the sonophotocatalytic optimization processes can achieve high removal efficiency with low concentrations of dyes i e 0 1 100 μm low ultrasound frequencies i e 20 200 khz and acidic ph values over a temperature range of 20 40 c though the exact recommended value would be dependent on the compound characteristics and the reactor geometry graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sonophotocatalysis dye degradation decolorization advanced oxidation process

extensively consumed in various industries e g textiles printing papers rubber paints cosmetics plastics leather food etc for products coloration 1 3 dyes usually have a wide structural diversity and are generally classified into various groups according to their source chemical structure and solubility as shown in fig 1 basically dyes can be divided into natural and synthetic dyes 4 5 natural dyes are frequently utilized in food industries and separated into three main categories based on their sources as plants animals and minerals 6 7 while synthetic dyes are widely used in textile industries and classified by chromophore groups in their chemical structures as azo dyes anthraquinone dyes phthalein dyes and phthalocyanine dyes etc 8 9 azo dyes containing azo bonds nn are the largest group of synthetic organic dyes 3000 different varieties and over 50 of all the dyes used in textile processing are azo dyes 1 10 in practice dyes are classified into acid dyes basic dyes cationic dyes direct dyes substantive dyes disperse dyes non ionic dyes reactive dyes vat dyes and sulfur dyes as shown in fig 1 11 despite the noticeable benefits of using dyes in different branches of industries they can be considered as a serious threat to the environment human health and aquatic ecosystems 12 13 over 700 000 tons of dye are annually produced for various industrial activities remarkable amounts of these dyes 1 20 are discharged along with effluents into main water bodies after dyeing processes 11 14 dye contaminants in water cause eutrophication reduction of photosynthesis and perturbation of aquatic life by preventing sunlight penetration into water 15 16 in other words dyes affect the photosynthetic mechanism of the aquatic ecosystem by inhibiting light penetration and reducing the amount of dissolved oxygen as a result of preventing the oxygen interchange at the surface 17 18 in addition to adverse environmental impacts most of these dyes cause health risks due to their toxic carcinogenic and xenobiotic nature 19 20 consequently there is a crying need to develop effective approaches for the treatment of dye effluents before they are released into water bodies dyes are photostable and not biologically degradable they are resistant to aerobic digestion thus implying that they are major difficult groups to be eliminated from the industrial wastewater 21 22 so far numerous physical chemical and biological treatment techniques have been investigated to decolorize dye effluents 23 conventional physical techniques such as activated carbon 24 adsorption 25 membrane filtration 26 reverse osmosis 27 pose various disadvantages such as long processing time high operating costs need for specialized equipment and generation of secondary pollution 28 29 these methods only transfer the pollutant to another phase and lack in the degradation or mineralization of dyes 30 31 unstable metabolites of chemical processes such as electrochemical 32 chlorination 33 ozonation 34 cause adverse health impacts 11 biological methods including microbiological 35 and enzymatic 36 treatments result in the incomplete degradation and the poor mineralization of by products 11 37 38 to overcome such obstacles researchers focused on developing an efficient economic and eco friendly treatment method for the degradation of dyes the physicochemical methods based on the production of reactive oxygen species ros e g h2o2 ho o2 and o3 named advanced oxidation processes aops have shown to be highly capable of oxidizing a wide range of pollutants 39 aops and their combinations such as ozonation fenton and photo fenton process ultraviolet uv h2o2 tio2 mediated photocatalysis sonolysis and sonophotocatalysis have been applied for this goal at different operational conditions 40 among various aops sonolysis as well as photocatalysis have recently received considerable attention from researchers for the elimination of organic pollutants from wastewater due to several potential advantages over conventional treatment methods 41 42 however the individual sonolysis or photolysis suffers in the lower production of ho radicals and also requires a long reaction time for complete degradation 43 44 moreover the transparency of wastewater containing dyes is low which prevents the light penetration to appreciable depth in contrast ultrasonic irradiations can penetrate deeply into the polluted wastewater to degrade organic pollutants 45 46 recent studies revealed that the combination of sonolysis and heterogeneous photocatalysis i e sonophotocatalysis helps to overcome the limitations of individual treatments and enhances the degradation rate of some organic compounds 47 during the sonophotocatalysis ultrasonic waves and light irradiation are implemented simultaneously to a system containing a photocatalyst in the sonophotocatalytic process the cavitation phenomenon possesses numerous benefits i e uniform distribution of a catalyst in the liquid medium enhancement of the surface area increasing the mass transfer cleaning the catalyst surface regeneration of active sites and enhancement of catalytic activities 48 50 hence this has led to sonophotocatalysis being the preferred approach for degrading organic pollutants among all other oxidation processes recently many researchers have studied the elimination of different dyes using sonophotocatalytic processes thus a comprehensive review of dye decolorization by sonophotocatalysis is important because the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes is influenced significantly by their unique properties as well as water quality sonication conditions and catalysts although there is an article entitled a review of the application of sonophotocatalytic process based on advanced oxidation process for degrading organic dye by zewde et al 51 it is mostly limited to the mechanism of sonophotocatalysis and also not relatively presented with detailed up to date information to the best of our knowledge such a comprehensive up to date and systematic review information on the destruction and decolorization of various dyes in aquatic systems by sonophotocatalysis has not yet been conducted this is an important gap in knowledge that the current paper intends to fill the new aspect of this review article is to cover up to date research result presentation on sonophotocatalytic degradation of various dyes and also to analyze and identify various operation conditions optimized conditions degradation pathways by products and kinetics of dye degradation by sonophotocatalysis the authors also tried to analyze the scattered available information on dye decolorization by sonophotocatalysis for the last two decades the present state of the art on the application of sonophotocatalysis in the elimination of dyes from aqueous solution is presented in this paper the present review article aims to judge the potential use of sonophotocatalysis for the decolorization of various dyes from aqueous solutions and investigates the applicability of the sonophotocatalytic process in the water treatment the first part provides a comprehensive overview of sonophotocatalysis for the decolorization of dyes and describes the synergistic effects of sonolysis combined with photocatalysis as well as the induced phenomena and the mechanism of sonophotocatalytic dye degradation then a detailed analysis of published reports in the field of sonophotocatalytic dye degradation is also provided in the next part operational parameters and optimized conditions by products degradation pathways the kinetics of sonophotocatalytic dye degradation cost estimation and feasibility of sonophotocatalysis for the treatment of the real textile wastewater are discussed in detail finally present challenges and future perspectives of sonophotocatalytic dye decolorization will be discussed as well the paper tries to present the fundamental scientific principles and useful guidelines for future research works and large scale utilization of sonophotocatalytic dye decolorization 2 sonolytic photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation mechanisms ultrasound us is a sound wave possessing frequencies greater than the human hearing threshold approximately 20 khz 52 53 the passage of ultrasound through a liquid medium causes acoustic cavitation phenomenon which consists of nucleation the rapid growth of cavities during the rarefaction cycle negative pressure period and transient implosion of the cavities during the compression phase positive pressure period 54 56 depending on the intensity and frequency of ultrasound there are two categories of acoustic cavitation bubbles namely stable and transient at high frequencies 1 mhz cavitational activity is stable and bubbles only oscillate around their resonance radius for many acoustic cycles and do not implode 57 59 the motion of gas filled bubbles during stable cavitation results in the micro streaming and eddy currents which can provide more extensive mass transfer in the medium surrounding 60 61 at low frequency ultrasound 20 khz 1 mhz transient vaporous cavities exist for a few acoustic cycles and then implode violently 57 59 fig 2a shows a schematic illustration of stable and transient cavitation 57 the propagation of low frequency ultrasound results in the enhancement of mass transfer by different hydrodynamic phenomena such as shear forces shock waves microturbulence and high speed microjets within the immediate surroundings 62 65 in addition the violent implosion of transient cavitation bubbles generates extremely high temperature and pressure 100 mpa 5000 k which leads to the degradation and pyrolytic dissociation of molecules including water in the vicinity or inside a collapsing bubble 57 66 inside the collapsing bubbles water and oxygen molecules are thermally fragmented into highly reactive free radicals h ho 2 and ho these primary radicals diffuse into bulk solutions and directly degrade some contaminants via hydroxylation and oxidation reactions 67 68 the following reactions occur during sonolysis of water reactions 1 5 69 1 h 2 o us h ho 2 o 2 us 2 o 3 o h 2 o 2 ho 4 h o 2 ho o 5 h o 2 ho 2 the trapped compounds in the cavities either undergo thermolytic degradation or react with the highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals 70 71 in the interfacial region of the cavitation bubble high temperature gradient results in condense hydroxyl radicals thereby initiating the degradation process in the liquid phase 72 73 though the temperature in the bubble liquid interface is lower than the core temperature there is an adequate high temperature to pyrolysis of the substrate hence there are two parallel pathways in the interfacial region of collapsing bubbles involving oh radical attack and pyrolysis which depends on the nature of the substrate in the bulk solution phase the reactions are basically between dissolved organic compounds and active radicals that migrate from the interfacial regions in the bulk solution free radical reactions are mainly promoted by shear forces turbulence and micro streaming moreover hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can be generated by combining oh radicals during sonolysis of the aqueous solution which is not effective in oxidizing the contaminant molecules due to its lower redox potential than oh radical reaction 6 74 77 6 2 ho h 2 o 2 generally there are two pathways for ultrasonic decomposition which depend on the basis of the physical chemical properties of the pollutants the first mechanism is pyrolysis inside the transient cavitation bubbles as well as in the interfacial region which is expected to be the main pathway for the decomposition of hydrophobic or apolar and more volatile substances the second mechanism is the hydroxyl radical generation in the cavities which subsequently diffuse into the bulk phase and oxidize the pollutants which are hydrophilic or polar and non volatile substances 78 79 fig 2b depicts the schematic illustration of the sonochemical reaction zones sonolysis operates at ambient conditions it is chemical free and does not generate secondary pollutants to the environmental matrices 41 the sonochemical methods have significant advantages such as safety cleanliness and low operating cost furthermore ultrasound is not affected by the biodegradability and toxicity of the pollutant solution 80 additionally the sonochemical process is known as a compatible and attachable technique to other treatment processes in terms of enhancing the efficiency of treatment processes 81 although ultrasonic irradiation is convenient for the removal of organic pollutants complete degradation is not achieved over short irradiation times this might be because of several reasons such as higher polarity of the organic compounds low accessibility of oh radicals or lack of dissipated power hydrophilic and or low volatile compounds treatment volume limitations and long processing time are the main drawbacks of sonochemical degradation which make it ineffective when used alone 82 83 to overcome such limitations the utilization of the sonochemical process coupled with other aop techniques can be a good choice among various combined treatment processes the combination of sonolysis with heterogeneous photocatalysis i e sonophotocatalysis has received much attention for the removal of hazardous pollutants from wastewater in the last few years 84 85 photocatalysis includes homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysis in homogeneous photocatalysis the catalysts and the reactants are in the same phase and various oxidants are employed hydrogen peroxide ozone fenton reagent sodium hypochlorite either alone or combined with uv light to generate radicals 86 87 in the heterogeneous photocatalytic process the catalyst is utilized in a different phase from the reactants this process is based on the use of semiconductor material as a catalyst and uv solar radiation to activate the catalyst to initiate a redox reaction for the intended contaminants 23 51 a semiconductor material has an electronic band structure that consists of the highest and lowest energy levels known as the valence band vb and conduction band cb respectively that are separated by band gap energy 88 89 when a photon of energy equal or greater than the band gap energy is absorbed by a semiconductor photocatalyst an electron from the valence band is excited to the conduction band with simultaneous production of a hole in the valence band hvb 11 valance band holes are able to oxidize the contaminant molecules or they can react with water and hydroxide ions to form hydroxyl radicals while at the conduction band the interaction between electrons and adsorbed molecular oxygen results in the production of superoxide radical anion o2 which can also lead to the formation of hydroxyl radical 2 48 the superoxide radical anion gets protonated forming hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and subsequently h2o2 which further dissociates into oh radicals 11 7 photo excitation tio 2 hv tio 2 e h 8 h vb oh ads ho 9 e cb o 2 oh 2 10 o 2 h ho 2 11 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 12 h 2 o 2 hv 2 ho 13 dye ho co 2 h 2 o 14 dye h vb oxidation products 15 dye e cb reduction products apart from the indirect photocatalytic oxidation of dyes by reactive radicals direct excitation of dye molecules may also occur under visible light due to their ability to absorb some of the visible lights in other words direct photolysis is another mechanism for photocatalytic dye degradation involving the dye excitation from the ground state dye to the triplet excited state dye under visible light λ 400 nm the excited dye is further converted into an oxidized radical cation dye by ejecting an electron from itself to the conduction band of the semiconductor the electron is then taken up by the oxygen molecule in the system resulting in the formation of superoxide radical anion and hydroxyl radical which are mainly responsible for the dye degradation 11 90 91 16 dye hv dye 17 dye tio 2 dye tio 2 according to several studies the indirect mechanism predominates over the direct mechanism and its contribution to the decomposition of dye is much more pronounced than the direct photolysis in comparison to the indirect mechanism photolytic decolorization proceeds very slowly due to the absence of sufficient hydroxyl radicals 92 93 the major defect of photocatalysis is the reduction of system efficiency under the long term operation this is mainly because of limited oxidation capacity and blocking of catalytically active sites by adsorption of pollutant molecules at the surface additionally the immobilized catalyst suffers from mass transfer limitation which can affect photocatalytic oxidation 2 51 other limitations of photocatalysis are including e h pair recombination rate long reaction time large amount of catalysts poor light penetration high cost of uv lamps and operational electricity 11 50 81 hence photocatalysis coupled with sonolysis sonophotocatalysis would help to overcome the drawbacks of the individual processes and synergistically combine the benefits of these techniques sonolysis induces splitting of water molecules into reactive h and oh radicals while in the case of photocatalysis oh radicals are produced from the interaction of holes and water molecules the integration of sonolysis photolysis and semiconductor catalysts results in the generation of electron hole pairs at high temperature and pressure and consequently higher formation of hydroxyl radical 84 94 therefore sonophotocatalysis results in the formation of sufficient free radicals through both band gap excitation and water dissociation and leads to completely oxidizing the majority of the pollutants compared to individual methods sonophotocatalysis offers substantial advantages such as improvement in the light penetration uniform distribution of catalyst particles acceleration of the cleavage of h2o2 and more generation of highly reactive radicals 95 97 moreover the acoustic cavitation process increases the catalyst surface due to particle fragmentation and deagglomeration and continuously cleans the photocatalyst surface during the operation 11 88 98 schematic representation of degradation mechanism by photocatalytic and sono photocatalytic processes are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively 3 research study design the primary literature survey in international electronic databases google scholar web of science science direct scopus pubmed and springer s databases was performed to find articles associated with the subject of this study from 2000 to 2020 our systematic search was conducted using english keywords search keywords in all databases included sonophotocatalysis photocatalysis sonolysis ultrasound dye removal degradation decolorization aqueous and advanced oxidation process in addition a manual search of bibliographies of potentially relevant articles was carried out to identify further papers which were not retrieved by online searches the and and or operators were used in combining the terms to make the primary outcome inclusive and restrictive article selection strategy included the title reading abstract reading and full text reading steps articles that meet the following criteria are included in the review i original research papers ii reporting of sonophotocatalysis for the dye degradation in aqueous solutions iii published in the english language iv full text articles were available in the identification step according to the title and abstract literature that mention other pollutants or approaches in their titles were excluded from the study in addition books thesis literature review non english papers papers without available full text as well as papers published prior to 2000 were rejected afterward from 673 articles collected 628 articles were eliminated by reviewing their titles or abstracts and only 45 documents were selected as probably suitable in the next stage the remaining papers were evaluated thoroughly and relevant articles were included in the study after assessing eligibility 38 papers were selected for the in depth analysis fig 5 illustrates the systematic review process in detail the main information of included studies for the sonophotocatalytic decomposition of dyes is summarized in table 1 4 sonophotocatalytic degradation of various dyes 4 1 sonophotocatalytic degradation efficiency sonophotocatalytic degradation and mineralization of various dyes have been reported recently in table 1 the degradation efficiency is determined based on the dye concentration change by measuring the characteristic absorbance peak at different reaction times as seen in table 1 all common dyes have distinct characteristic absorptions in the visible range 400 700 nm the degradation efficiency is calculated using the following equation 18 degradation efficiency c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 and c denote the dye concentration at the beginning of the process and after the specified treatment time respectively the studies show that the sonophotocatalytic process has great potential for the degradation of dyes for instance eshaq and elmetwally 94 investigated sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in the presence of bmim oac cu2o g c3n4 as a heterogeneous catalyst they found that only 30 min of sonophotocatalysis was enough to achieve a complete degradation at 25 c and ph 7 in another study eren 119 reported that complete color removal was obtained after 10 min treatment using us uv zno h2o2 system the reaction mechanism of sonophotocatalysis for the removal of dyes is mainly due to the synergistic effect between sonolysis and photocatalysis as mentioned earlier sonolysis of the aqueous solution resulted in the formation of h and oh radicals as a consequence of the pyrolysis of water molecules within the cavitation bubbles during the sonochemical decolorization of dyes in the aqueous solution oxidative degradation generally occurs via free radical attack 128 while in the case of photocatalysis the primary degradation pathway of dyes involves hydroxyl radicals and that direct oxidation by photogenerated holes therefore the combination of photocatalysis and sonolysis i e sonophotocatalysis seems to improve the decolorization rate by the increased formation of free radicals in addition sonophotocatalysis can overcome the limitations associated with each individual process 95 the main disadvantage of photocatalysis is a reduction in the catalytic activity due to the blockage of active sites on the catalyst surface by contaminants molecules the use of ultrasound in the photocatalytic system enhances turbulence in the solution thus reducing mass transfer limitations and regenerating the catalyst surface due to particle fragmentation and deagglomeration 129 furthermore the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst contributes to the enhancement in the rate of the generation of cavitation bubbles by providing additional nuclei which in turn increases the cleavage of water molecules and hydroxyl radical production the synergistic effect between sonolysis and photocatalysis enhances reactive radical production increases the generation of bubble cavities accelerates the mass transfer of dye molecules onto the catalyst surface and eliminates any impurities from its surface 130 131 during sonophotocatalysis the adsorbed dye molecule on the catalyst surface reacts with the free radicals formed through photocatalysis subsequently the shock waves created by cavitation bubbles desorb the dye molecules from the catalyst surface 105 107 on the other hand the reactive radicals produced by the implosion of cavities in the neighborhood of the photocatalyst particles can cause degradation of the dye molecules in general nanoparticles with smaller sizes and larger surface areas have more active sites which are more beneficial for sonophotocatalysis 131 4 2 evaluation of the synergistic effect during sonophotocatalytic process in order to evaluate the synergistic enhancement in the dye decolorization during sonophotocatalysis the synergistic index can be used which is the ratio of the sonophotocatalytic rate constant to the sum of the rate constants of the separate processes i e sonolysis and photocatalysis however there are variations in the calculations based on the individual processes studied the general representation of the synergy index can be given as eq 19 43 132 133 19 synergy index k sonophotocatalysis k sonolysis or sonocatalysis k photocatalysis where k reflects the pseudo first order rate constant of dye decolorization in the separate activation sonolysis or sonocatalysis and photocatalysis and hybrid activation sonophotocatalysis synergy index values 1 imply that the efficiency of the integrated approach is more than the cumulative values of the individual processes for instance marković et al 101 reported that the pseudo first order rate constant for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of acid orange 7 was 25 01 10 3 min 1 whereas the sum of rate constants for the individual approaches was 10 26 10 3 min 1 giving a synergistic index of 2 44 in another study by sathishkumar et al 99 a synergy index of 1 4 was reported for sonophotocatalytic degradation of acid blue 113 in the presence y3 tio2 nanocatalysts the rate constant of the combined treatment was reported to be 18 10 5 s 1 while the sum of rate constants for the individual sonocatalytic and photocatalytic processes was 12 8 10 5 s 1 which signifies a greater value of the rate constant during the sonophotocatalytic decolorization processes than the individual processes eshaq and elmetwally 94 reported a synergy of 30 66 during the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of methylene blue which was calculated using the following equation 20 synergy k sonophotocatalysis k sonocatalysis k photocatalysis k sonophotocatalysis 100 the decolorization rate constant k 0 151 min 1 of methylene blue was found to be higher than the sum of the rate constants of the individual processes kus tio2 kuv tio2 0 1047 min 1 berberidou et al 108 reported that the pseudo first order rate constants for the sonocatalytic photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation of malachite green under air were 11 6 10 3 112 6 10 3 and 1136 7 10 3 min 1 respectively and the synergy of 10 was obtained 4 3 influence of the operating variables the sonophotocatalytic degradation of different dyes showed that the performance of sonophotocatalysis is affected by many parameters therefore it is important to discuss the effects of operating variables in detail to optimize and apply them in the future operating conditions such as reactor design initial dye concentration light intensity type and concentration of catalyst ultrasonic frequency ultrasonic power solution temperature solution ph and operation time have been widely studied because of their remarkable influence on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes the process variables require to be properly quantified and optimized for achieving the best decolorization results with the minimum energy consumption and economic costs in this section some possible directions for optimization of all variables affecting sonophotocatalysis are outlined based on the thorough analysis of relevant studies 4 3 1 influence of catalyst dose from an economical point of view the catalyst dosage plays a crucial role in any sonophotocatalytic degradation process that should be evaluated several studies have investigated the degradation rate as a function of catalyst loading during sonophotocatalysis in general an increase in catalyst concentration enhances the available surface area or the population of active sites and intensifies the photocatalytic oxidation capability thus the enhanced loading of the catalyst in the reaction solution results in an enhancement in the production of oxidizing radicals by providing more fractions of the incident absorbed light furthermore the increment in the catalyst loading at the optimum level would contribute to the cavitational activity promotion by providing additional nuclei 44 48 however further increase in the catalyst dose beyond the optimum value increases the aggregation of particles and the extent of light scattering which results in the reduction of light absorption and photodegradation efficiency it also appears that ultrasound irradiation enhances the catalytic activity by improving the surface area of the catalyst and preventing the aggregation of the catalyst particles nevertheless sonocatalysis process does not change the pattern of dependence of the degradation rate on the catalyst dosage observed in photocatalysis 48 103 at excessive photocatalyst dosage even in the presence of ultrasound the amount of suspension turbidity increases and consequently the penetration of uv radiation decreases hence the sonophotocatalytic degradation efficiency decreases 51 131 therefore it is recommended to optimize the catalyst dosage based on the laboratory scale investigations as the optimal value is strongly dependent on the amount and the nature of the dye reactor configuration light intensity and the type as well as structural characteristics of the catalyst numerous studies have investigated the effect of catalyst dosage on the extent of dye degradation for instance asgari et al 50 investigated the effects of catalyst dosages 0 2 1 g l 1 on the decolorization of acid blue they reported 0 88 g l 1 as the optimum initial dosage of zno for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of ab113 the results revealed that following an increment in the initial concentration of zno up to 0 88 g l 1 the decolorization efficiency of ab113 also showed a linearly increasing rate and at a higher amount of catalyst concentration the decolorization rate showed a relatively constant trend in another study bagheri et al 21 investigated the effects of different loadings 1 6 mg l 1 of mwcnts zno nps and zno nps mwcnts on rb203 decolorization the results demonstrated that the optimum catalyst concentration for the dye removal with zno nps and zno nps mwcnts was 5 mg l 1 similar results were observed by ahmedchekkat et al 44 yetim and tekin 48 ertugay and acar 82 verma et al 103 abdul et al 121 kaur and singh 122 gonzalez and martinez 104 sabzehmeidani et al 125 and bokhale et al 126 a study conducted by ertugay and acar 106 reported that the yield of direct blue 71 decolorization increased from 23 to 74 with an increase in the photocatalyst loading from 0 to 1 g l 1 4 3 2 influence of catalyst design a variety of photocatalysts have been widely evaluated for the decolorization of dyes from aqueous solutions which can be classified into three categories the first category of photocatalysts is composed of single component materials e g tio2 zno and zro2 recently tio2 has attracted great interest in the photocatalytic decolorization processes owing to its non toxic nature high electrical conductivity high structural stability low cost and broad availability 134 136 however these conventional photocatalysts are activated only in the presence of uv light irradiation 250 350 nm due to their wide band gap 3 2 ev cationic and anionic dyes and dyes with various chromophores are decomposed using tio2 2 137 numerous studies have been carried out using tio2 sonophotocatalytic systems for the decolorization of different dyes for instance acid blue 113 99 100 acid red 88 83 alizarin reactive red 103 direct blue 71 106 malachite green 45 108 109 methyl orange 66 116 reactive black 5 118 reactive blue 19 120 reactive red dye 198 122 reactive red 2 123 basic blue 9 104 rhodamine b 44 and rhodamine 6g 127 were degraded by sonophotocatalytic treatment using tio2 other than tio2 zno has been extensively applied as a photocatalytic material for the degradation of organic pollutants due to its stability low cost high photosensitivity high catalytic activity and higher light absorption spectrum compared to tio2 29 direct blue 71 82 methylene blue 112 methyl orange 117 rhodamine b 49 124 were degraded using zno photocatalyst under sonophotocatalysis the disadvantage of single material photocatalysts is their wide band gap ranging from 3 to 5 ev which makes them only uv excited 28 137 in response to this limitation doping can be a good choice to promote the performance of the photocatalyst and develop the second category of photocatalysts 89 doping or surface modification decreases the band gap energy of single component materials to shift the photoabsorption band from uv to visible range 11 dinesh et al 102 investigated the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of acid yellow 23 with fe doped with zno they reported that the removal efficiencies of 91 and 98 were achieved for individual zno catalyst and fe zno composite catalyst respectively after 60 min sonophotocatalytic treatment the high performance of the fe zno composite was attributed to its uniform shape significant surface area and high capacity of uv light absorption in another work wantala et al 115 studied the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of methyl orange mo using pure and doped tio2 they observed that mo degraded completely after 1 h sonophotocatalytic process using 0 1 fe tio2 catalyst similarly kristianto et al 111 wang et al 113 sabzehmeidani et al 125 and shah 92 improved the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes using multi component photocatalysts the use of multi component photocatalysts in suspension mode suffers from the agglomeration of the photocatalyst and requires extra equipment and energy for separating and recycling the photocatalysts 104 these drawbacks could be minimized by immobilizing the catalyst on support or thin film like glass substrates metallic supports zeolites photoelectrodes etc photocatalysts immobilized over solid support materials are considered as the third category of photocatalysts immobilization of catalysts results in improved removal efficiency thereby reducing overall operating costs 138 139 yuan et al 45 studied the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue using a tio2 nanotube array they reported that the synergistic effect was found to be 22 1 at 27 khz and the catalyst also showed good recyclability eshaq and elmetwally 94 demonstrated that preparation of ionic liquid 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium acetate modified cuprous oxide immobilized over graphitic carbon nitride bmim oac cu2o g c3n4 ensured the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dye methylene blue saponjic et al 101 reported that ag tio2 nanoparticles immobilized on corona pre treated polypropylene non woven fabric provided excellent dye removal efficiency and superior reusability during sonophotocatalysis 4 3 3 influence of light intensity photocatalytic activity depends on the energy supplied by light irradiation electron hole pairs are produced in the conduction band and valence band of photocatalysts when they absorb energy equal to or higher than the band gap the photon energy absorbed by the photocatalyst depends on its wavelength and light source intensity therefore the selection of energy light sources such as solar and visible and many others with the appropriate light intensity and wavelength is a crucial factor in efficient photocatalysis 89 124 the effect of light sources i e conventional blacklight fluorescent lamp uv bl light emitting diode uv led and solar light on photocatalytic dye degradation have been extensively studied uv leds are utilized in various photocatalytic based mechanisms as a strong and environment friendly light source additionally leds are cost effective options with a longer working lifespan compared to conventional light supplies the light intensity is a major factor in the photodegradation that can affect the absorption performance of the catalyst and photocatalytic activity of the e h pairs 21 89 obviously the enhancement of uv intensity causes higher electrons to be excited from the catalyst and higher oh radicals to be generated resulting in increased photocatalytic oxidation 140 however at higher light intensities the photodegradation rate is independent of the irradiation intensity and the increment of irradiation intensity enhances the photocatalytic activity only up to a certain degree 2 this phenomenon occurs due to the e h recombination competitiveness on the catalyst surface with varying the light intensity and leads to a reduction in the photocatalytic efficiency 141 research studies have found that at low irradiation intensities the photocatalytic performance of e h pairs is predominant and the recombination rate of charge carriers is negligible whereas the recombination rate is enhanced at greater intensities 51 as an example yetim and tekin 48 examined the effect of light intensity on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of an artificial effluent solution containing acid black 1 and acid blue 62 dyestuffs they found that the photodegradation rate increased with an increment of the light intensity they explained that the increase of light intensity provided more possibility of hydroxyl radical production on the catalyst surface and led to the increased extent of degradation 4 3 4 influence of ultrasound frequency many researchers have studied the effect of ultrasound frequency on dye decolorization for instance yuan et al 45 evaluated the effect of us frequency in the range from 18 to 30 khz on sonophotocatalytic decolorization of methylene blue and they reported that the optimal frequency for the mb degradation was 27 khz wang et al 113 reported that the change of ultrasonic frequency over the range of 20 48 khz frequency showed a negligible effect on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of methyl orange from these results it can be concluded that the us frequency may influence the decolorization efficiency the impact of frequency on dye decolorization can be described by the fact that acoustic cavitation activity and rates of hydroxyl radical production are directly related to the us frequency in general the lifetime and size of the acoustic bubbles diminish with increasing the us frequency which result in the reduction of cavitation intensity and maximum temperature created inside a collapsed cavitation bubble the consequence of these conditions is usually a lower yield of oh radicals 142 143 the magnitude of the optimal frequency to achieve maximum sonochemical effects is not only dependent on the type of the pollutant but also the reactor design and the operating conditions according to several studies sonolysis in the frequency range of 200 500 khz results in the maximum hydroxyl radicals production which is suited for effective pollutant degradation 144 145 additionally at relatively high us frequency intensified mass transfer caused by acoustic streaming eddy currents turbulent convection and other physical effects leads to faster release of reactive free radicals into the bulk liquid solution and also helps in cleaning the catalyst however as the frequency of ultrasound rises the power required to initiate cavitation events increases and thus the sonolysis may become uneconomical in a high frequency operation the use of multiple frequencies generates more intense cavitation and thus results in higher sonochemical reaction yields hence dual or triple frequency sonoreactors should be used to achieve comparable outcomes to a single very high frequency transducer in other words the use of multiple frequency operation could be a better option than the single frequency operation when higher cavitational intensities are required for the application 146 for degradation of hydrophobic organic contaminants the optimal ultrasonic frequency is related to the optimal oh yield and also the effective mass transfer of a reactive solute from the bulk liquid to the vapor phase 147 overall it is recommended that a combination of low frequency ultrasound typically 20 khz with other frequencies in the range of 50 200 khz should be utilized for dye degradation for providing enhanced cavitational activity and the mass transfer rates 43 146 4 3 5 influence of acoustic power based on the papers reviewed acoustic power is a crucial parameter in the performance of the sonophotocatalytic system for dye degradation the results indicate that sonophotocatalytic activity is enhanced proportionately with an increment of acoustic power an increase in the acoustic power results in an improvement in the rate and the number of cavities and consequently enhances the concentration of the h and oh radicals by dissociation of water molecules furthermore as acoustic power increases the bubble size increases resulting in a higher implosion temperature 148 150 additionally the intensity of turbulence is effectively intensified at enhanced acoustic power which promotes the mass transfer rate of target pollutant molecules between the bulk solution and the catalyst surface 149 finally the higher power density of us induces the fragmentation and deaggregation of the photocatalyst which results in the increment of its surface area and the quantity of absorbed photons by the catalyst in other words higher acoustic power increases the generation rate of hydroxyl radicals arising from the catalyst surface and thus accelerates the sonophotocatalytic reaction by both activating and continuously cleaning the catalyst surface overall in terms of acoustic power it is suggested that an optimum level of ultrasonic power is required for sonophotocatalytic decolorization which depends on the dye type and the reactor geometry the effect of acoustic power on dye decolorization has been a subject of numerous studies asgari et al 50 studied the effect of acoustic power 100 300 w l 1 on the degradation of acid blue 113 ab113 dye by the us uv zno ps process and also reported that high degradation efficiency of ab113 was achieved by rising the us power density in the range of 100 300 w l 1 they explained these results by the enhancement in the number of cavities and consequently concentration of free radicals under the circumstances of the larger acoustic power similar results were reported by abdul et al 121 madhavan et al 83 berberidou et al 108 bejarano pe and sua 109 cheng et al 116 and ahmedchekkat et al 44 from the research carried out by siddique et al 120 on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of reactive blue 19 rb19 using tio2 catalyst with ultrasonic power range of 120 300 w the maximum 73 dye decolorization was obtained at 240 w however by enhancing us power from 240 to 300 w no remarkable improvement in the dye decolorization was observed 4 3 6 influence of initial dye concentration based on the studies examined the sonophotocatalytic decomposition efficiency can be strongly affected by the initial dye concentration the initial rate of decomposition in sonophotocatalysis increases with an increment of the initial dye concentration till an optimum value at low concentrations of dye the recombination of oh radicals in the cavity is more remarkable than the oh radical interaction with pollutants in the solution bulk however as the concentration of dye is enhanced the portion of hydroxyl radicals that take part in recombination reactions would diminish and the possibility of collision between dye molecules and hydroxyl radical increases leading to an enhancement of the decolorization efficiency 151 152 however further increase in the dye concentration beyond the optimum value results in a decrease in the decolorization efficiency because more dye molecules compete for the reaction with oh radicals in the bulk liquid alternatively at higher dye concentrations the formation of reaction intermediates increases so the competition for the occupation of limited active sites increases 2 additionally at high dye loading the main portion of light be absorbed by dye molecules rather than by the catalyst surface reducing photocatalytic activity in other words at high initial dye concentration dye molecules act as internal filters which avoid the distribution of light and make the small fraction of photons reach the surface active sites 49 51 it is necessary to properly optimize the dye loading through the pilot scale experiments as the optimum concentration will be strongly dependent on the dye structure numerous experimental studies have also demonstrated that the maximum decolorization efficiency can be achieved using an optimized initial dye loading over a range of 0 1 100 μm in literature there are several research investigating the impact of initial dye loading on the sonophotocatalytic degradation efficiency for instance ahmedchekkat et al 44 observed a reduction in the decolorization percentage from 94 to 60 when the rhodamine b loading was enhanced from 10 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 similar decreasing trends in the decolorization rate with an increment of initial concentration during sonophotocatalysis were obtained by ertugay and akar 106 berberidou et al 108 wang et al 113 kritikos et al 118 abdul et al 121 and zhang et al 153 in another study kumawat et al 47 investigated sonophotocatalytic degradation of nigrosine dye with initial concentrations of 1 0 10 5 m to 4 5 10 5 m they reported 3 0 10 5 m as the optimum initial loading of nigrosine dye for the highest decolorization rate also they attributed the higher degradation rates of nigrosine dye at a concentration of 3 0 10 5 m to more availability of dye molecules for the degradation they declared that further increase in dye concentration beyond 3 0 10 5 m caused retardation of the reaction because of reduction in collisions between the dye molecules and oh radicals additionally matto ghasemi et al 46 observed an optimum initial concentration of 60 mg l 1 for the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of begazol black b siddique et al 120 conducted an experiment on the decolorization of reactive blue 19 using sonophotocatalysis in aqueous solutions experiment outcomes showed that the decolorization rate was reduced with an increase in the initial dye loading and the optimum dye loading was found 100 mg l 1 4 3 7 influence of solution ph according to the literature review the solution ph is another important parameter affecting the decomposition rate and the overall efficiency of the sonophotocatalytic dye degradation initial solution ph plays a crucial role in the photocatalytic characteristics ionization state of a contaminant activity and solubility of oxidative agents 50 the effect of ph is mainly attributed to the electrostatic attractive forces between the semiconductor surface organic molecules and reactive radicals during the sonophotocatalysis surface charge properties and the aggregation of the photocatalysts particles are associated with the ph of a given solution 2 51 the ph effect on the catalyst surface charge could be described on the basis of the point of zero charge pzc below phpzc the catalyst surface is positively charged whereas above phpzc the surface is negatively charged 50 for instance the point of zero charge for tio2 particles is about 6 8 therefore below phpzc ph 6 8 or under acidic medium the catalyst surface gets positively charged while above that it is negatively charged according to eqs 21 and 22 given below 11 21 tioh surface h tioh 2 surface 22 tioh surface oh tio surface h 2 o hence ph values below phpzc would contribute to the electrostatic attractive force between the positively charged tio2 and the anionic dye resulting in strong dye adsorption and subsequently the photodegradation efficiency is enhanced an additional explanation for the effect of varied initial ph can be related to the protonation or deprotonation state of the organic pollutants which change their adsorption characteristics and degradation rate 102 the initial solution ph also influences the generation rate of hydroxyl radicals during sono degradation and hence affects the decolorization efficiency acidic ph leads to a higher formation rate of oh radicals by minimizing their recombination in other words at higher ph higher quantities of oh radical self recombine to generate h2o2 leading to a reduction in the quantum of the oh radicals available for the desired removal reaction 154 155 moreover the oxidizing potential of the oh radical in an acidic medium is higher than the basic condition where the standard potential of oh radical has been reported to be 2 59 and 1 64 v at ph of zero and 14 respectively 50 furthermore high ph solutions may create more free radical scavengers and results in the diminution of the oh concentration 156 157 therefore higher quantities and higher reactivity of oh radicals in the acidic medium than that at neutral and alkaline ph promote removal kinetics under ultrasonic irradiation similar trends of an enhancement in the extent of dye decolorization under acidic conditions during sonophotocatalysis were observed in literature saponjic et al 101 studied the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of dye acid orange7 ao7 in acidic ph 4 0 and alkaline ph 9 0 conditions and reported that discoloration of the solution was enhanced in acidic conditions they attributed this to the contribution of electrostatic interaction on dye adsorption under acidic conditions another study of the ph effect on the dye removal was conducted by ertugay and acar 82 they observed that the complete decolorization of direct blue 71 db71 was achieved at an operating ph of 2 5 whereas at ph 5 5 the degradation rate was reduced up to 29 similarly verma et al 103 he et al 66 abdul et al 121 kaur and singh 122 also revealed that the best efficiency of the sonophotocatalytic dye degradation was achieved at acidic ph dhanasekar et al 110 studied sonophotocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue mb at various initial ph values 3 5 9 and 11 they found that the dye decolorization was not much influenced by the initial ph and the variation observed was only 2 3 the ph 7 near the point of zero charge of the catalyst was found to be favorable for the efficient decolorization of mb dye the result showed a good agreement with the reports by gonzález and martínez 104 and sabzehmeidani et al 125 4 3 8 influence of temperature recent studies have shown that the rate of sonophotocatalytic decolorization is strongly temperature dependent in general the solution temperature influences important factors during sonolysis such as cavitation energy cavitational threshold the quantity of dissolved gas and vapor pressure an increment of bulk liquid temperature causes a reduction in the viscosity and surface tension of the bulk liquid liquid with low viscosity and surface tension generally has a lower cavitation threshold so that cavities are more readily generated moreover the high reaction temperature improves the mass transfer of the generated free radicals to the bulk solution and promotes the oxidation rate of dye molecules thus resulting in a higher extent of degradation on the other hand high operating temperature causes the generation of cavities that have more vaporous nature and consequently reduces the intensity of the cavitation in fact the vapor content within the cavity increases as the temperature rises for reactants that are volatile in nature the reduction in the collapse intensity in terms of temperature and pressure is mainly on account of the increase in the vapor pressure thus increasing operating temperature could lead to a decline in the temperature of the hot spot thereby reducing the sono degradation efficiency 158 160 it should be noted that the use of the raised temperature delays the e h recombination a detailed analysis of the published papers indicates that the substantial extent of dye degradation can be obtained using sonophotocatalysis over a range of 20 40 c many researchers have examined the influences of temperature on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes for instance mokhtar et al 112 studied the effect of operating temperature on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue they found that the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue increased by increasing temperature and 100 degradation was achieved in 40 min at 45 c they attributed the increased degradation to the retard of e h recombination at high solution temperature by the production of cavities on the catalyst surface which led to the generation of greater amounts of free radicals and catalyst surface cleaning the effect of reaction temperature on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue was studied by eshaq and elmetwally 94 their study revealed that the first order degradation rate constant of mb increased from 0 0938 min 1 to 0 2649 min 1 with increasing the reaction temperature from 15 c to 55 c furthermore similar results were reported by wu 123 and ahmedchekkat et al 44 4 3 9 influence of time in general the sonophotochemical degradation efficiency is a function of time and the extent of dye decolorization is enhanced with increasing the reaction time the positive effects of irradiation and sonication time on the dye degradation can be attributed to the more exposure of the dye molecules to the ultrasonication and the light irradiation as well as more yielding of reactive radicals which result in higher dye removal efficiency furthermore prolonging the irradiation time improves the photocatalytic performance by increasing the sensitivity of the photocatalyst nanoparticle in fact prolonged reaction times provide a larger opportunity for more electrons to jump from the vb to the cb thereby increasing photogenerated active species 21 in addition the results of sonophotocatalytic degradation of dye show that the decolorization profile could be considered in three distinct regimes the first step step 1 is represented by a sharp enhancement in the dye decolorization efficiency which is caused by the high concentrations of dyes however with the prolonging of the reaction time step 2 the decolorization proceeds at slower rates at the end of the sonophotocatalytic degradation process step 3 the yield of dye decolorization remains relatively unchanged in other words since the dye content is comparatively high at the beginning of the process the reaction is accelerated as prolonging the degradation time the less concentration of dye is available as a result the dyes molecules undergo decolorization much slower 161 furthermore various intermediates produced during the decolorization process make limitations in the dye degradation by increasing the competitiveness with dye molecules for oxidative species it is necessary to identify the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of dyes in terms of reaction kinetics to optimize the treatment time the typical range of required reaction time for using sonophotocatalysis systems would be anywhere between 15 min and 1 h mosleh et al 96 studied the effect of radiation time 10 30 min on sonophotocatalytic decolorization of trypan blue tb and vesuvine they found that irradiation sound and or light time has a positive influence on sonophotocatalytic decolorization percentage of dyes and reported 25 min of irradiation and sonication time as an optimum treatment time in another study asgari et al 50 investigated the degradation efficiency of acid blue 113 ab113 for various treatment times and reported that degradation efficiency increased by 75 with the increment of the treatment time from 5 to 25 min they also observed that the removal efficiency of ab113 dye increased sharply during the first 20 min and then it proceeded with a slower kinetic rate zhang et al 153 guzma et al 162 observed similar results in their survey 4 3 10 influence of carbon tetrachloride ccl4 the presence of carbon tetrachloride can result in the intensification of oxidation of dye molecules under the sonophotocatalytic decolorization process by way of generation of various active species ccl4 as a hydrophobic organic compound tends to enter the collapsing bubble and undergoes degradation by direct pyrolytic dissociation resulting in large yields of highly reactive chlorine radicals 143 inside a cavitation bubble thermolytic cleavage of ccl bond in ccl4 occurs to form a large amount of cl radicals compared to the hoh bond in h2o due to the lower bond dissociation energy of ccl in ccl4 73 kcal mol 1 compared to that of hoh in h2o 119 kcal mol 1 154 the formed chlorine radicals can initiate a series of chain reactions generating highly reactive agents such as hypochlorous acid hclo chlorine and its oxidant species cl ccl3 and ccl2 which will significantly promote the degradation of pollutants in the solution reactions 23 30 143 163 23 ccl 4 us ccl 3 cl 24 ccl 4 us ccl 2 cl 2 25 ccl 3 us ccl 2 cl 26 ccl 3 ccl 3 ccl 4 ccl 2 27 ccl 3 ccl 3 c 2 cl 6 28 ccl 2 ccl 2 c 2 cl 4 29 cl cl cl 2 30 cl 2 h 2 o hclo hcl along with oh attack the additional active oxidizing agents independently attack the target organics present in the bulk solution or at interfacial regions of the cavitation bubbles and thus remarkably improve the destruction rate of contaminants 164 furthermore it has been reported that ccl4 acts as a good hydrogen atom scavenger and it has no tendency to react with oh radicals in other words ccl4 inhibits the recombination of hydrogen atoms to reform water hence the concentration of oh radicals increases in the presence of ccl4 156 165 166 however uddin and okitsu 167 recently suggested that ccl4 did not act as a hydrogen atom scavenger and explained the enhancement effect of ccl4 on the degradation of phenolic compounds by the chlorine radicals and chlorine species formed in the sonolysis of ccl4 it is also important to notice that the initial concentration of ccl4 can influence the final toxicity levels of the reaction medium if it is not utilized totally during the treatment process moreover the excessive addition of ccl4 beyond the optimum level in the medium leads to the formation of vaporous cavities due to its volatile nature consequently the great amount of ccl4 diminishes the net distribution of energy during the cavity implosion and leads to a decrease in the formation of oxidants on the other hand the high amount of intermediaries resulting from the pyrolysis of ccl4 can act as scavengers of free radicals obstructing in this way the reaction between them and pollutant molecules 44 109 hence in order to prevent the interference effects of the residual ccl4 minimize additive losses and toxicity as well as achieve maximum intensification of the extent of dye decolorization selecting the optimum dosage is a necessary design consideration the optimum level of ccl4 is mainly dependent on the type of dye reactor configuration characteristics and operating conditions especially ultrasonic intensity 156 similar results about the intensification are available in the literature for the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of different dyes bejarano perez and suarez herrera 109 performed the sonochemical and sonophotocatalytic degradation of malachite green mg and found that the rate of sonochemical and sonophotocatalytic decolorization increased about 2 5 times by the addition of 0 5 ml of ccl4 per liter of water ahmedchekkat et al 44 also observed similar results for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of rhb solution in the presence of ccl4 4 3 11 influence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the addition of hydrogen peroxide as a strong oxidizing agent during sonophotocatalysis often leads to an increment in the extent of decolorization efficiency h2o2 increases the generation rate of oh radicals which in turn promotes the extent of degradation h2o2 enhances the production rate of oh radicals in two routes firstly the reduction of h2o2 at the conduction band would generate oh radicals secondly the dissociation of h2o2 under uv irradiation or sonication would also generate oh radicals according to eqs 31 and 32 46 82 31 h 2 o 2 us 2 ho 32 h 2 o 2 hv 2 ho furthermore the added h2o2 prevents the electron hole pair e cb e vb recombination by trapping the conductive band electrons and subsequently compensates for oxygen deficiency eqs 33 and 34 46 33 h 2 o 2 e oh ho 34 h 2 o 2 o 2 ho oh o 2 while at high concentrations h2o2 can scavenge oh thus decreasing the hydroxyl radicals availability in the bulk solution h2o2 can also be directly oxidized to oxygen and proton by the valence band holes hence it is essential to determine the optimum h2o2 loading to achieve high degradation efficiency 118 35 h 2 o 2 ho h 2 o ho 2 36 ho 2 ho h 2 o o 2 37 h 2 o 2 2 h vb o 2 2 h therefore there exists an optimum h2o2 dosage where the extent of destruction of h2o2 into oh is the dominant and the scavenging effect of residual h2o2 is not significant the optimum h2o2 dosage depends on operating conditions such as ultrasonic power intensity initial concentration of pollutants type of pollutant and reactor configuration many researchers have studied the effect of the addition of hydrogen peroxide on the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes for instance ghasemi et al 46 investigated the effect of initial h2o2 concentration on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of begazol black b and reported that the optimum concentration of h2o2 was 160 mg l 1 they observed that the extent of degradation increased with the addition of hydrogen peroxide up to 200 mg l 1 in other experiments reddy et al 84 reported that the degradation of naphthol blue black nbb increased with the increment in loading of h2o2 of 8 82 17 64 26 46 35 28 44 1 mmol l 1 and decreased with the further increase in h2o2 loading of 52 92 mmol l 1 a similar effect of h2o2 addition on the sonophotocatalytic degradation yield was reported by verma et al 30 and ahmedchekkat et al 44 additionally eshaq and elmetwally 94 studied the effect of hydrogen peroxide on sonophotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in the range of 5 30 mm they found that the removal extent of mb was directly proportional to the quantity of h2o2 and the complete destruction of mb was obtained when the hydrogen peroxide was 30 mm the enhancement in the removal rate with an increment in the initial h2o2 concentration was also reported by ertugay and acar 82 kritikos et al 118 and dinesh et al 102 4 3 12 influence of dissolved gas the existence of dissolved gases in the reaction medium is an important parameter for dye degradation using sonophotocatalysis 168 some thermophysical properties of dissolved gases considerably influence the sonochemical activity namely specific heat ratio gas thermal conductivity and gas solubility higher temperatures and pressures upon cavity implosion are achieved with monatomic gases with a higher specific heat ratio than those with polyatomic gases with a lower specific heat ratio gas thermal conductivity is another crucial factor affecting cavitational collapse although compression is assumed as an adiabatic procedure during sonolysis small amounts of heat are dissipated to the bulk liquid therefore a gas with low thermal conductivity diminishes heat energy dissipation favoring increased implosion temperatures as mentioned earlier the gas solubility in a liquid medium is also an important aspect nucleation rate is enhanced by increasing gas solubility thus facilitating cavitation soluble gases provide a large number of cavitation nuclei and extensive bubble collapse and thus the oh radicals generated also enrich in general dissolved gas correlates to both the intensity of the sonochemical field and the yield of free radical production under sonolytic irradiation 70 160 169 170 in addition the rate of photooxidation upon electronic excitation of the organic substrate depends on the dissolved oxygen level as explained earlier the oxygen adsorbed on the catalyst surface reacts with photogenerated conduction band electrons e and produces superoxide o2 radicals which are responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of the contaminant 93 108 171 recently some studies have been conducted to explore the influence of dissolved gases on degradation efficiency in sonophotocatalytic systems for instance reddy et al 84 studied the impact of dissolved gas species ar o2 n2 and air on the sonophotolysis treatment of naphthol blue black nbb dye they reported that the highest decolorization 17 was achieved in the argon atmosphere as it has a high specific heat ratio of 1 66 while the lowest decolorization 6 was obtained in the nitrogen atmosphere oxygen and air atmosphere resulted in 12 and 8 decolorization respectively besides cheng et al 116 reported that the removal rate constants k of methyl orange without air was only 2 35 10 2 min 1 however even only 0 1 l min 1 gas enters to the medium the k increased to 3 27 10 2 min 1 they explained that the air flow rate significantly influenced the electron acceptor dissolved oxygen in the reaction mixture the increase of the air flow rate enhances the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the solution 4 3 13 influence of water matrix water matrix is a critical factor that can affect the sonophotocatalytic degradation kinetics a mixture of various inorganic anions and organic matter was commonly found in both natural water and wastewaters depending on the concentration and characteristics of inorganic species sonophotocatalysis can take different routes generally inorganic matrices can accelerate or inhibit the sonophotocatalytic degradation of dye molecules through the following mechanisms driving the organic compounds towards the interfacial zone of the cavitation bubbles through salting out effects scavenging action on the highly reactive radicals and or decrease catalyst s activity by filtering light as well as occupying the active superficial sites of photocatalyst 123 172 in other words the presence of the specific inorganic anion can saturate the bulk liquid medium thereby dye molecules migrate from the bulk solution to the bubble bulk interface where degradation is accelerated 173 174 on the other hand the presence of certain anions can result in serious inhibitions on sonophotocatalytic reactions anions can act as a radical scavenger competing with dye molecules for the reaction with oxidative radicals less reactive radicals are produced as a result of the scavenging reaction between inorganic anions and oxidative radicals reducing the overall degradation efficiency 175 177 the anions can also cause deactivation of the photocatalyst towards dye molecules by clogging many active sites via adsorption on the catalyst surface 178 in addition organic matrices may inhibit the sonophotochemical degradation of target contaminants the natural organic matters are not only able to compete with dye molecules for reactive oxidizing radicals but also can decrease the cavitation threshold by changing the vapor pressure thus ultimately reducing the intensity of the collapse and degradation rates 172 due to the common presence of bicarbonate phosphate sulfate nitrate and chloride ions in real dye wastewaters asgari et al 50 investigated their effect on the sonophotocatalytic ab113 decolorization efficiency under the us uv zno ps process they found that all anions caused a decrease in removal efficiency by possible quenching the reactive radicals and or by competitive adsorption on active sites of the photocatalyst their inhabitation effects on the ab113 degradation efficiency followed the order bicarbonate sulfate phosphate nitrate chloride in another study shah et al 92 evaluated the effect of sample matrix on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization efficiency of two textile dyes in the presence of cu zno as a catalyst they reported that the addition of carbonate sulfate and chloride as common anions reduced the sonophotocatalytic degradation efficiency from 100 to 92 94 and 92 respectively in the study of the sonophotocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b dye by zno in presence of salts such as na2so4 and nahco3 lops et al 49 reported similar results they claimed that the addition of common salts caused a reduction in the dye decolorization rate 4 3 14 influence of reactor configuration the configuration of the sono photoreactor is an essential factor affecting the synergistic effects and efficiency of the sonophotocatalytic process and should be aimed at providing a uniform distribution of both the cavitation activity and uv irradiation sonophotocatalytic degradation studies have been generally carried out in batch or continuous systems batch reactors are generally divided into three designs bath probe horn and cup horn system bath type sonicator is a low intensity system and a very little amount of energy is supplied to the gravitational activity within the sample in addition controlling the temperature is not easy in this approach and the cavitational activity is also limited due to the attenuation of ultrasound by the location of the reaction vessel the bath size beaker geometric dimensions diameter and wall thickness and the height of the bath liquid and the solution within the beaker hence the replicability and scalability of this configuration are very poor nevertheless sonication bath systems are usually employed for cleaning processes degassing of solution and organic synthesis owing to their availability operability and flexibility 179 180 in bath type sono photoreactor the transducer is located at the bottom of the reactor and the uv light source can be installed at either the top or aside of the reactor or immersed inside the reactors using quartz tubes reddy et al 84 employed a cylindrical 500 ml borosilicate glass for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of naphthol blue black nbb dye fig 6a the reactor was placed in the ultrasonic bath of 37 khz frequency and 200 w power uv lamp of 4 w which emitted 256 nm uv light was placed over the reactor wu 123 investigated the degradation of reactive red 2 rr2 using a similar geometry reactor which generates 49 khz frequency and 400 w power the uv lamp placed inside the quartz tube was vertically immersed inside the reactor as shown in fig 6b this type of sono photoreactor provides direct photolysis and avoids the loss of photons in the surrounding an ultrasonic horn or probe device is directly immersed into the reaction mixture and provides intense local cavitation the probe system is proper for processing relatively small volumes due to the high intensity ultrasound wave is generated more focused and not transmitted as in the case of bath sonicator 169 the probe type sonicator is characterized by providing intense local cavitation however controlling the temperature is necessary here furthermore ultrasonic probes present a risk of sample contamination by surface active impurities due to cavitational erosion of the sonicator tip and results in some chemical interference 180 the ultrasonic probe is generally used for cell disruption 55 disinfection process 181 degassing of liquids 182 crystallization processes 183 dispersion of solids into liquids 184 and emulsification of immiscible liquids 185 a probe type sono photoreactor consists of an ultrasonic probe for the generation of the ultrasonic wave and the uv light source installed either aside or inside of the reactor this type of sono photoreactor provides higher energy directly to the system as compared to the bath type sonicator chen and huang 186 used a probe type sono photoreactor having 88 w power and 20 khz frequency fig 7a twelve uv lamps which emitted 254 nm uv light were vertically installed surrounding the reactor this configuration was used for providing uniform uv light irradiation ertugay and acar 106 studied the sonophotocatalytic degradation of direct blue 71 by a probe type sono photoreactor which generates 20 khz frequency and 750 w power fig 7b two ultraviolet lamps of 254 nm wavelength were submerged in the reactor to avoid the emission of uv light to the surrounding berberidou et al 108 investigated the degradation of malachite green using a unique sono photoreactor fig 7c in which the ultrasonic probe was immersed in the axial position inside the sono photoreactor while the uv lamp of 9 w with the maximum wavelength of 365 nm was kept at the lowermost side of the reactor fig 7d represents the reactor geometry employed by ahmedchekkat et al 44 to study the sonophotocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b the reactor was configured with an ultrasonic probe of 20 khz frequency at the bottom side a 15 w uv lamp that emitted 352 nm wavelength was submerged inside the reactor they reported that the propagation of ultrasound through the novel sono photoreactor improves photocatalytic decolorization the cup horn system is a combination of bath and probe systems which can deliver direct and indirect sonication a cup horn improves temperature control and provides powerful sonication without any contamination by the metal impurity 169 181 187 multiple samples can be sonicated indirectly when the cup is filled with water and samples are placed in vials just above the titanium horn therefore the ultrasonic energy is produced in water then crosses the wall of the sample tube and is transferred indirectly to the sample medium 70 182 alternatively samples can be placed within the cup for direct sonication cup horn type sonoreactor provides the maximum degradation of contaminants as compared to the probe and bath type reactors under the same condition due to the uniform energy distribution and the lower spatial variation in the solution 188 ahmedchekkat et al 44 investigated the sonophotocatalytic destruction of rhb using three different sono photoreactor configurations i e horn bath and cup horn type ultrasonicators they reported that the best rhb degradation rate in the aqueous solution occurred in the cup horn reactor they explained their observations by the strong turbulence of catalyst nanoparticles due to the intense acoustic streaming in the focal region the continuous flow reactors are useful for the treatment of large scale wastewater gonzalez and martinez 104 used a 150 ml capacity continuous sono photoreactor included an ultrasonic probe of 20 khz frequency and 76 w power a 15 w uv lamp with an emission wavelength of 352 nm was combined with the probe system in recirculation operation this configuration is shown in fig 8a this type of sono photoreactor allowed the evaluation of the sono photo and sonophotocatalytic degradation of basic blue 9 and provided the uniform distribution and high penetration of uv light to the solution mosleh and rahimi 96 employed a continuous flow loop sono photoreactor which consisted of a 25 khz ultrasonic bath and blue led with 465 470 nm wavelength and aeration pump as presented in fig 8b the continuous flow loop reactor increased turbulence and agitation in the system and consequently enhanced the mass transfer rate most of the studies describing the sonophotocatalytic destruction of dyes have been performed in the laboratory scale using either high intensity probe or bath systems using the novel design or configuration of the sonoreactor is one of the effective ways for commercial operations since large volumes of effluents must be processed continuous reactors rather than batch reactors or at least reactors running in a recirculating mode are preferred for wastewater applications it is recommended to enhance the efficiency of acoustic energy over a large volume using multiple transducers multiple transducers with multi frequency irradiations in the range of 20 200 khz significantly promote the uniformity and intensity of the acoustic cavitation in comparison to the single piezoelectric transducer operation and thus this design is a promising alternative for scale up of conventional sonoreactors to achieve synergism it is better to use ultrasound and uv or solar irradiation at the same time this procedure would also keep the catalyst clean in the process resulting in better degradation efficiency it is preferable to use configurations that result in a uniform distribution of uv irradiation an annular placement of uv and ultrasonic irradiation sources would be a suitable geometry to consider large scale designs can also involve parabolic type reflectors for use in direct sunlight 4 4 mineralization and degradation pathway in order to precisely evaluate the mineralization of dyes during the degradation total organic carbon toc analyses are usually utilized the most common way of estimating the mineralization is to monitor the reduction in toc which is performed via a toc analyzer toc is an indicative measure of the carbon amount in organic compounds which can accurately reflect the total amount of organic compounds in the solution the efficiency of toc removal is determined using eq 38 90 189 38 toc removal t 0 t t t 0 100 where t0 and tt represent the toc content in the initial and degraded samples at the specified treatment time respectively the studies show that the sonophotocatalytic process has great potential for the mineralization of dyes for instance sathishkumar et al 100 reported that 2 03 and 2 20 fold enhancement in the mineralization was achieved for the sonophotocatalytic degradation of acid blue 113 in the presence of pr3 loaded tio2 when compared with the sonolysis and photocatalysis processes eren 119 observed 43 5 and 62 8 of dye mineralization after 2 h treatment using us uv zno h2o2 and us uv fe2 systems respectively whereas mineralization was not seen in individual processes i e sonolysis or photocatalysis even for a long treatment period 4 h the analysis of dye intermediates and the investigation of sonophotocatalytic degradation pathways are conducted by lc ms ms hplc esi ms or gc ms the sonophotocatalytic degradation pathways of dyes have been widely reported for instance madhavan et al 83 proposed the degradation pathway of acid red 88 after 0 2 h treatment by sonophotocatalytic process under the following conditions ar88 0 09 mm tio2 1 g l 1 acoustic power 55 mw ml 1 and ph 2 7 the degradation products of acid red 88 were analyzed according to the mass spectrometer analysis and a possible reaction network was proposed fig 9a based on the results of ms the formation of mono and di hydroxylated products was identified for the ar88 degradation by the sonophotocatalytic process they reported that sonophotocatalysis resulted in the formation of products with m z values of 175 223 239 255 378 394 396 412 and 428 the hydroxylation and hydroxyl radical attack were commonly suggested as the major routes for the formation of intermediates based on the results of gc ms analysis berberidou et al 108 proposed a degradation pathway of malachite green by the sonophotocatalytic process after 30 min treatment at the conditions of mg 0 09 mm tio2 0 5 g l 1 ultrasonic power 135 w and ph of 5 5 fig 9b they reported that radical attack to the central carbon atom and the dimethylamino group of mg and subsequent demethylation and oxidation were the typical fragmentation pathway of mg moreover they found that mg decomposition resulted in the formation of n n dimethyl benzenamine 4 dimethylamino benzophenone n n dimethyl benzenamine benzenamine nitrobenzene and 4 amino benzophenone 4 nitro benzophenone benzophenone benzaldehyde and benzene he et al 66 proposed seven main products generated during the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methyl orange fig 9c analysis of the structure and the m z values of intermediates indicated that hydroxylation and or demethylation were responsible for the sonolytic photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation of mo molecules they also analyzed by products from the degradation of mo after 60 min sonophotocatalysis at ph 2 the tio2 loading the ultrasonic frequency and the power were 1 mg ml 1 213 khz and 55 mw ml 1 respectively they reported that seven organic intermediates were detected with the peak of m z 276 m z 290 m z 292 m z 306 m z 308 m z 320 and m z 322 respectively siddique et al 120 conducted a comprehensive by product analysis of the sonophotocatalytic degradation of reactive blue 19 using gc ms under the following reaction conditions initial ph 4 dye 100 mg l 1 tio2 300 mg l 1 us power 240 w and treatment time 120 min they illustrated the degradation pathway of rb19 for the obtaining of selected by products including isobenzofuran 1 3 dione 2 3 dihydronaphthalene 1 4 dione benzoic acid benzaldehyde and acetic acid fig 9d 4 5 kinetics of sonophotocatalytic dye degradation based on several experimental results the kinetics of sonolysis photocatalysis and sonophotocatalysis for the decolorization of various dyes can be explained by langmuir hinshelwood l h which is the most suitable kinetic model for investigating the destruction process of pollutants and reaction rates obey pseudo first order kinetics by considering steady state conditions 190 191 mohamed et al 112 indicated that the degradation of methylene blue dye at zno 70 cnt hybrid by the sono photo and sonophotocatalysis followed a first order kinetic model and rate constants were 0 015 0 0193 and 0 017 min 1 respectively a similar study conducted by wang et al 114 showed that the sonophotocatalytic degradation of methyl orange in the presence of carbon nanotube tio2 followed the first order kinetics and the kinetic constant of the photocatalysis and sonophotocatalysis were 0 00787 and 0 01118 min 1 respectively degradation kinetics of the sonophotocatalysis was a first order kinetic model in the study examined by eren 119 kaur and singh 122 wu 123 and ahmad et al 124 the general formula of the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model is given by eq 39 39 r d d c d dt k a i a k d c d 1 k d c d where rd reflects the degradation rate of the dye mg l min 1 cd corresponds to the dye concentration mg l 1 specified reaction time ka is the reaction rate constant mg m2 l w min 1 kd is the adsorption constant of the dye l mg 1 onto the catalyst ia is light intensity w m 2 and t is the irradiation time min if the competition of by products for adsorption is considered 192 40 r d d c d dt k a i a k d c d 1 k d c d k i c i where ki and ci reflect the adsorption equilibrium constant and the concentration of various intermediates respectively beltran heredia et al 193 proposed the assumption of equal adsorption coefficients for all organic species and intermediates as follows 41 k d c d k i c i k d c d 0 in this equation cd0 represents the primary dye concentration mg l 1 by introducing eq 41 into eq 40 we will have 42 r d d c d dt k a i a k d c d 1 k d c d 0 k p c d ln c 0 c k p t 43 k p k a i a k d 1 k d c d 0 if the light intensity used is considered to be constant 44 k c k a i a eq 43 can therefore be rewritten as 45 k p k c k d 1 k d c d 0 the linear form of eq 45 can be expressed as 46 1 k p 1 k c k d 1 k c c d 0 the arrhenius expression which shows the relationship between the pseudo first order kinetic constant and the reaction temperature is represented as follows eq 47 47 k a exp e a rt where k a ea r and t reflect the rate constant min 1 the frequency factor the activation energy kj mol 1 the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k 1 and the reaction s absolute temperature k respectively the dependence of reaction kinetics on sonolysis power is usually expressed by the following relation 194 195 48 e w 1 b w u c where b c are constants wu represents ultrasonic power and ew reflects the ultrasonic enhancement factor calculated as 49 e w k utrasound k non ultrasound by combining eqs 47 48 and 49 the following is obtained 50 k a 0 1 b w u c exp e rt by combining eqs 50 and 43 are combined the reaction rate constant kp is obtained as follows 51 k p a 0 1 b w u c exp e rt i a k d 1 k d c d 0 yetim and tekin 196 found that the kinetics of the sono photo and sonophotocatalysis for the degradation of textile dyes obeyed langmuir hinshelwood as pseudo first order kinetics they also presented the sonophotocatalytic degradation kinetics with the following relation 52 k p 3 19 10 7 1 0 029 w u 0 153 exp 7880 t i a 0 156 1 0 156 c d 0 4 6 cost estimation apart from technical feasibility economical feasibility is fundamentally required for any wastewater treatment technology to be appropriate for use in the industry an economically viable technology requires low investments and operating costs for its commercialization as well as a short treatment time for the degradation of the organic pollutant several studies have shown that using a sonophotocatalytic process for wastewater treatment is technically feasible however there are a few reports that discuss cost estimation analysis and economical feasibility of sonophotocatalysis for large scale operations 197 mahamuni and adewuyi 198 estimated the cost of wastewater treatment using sono based advanced oxidation processes they calculated the costs of a treatment plant with a capacity of 1000 l min 1 the cost estimate was performed based upon rate constants the time required for 90 elimination of pollutants and specific energy the total cost was estimated by taking into account the capital and operating and maintenance costs of wastewater treatment they found that ultrasound in conjunction with various aops for the treatment of dye containing wastewater was more cost effective than the use of ultrasound alone whereas the total costs for 90 degradation of reactive azo dye by sonolysis and photocatalysis were estimated as 4203 7 and 739 8 respectively it was only 234 2 for the sonophotocatalytic process in another study asgari et al 50 assessed the cost needed to reach 90 elimination of ab113 by the sonophotocatalytic treatment process the cost to achieve the target degradation by us uv zno and ps processes were estimated as 214 2 43 8 1690 5 and 1064 per cubic meter respectively the total cost of electrical energy and chemicals for such a treatment using the us uv zno ps process were estimated to be 7 1 and 147 5 per cubic meter respectively hence it can be concluded from the analysis that sonophotocatalysis is economically more attractive than individual approaches for wastewater treatment sonophotocatalysis remarkably reduces the contact time needed to achieve the desired dye degradation efficiency compared to single approaches thus it results in a reasonable reduction in the reactor capacity required for treatment on an industrial scale and consequently in the capital cost of the equipment involved for the treatment process 50 131 4 7 treatment of textile wastewater by sonophotocatalysis as mentioned earlier the textile industry is a major industry that largely releases dye containing effluents affecting the environment and human health 8 textile effluents are rich in salts metals total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total organic carbon toc and have a quite low bod cod ratio hence after the treatment processes it is essential to compare physico chemical parameters with the standard values for discharging color containing wastewater to the aquatic system 26 35 table 2 summarizes the typical characteristics of the actual textile effluent it should be mentioned that characteristics of textile wastewater vary and depend on the process equipment fabric chemicals etc 199 some authors have examined the potential of sonophotocatalysis for the treatment of real textile effluents for instance reddy et al 84 studied the practical applicability of the us fe tio2 uv system for the treatment of actual textile effluents they reported that the sonophotocatalysis was effective in the term of toc removal and 91 toc removal was achieved with 3 g l 1 of fe tio2 1 7 similarly dinesh et al 201 treated real textile wastewater using the sonophotocatalytic technique in the presence of 3 g l 1 fe doped bi2o3 and 6 g l 1 peroxymonosulfate results showed that 77 and 91 reduction of the toc and cod were achieved respectively in 180 min the study of shah et al 92 indicated that sonophotocatalysis could remove 91 of industrial sample under optimal conditions asgari et al 50 assessed the performance of the us uv zno ps process for the treatment of real textile wastewater they reported that the 96 6 and 97 1 reduction of cod and toc was obtained after 5 and 7 h of sonophotocatalysis respectively in addition the us uv zno ps process increased the bod cod ratio from 0 15 to 0 61 after 90 min reaction time in another study chen and huang 186 evaluated the feasibility of nitrotoluene degradation in industrial wastewater using sonophotocatalysis their findings demonstrated a complete degradation after 8 h sonophotocatalysis at tio2 3000 mg l 1 us power 110 w cm 2 light intensity 96 w and o2 300 ml min 1 the results indicate the great potential of sonophotocatalysis to enhance the mineralization and biodegradability of wastewater along with the dye degradation finally it can be concluded that sonophotocatalysis can be proposed as an efficient and promising approach both for decolorization and destruction of complex compounds in the dye effluent 5 path forward and research needs there are multiple aspects in the practical utilization of sonophotocatalysis for dye decolorization that need to be considered in the future numerous important subjects where future research should be addressed are pointed below a detailed overview of the existing literature related to the sonophotocatalytic destruction of dyes demonstrates that remarkable improvement in terms of increased decolorization efficiency the decrement in the treatment time and the elimination of the drawbacks associated with individual operations can be obtained by the sonophotocatalytic processes currently conventional configurations of batch sonoreactors namely bath and horn type are the most common reactor design used which may not be effective at a large scale operation as mentioned earlier probe sonicators operating at high intensities and low frequencies suffer from the drawback that the acoustic energy cannot be transmitted more than a few centimeters beyond the delivery tip surface another limitation for the industrialization of sonolysis is the cavitational erosion of the horn surface and the particle shedding with the continuous operation resulting in the possibility of failure and the need for frequent costly maintenance or the replacement of the probe therefore there is a fundamental requirement to improve not only the high power sonicator but also suitable reactor designs that can be operated simply and reliably for large scale dye treatments thus further investigations should be directed towards the improvement of sonicators which will be technically sophisticated and have a higher power intensity a larger radiating surface and substantial cavitation efficiency besides at the full scale the sono photoreactor should provide a uniform distribution of the acoustic cavitation and photon energy effective interactions between the dye and the photocatalyst and residence time to destroy a large amount of wastewater through the sonophotocatalytic process there is a need to improve the novel scaled up units using multiple low output transducers irradiating either the same or different frequencies over an extended area around the medium being sonicated continuous flow sonoreactors with multiple frequency transducers mounted in the reactor wall are recommended for larger scale processes hence running several units in parallel ensures the maximum and uniform acoustic energy distribution and eliminates scale up problems the exhaustive analysis of the relevant literature indicates that most studies commonly used low dye concentrations in laboratory synthetic solutions however the real effluent often contains high concentrations of dye additionally when treating actual wastewater there will be competition for the adsorption photocatalysis or the reaction with hydroxyl radical between different materials during the treatment process due to the actual wastewater containing other contaminants such as other organic matter the use of natural water solution is an important factor for verifying the reliability of sonophotocatalytic decolorization yield as it provides the study of conditions close to the industrial wastewater thereby paving the way for large scale application of sonophotocatalysis there is a need for theoretical and parametric investigations for the optimization of the process for industrial scale and long term applications the simulation of sonophotocatalytic decolorization allows studies of mass transfer coefficient acoustic pressure and temperature distribution liquid circulations etc in any new sono photoreactor with varying geometries and reaction conditions with substantial savings in time and economics cost modeling investigations provide valuable data for the process control and contribute to optimization for the maximum distribution of acoustic energy from this review it is clear that most of the investigated photocatalysts for sonophotocatalytic degradation of dyes are uv active the replacement of conventional uv lamps with sunlight illumination should be considered for an energy efficient and economical sonophotocatalysis in the future doping and composite semiconductors provide the possibility of using solar irradiation which can lead to a cost effective operation especially for industrial scale operations consequently the use of multi component photocatalytic systems is suggested as compared to the conventional single oxide forms thus various catalysts should be assessed for the improvement of sunlight photo decolorization for the commercialization of sonophotocatalysis it is also necessary to utilize the photocatalyst with high stability and recyclability that can be efficiently reused in the treatment process recycling remarkably decreases the cost of photocatalysis especially for large scale operations therefore further researches are required to establish efficient photocatalyst separation recovery and recycling at an industrial scale to promote the recyclability of photocatalyst and overcome the post separation difficulties related to the first and second categories of photocatalyst the immobilized catalysts can be an effective alternative approach the third category of photocatalyst holds enormous potential for industrial applications particularly in the dye removal process however there is a lack of literature on different immobilization techniques such as sol gel solvent deposition thermal spraying electrophoresis and chemical and physical vapor deposition to develop a pure and composite photocatalytic system furthermore few studies evaluate various support materials such as glass clay ceramics zeolites metallic agents polymers carbonaceous materials and cellulosic materials on photocatalytic activity therefore more investigation into these immobilization methods and support materials using continuous flow reactors will help assess their applicability to dye degradation and determine which is more appropriate for dye removal applications additionally more investigations could be conducted for synthesizing new supporting materials that can minimize the mass transfer restriction of immobilized photocatalysis from the perspective of industrial scale applications of sonophotocatalysis for the destruction of dyes an essential aspect that needs to be evaluated is the possible formation of intermediates and harmful by products hence the identification and toxicological assessments of by products are required as a final remark the feasibility of sonophotocatalysis at full scale requires consideration undoubtedly economic viability is the main objective to achieve to be able to consider sonophotocatalytic treatment as a competitive approach towards conventional methods poor attention to energy consumption levels can be found in the literature and only a few research studies have provided economical results detailed information on overall treatment costs such as investments operating and maintenance chemicals and energy consumption costs should be estimated in future work therefore more evaluations should be carried out in order to ensure the technical and economic competitiveness of sonophotocatalysis towards conventional processes for the dye removal treatment on an industrial scale 6 conclusions in recent years there has been a growing demand for alternative and innovative techniques for dye decolorization from aqueous solutions this paper comprehensively reviewed different aspects of sonophotocatalytic dye destruction such as the mechanism its advantages and disadvantages and effects of operating parameters this review clearly indicates that sonophotocatalysis as an effective and lucrative treatment process has great potentials in the decolorization of various types of dyes the main principle of using sonophotocatalysis is to promote the generation of highly reactive radicals in water and also resolve the limitations of individual approaches according to experimental results from recent researches the efficiency of sonophotocatalytic decolorization is greatly affected by features of the pollutant reactor configuration operational parameters and water quality the maximum sonophotocatalytic decolorization can be achieved at the optimum acoustic power and catalyst dose which vary depending on the amount and the nature of the dye reactor configuration as well as the type structural characteristics of the catalyst and most of the sonophotocatalytic optimization processes can obtain high removal efficiency with low concentrations of dyes i e 0 1 100 μm low ultrasound frequencies i e 20 200 khz and acidic ph values over a temperature range of 20 40 c though the exact recommended value would be dependent on the nature of compounds and the reactor geometry furthermore the presence of additives providing additional sources of free radicals or increasing the generation rate of free radicals in the sonophotocatalytic system results in the enhancement of degradation rates this review article also reveals that the kinetics of sonophotocatalysis for decolorization of various dyes can be explained by langmuir hinshelwood l h and reaction rates usually follow the pseudo first order kinetics model most previous investigations on the sonophotocatalytic decolorization of dyes were the laboratory oriented and these cannot be scaled up directly to industrial operations therefore much attention should be focused on the future on the kinetics reactor configurations energy consumption levels commercialization and scale up for practical applications declaration of competing interest

13241,microplastics mps are the ubiquitous anthropogenic pollutants that contaminate the aquatic environment severely different species in the maritime ecosystem may become extinct as a result of the gradual incorporation of mps these plastic particles are also to blame for the serious complications in human health caused by the direct ingestion of mps containing aquatic species in consequence the origin transportation and separation of mps have been extensively researched however the question as to what will happen to such mps that are separated from the water remained unanswered as a result in this article we autopsied the whole phenomenon to answer this question and provide a favorable method of recycling these extracted mps into commercially valuable products a possible plan is suggested to highlight the feasibility of each step in the recycling process without a doubt such a focus will aid in ensuring sustainable mps handling methods as well as the feasible disposal of such pollutants without jeopardizing environmental safety keywords recycling graphene pollution extraction microfiber 1 introduction we are living with microplastics mps in our daily life from drinking water to table salts garment outfits to washing machines and even breathing mps with air sand and dust heating food with a polypropylene plastic container is also peeling mps in consequence these ingested mps are moving towards our gut accumulated to some extent in the gastrointestinal tract and remaining discharges with excreta 1 this consumption is leading to major complexities in human health including cancer respiratory problems birth defects and cardiovascular disease 2 water is a vital base for human beings and the elimination of pollutants from water is a crucial concern around the world thus sufficient availability of pure water for drinking as well as for other purposes is the major concern of researchers in this decade but the phenomena further embroiled due to the tracing of omnipresent mps even in mineral drinking water from plastic bottles schymanski and her team investigated mineral water for the first time and surprisingly found mps in drinking water they revealed that almost 80 of polypropylene and polyester based mps with less than 20 μm in size were present in water they used micro raman spectroscopy with automatic mps scanning and enumerating facilities in dark field mode to ensure the smallest particles counting and not even excluding white or transparent plastic particles 3 at next baiwen with other researchers investigated the mps removal performance from drinking water via aluminum and iron salt based coagulation in conjunction with ultrafiltration 4 studies on mps were initiated almost 15 years ago in 2004 to focus on the impact of these tiny plastic particles on marine aquatic life a marine biologist named professor richard thompson university of plymouth uk denoted the term microplastics for plastic particles less than 5 mm but later researchers found it everywhere like arctic snow to the deep ocean atmospheric air to rainwater and lastly even in our daily food moreover freshwater shrimp gammarus uptakes mps through duckweed feeding so people are eating mps via ingesting such shrimp in food chain the ocean as well as the marine environment is the ultimate sink of mps in 2015 around 15 to 51 trillion mps were recorded in the ocean surface water alone and can easily be assumed the presence of enormous sunk mps in different layers of the sea along with sediments 5 if plastics production is completely halted around the world today the already stored plastics nearly 5 billion tons in the environment will degrade to countless mps and be nearly impossible to eradicate from nature as a result immediate action is required with no time to waste although it s quite optimistic that researchers are working to develop the standard methods of extracting mps from water the most common methods for separating mps from water are adsorption coagulation membrane filtration oxidation and microbial degradation will these tactics however be able to alter the phenomenon or defuse the plastics bomb that is already embedded in the marine environment it may be possible to respond in terms of removal efficiency as highly efficient removal processes may be implemented in every country to extract mps from water but the situation will be analogous to changing the carrier phase of mps from water to land and it will remain questionable to manage this enormous number of separated mps as a secondary pollutant with an assurance of environmental sustainability for example bangladesh is a country of one of the largest garment industries in the world and polystyrene is highly used in this sector and ultimately these materials are discharged into nature via wastewater with the concentration of 100 polystyrene based microfiber liter 6 sakamoto estimated 349 million m3 wastewater will be discharged into the environment from the garment industries of bangladesh in 2021 7 based on the study conducted by browne et al 6 more than 100 microfibers discharge per liter thereby more than 34 9 trillion mps fiber based may enter into bangladeshi aquatic environment this year now the question is when the government initiates to trap this waste fiber through the membrane or adsorbent what will be the next steps to manage these waste fibers with sustainability covid 19 is also rushing mps pollution through the disposal of personal protective equipment ppes and facemasks so how will we deal with these noxious microfibers as soon as possible the simple and likely solution is to recover and recycle microfibers in various formats preferably from plastics to non plastic items there has been very little work done on the recycling of mps so the ultimate motto should be erase microfibers and other plastic derivatives now or never in order to save water for a better future 2 detection and impacts of microplastics merlin n issac and other colleagues reviewed the dramatic effects of mps in water and aquatic life in 2021 polyethylene 50 is the most common name for mps found in sea surface water while polypropylene holds the second highest percentage 16 5 8 furthermore the current pandemic covid 19 is hastening mps contamination in water as stated by aragaw and de la torre ge with their teams in 2020 and 2021 respectively to tackle the coronavirus ppes are a must thus electrospinning of nanofiber is used in ppes and resulting in fiber contamination in water 9 even though polyester based cheap mps microfiber based are the most prevalent in the environment around the world similarly fibrous layers of waste surgical masks are deposited in the aquatic environment as are polyethylene and polyester based microfibers 10 specifically 4 5 g of various plastic derivatives and 11 g of polypropylene are discharged into the environment from a single n95 and surgical face mask respectively and further degradation into mps via weathering is also predictable 11 but why are we talking about microfibers and other plastic particles and how they relate to covid 19 and mps disasters mps poisoning mechanism is slower and nearly impossible to detect because of the abundance of microfibers aquatic organism s tissues become entangled with fibers primarily affecting the reproduction system mps primarily affect aquatic organisms of the vertebrate family furthermore tiny plastics endanger one fifth of all sea bird species half of all mammals and all sea turtles various complexities for mps have been incorporated regarding aquatic species up to this point but the ultimate result is the reduction and extinction of aquatic life as a result it is a difficult time for aquatic creatures and it is a matter of life and death for them as a result of human activities before the solution problem identification is inevitable and satellite remote sensing is one of the most updated technology for mps detection in water in 2020 lauren biermann and her teammate for the first time detect mps on the water surface using esa sentinel 2 satellites they also used naive bayes bayesian algorithm to synchronize optical sensing data with 86 detection accuracy and published their findings in scientific reports 12 most notably researchers are proposing the integration of ir spectroscopy with auto image analyzer and particle counting for flawless mps identification as a result raman spectroscopy with auto scanning and counting capabilities of mps is already the most recent technique to emerge in research trends 4 thermoanalytical techniques are an alternative to ir spectroscopy for the chemical characterization of mps however its applicability is limited due to the destructive as well as the time consuming nature of the analysis later modifications have been proposed to integrate an auto image analyzer with this thermal process for maximum accuracy with requiring the least amount of labor 2 to analyze the properties physical and chemical of such plastic polymers a simple and accurate detection method for mps is required because it is necessary to assess the recycling capacity of existing mps 3 hypothesis of microplastics recovery in terms of mps separation competitive research is being conducted to develop standard separation technologies with the highest output plasma electrolytic oxidation graphene based adsorption electrocoagulation nanocomposites membrane filtration and magnetic separation are examples of cutting edge technology 2 13 in terms of mps recovery after separation chitin with graphene oxide nano adsorbent is noteworthy and the adsorbent was used three successive cycles for polystyrene sieving created by cuizhu sun and team members in 2020 and is expected to be used to combat mps pollution 14 with the abundance of polystyrene and its impact in mind research is still being conducted with reduced graphene oxide to achieve the highest reusability and biocompatibility of adsorbent similarly the polymeric membrane is used more effectively to trap polystyrene based mps on trend shi et al 15 used magnetic nano fe3o4 for the removal of polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate based mps with 80 efficiency with surface adsorption being the promising step furthermore new technologies are gradually being implemented to separate various polymeric mps from water perren et al 16 used an electrochemical pathway to separate polyethylene based mps with varying concentrations this simple and inexpensive experiment yielded a 99 removal rate magnetic extraction is also the recent technology for sieving mps it has the potential to be a low complexity alternative to a traditional filtration system with such a viewpoint rhein et al 17 considered polyvinyl chloride based mps separation via magnetic seeded filtration magnetite based the authors confirmed a 95 mps removal rate using this sieving process and electrostatic interactions were the rate determining factor wang et al 18 recently investigated the separation of polystyrene microspheres by using bio adsorbent in this process porous biochar derived from corn straw and hardwood was used this method has been shown to remove more than 95 of mps using along with a series of sand filtration systems moreover novel strategies based on au ni tio2 based photocatalytic micromotors have recently been used for mps extraction as micromotors have core shell properties mps can be effectively removed via phoretic interaction 19 to use hydrophobic effects for mps separation rius ayra et al 20 modified the surface of mps to change its wettability by introducing superoleophilicity and superhydrophobicity these two methods can result in long term mps separation tactics with higher process efficiency for mps separation a new concept of foam materials based auto filtration systems is also worth mentioning chen et al 21 fabricated a zirconium organic framework based foamy material for mps separation with 95 5 1 2 efficacy for this purpose in this case a greater uniformity greater durability and the availability of interpenetrated pores in fabricated foams are critical for sieving mps from both fresh water and seawater pizzichetti et al 22 evaluated the performance of three different polymeric membranes to separate polyamide and polystyrene mps with particle sizes ranging from 20 to 300 μm while keeping cost and sustainability in mind during testing such synthetic membranes achieved a removal efficiency of more than 94 as a result everyone is attempting to separate polystyrene and other tiny plastic derivatives from water but what will happen to these recovered mps and where do they end up will it be recycled with careful management for value addition or returned to the environment there is currently no answer in terms of commercial viability however this discussion may solve the puzzle and the most likely solution is the conversion of mps into valuable products such as gasoline garment fiber graphene and so on which has the potential to industrialize for the benefit of living beings fig 1 the primary challenge for recycling strategies is the desorption of mps grafted with adsorbent or membrane cuizhu sun and colleagues have already demonstrated desorption and recycling of go adsorbent up to three cycles as a result it is possible to desorb polystyrene based mps and prepare them for further use the simplest method for desorption tactics is to wash with ethanol for 10 min although the concept of mps desorption and recycling is relatively new it is quite common for adsorbents loaded with heavy metals extracted from wastewater and reused mps desorption from adsorbent and membrane surfaces can occur via two mechanisms acidic and alkaline treatment several alkalis including sodium carbonate sodium hydroxide sodium bicarbonate potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate are commonly used for metal desorption with naoh exhibiting the best performance 94 6 98 3 for various pollutant recovery on the other hand acidic treatments such as hydrochloric acid acetic acid sulfuric acid and formic acid are used for desorption studies while mild acids are recommended for preserving material integrity 23 24 as a result these chemical treatments can be tested for mps desorption to ensure complete recovery it is important to note that researchers should confirm dose optimization for acid and alkali treatment to have unscathed mps and no additional threat to nature furthermore for mps recovery in a short period an optimized application of edta can be considered fig 1 so what are the next steps after the mps recovery the answer is mps degradation for carbon extraction which will be the most difficult part of mps journey to graphene or related materials 4 hypothesis of microplastics recycling routes in terms of mps recycling several paths can be taken i heat treatment of mps to convert into fibers followed by spinning into yarn for use in clothing 25 ii degradation of recovered mps into carbon dioxide and water following that co2 can be electrochemically converted into carbon monoxide to use as a gasoline precursor 26 carbon dioxide can also be used to extract carbon for the production of highly valuable graphene and other similar materials 27 in this study we represented mps recycling into various commercial products microbial degradation can be a prominent method for the beginning of the recycling journey for the preparation of graphene and other related materials what happened during the microbial degradation process and how did microbes use carbon based mps as a source of energy these answers will be the primary mechanism for carbon extraction and can be replicated in the laboratory using controlled media shosuke yoshida and his team responded to this question in 2016 they investigated the degradation mechanism and discovered the petase and mhetase enzymes secreted by bacteria ideonella sakaiensis 201 f6 to separate polyethylene terephthalate based plastic constituents to engulf the abundance of carbon 28 it can be answered more easily when secreted enzymes eat the chemical bonds of the polymeric chain the molecules break down into smaller components as a result microbes digest only carbon causing mps to degrade so if these enzymes can be used commercially to extract carbon from mps then recycling plastic particles may be a viable option in terms of environmental safety controlled plastics incineration for energy recovery is widely used in various countries it has been estimated that during the incineration of plastics 673 to 4605 g kg 1 co2 can be produced 29 as a result by further chemical treatment of co2 this process can be replicated for mps degradation without jeopardizing the environmental suitability to have enough carbon on january 18th 2021 a news article in new atlas stated that prof patrick drogui scientists at inrs canada degraded polystyrene based mps of wastewater into non toxic co2 and water previously the team investigated anodic oxidation in terms of polystyrene degradation up to 58 21 in 1 h the experimental strategy and research data were published in the journal of environmental pollution 13 they are now attempting to apply the technique 89 degradation rate directly to pure laundry wastewater to produce co2 and water ward et al also experimented with converting polystyrene into co2 using natural sunlight 30 as a result these studies show that co2 emissions from polystyrene fiber based mps are possible other mps and their derivatives may also be feasible in this manner until now sufficient explanations have been provided for co2 preparation but what will be the use of this gas the next stage will be graphene preparation fig 1 amartya chakrabarti and a colleague converted co2 into a few layers of graphene in 2011 they considered the reaction between magnesium and co2 for this purpose it was then treated with 1 m hcl washed with deionized water and dried overnight in a vacuum at 100 c at the end of the research various characterizations via electronic microscope and infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of graphene 27 recently liu et al 31 converted co2 into graphene in two steps co2 was converted into carbon in the first step using carbonate based electrolysis and graphene was created in the second step using electrochemical exfoliation of carbon as a byproduct of the graphene preparation process oxygen was produced throughout the entire process the author also suggested changing the carbonate electrolysis time and varying the carbonate mixture to have a more lateral dimension of graphene to make this conversion more efficient and cost effective sun et al 32 investigated alkali metal based chemical reactions for co2 gas decomposition and graphitization specifically different alkaline metals such as potassium lithium and sodium were considered to react directly with co2 for carbon extraction followed by acid washing to produce flower like graphene the authors also considered how such fabricated graphene could be used in advanced fields such as solar cells batteries and environmental remediation furthermore recommendations are provided to improve process efficiency including the consideration of various parameters such as co2 gas pressure alkaline metal concentration and heating process calcium magnesium and aluminum should also be considered as reactive and earth abundant metals for the production of graphene from co2 gas li et al 33 investigated co2 as a feedstock gas source for graphene preparation during their research the magnesiothermic reaction was studied to break the co bond in order to separate carbon for graphene preparation and exposed to acid rinsing in order to have graphene with a mesoporous structure liang et al 34 investigated the green approach of graphite synthesis from co2 gas in the year of 2021 during this experimentation a simple reaction between co2 and lithium aluminum hydride was considered at a lower temperature 126 c the author also claimed that this method of fabrication is environmentally friendly and can be carried out at low temperatures without the use of any metal catalysts so the overall understanding of these explanations is to emphasize the possibility of recycling waste microfibers or mps with other derivatives into graphene or other commercially viable products with greater efficiency microplastics in addition to graphene and related products can be used to produce gasoline through co2 production recovered mps in particular can be incinerated or electrochemically oxidized into co2 gas which can then be used as a feedstock for fuel generation to ensure environmental sustainability yao et al 35 transformed co2 into hydrocarbons jet fuel the fe mn k catalyst was fabricated in this experiment using the organic combustion process and it converted co2 into aviation jet fuel via hydrogenation to hydrocarbons several byproducts of the chemical reaction were also produced including butene ethylene and propylene these byproducts are crucial raw materials for the petrochemical industry according to the author this fabricated hydrocarbon aviation fuel is carbon neutral because the hazardous material was extracted during the chemical processing as a result co2 based feedstock gas is a renewable and sustainable source of fuel extraction kumaravel et al 36 later investigated photoelectrochemical pec reactions for the conversion of co2 into fuels as well as other chemicals the author suggested varieties of photoelectrode materials to improve the efficacy of pec including molecular catalysts 2d 3d materials biological molecules and carbon based catalysts in addition controlling several parameters such as the source of light for electrochemical reaction co2 solubility reactor operational mode phase requirement and heat exchanging system is also important to consider when building a pec reactor yarn preparation from mps may also become a viable option in terms of mps recycling strategy sarioğlu et al 25 investigated the prospects for recycling polyethylene terephthalate plastics into sustainable textile during recycling the conversion process included several steps such as grinding plastics to make flakes washing drying extruding fiber production yarn fabrication the feasibility of producing yarn from such recycled fibers was then determined through mechanical characterization following this fabrication method could thus be the most sustainable way to prepare garments from polyethylene terephthalate based mps it is worth noting that other mps derivatives should also be investigated to determine their suitability for garments preparation 5 conclusion microplastics mps are proliferating in our environment in the blink of an eye with a two fold increase in plastic waste forecasted between 2016 and 2040 from 188 to 380 million tons weathering will undoubtedly cause this massive waste to degrade and form mps as a result recycling and reusing mps in various formats such as graphene fabrication aviation fuel production garment preparation or the synthesis of other commercially viable products should be considered as a result these highlighting concepts are highly compatible for commercial use and should be researched further for process optimization process control material evaluation and quality control furthermore the circular economy concept can be used to promote sustainability by retaining plastic resources in the economic cycle for a longer period in addition greater preference should be imposed in our daily lives for using bio based polymers which can alter the demand for plastics to a greater extent thereby a material that has been used for a few minutes or hours and requires nearly half a millennium to degrade and remain unscathed in the environment is unworthy of manufacture and has no chance of being used in an unsustainable manner declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment ministry of science technology and university grant commission of bangladesh

primarily affect aquatic organisms of the vertebrate family furthermore tiny plastics endanger one fifth of all sea bird species half of all mammals and all sea turtles various complexities for mps have been incorporated regarding aquatic species up to this point but the ultimate result is the reduction and extinction of aquatic life as a result it is a difficult time for aquatic creatures and it is a matter of life and death for them as a result of human activities before the solution problem identification is inevitable and satellite remote sensing is one of the most updated technology for mps detection in water in 2020 lauren biermann and her teammate for the first time detect mps on the water surface using esa sentinel 2 satellites they also used naive bayes bayesian algorithm to synchronize optical sensing data with 86 detection accuracy and published their findings in scientific reports 12 most notably researchers are proposing the integration of ir spectroscopy with auto image analyzer and particle counting for flawless mps identification as a result raman spectroscopy with auto scanning and counting capabilities of mps is already the most recent technique to emerge in research trends 4 thermoanalytical techniques are an alternative to ir spectroscopy for the chemical characterization of mps however its applicability is limited due to the destructive as well as the time consuming nature of the analysis later modifications have been proposed to integrate an auto image analyzer with this thermal process for maximum accuracy with requiring the least amount of labor 2 to analyze the properties physical and chemical of such plastic polymers a simple and accurate detection method for mps is required because it is necessary to assess the recycling capacity of existing mps 3 hypothesis of microplastics recovery in terms of mps separation competitive research is being conducted to develop standard separation technologies with the highest output plasma electrolytic oxidation graphene based adsorption electrocoagulation nanocomposites membrane filtration and magnetic separation are examples of cutting edge technology 2 13 in terms of mps recovery after separation chitin with graphene oxide nano adsorbent is noteworthy and the adsorbent was used three successive cycles for polystyrene sieving created by cuizhu sun and team members in 2020 and is expected to be used to combat mps pollution 14 with the abundance of polystyrene and its impact in mind research is still being conducted with reduced graphene oxide to achieve the highest reusability and biocompatibility of adsorbent similarly the polymeric membrane is used more effectively to trap polystyrene based mps on trend shi et al 15 used magnetic nano fe3o4 for the removal of polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate based mps with 80 efficiency with surface adsorption being the promising step furthermore new technologies are gradually being implemented to separate various polymeric mps from water perren et al 16 used an electrochemical pathway to separate polyethylene based mps with varying concentrations this simple and inexpensive experiment yielded a 99 removal rate magnetic extraction is also the recent technology for sieving mps it has the potential to be a low complexity alternative to a traditional filtration system with such a viewpoint rhein et al 17 considered polyvinyl chloride based mps separation via magnetic seeded filtration magnetite based the authors confirmed a 95 mps removal rate using this sieving process and electrostatic interactions were the rate determining factor wang et al 18 recently investigated the separation of polystyrene microspheres by using bio adsorbent in this process porous biochar derived from corn straw and hardwood was used this method has been shown to remove more than 95 of mps using along with a series of sand filtration systems moreover novel strategies based on au ni tio2 based photocatalytic micromotors have recently been used for mps extraction as micromotors have core shell properties mps can be effectively removed via phoretic interaction 19 to use hydrophobic effects for mps separation rius ayra et al 20 modified the surface of mps to change its wettability by introducing superoleophilicity and superhydrophobicity these two methods can result in long term mps separation tactics with higher process efficiency for mps separation a new concept of foam materials based auto filtration systems is also worth mentioning chen et al 21 fabricated a zirconium organic framework based foamy material for mps separation with 95 5 1 2 efficacy for this purpose in this case a greater uniformity greater durability and the availability of interpenetrated pores in fabricated foams are critical for sieving mps from both fresh water and seawater pizzichetti et al 22 evaluated the performance of three different polymeric membranes to separate polyamide and polystyrene mps with particle sizes ranging from 20 to 300 μm while keeping cost and sustainability in mind during testing such synthetic membranes achieved a removal efficiency of more than 94 as a result everyone is attempting to separate polystyrene and other tiny plastic derivatives from water but what will happen to these recovered mps and where do they end up will it be recycled with careful management for value addition or returned to the environment there is currently no answer in terms of commercial viability however this discussion may solve the puzzle and the most likely solution is the conversion of mps into valuable products such as gasoline garment fiber graphene and so on which has the potential to industrialize for the benefit of living beings fig 1 the primary challenge for recycling strategies is the desorption of mps grafted with adsorbent or membrane cuizhu sun and colleagues have already demonstrated desorption and recycling of go adsorbent up to three cycles as a result it is possible to desorb polystyrene based mps and prepare them for further use the simplest method for desorption tactics is to wash with ethanol for 10 min although the concept of mps desorption and recycling is relatively new it is quite common for adsorbents loaded with heavy metals extracted from wastewater and reused mps desorption from adsorbent and membrane surfaces can occur via two mechanisms acidic and alkaline treatment several alkalis including sodium carbonate sodium hydroxide sodium bicarbonate potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate are commonly used for metal desorption with naoh exhibiting the best performance 94 6 98 3 for various pollutant recovery on the other hand acidic treatments such as hydrochloric acid acetic acid sulfuric acid and formic acid are used for desorption studies while mild acids are recommended for preserving material integrity 23 24 as a result these chemical treatments can be tested for mps desorption to ensure complete recovery it is important to note that researchers should confirm dose optimization for acid and alkali treatment to have unscathed mps and no additional threat to nature furthermore for mps recovery in a short period an optimized application of edta can be considered fig 1 so what are the next steps after the mps recovery the answer is mps degradation for carbon extraction which will be the most difficult part of mps journey to graphene or related materials 4 hypothesis of microplastics recycling routes in terms of mps recycling several paths can be taken i heat treatment of mps to convert into fibers followed by spinning into yarn for use in clothing 25 ii degradation of recovered mps into carbon dioxide and water following that co2 can be electrochemically converted into carbon monoxide to use as a gasoline precursor 26 carbon dioxide can also be used to extract carbon for the production of highly valuable graphene and other similar materials 27 in this study we represented mps recycling into various commercial products microbial degradation can be a prominent method for the beginning of the recycling journey for the preparation of graphene and other related materials what happened during the microbial degradation process and how did microbes use carbon based mps as a source of energy these answers will be the primary mechanism for carbon extraction and can be replicated in the laboratory using controlled media shosuke yoshida and his team responded to this question in 2016 they investigated the degradation mechanism and discovered the petase and mhetase enzymes secreted by bacteria ideonella sakaiensis 201 f6 to separate polyethylene terephthalate based plastic constituents to engulf the abundance of carbon 28 it can be answered more easily when secreted enzymes eat the chemical bonds of the polymeric chain the molecules break down into smaller components as a result microbes digest only carbon causing mps to degrade so if these enzymes can be used commercially to extract carbon from mps then recycling plastic particles may be a viable option in terms of environmental safety controlled plastics incineration for energy recovery is widely used in various countries it has been estimated that during the incineration of plastics 673 to 4605 g kg 1 co2 can be produced 29 as a result by further chemical treatment of co2 this process can be replicated for mps degradation without jeopardizing the environmental suitability to have enough carbon on january 18th 2021 a news article in new atlas stated that prof patrick drogui scientists at inrs canada degraded polystyrene based mps of wastewater into non toxic co2 and water previously the team investigated anodic oxidation in terms of polystyrene degradation up to 58 21 in 1 h the experimental strategy and research data were published in the journal of environmental pollution 13 they are now attempting to apply the technique 89 degradation rate directly to pure laundry wastewater to produce co2 and water ward et al also experimented with converting polystyrene into co2 using natural sunlight 30 as a result these studies show that co2 emissions from polystyrene fiber based mps are possible other mps and their derivatives may also be feasible in this manner until now sufficient explanations have been provided for co2 preparation but what will be the use of this gas the next stage will be graphene preparation fig 1 amartya chakrabarti and a colleague converted co2 into a few layers of graphene in 2011 they considered the reaction between magnesium and co2 for this purpose it was then treated with 1 m hcl washed with deionized water and dried overnight in a vacuum at 100 c at the end of the research various characterizations via electronic microscope and infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of graphene 27 recently liu et al 31 converted co2 into graphene in two steps co2 was converted into carbon in the first step using carbonate based electrolysis and graphene was created in the second step using electrochemical exfoliation of carbon as a byproduct of the graphene preparation process oxygen was produced throughout the entire process the author also suggested changing the carbonate electrolysis time and varying the carbonate mixture to have a more lateral dimension of graphene to make this conversion more efficient and cost effective sun et al 32 investigated alkali metal based chemical reactions for co2 gas decomposition and graphitization specifically different alkaline metals such as potassium lithium and sodium were considered to react directly with co2 for carbon extraction followed by acid washing to produce flower like graphene the authors also considered how such fabricated graphene could be used in advanced fields such as solar cells batteries and environmental remediation furthermore recommendations are provided to improve process efficiency including the consideration of various parameters such as co2 gas pressure alkaline metal concentration and heating process calcium magnesium and aluminum should also be considered as reactive and earth abundant metals for the production of graphene from co2 gas li et al 33 investigated co2 as a feedstock gas source for graphene preparation during their research the magnesiothermic reaction was studied to break the co bond in order to separate carbon for graphene preparation and exposed to acid rinsing in order to have graphene with a mesoporous structure liang et al 34 investigated the green approach of graphite synthesis from co2 gas in the year of 2021 during this experimentation a simple reaction between co2 and lithium aluminum hydride was considered at a lower temperature 126 c the author also claimed that this method of fabrication is environmentally friendly and can be carried out at low temperatures without the use of any metal catalysts so the overall understanding of these explanations is to emphasize the possibility of recycling waste microfibers or mps with other derivatives into graphene or other commercially viable products with greater efficiency microplastics in addition to graphene and related products can be used to produce gasoline through co2 production recovered mps in particular can be incinerated or electrochemically oxidized into co2 gas which can then be used as a feedstock for fuel generation to ensure environmental sustainability yao et al 35 transformed co2 into hydrocarbons jet fuel the fe mn k catalyst was fabricated in this experiment using the organic combustion process and it converted co2 into aviation jet fuel via hydrogenation to hydrocarbons several byproducts of the chemical reaction were also produced including butene ethylene and propylene these byproducts are crucial raw materials for the petrochemical industry according to the author this fabricated hydrocarbon aviation fuel is carbon neutral because the hazardous material was extracted during the chemical processing as a result co2 based feedstock gas is a renewable and sustainable source of fuel extraction kumaravel et al 36 later investigated photoelectrochemical pec reactions for the conversion of co2 into fuels as well as other chemicals the author suggested varieties of photoelectrode materials to improve the efficacy of pec including molecular catalysts 2d 3d materials biological molecules and carbon based catalysts in addition controlling several parameters such as the source of light for electrochemical reaction co2 solubility reactor operational mode phase requirement and heat exchanging system is also important to consider when building a pec reactor yarn preparation from mps may also become a viable option in terms of mps recycling strategy sarioğlu et al 25 investigated the prospects for recycling polyethylene terephthalate plastics into sustainable textile during recycling the conversion process included several steps such as grinding plastics to make flakes washing drying extruding fiber production yarn fabrication the feasibility of producing yarn from such recycled fibers was then determined through mechanical characterization following this fabrication method could thus be the most sustainable way to prepare garments from polyethylene terephthalate based mps it is worth noting that other mps derivatives should also be investigated to determine their suitability for garments preparation 5 conclusion microplastics mps are proliferating in our environment in the blink of an eye with a two fold increase in plastic waste forecasted between 2016 and 2040 from 188 to 380 million tons weathering will undoubtedly cause this massive waste to degrade and form mps as a result recycling and reusing mps in various formats such as graphene fabrication aviation fuel production garment preparation or the synthesis of other commercially viable products should be considered as a result these highlighting concepts are highly compatible for commercial use and should be researched further for process optimization process control material evaluation and quality control furthermore the circular economy concept can be used to promote sustainability by retaining plastic resources in the economic cycle for a longer period in addition greater preference should be imposed in our daily lives for using bio based polymers which can alter the demand for plastics to a greater extent thereby a material that has been used for a few minutes or hours and requires nearly half a millennium to degrade and remain unscathed in the environment is unworthy of manufacture and has no chance of being used in an unsustainable manner declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment ministry of science technology and university grant commission of bangladesh

13242,in this study we developed a single medium membraneless microbial fuel cell sm mfc to examine the migration and types of cu ii migration in sediment and the difference in the microorganism community under various cathode conditions to prevent o2 from competing with cu ii for electrons in the cathode and limiting the cu ii migration efficiency we buried the cathode in sediment to facilitate cu ii migration modified stainless steel was used as a biocathode to increase electron migration in the mfc and enhance the electromigration of cu ii in the initial phase voltages were applied to the mfc for microorganism acclimation and the results revealed that the average voltage of the mfc reached 67 2 mv which was 9 29 times higher than that of the mfc without voltage application when the cu ii in the sediment is 172 mg kg after 100 days of operation the mfc with a 10 cm electrode spacing exhibited the highest cu ii removal efficiency 57 and voltage output 57 7 mv the voltage output of the sm mfc with a biocathode was 1 72 times higher than that of the cell with an abiotic cathode the migrated cu ii formed cu2o and cuo at the cathode the dominant bacteria phyla discovered at the cathode of the sm mfc i e proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria could degrade organic matter generate electricity and tolerate cu ii graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sediment microbial fuel cell biocathode applied voltages electromigration microbial profile external resistance 1 introduction bioelectrochemical systems are increasingly being applied to the remediation of heavy metal pollution among these systems microbial fuel cells mfcs are a potential novel electrochemical technology 1 in mfcs chemical energy is converted into electrical energy through the anodic oxidation of organic compounds in microorganisms the electromotive force generated by electron movement in such cells can be applied to remove heavy metals in water 2 among them copper has the potential to be reduced in recent years there have been many reports of successful bioelectrochemical removal of copper from wastewater 3 5 currently mfcs are mostly used for treating heavy metal wastewater and less commonly for treating sediment contaminated with heavy metal this is mainly because sediment which is highly viscus and consists of tiny particles readily absorbs metals and therefore impedes metal migration 6 however sediment contains rich microorganisms as well as the nutrients they feed on 7 features a slightly anaerobic environment and consists of microorganisms that even metal tolerant these characteristics contribute to the advantages of mfc application therefore the anode can be placed in an oxygen deficient sediment environment to develop innovative sediment microbial fuel cells smfcs the microorganisms on the smfc anode oxidize the organic matter in the sediment and release electrons and protons while the cathode uses heavy metals as the electron acceptor thus achieving the detoxification of the heavy metals in the sediment 8 in addition the electromigration through the smfc can promote the migration of heavy metals in the sediment environment to overcome the defect of insufficient mass transfer capacity of sediments and increase the application potential of mfcs for treating heavy metal polluted sediment 9 researchers have discussed the parameters used in smfc applications for the treatment of heavy metal pollution in oceans these parameters include ph and temperature 10 oxygen content 11 and diverse types of heavy metals 12 the key to successful heavy metal removal with smfcs is the use of the adequate electron acceptor type at the mfc cathode because o2 1 23 v has a higher redox potential than most heavy metals e g cu ii 0 28 v ag i 0 79 v and pb ii 0 91 v it undergoes a reduction reaction with electrons at the cathode more readily than do heavy metals this prevents metal ions from obtaining electrons and limits the reduction of metals 13 wu et al 14 employed an smfc to degrade sediment organic matter in rivers and successfully removed hg ii cu ii and ag i they concluded that the toxicity of heavy metals reduces the diversity of microorganisms and inhibits their growth and activity to increase the removal efficiency re of metals oxygen depletion is required at the smfc cathode to prevent o2 from competing with heavy metals for electrons accordingly metals can be used instead of o2 as the electron acceptor at the smfc cathode to facilitate heavy metal removal the diminished toxicity of the reduced metals may also minimize the harm to microorganisms 15 conventional smfcs are membraneless vertical and single chambered specifically the anode is embedded in an anaerobic sediment and the cathode is exposed to the aerobic upper water layer the high concentration o2 at the cathode is used to induce a reduction reaction and increase voltage 16 however li and yu 17 indicated that although such a design could increase voltage part of the o2 might diffuse into the anode and cause energy losses moreover because the redox potential at the cathode is a key to heavy metal removal the operating conditions at the smfc cathode e g o2 should be adjusted according to the redox potential level to prevent o2 from competing with heavy metals for electrons erable et al 18 designed a single medium mfc sm mfc and applied it to marine sediment the graphite anode and stainless steel cathode were both buried in the sediment their results revealed that the current density of the smfc was maintained at 280 ma m2 for 2 weeks confirming that an mfc with a single medium could form an electric field however the field only lasted for 14 days qin et al 19 buried the anode and cathode of an sm mfc in soil and applied a voltage of 0 5 v to remove no3 the results demonstrated that the applied voltages were beneficial for removing organic matter and increasing the variety of microorganism the aforementioned studies on sm mfcs have focused on the treatment of sediment contaminated by organic or inorganic compounds rather than heavy metals and the discussions emphasized the microbial community instead of the electrochemical effects of mfcs in addition li and yu 17 reported that mfc has the potential to remove copper containing sediments and current studies have confirmed the possibility of soil copper migration 9 however the properties of sediment and soil are slightly different for example the mass transfer of sediment physical and chemical properties e g ph conductivity and microbial structure limitations make the migration of copper in sediments may face challenges in this study we adopted an sm mfc to treat copper contaminated sediment the cathode was buried in the sediment to facilitate the migration and removal of cu ii and cu ii that migrated to the cathode was used as the electron acceptor of the mfc to increase voltage output the use of conventional smfcs in sediment is limited by the poor mass transfer performance of organic matter which reduces the attachment of microorganisms and transfer of electrons however this work used simple and low cost electrode materials i e carbon cloth and stainless steel mesh to develop an sm mfc with biocathode can successfully increase voltage output because the electrochemically active bacteria present in the cell can easily attach to the cathode the abiotic cathode of the developed cell addresses the lack of mfc potential difference caused by the organic matter degrading bacteria at the anode and the cathode the objectives of this study were to 1 discuss the effect of applied voltages on cu ii migration and microorganism activity in sm mfcs 2 estimate the effect of electrode spacing on the energy output and cu ii migration in sm mfcs 3 assess the difference in the effects of sm mfc biocathodes and abiotic cathodes on electron transfer efficiency and 4 examine changes in the microbial community under various cathode conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum and incubation we retrieved a mixed culture from a wastewater treatment plant the obtained sludge was placed into an acclimation bucket 5 2 l containing 500 ml of nutrients and sodium acetate was used as a long term substrate 1 g l was replenished weekly the acclimation bucket was exposed to n2 weekly to maintain the dissolved oxygen level at 1 mg l and a trace amount of cu ii was added weekly to acclimate cu tolerant microorganisms 2 2 sample preparation construction of sm mfc and operation the sediment was sampled from a pond in yunlin county taiwan using a grab sampler all sediment samples were obtained by removing large gravels or debris the analysis of their basic properties was shown in table 1 the sm mfc chamber was made of an acrylic container 2200 cm3 as shown in fig 1 before the experiment we dried the sediment sample in an oven at 105 c and filtered it with a 100 mesh screen subsequently cu ii was added to the sediment which was then stirred and evenly mixed 150 250 mg kg the amount of cu ii artificially added to the sediment sample was 0 96 1 59 folds higher than the upper limit of copper 157 mg kg which was determined in accordance with the regulations on the management of sediment quality index system and its use restrictions promulgated by the taiwan environmental protection agency after placing contaminated sediment sample in the reactor at a height of approximately 5 cm we added 300 mg l mixed bacteria w w obtained by concentration in a centrifuge z323k hermle labortechnik usa 0 5 g of ch3coona and 0 5 ml of nutrients the experiment was divided into three phases in phase i we examined the effect of applied voltages on the acclimation period of the sm mfc in phase ii we evaluated the differences in the voltage output and cu removal result of the sm mfc with respect to various electrode spacings 5 10 and 15 cm in phase iii we compared the effect of a biocathode and an abiotic cathode on the cu recovery result and the electrochemical activity of the mfc voltage application was conducted by connecting the anode and cathode to the power supply mp 310 major science ca usa and applying a potential difference between the electrodes with a direct current 1 v 100 ma experiments in all phases were performed in triplicate and one set of open circuit condition served as a control group due to long term operation about 100 days a transparent plastic dropper was used to supplement sm mfc with nutrients and 1 g l sodium acetate every week the type of electrode material is the key to smfc electricity production carbon based materials are usually used as anodes while stainless steel meshes have been reported to have the potential to become biocathode materials 18 therefore a carbon cloth 10 10 cm a common carbon based material and stainless steel mesh 5 5 5 5 cm were used as the anode and cathode of the sm mfc respectively and the electrodes were connected with a titanium wire before use the carbon cloth and stainless steel mesh were soaked in a 15 hno3 solution and a ch3coch3 solution respectively to remove the organic matter or impurities attached to the material before the operation of the sm mfc we placed the anode and cathode in the sediment the anode surface was inoculated with acclimated microorganisms with electrochemical capabilities when the open circuit voltage of the sm mfc reached the maximum 200 mv and stabilized we used a 1 kω resistor as the external resistor that connected the anode and cathode 2 3 fabrication of abiotic cathode a stainless steel mesh was used as the abiotic cathode first the surface was modified using coke powder and a microorganism inhibitor agno3 20 21 the coke powder that passed through the 100 mesh screen was placed in an oven and dried at 50 c for 24 h subsequently it was soaked in a mixture of agno3 that inhibited microorganism activity the mixture underwent ultrasonic oscillation for 120 min and was settled for 24 h the modification of the coke powder was completed after the mixture in the supernatant was removed and the temperature of the mixture was raised to 500 c within 2 h 3 c min the modified coke powder 0 5 g coke g pva was mixed with polyvinyl alcohol 10 solution and this mixture was coated on the outer layer of the stainless steel after it was dried in the oven at 50 c the abiotic cathode was completed 2 4 analysis of copper and chemical oxygen demand we extracted 2 ml of water sample from the anode of the sm mfc digested it through 0 1 ml of hno3 1 m and oscillated it thoroughly for 3 5 s the water sample was then filtered using a 0 22 μm membrane filter an atomic absorption spectrometer aa pg990 pg uk was employed to measure the cu ii concentration of the water sample to be tested the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of the water sample was analyzed using the closed dichromate reflux method niea w517 53b and inspected using a multiparameter portable colorimeter dr890 hach usa 2 5 electrochemical analysis the voltage output monitoring of the sm mfc was conducted through a continuity test with a multimeter keithley 7700 2200 usa to record one data point every minute the multimeter cht 48r chy taiwan was applied to connect various external resistors 510 kω 5 ω for measuring the voltage output of the sm mfc the power density pd was obtained according to the anode volume 750 cm3 and the pd and polarization curves were plotted internal resistance measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv analysis were carried out using potentiostat sp 150 bio logic france the cv and eis of sm mfc were measured by the three electrode method 22 among them the anode was the working electrode and the cathode was the auxiliary electrode and the reference electrode ag agcl was inserted into the sediment of the sm mfc cv scanned at least twice from 1 0 v to 1 0 v at a scan rate of 20 mv s eis scanned impedance between 100 khz and 100 mhz with a sinusoidal interference amplitude of 10 mv 2 6 sem eds and xrd analyses the microorganisms attached to the surface of the sm mfc electrodes the type of sediment and the ratio of metal compounds were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope jsm 6701f japan the element content was determined by an energy dispersive spectrometer rigaku japan furthermore the lattice structure with compound properties on the cathode was inspected using an x ray diffractometer rigaku japan 2 7 biomass and microbial community the biomass was measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay biobasic inc canada we mixed 3 g of the sediment with a 5 sodium dodecyl sulfonate solution and obtained cellular proteins after 120 min of ultrasonic oscillation subsequently the absorbance of the sample at a wavelength of 562 nm was measured using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy opron 3000 hanson tech co ltd korea to calculate the protein concentration we extracted 5 g of the sediment from the cathode at three time points before operation 15 days after voltage application and 100 days after operation to serve as samples to initiate 16s rdna microbial high throughput sequencing first the dna of the microorganisms was extracted using a dna kit purelink subsequently the target segment v3 v4 341f 805r was subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification and the amplified product was purified through a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen finally the 300 bp paired end reads were generated using the illumina miseq platform by genomics biosci tech co new taipei city taiwan 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of applied voltages on cu ii electromigration by mfc the average voltage output was 7 23 mv the cu ii concentration dropped slightly re 2 68 at the initial operation phase of the mfc fig 2 after we applied 1 v of voltage to the mfc on the 15th 20th day the concentration of cu ii dropped from 140 mg kg to 85 mg kg re 39 3 a re increase of 14 7 times and the voltage output on the 40th day 67 2 mv on average when the sm mfc was stable was 9 29 times higher than that before voltage was applied this corresponds with the results obtained by gunda et al 23 they treated waste leachate with a single chamber mfc and applied a voltage of 500 mv to increase the electricity generation to a level 1 68 times higher 832 mw m2 than that before voltage was applied the re of the cod also increased to 80 4 baskaran et al 24 applied a voltage of 30 v to the anode chamber to treat cu containing soil with an electrokinetic remediation technology the results indicated that the re of cu increased from 23 95 to 63 95 after voltages were applied confirming that metal ions could be migrated to the cathode by applying voltages the main purpose of this research is to create a potential difference environment between the anode and cathode of sm mfc by applying voltage to facilitate the growth of electricity producing microorganisms the 20th day and the 60th day represent the influence of the applied voltage on the mfc and after the applied voltage respectively and the influence of the potential difference formed by the applied voltage on the biological activity of the sm mfc was compared the voltage applied to the sm mfc did not increase the amount of bacteria during the initial phase of the experiment with the average protein concentration being 563 μg ml fig 3 on the 60th day of the operation the voltage applied to the sm mfc increased the protein concentration to 1344 μg ml which was 1 81 times higher than that before voltages were applied that is the applied voltage greatly increased the amount of bacteria this is consistent with the results obtained by modestra et al 25 they applied a voltage of 100 mv to an mfc and the voltage output increased by 2 41 times confirming that voltage application facilitates electron transfer accordingly the applied voltage increased the amount and activity of the bacteria at the anode this approach represents an effective biostimulation technology that reduces the acclimation period of microorganisms however this experiment only verified that the applied voltage considerably affected the voltage output of the mfc over a short period but could not be used to effectively evaluate the effect of the sm mfc on the re of cu or clarify the mechanism of cu removal and the differences between various mechanisms therefore in section 3 4 we propose the voltage be applied at the early phase of microorganism acclimation and discuss the changes in the voltage output cu ii and microbial community under the long term operation of the sm mfc 3 2 effects of electrode spacing on mfc performance as shown in fig 4 the largest average voltage output 57 7 mv of the sm mfc was observed when the electrode spacing was 10 cm and the average voltage was 2 01 and 1 28 times higher than that when the electrode spacing was 5 and 15 cm respectively the maximum pd 34 9 mw m3 occurred when the electrode spacing was 10 cm and the pd was 2 22 and 1 47 times higher than that when the electrode spacing was 5 and 15 cm respectively table 2 this finding is consistent with the aforementioned voltage output trend however although the sm mfc with an electrode spacing of 5 cm had the lowest internal resistance 189 6 ω it did not have the largest pd this accords with the results of nandy et al 26 the reason for this result is that when the electrode spacing was small the protons produced in the anode chamber could reach the cathode by traveling a shorter distance therefore the internal resistance decreased doherty et al 27 used a constructed wetland mfc to degrade cod and discovered that smaller electrode spacing result in lower voltage output this finding can be attributed to the electrons having been removed before reaching the cathode resulting in a limited voltage output this result is similar to that obtained by our study when the electrode spacing was small the cu ii at the anode directly reacted with electrons and was reduced and precipitated in the anode chamber this hindered cu from migrating to the cathode and thus evidently reduced the voltage output and pd liu et al 28 suggested that when the two electrodes are too far apart the pd drops because of the high internal resistance which is consistent with the result we obtained although the sm mfc with a 15 cm electrode spacing exhibited the highest current density of 347 8 ma m3 its internal resistance was 1 17 2 00 times higher than that with a 5 or 10 cm electrode spacing which caused the pd to drop the reason is that when the electrode spacing is longer the resistance to ion and electron transfer increases resulting in the increase of internal resistance and the decrease of voltage output 3 fig 4 also reveals the changes in cu ii under the various electrode spacings the average cu ii concentration of each sm mfc condition was approximately 172 mg kg under 100 days of long term operation the re of the cu ii of the sm mfc with a 10 cm electrode spacing was the most satisfactory 57 it was 1 24 2 17 times higher than that of the sm mfc with a 5 or 15 cm electrode spacing the reason is that the sm mfc with a 10 cm electrode spacing had the highest voltage output hence the relatively high potential difference between the anode and cathode could effectively drive the electromigration of cu ii to the cathode copper conc image 18 5 cm image 19 10 cm image 20 15 cm voltage image 21 5 cm image 22 10 cm image 23 15 cm copper conc image 24 abiotic cathode image 25 biocathode voltage image 26 abiotic cathode image 27 biocathode 3 3 removal efficiency of cu ii under biocathode and abiotic cathode conditions the average voltage output of the sm mfc with a biocathode was only 40 6 mv during the initial operation phase 15 days fig 5 the initial low voltage was presumably caused by the inhibition of microorganism activity due to the high cu ii concentration 223 mg kg 29 on the 20th 40th day the sm mfc with a biocathode had the highest average voltage output 75 9 mv it was 1 72 times higher than that of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode on the 55th day when substrate was again added to the sm mfc the voltages of both mfcs were slightly higher than that in the previous stage the average voltage output of the sm mfc with a biocathode and an abiotic cathode was 84 7 and 42 9 mv respectively furthermore the sm mfc with a biocathode and an abiotic cathode had a similar voltage output under long term operation comprising two phases this suggests that the voltage output of the sm mfc can be maintained after 100 days of operation hence it has the potential for long term operation the concentration of cu ii of sm mfc with a biocathode dropped to 82 mg kg after 100 days of operation re 64 the re was 1 7 times higher than that of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode fig 5 the reason is that the microorganisms on the stainless steel mesh biocathode can directly and physically make contact with the surface of the cathode for electron transfer because the electrons are directly used the electricity output increases this finding corresponds with that of qiu et al 30 the mfc with a biocathode they developed facilitated electron transfer and effectively reduced the resistance to charge transfer which increased electricity output and metal reduction 3 4 electrochemical analysis according to the nyquist plots the internal resistance rint of the mfc includes solvent resistance rs charge transfer resistance rct and warbug s diffusion element w fig 6a shows that rs and w have little difference under biocathode and abiotic cathode condition but rct exhibits significant difference the sm mfc with a biocathode had the smallest rint 170 4 ω it was 49 2 smaller than the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode fig 6a this indicates that the sm mfc with a biocathode has a higher voltage output fig 6a further shows that the greatest difference between the two mfc centers on rct the rct of the sm mfc with a biocathode and an abiotic cathode was 110 and 283 2 ω respectively the rct of the sm mfc with a biocathode was 38 8 smaller than that of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode the reason is that electricity producing microorganisms exist among the microorganisms attaching on the biocathode the electrons can be effectively transferred from microorganisms to the cathode therefore the sm mfc with a biocathode has a smaller rct but greater voltage output and re of cu ii fig 3b zhang et al 31 modified the cathode of an mfc by using cu containing compounds and successfully improved the performance of the mfc the cu ii of the developed mfc migrated from the anode to the cathode hence the internal resistance dropped considerably the sm mfc with a biocathode had a higher peak current value 3 29 ma it was 1 49 times higher than that of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode fig 6b a larger peak current implies that electrochemically active bacteria influenced the electrodes accelerating electron transfer and generating current 32 however this also means that the cathode had a higher ability in receiving electrons therefore the re of cu ii was higher the higher re of cu ii enabled cu compounds to modify the mfc cathode and increased the performance of the mfc the result is consistent with that in section 3 3 both the biocathode fig 7a and the abiotic cathode fig 7d had a smooth structure before the mfc operation but numerous biofilms grew on the electrode surface after long term operation fig 7b c and e f indicating that microorganisms grew well in the sediment environment the microorganisms on the surface of the biocathode may be reducing bacteria which can strengthen the reduction reaction of smfc zhao et al 33 also used the sem to photograph the surface morphology of the biocathode which provided evidence of the existence of reducing bacteria on the surface of the cathode the sm mfc with a biocathode mainly generated cu2o 2θ 36 5 42 4 and 73 7 jcpds card number 77 0199 and cuo 2θ 36 6 42 5 and 77 8 jcpds card number 78 0428 fig 8 this finding is similar to that obtained by wu et al 34 fig 9 displays the distribution of cu ii in the sm mfc the cu ii content at the anode of the sm mfc with a biocathode and an abiotic cathode was 43 8 and 57 5 respectively under an open circuit condition because the mfc cannot generate current under an open circuit condition cu ii can only move to the cathode through diffusion but not electromigration in addition the cu ii content at the biocathode was 1 25 times higher than that at the abiotic cathode which accords with the result revealed in fig 5 the sm mfc with a biocathode had superior electricity output and thus could migrate heavy metals more effectively this result is consistent with that of wang et al 9 3 5 microbial community analysis as listed in table 3 the coverage of all three cathode conditions before operation 15 days after voltage application and 100 days after the operation reached 1 suggesting that the analytical results on the microorganism community was highly representative 35 the average richness of the three samples in terms of chao1 and species was 549 suggesting a high level of species richness at the cathode the changes in enspie the shannon index and the simpson index revealed that the species diversity and uniformity increased after 100 days of operation the reason is that when the microorganism community is stimulated by voltage or current the rise of the environmental potential increases both richness and uniformity 36 fig 10a reveals the analytical results of the phylum of the microorganisms in the cathode the main dominant bacteria in the three cathode conditions were proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria among which the most dominant phylum emerged after 100 days of operation geetanjali et al 37 indicated that proteobacteria and firmicutes are the most common electrochemically active bacteria in smfcs in this study the proteobacteria floras after 100 days of operation accounted for 32 8 which was 1 06 1 14 times higher than that before the operation and 15 days after voltage application the firmicutes floras exhibited a similar trend fig 10a this finding indicates that after long term operation both the activity and richness of the electrochemically active bacteria increased actinobacteria commonly observed in sediment are anaerobic bacteria that are capable of degrading organic matter 38 with the increase in operation time the number of actinobacteria increased by 2 71 times fig 10a domingues et al 39 discovered that the three strains i e proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria are all tolerant to multiple types of heavy metals which corresponds with the result we obtained fig 10b reveals the analytical results of the genus of the microorganisms in the cathode bacillus which accounted for the highest proportion belongs to the genus thiobacillus they are a type of common electricity producing bacteria discovered in mfcs and are capable of degrading organic matter and generating a considerable amount of electricity 40 according to huo et al 41 pelagibacterium are tolerant to heavy metals in this study we added ch3coona as a microbial substrate on a regular basis and discovered geoalkalibacter in the mfc such bacteria can generate high current output by degrading ch3coona 42 according to erable et al 18 in a single medium mfc the microbial structure of the stainless steel mesh biocathode and the graphite anode was similar only under the action of different electrochemistry some reducing bacteria and degrading bacteria have been generated at the cathode and anode respectively therefore it can be inferred that the microbial structures at the cathode and anode of this study are similar however it can also be found from fig 10 of this study that the bacteria of sm mfc are common found in the natural sediment environment so this sm mfc is suitable for on site sediment treatment 4 conclusion applying voltage to the sm mfc for biostimulation can reduce the acclimation period of microorganisms and increase the number and activity of bacteria the sm mfc with 10 cm electrode spacing showed the highest cu ii removal efficiency and voltage output the sm mfc with a biocathode could effectively transfer electrons therefore its re of cu ii was 1 7 times higher and its peak electricity was 1 49 times higher than those of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode the main dominant bacteria discovered in the cathode of the sm mfc were proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria which are all common electrochemically active bacteria with the ability to degrade organic matter and tolerate heavy metals the optimization of the single medium configuration and cathode conditions of the sm mfc intensified electricity output facilitated the cu ii removal and increased the activity of the electrochemically active bacteria in the mfc in this study the anode and cathode were buried in the sediment environment and it was confirmed that the sm mfc can operate stably for 100 days without corrosion or damage to the electrode surface this shows the long term operation capability of sm mfc and the feasibility of practical application declaration of competing

13242,in this study we developed a single medium membraneless microbial fuel cell sm mfc to examine the migration and types of cu ii migration in sediment and the difference in the microorganism community under various cathode conditions to prevent o2 from competing with cu ii for electrons in the cathode and limiting the cu ii migration efficiency we buried the cathode in sediment to facilitate cu ii migration modified stainless steel was used as a biocathode to increase electron migration in the mfc and enhance the electromigration of cu ii in the initial phase voltages were applied to the mfc for microorganism acclimation and the results revealed that the average voltage of the mfc reached 67 2 mv which was 9 29 times higher than that of the mfc without voltage application when the cu ii in the sediment is 172 mg kg after 100 days of operation the mfc with a 10 cm electrode spacing exhibited the highest cu ii removal efficiency 57 and voltage output 57 7 mv the voltage output of the sm mfc with a biocathode was 1 72 times higher than that of the cell with an abiotic cathode the migrated cu ii formed cu2o and cuo at the cathode the dominant bacteria phyla discovered at the cathode of the sm mfc i e proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria could degrade organic matter generate electricity and tolerate cu ii graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sediment microbial fuel cell biocathode applied voltages electromigration microbial profile external resistance 1 introduction bioelectrochemical systems are increasingly being applied to the remediation of heavy metal pollution among these systems microbial fuel cells mfcs are a potential novel electrochemical technology 1 in mfcs chemical energy is converted into electrical energy through the anodic oxidation of organic compounds in microorganisms the electromotive force generated by electron movement in such cells can be applied to remove heavy metals in water 2 among them copper has the potential to be reduced in recent years there have been many reports of successful bioelectrochemical removal of copper from wastewater 3 5 currently mfcs are mostly used for treating heavy metal wastewater and less commonly for treating sediment contaminated with heavy metal this is mainly because sediment which is highly viscus and consists of tiny particles readily absorbs metals and therefore impedes metal migration 6 however sediment contains rich microorganisms as well as the nutrients they feed on 7 features a slightly anaerobic environment and consists of microorganisms that even metal tolerant these characteristics contribute to the advantages of mfc application therefore the anode can be placed in an oxygen deficient sediment environment to develop innovative sediment microbial fuel cells smfcs the microorganisms on the smfc anode oxidize the organic matter in the sediment and release electrons and protons while the cathode uses heavy metals as the electron acceptor thus achieving the detoxification of the heavy metals in the sediment 8 in addition the electromigration through the smfc can promote the migration of heavy metals in the sediment environment to overcome the defect of insufficient mass transfer capacity of sediments and increase the application potential of mfcs for treating heavy metal polluted sediment 9 researchers have discussed the parameters used in smfc applications for the treatment of heavy metal pollution in oceans these parameters include ph and temperature 10 oxygen content 11 and diverse types of heavy metals 12 the key to successful heavy metal removal with smfcs is the use of the adequate electron acceptor type at the mfc cathode because o2 1 23 v has a higher redox potential than most heavy metals e g cu ii 0 28 v ag i 0 79 v and pb ii 0 91 v it undergoes a reduction reaction with electrons at the cathode more readily than do heavy metals this prevents metal ions from obtaining electrons and limits the reduction of metals 13 wu et al 14 employed an smfc to degrade sediment organic matter in rivers and successfully removed hg ii cu ii and ag i they concluded that the toxicity of heavy metals reduces the diversity of microorganisms and inhibits their growth and activity to increase the removal efficiency re of metals oxygen depletion is required at the smfc cathode to prevent o2 from competing with heavy metals for electrons accordingly metals can be used instead of o2 as the electron acceptor at the smfc cathode to facilitate heavy metal removal the diminished toxicity of the reduced metals may also minimize the harm to microorganisms 15 conventional smfcs are membraneless vertical and single chambered specifically the anode is embedded in an anaerobic sediment and the cathode is exposed to the aerobic upper water layer the high concentration o2 at the cathode is used to induce a reduction reaction and increase voltage 16 however li and yu 17 indicated that although such a design could increase voltage part of the o2 might diffuse into the anode and cause energy losses moreover because the redox potential at the cathode is a key to heavy metal removal the operating conditions at the smfc cathode e g o2 should be adjusted according to the redox potential level to prevent o2 from competing with heavy metals for electrons erable et al 18 designed a single medium mfc sm mfc and applied it to marine sediment the graphite anode and stainless steel cathode were both buried in the sediment their results revealed that the current density of the smfc was maintained at 280 ma m2 for 2 weeks confirming that an mfc with a single medium could form an electric field however the field only lasted for 14 days qin et al 19 buried the anode and cathode of an sm mfc in soil and applied a voltage of 0 5 v to remove no3 the results demonstrated that the applied voltages were beneficial for removing organic matter and increasing the variety of microorganism the aforementioned studies on sm mfcs have focused on the treatment of sediment contaminated by organic or inorganic compounds rather than heavy metals and the discussions emphasized the microbial community instead of the electrochemical effects of mfcs in addition li and yu 17 reported that mfc has the potential to remove copper containing sediments and current studies have confirmed the possibility of soil copper migration 9 however the properties of sediment and soil are slightly different for example the mass transfer of sediment physical and chemical properties e g ph conductivity and microbial structure limitations make the migration of copper in sediments may face challenges in this study we adopted an sm mfc to treat copper contaminated sediment the cathode was buried in the sediment to facilitate the migration and removal of cu ii and cu ii that migrated to the cathode was used as the electron acceptor of the mfc to increase voltage output the use of conventional smfcs in sediment is limited by the poor mass transfer performance of organic matter which reduces the attachment of microorganisms and transfer of electrons however this work used simple and low cost electrode materials i e carbon cloth and stainless steel mesh to develop an sm mfc with biocathode can successfully increase voltage output because the electrochemically active bacteria present in the cell can easily attach to the cathode the abiotic cathode of the developed cell addresses the lack of mfc potential difference caused by the organic matter degrading bacteria at the anode and the cathode the objectives of this study were to 1 discuss the effect of applied voltages on cu ii migration and microorganism activity in sm mfcs 2 estimate the effect of electrode spacing on the energy output and cu ii migration in sm mfcs 3 assess the difference in the effects of sm mfc biocathodes and abiotic cathodes on electron transfer efficiency and 4 examine changes in the microbial community under various cathode conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum and incubation we retrieved a mixed culture from a wastewater treatment plant the obtained sludge was placed into an acclimation bucket 5 2 l containing 500 ml of nutrients and sodium acetate was used as a long term substrate 1 g l was replenished weekly the acclimation bucket was exposed to n2 weekly to maintain the dissolved oxygen level at 1 mg l and a trace amount of cu ii was added weekly to acclimate cu tolerant microorganisms 2 2 sample preparation construction of sm mfc and operation the sediment was sampled from a pond in yunlin county taiwan using a grab sampler all sediment samples were obtained by removing large gravels or debris the analysis of their basic properties was shown in table 1 the sm mfc chamber was made of an acrylic container 2200 cm3 as shown in fig 1 before the experiment we dried the sediment sample in an oven at 105 c and filtered it with a 100 mesh screen subsequently cu ii was added to the sediment which was then stirred and evenly mixed 150 250 mg kg the amount of cu ii artificially added to the sediment sample was 0 96 1 59 folds higher than the upper limit of copper 157 mg kg which was determined in accordance with the regulations on the management of sediment quality index system and its use restrictions promulgated by the taiwan environmental protection agency after placing contaminated sediment sample in the reactor at a height of approximately 5 cm we added 300 mg l mixed bacteria w w obtained by concentration in a centrifuge z323k hermle labortechnik usa 0 5 g of ch3coona and 0 5 ml of nutrients the experiment was divided into three phases in phase i we examined the effect of applied voltages on the acclimation period of the sm mfc in phase ii we evaluated the differences in the voltage output and cu removal result of the sm mfc with respect to various electrode spacings 5 10 and 15 cm in phase iii we compared the effect of a biocathode and an abiotic cathode on the cu recovery result and the electrochemical activity of the mfc voltage application was conducted by connecting the anode and cathode to the power supply mp 310 major science ca usa and applying a potential difference between the electrodes with a direct current 1 v 100 ma experiments in all phases were performed in triplicate and one set of open circuit condition served as a control group due to long term operation about 100 days a transparent plastic dropper was used to supplement sm mfc with nutrients and 1 g l sodium acetate every week the type of electrode material is the key to smfc electricity production carbon based materials are usually used as anodes while stainless steel meshes have been reported to have the potential to become biocathode materials 18 therefore a carbon cloth 10 10 cm a common carbon based material and stainless steel mesh 5 5 5 5 cm were used as the anode and cathode of the sm mfc respectively and the electrodes were connected with a titanium wire before use the carbon cloth and stainless steel mesh were soaked in a 15 hno3 solution and a ch3coch3 solution respectively to remove the organic matter or impurities attached to the material before the operation of the sm mfc we placed the anode and cathode in the sediment the anode surface was inoculated with acclimated microorganisms with electrochemical capabilities when the open circuit voltage of the sm mfc reached the maximum 200 mv and stabilized we used a 1 kω resistor as the external resistor that connected the anode and cathode 2 3 fabrication of abiotic cathode a stainless steel mesh was used as the abiotic cathode first the surface was modified using coke powder and a microorganism inhibitor agno3 20 21 the coke powder that passed through the 100 mesh screen was placed in an oven and dried at 50 c for 24 h subsequently it was soaked in a mixture of agno3 that inhibited microorganism activity the mixture underwent ultrasonic oscillation for 120 min and was settled for 24 h the modification of the coke powder was completed after the mixture in the supernatant was removed and the temperature of the mixture was raised to 500 c within 2 h 3 c min the modified coke powder 0 5 g coke g pva was mixed with polyvinyl alcohol 10 solution and this mixture was coated on the outer layer of the stainless steel after it was dried in the oven at 50 c the abiotic cathode was completed 2 4 analysis of copper and chemical oxygen demand we extracted 2 ml of water sample from the anode of the sm mfc digested it through 0 1 ml of hno3 1 m and oscillated it thoroughly for 3 5 s the water sample was then filtered using a 0 22 μm membrane filter an atomic absorption spectrometer aa pg990 pg uk was employed to measure the cu ii concentration of the water sample to be tested the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of the water sample was analyzed using the closed dichromate reflux method niea w517 53b and inspected using a multiparameter portable colorimeter dr890 hach usa 2 5 electrochemical analysis the voltage output monitoring of the sm mfc was conducted through a continuity test with a multimeter keithley 7700 2200 usa to record one data point every minute the multimeter cht 48r chy taiwan was applied to connect various external resistors 510 kω 5 ω for measuring the voltage output of the sm mfc the power density pd was obtained according to the anode volume 750 cm3 and the pd and polarization curves were plotted internal resistance measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv analysis were carried out using potentiostat sp 150 bio logic france the cv and eis of sm mfc were measured by the three electrode method 22 among them the anode was the working electrode and the cathode was the auxiliary electrode and the reference electrode ag agcl was inserted into the sediment of the sm mfc cv scanned at least twice from 1 0 v to 1 0 v at a scan rate of 20 mv s eis scanned impedance between 100 khz and 100 mhz with a sinusoidal interference amplitude of 10 mv 2 6 sem eds and xrd analyses the microorganisms attached to the surface of the sm mfc electrodes the type of sediment and the ratio of metal compounds were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope jsm 6701f japan the element content was determined by an energy dispersive spectrometer rigaku japan furthermore the lattice structure with compound properties on the cathode was inspected using an x ray diffractometer rigaku japan 2 7 biomass and microbial community the biomass was measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay biobasic inc canada we mixed 3 g of the sediment with a 5 sodium dodecyl sulfonate solution and obtained cellular proteins after 120 min of ultrasonic oscillation subsequently the absorbance of the sample at a wavelength of 562 nm was measured using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy opron 3000 hanson tech co ltd korea to calculate the protein concentration we extracted 5 g of the sediment from the cathode at three time points before operation 15 days after voltage application and 100 days after operation to serve as samples to initiate 16s rdna microbial high throughput sequencing first the dna of the microorganisms was extracted using a dna kit purelink subsequently the target segment v3 v4 341f 805r was subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification and the amplified product was purified through a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen finally the 300 bp paired end reads were generated using the illumina miseq platform by genomics biosci tech co new taipei city taiwan 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of applied voltages on cu ii electromigration by mfc the average voltage output was 7 23 mv the cu ii concentration dropped slightly re 2 68 at the initial operation phase of the mfc fig 2 after we applied 1 v of voltage to the mfc on the 15th 20th day the concentration of cu ii dropped from 140 mg kg to 85 mg kg re 39 3 a re increase of 14 7 times and the voltage output on the 40th day 67 2 mv on average when the sm mfc was stable was 9 29 times higher than that before voltage was applied this corresponds with the results obtained by gunda et al 23 they treated waste leachate with a single chamber mfc and applied a voltage of 500 mv to increase the electricity generation to a level 1 68 times higher 832 mw m2 than that before voltage was applied the re of the cod also increased to 80 4 baskaran et al 24 applied a voltage of 30 v to the anode chamber to treat cu containing soil with an electrokinetic remediation technology the results indicated that the re of cu increased from 23 95 to 63 95 after voltages were applied confirming that metal ions could be migrated to the cathode by applying voltages the main purpose of this research is to create a potential difference environment between the anode and cathode of sm mfc by applying voltage to facilitate the growth of electricity producing microorganisms the 20th day and the 60th day represent the influence of the applied voltage on the mfc and after the applied voltage respectively and the influence of the potential difference formed by the applied voltage on the biological activity of the sm mfc was compared the voltage applied to the sm mfc did not increase the amount of bacteria during the initial phase of the experiment with the average protein concentration being 563 μg ml fig 3 on the 60th day of the operation the voltage applied to the sm mfc increased the protein concentration to 1344 μg ml which was 1 81 times higher than that before voltages were applied that is the applied voltage greatly increased the amount of bacteria this is consistent with the results obtained by modestra et al 25 they applied a voltage of 100 mv to an mfc and the voltage output increased by 2 41 times confirming that voltage application facilitates electron transfer accordingly the applied voltage increased the amount and activity of the bacteria at the anode this approach represents an effective biostimulation technology that reduces the acclimation period of microorganisms however this experiment only verified that the applied voltage considerably affected the voltage output of the mfc over a short period but could not be used to effectively evaluate the effect of the sm mfc on the re of cu or clarify the mechanism of cu removal and the differences between various mechanisms therefore in section 3 4 we propose the voltage be applied at the early phase of microorganism acclimation and discuss the changes in the voltage output cu ii and microbial community under the long term operation of the sm mfc 3 2 effects of electrode spacing on mfc performance as shown in fig 4 the largest average voltage output 57 7 mv of the sm mfc was observed when the electrode spacing was 10 cm and the average voltage was 2 01 and 1 28 times higher than that when the electrode spacing was 5 and 15 cm respectively the maximum pd 34 9 mw m3 occurred when the electrode spacing was 10 cm and the pd was 2 22 and 1 47 times higher than that when the electrode spacing was 5 and 15 cm respectively table 2 this finding is consistent with the aforementioned voltage output trend however although the sm mfc with an electrode spacing of 5 cm had the lowest internal resistance 189 6 ω it did not have the largest pd this accords with the results of nandy et al 26 the reason for this result is that when the electrode spacing was small the protons produced in the anode chamber could reach the cathode by traveling a shorter distance therefore the internal resistance decreased doherty et al 27 used a constructed wetland mfc to degrade cod and discovered that smaller electrode spacing result in lower voltage output this finding can be attributed to the electrons having been removed before reaching the cathode resulting in a limited voltage output this result is similar to that obtained by our study when the electrode spacing was small the cu ii at the anode directly reacted with electrons and was reduced and precipitated in the anode chamber this hindered cu from migrating to the cathode and thus evidently reduced the voltage output and pd liu et al 28 suggested that when the two electrodes are too far apart the pd drops because of the high internal resistance which is consistent with the result we obtained although the sm mfc with a 15 cm electrode spacing exhibited the highest current density of 347 8 ma m3 its internal resistance was 1 17 2 00 times higher than that with a 5 or 10 cm electrode spacing which caused the pd to drop the reason is that when the electrode spacing is longer the resistance to ion and electron transfer increases resulting in the increase of internal resistance and the decrease of voltage output 3 fig 4 also reveals the changes in cu ii under the various electrode spacings the average cu ii concentration of each sm mfc condition was approximately 172 mg kg under 100 days of long term operation the re of the cu ii of the sm mfc with a 10 cm electrode spacing was the most satisfactory 57 it was 1 24 2 17 times higher than that of the sm mfc with a 5 or 15 cm electrode spacing the reason is that the sm mfc with a 10 cm electrode spacing had the highest voltage output hence the relatively high potential difference between the anode and cathode could effectively drive the electromigration of cu ii to the cathode copper conc image 18 5 cm image 19 10 cm image 20 15 cm voltage image 21 5 cm image 22 10 cm image 23 15 cm copper conc image 24 abiotic cathode image 25 biocathode voltage image 26 abiotic cathode image 27 biocathode 3 3 removal efficiency of cu ii under biocathode and abiotic cathode conditions the average voltage output of the sm mfc with a biocathode was only 40 6 mv during the initial operation phase 15 days fig 5 the initial low voltage was presumably caused by the inhibition of microorganism activity due to the high cu ii concentration 223 mg kg 29 on the 20th 40th day the sm mfc with a biocathode had the highest average voltage output 75 9 mv it was 1 72 times higher than that of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode on the 55th day when substrate was again added to the sm mfc the voltages of both mfcs were slightly higher than that in the previous stage the average voltage output of the sm mfc with a biocathode and an abiotic cathode was 84 7 and 42 9 mv respectively furthermore the sm mfc with a biocathode and an abiotic cathode had a similar voltage output under long term operation comprising two phases this suggests that the voltage output of the sm mfc can be maintained after 100 days of operation hence it has the potential for long term operation the concentration of cu ii of sm mfc with a biocathode dropped to 82 mg kg after 100 days of operation re 64 the re was 1 7 times higher than that of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode fig 5 the reason is that the microorganisms on the stainless steel mesh biocathode can directly and physically make contact with the surface of the cathode for electron transfer because the electrons are directly used the electricity output increases this finding corresponds with that of qiu et al 30 the mfc with a biocathode they developed facilitated electron transfer and effectively reduced the resistance to charge transfer which increased electricity output and metal reduction 3 4 electrochemical analysis according to the nyquist plots the internal resistance rint of the mfc includes solvent resistance rs charge transfer resistance rct and warbug s diffusion element w fig 6a shows that rs and w have little difference under biocathode and abiotic cathode condition but rct exhibits significant difference the sm mfc with a biocathode had the smallest rint 170 4 ω it was 49 2 smaller than the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode fig 6a this indicates that the sm mfc with a biocathode has a higher voltage output fig 6a further shows that the greatest difference between the two mfc centers on rct the rct of the sm mfc with a biocathode and an abiotic cathode was 110 and 283 2 ω respectively the rct of the sm mfc with a biocathode was 38 8 smaller than that of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode the reason is that electricity producing microorganisms exist among the microorganisms attaching on the biocathode the electrons can be effectively transferred from microorganisms to the cathode therefore the sm mfc with a biocathode has a smaller rct but greater voltage output and re of cu ii fig 3b zhang et al 31 modified the cathode of an mfc by using cu containing compounds and successfully improved the performance of the mfc the cu ii of the developed mfc migrated from the anode to the cathode hence the internal resistance dropped considerably the sm mfc with a biocathode had a higher peak current value 3 29 ma it was 1 49 times higher than that of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode fig 6b a larger peak current implies that electrochemically active bacteria influenced the electrodes accelerating electron transfer and generating current 32 however this also means that the cathode had a higher ability in receiving electrons therefore the re of cu ii was higher the higher re of cu ii enabled cu compounds to modify the mfc cathode and increased the performance of the mfc the result is consistent with that in section 3 3 both the biocathode fig 7a and the abiotic cathode fig 7d had a smooth structure before the mfc operation but numerous biofilms grew on the electrode surface after long term operation fig 7b c and e f indicating that microorganisms grew well in the sediment environment the microorganisms on the surface of the biocathode may be reducing bacteria which can strengthen the reduction reaction of smfc zhao et al 33 also used the sem to photograph the surface morphology of the biocathode which provided evidence of the existence of reducing bacteria on the surface of the cathode the sm mfc with a biocathode mainly generated cu2o 2θ 36 5 42 4 and 73 7 jcpds card number 77 0199 and cuo 2θ 36 6 42 5 and 77 8 jcpds card number 78 0428 fig 8 this finding is similar to that obtained by wu et al 34 fig 9 displays the distribution of cu ii in the sm mfc the cu ii content at the anode of the sm mfc with a biocathode and an abiotic cathode was 43 8 and 57 5 respectively under an open circuit condition because the mfc cannot generate current under an open circuit condition cu ii can only move to the cathode through diffusion but not electromigration in addition the cu ii content at the biocathode was 1 25 times higher than that at the abiotic cathode which accords with the result revealed in fig 5 the sm mfc with a biocathode had superior electricity output and thus could migrate heavy metals more effectively this result is consistent with that of wang et al 9 3 5 microbial community analysis as listed in table 3 the coverage of all three cathode conditions before operation 15 days after voltage application and 100 days after the operation reached 1 suggesting that the analytical results on the microorganism community was highly representative 35 the average richness of the three samples in terms of chao1 and species was 549 suggesting a high level of species richness at the cathode the changes in enspie the shannon index and the simpson index revealed that the species diversity and uniformity increased after 100 days of operation the reason is that when the microorganism community is stimulated by voltage or current the rise of the environmental potential increases both richness and uniformity 36 fig 10a reveals the analytical results of the phylum of the microorganisms in the cathode the main dominant bacteria in the three cathode conditions were proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria among which the most dominant phylum emerged after 100 days of operation geetanjali et al 37 indicated that proteobacteria and firmicutes are the most common electrochemically active bacteria in smfcs in this study the proteobacteria floras after 100 days of operation accounted for 32 8 which was 1 06 1 14 times higher than that before the operation and 15 days after voltage application the firmicutes floras exhibited a similar trend fig 10a this finding indicates that after long term operation both the activity and richness of the electrochemically active bacteria increased actinobacteria commonly observed in sediment are anaerobic bacteria that are capable of degrading organic matter 38 with the increase in operation time the number of actinobacteria increased by 2 71 times fig 10a domingues et al 39 discovered that the three strains i e proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria are all tolerant to multiple types of heavy metals which corresponds with the result we obtained fig 10b reveals the analytical results of the genus of the microorganisms in the cathode bacillus which accounted for the highest proportion belongs to the genus thiobacillus they are a type of common electricity producing bacteria discovered in mfcs and are capable of degrading organic matter and generating a considerable amount of electricity 40 according to huo et al 41 pelagibacterium are tolerant to heavy metals in this study we added ch3coona as a microbial substrate on a regular basis and discovered geoalkalibacter in the mfc such bacteria can generate high current output by degrading ch3coona 42 according to erable et al 18 in a single medium mfc the microbial structure of the stainless steel mesh biocathode and the graphite anode was similar only under the action of different electrochemistry some reducing bacteria and degrading bacteria have been generated at the cathode and anode respectively therefore it can be inferred that the microbial structures at the cathode and anode of this study are similar however it can also be found from fig 10 of this study that the bacteria of sm mfc are common found in the natural sediment environment so this sm mfc is suitable for on site sediment treatment 4 conclusion applying voltage to the sm mfc for biostimulation can reduce the acclimation period of microorganisms and increase the number and activity of bacteria the sm mfc with 10 cm electrode spacing showed the highest cu ii removal efficiency and voltage output the sm mfc with a biocathode could effectively transfer electrons therefore its re of cu ii was 1 7 times higher and its peak electricity was 1 49 times higher than those of the sm mfc with an abiotic cathode the main dominant bacteria discovered in the cathode of the sm mfc were proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria which are all common electrochemically active bacteria with the ability to degrade organic matter and tolerate heavy metals the optimization of the single medium configuration and cathode conditions of the sm mfc intensified electricity output facilitated the cu ii removal and increased the activity of the electrochemically active bacteria in the mfc in this study the anode and cathode were buried in the sediment environment and it was confirmed that the sm mfc can operate stably for 100 days without corrosion or damage to the electrode surface this shows the long term operation capability of sm mfc and the feasibility of practical application declaration of competing

13243,direct contact membrane distillation dcmd has shown great promises in remediating high salinity oilfield produced water pw in our previous work a hydrophobic silica sol si r was successfully synthesized to engineer anti wetting ability of poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane here our research interest lies in customizing pvdf hollow fiber membrane hfm with desirable stability for treating challenging oilfield pw via a dcmd process the pvdf si r hybrid hfm was fabricated under an optimized spinning condition it is found that the fabricated pvdf si r hfm is sandwich structured consisting a highly porous and thick middle layer and small size macrovoids of outer layer and inner layer with different pore geometry and the unique sandwich structure endows the membrane with superior wetting resistance the membrane characterization showed that the liquid entry pressure lep and water contact angle wca of the fabricated pvdf si r hfm impressively reached up to 5 25 bar and 126 respectively as a result the pvdf si r hfm possessed a desirable performance in treating high salinity oilfield pw in terms of wetting resistance and salt rejection specifically with a 60 h continuous dcmd operation the pvdf si r membrane exhibited over 99 9 salt rejection with only 7 reduction in permeate water flux clearly the synthesized hydrophobic si r is a favorable additive for enhancing the antiwetting ability of pvdf hfm to treat high salinity oilfield pw via dcmd process keywords polyvinylidene fluoride hydrophobic silica sol direct contact membrane distillation produced water stability 1 introduction in recent years new technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and chemical flooding have been extensively used for extracting oil and gas from unconventional reservoirs 1 3 in a typical hydraulic fracturing process fracturing fluid contains water and various kinds of chemicals were pumped down to a wellbore to fracture the rock in the target formation so as to increase the mobility of oil and gas most of the fracking fluids flow back to the surface and contributed as part of oilfield wastewater the so called flowback water it was estimated that only in 2009 there are around 71 billion barrels of flowback water generated around the world 4 flowback water is usually characterized by high salinity and presence of dissolved organic compounds 5 making it a major pollute source in the petroleum industry the composition of flowback water varies from well to well 6 7 according to a database from the u s geological survey the total dissolved solids tds in flowback water ranged from 1000 mg l to over 400 000 mg l with alkali salts nacl calcl2 etc contributed the most 8 meanwhile the total organic carbon toc of flow back water ranged from almost none to 4900 mg l 8 and the main organic components are hydrocarbons and fatty acids reinjection of flowback water into disposal wells has been an option for flowback water management 9 10 however the infrastructure of a disposal well is expensive 11 and the injection of flowback water into underground may cause seismic activity 12 in consideration of the global freshwater scarcity a much better alternative is to eliminate the inorganic salts and contaminants from the pw so that the waste stream can be reused as a sustainable resource for freshwater recovery membrane based filtration technology has been widely employed as one of the most emerging technologies for oilfield pw treatment in recent years 13 15 pw with relatively low salinity tds 30 000 mg l can be treated by reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo and membrane bioreactor mbr 16 18 however it requires super high hydraulic pressure for the ro process or very high draw solution concentration for the fo process to desalinate the pw with high salinity 4 17 and high salinity and oily feature could largely impede the performance of biological treatment technique which makes these pressure driven process impractical in recent years dcmd has attracted the most attention as a promising alternative method for water treatment 19 dcmd is a thermally driven separation process in which the feed solution was partially evaporated across a hydrophobic membrane and freshwater was collected by condensing the water vapor that penetrated through the pores of the hydrophobic membrane 20 22 the unique advantages of the dcmd include 1 no hydraulic pressure required 2 theoretically 100 salt rejection 3 less vulnerable to concentration polarization and 4 low temperature applicability so that green and renewable energy or even waste heat can be used as heating source 23 24 despite these advantages there is still a certain distance from the pitch to large scale commercial application of the dcmd process for high salinity pw treatment the major challenge includes quick membrane pore wetting low permeate water flux and membrane fouling from both organic and inorganic contaminants 20 25 in the decades different attempts have been performed to design and fabricate membranes for dcmd 26 29 the improvement of the membrane hydrophobicity is a routine strategy to enhance membrane antifouling ability and slow down membrane wetting in a dcmd process prince et al prepared hydrophobic macromolecules modified pvdf membrane for dcmd 30 the obtained membrane exhibited a higher contact angle and liquid entry pressure lep than the neat pvdf membrane however the incorporation of the surface modifying macromolecules reduced the mean pore size which results in a significant decrease in the permeate water flux lu et al prepared a hfm with outstanding anti wetting performance by coating perfluorinated polymer onto the outer surface of the pvdf hfm 23 the outer surface hydrophobicity of perfluorinated polymer coated pvdf membrane was found to be significantly augmented that the contact angle increased by 35 as compared to the substrate and the wetting resistance of the membrane was enhanced accordingly the tailoring of membrane structure including surface roughness and pore characteristic has been also considered as an alternative way to improve membrane performance 31 33 zhang et al synthesized a pvdf with superhydrophobic characteristic membrane by coating a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane pdms and hydrophobic silicon dioxide nanoparticles onto the substrate 32 the coated membrane was found with smaller pores on its outer surface as well as higher anti fouling ability compared to the neat pvdf membrane substrate in 40 h of continuous dcmd operation wang et al fabricated pvdf hfm with ethylene glycol eg as additive 33 the resulted membrane showed smaller pore size on its inner surface while larger pore size on its outer surface in contrast to the neat membrane prepared without eg the permeate water flux reached up to almost 5 times of the neat membrane when the feed solution temperature was 80 c however since the membrane hydrophobicity is mainly originated from the intrinsic property of the pvdf matrix there is still effort required to further improve the dcmd performance of the pvdf hfms in general large pores facilitate mass transfer but also accelerated membrane wetting while small pores could help restrict membrane fouling but may reduce the roughness and hydrophobicity of the membrane surface 33 35 from this point of view for the challenging impaired water such as oily and high salinity pw treatment via the dcmd process the membrane with desired wetting resistant that should be customized as relatively small pore size elevated porosity and high hydrophobicity on the membrane surface in our previous works we exploited a two step method to synthesize hydrophobic si r sol for improving the fouling and wetting resistance of membrane 22 36 37 pvdf si r hybrid hfm was fabricated by a in situ sol gel spinning technique it is worth quoting that the developed technique has a unique merit over other reported methods as the synthesis of hydrophobic si r was under n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp condition the si r sol could be directly incorporated into pvdf nmp system without solvent removal process we have spun different pvdf si r hybrid hfm contactors under well designed parameters for carbon dioxide capture and water treatment and desirable results have been disclosed in our published literatures in this work we further elucidate the fundamental science of the incorporation of si r on pvdf hfm formation and customized the membrane with desirable characteristics for treating super high salinity pw by dcmd process the research work aims to 1 elucidate the correlation between membrane formation matrix morphology and pore characteristics with incorporating of si r into pvdf nmp solution and 2 to evaluate dcmd performance of the customized pvdf si r hybrid hfm 2 experiment 2 1 materials the commercial resin pvdf was kindly provided by arkema inc type kynar 761 n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp ar tetraethyl orthosilicate teos ar chlorotrimethylsilane cmts ar and hydrochloric acid hcl 36 5 38 were ordered from sigma aldrich for spinning of the pvdf si r hfms methanol moh 99 8 and hexane for hfm post treatment and isopropanol ipa and kerosene for membrane characterization were obtained from sigma aldrich salts including nacl mgcl2 cacl2 and na2so4 in analytical grade and hydrocarbons including benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene were also received from sigma aldrich to mimic pw 2 2 membrane fabrication 2 2 1 synthesis of hydrophobic si r sol hydrophobic si r sol was synthesized according to the procedure detailed in our previous work 36 a two step process was performed to synthesize the si r under acid catalyzed hcl and aprotic solvent nmp condition briefly the teos was diluted into a certain amount of nmp and it was fully hydrolyzed with a partial amount of water under hcl as the catalyst afterward the resultant hydroxyl groups on silica sol were reacted with an excessive amount of cmts finally the residual h2o hcl and ctms were evaporated under high temperature to obtain the hydrophobic si r nmp sol 2 2 2 dope solution formulation the pvdf powder was then directly dissolved into the hydrophobic si r nmp sol with continuous mechanical stirring at room temperature until a transparent and brown pvdf si r nmp dope solution was obtained the dope solution was degassed overnight before phase inversion study and hfm spinning 2 2 3 membrane formation study to reveal the influence of si r incorporation on membrane formation a titration method based on cloud point measurements was performed to determine the liquid liquid boundary briefly a minuscule amount of water was slowly and intermittently dropped into the solution with constantly agitating the solution in case when the solution become permanently turbid and could not return back to homogenous state the cloud point was considered to be reached the binodal cure was plotted based on the set of composition points at different polymer concentration 2 2 4 hfm spinning pvdf si r hfm was spun via a dry jet wet spinning technique the pvdf si r solution was filtered by a metal filter 60 μm before pumping through a stainless spinneret as well as bore fluid the discharged solution and bore fluid experienced an air gap distance region before falling into coagulant bath the spinning parameters for hfm are tabulated in table 1 the details of the membrane spinning and post treatment process hfm can be found in our previous study 36 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 membrane morphology morphology of the pvdf si r hfm was analysized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem quanta 200f fei for the observation of cross section and inner surface the hfm was frozen in liquid nitrogen for 10 min and then fractured all of the samples were deposited with a thin carbon layer for electrical conduction prior to observation 2 3 2 water contact angle measurement contact angle measurement was performed by dropping 2 μl water droplets onto the outer surfaces of the pvdf si r hfm which lumen side was glued to a glass slide the contact angle magnitude was averaged from five observation and analysis fromsca20 software 2 3 3 overall porosity pore size lep and effective porosity the hfm overall porosity is obtained by the kerosene immersion method 38 briefly the length and cross sectional area were first measured and calculated to determine the total volume of the membrane the dry sample fiber was then weighted before it was immersed in kerosene for 5 days to make sure the membrane was completely wetted afterward the mass of the wetted hfm was weighted and the pore volume of the fiber was calculated the membrane overall porosity was determined by the ratio of the pore volume to the total volume of the membrane gas permeation test is considered as an effective technique to evaluate mean pore size and effective porosity it is easy to perform because only the gas flow rate across the membrane matrix was measured at different trans membrane pressure the estimation of the mean pore size and effective porosity are detailed elsewhere 39 the liquid entry pressure lep is considered as an important metric for anti wetting ability evaluation the combined effect of surface hydrophobicity and maximum pore size determine the final magnitude it was evaluated using a lab made set up as described in ref 39 2 4 dcmd experiment 2 4 1 experimental setup the epoxy potting technique was carried out to seal the ends of pvdf si r module prior to the dcmd experiments the pvdf si r fibers with effective length at 22 cm were assembled to a stainless tube and then sealed using epoxy resin hfm dcmd experiments were performed using the apparatus illustrated schematically in fig 1 pw with elevated temperature circulated in the lumen side of the hfms permeate water was maintained at a constant low temperature and before circulated into the shell side of the membranes the temperatures of both hot feed solution and cold permeate water at the inlets t1 and t3 and outlets t2 and t4 were in situ monitored with temperature transducers during the dcmd process the flow rates of the feed and permeate streams were controlled by two peristaltic pumps the weights of the recovered water at the permeate side was recorded with a balance to evaluate the permeate water flux the tds and electrical conductivity ec at the permeate side were examined by a multi meter hach hq40d for salt rejection calculation the specific ion concentration was measured with dionex ion chromatography ics1100 thermo dionex 2 4 2 water flux calculation the water permeate flux was evaluated by eq 1 listed below 1 f m a t where f is the water flux kg m2h m is the mass of recovered water kg a is the membrane effective area m2 and t is the time h 2 4 3 thermal efficiency analysis during the dcmd process the heat transfer is a complex process which mainly includes the effective consumption of energy for vaporization of water qn as shown in eq 2 and the undesirable heat loss of conductive heat transfer across the membrane material qc as shown in eq 3 the thermal efficiency in this study can be defined as the fraction of qn to the total heat transported across the membrane qn qc as shown in eq 4 21 2 q n f hv 3 q c γ m δ m t f m t p m 4 ee f hv f hv γ m δ m t f m t p m 100 where f is water flux kg m2h δhv is the latent heat of water vaporization γm is the heat conductivity of the membrane δm is membrane thickness tf m and tp m are the temperature at membrane surface on the feed and permeate sides respectively 2 4 4 evaluation of membrane long term stability in order to evaluate long term stability namely fouling and wetting resistance of the pvdf si r hfm during the dcmd process of hypersaline pw pw simulated one was prepared with the similar composition of pw obtained from an oilfield in permian basin the constituents in the synthesized pw were in table 2 the tds of the synthesized pw is 89 637 ppm a 60 h continuous dcmd process was carried out with the synthesized pw the inlet temperatures of cold permeate and feed solution were set as 20 c and 40 c respectively and the linear velocities of the hot and cold streams were set as 2 73 m s and 0 09 m s respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the cross sectional and surfaces fesem image of the pvdf si r hfm are presented in fig 2 as it can be seen in fig 2 a that the inner and outer diameters of the hfm are around 545 μm and 364 μm respectively and the membrane thickness is around 90 μm in fig 2 b the pvdf si r hfm possesses a typical asymmetric structure with a thick porous middle layer sandwiched between a dense outer surface and a porous inner surface the thin and dense surface contributes to a rapid phase inversion during the spinning process the finger like and sponge like micropores in the middle layer was formed through a slow exchange between the solvent and non solvent during the membrane fabrication process fig 2 c and d show the fesem images of both the outer surface and the inner surface of the hfm it is obvious that large amounts of isolated pores are clearly present on the outer surface in contrast the pores are interconnected at the inner surface the smaller pore size on the inner surface was probably due to the molecular orientation caused by the large air gap 10 cm and stretching rate during the membrane spinning process besides it is also observed that the inner surface layer possessed a more porous structure than the outer surface this phenomenon was probably due to the slower phase inversion on the inner surface than that on the outer surface 40 42 as indicated in fig 3 that the isothermal cloud point curve shifts toward the polymer solvent axis with the embedding of superhydrophobic si r nanoparticles which means less water is required to disturb the dope system equilibrium and induce the polymer precipitation it is obvious in fig 2 d that most silica particles deposit on the inner surface of the hfm but not the outer surface of the membrane which helps further slowdown the phase inversion at the lumen side and inversely facilitates the deposition of more silica nanoparticles on the inner surface rather than getting embedded within the polymer matrix the characteristics of the pvdf si r hfm were tabulated in table 3 including surface water contact angle wca overall porosity effective porosity mean pore size and lep the wca was 126 and it was much bigger than the neat hfm spun from pvdf kynar 761 nmp dope solution 36 the enhanced contact angle might originate from the surface free energy reduction or roughness improvement due to the hybridization of silica nanoparticles into the membrane matrix 38 the hfm possessed porosity of 48 3 mean pore size 47 2 nm and effective porosity of 107 8 m 1 respectively generally dcmd hfm owning smaller porosity mean pore size and effective porosity indicated higher mass transfer resistance and disadvantage of thermal conductivity however fouling and wetting issues make it rather subtle to treat the oilfield pw therefore dcmd membrane for pw treatment prefer to have smaller pore size in order to mitigate the fouling it shows in table 3 that the lep magnitude of the membrane reaches up to 5 25 bar this superior lep is much higher than most of hydrophobic hfm reported in md process indicating excellent anti wetting phenomenon in dcmd the high lep is not only because the small pore size but also could ascribe to its thick sponge like structure in the middle region the resultant sandwich structure can effectively augment the hfm tortuosity and largely enhances the wetting resistance 3 2 effects of operating parameters on membrane performances fig 4 shows the permeate flux of the pvdf si r hfm based dcmd process as a function of stream salinity at different feed temperatures the flow velocities of the feed and permeate solution was 2 37 m s and 0 09 m s respectively in all the experiments the pvdf si r hfm showed salt rejection above 99 7 as illustrated in fig 3 that the permeate flux of the pvdf si r membrane gradually increased with the increase of feed temperature at all feed concentrations which contributes the fact that the vapor pressure on the feed side increased with the increase of the temperature difference across the membrane 12 in fig 4 the permeate flux declined with the increase in feed concentration at different feed temperatures due to the declined partial vapor pressure of water at the feed side and thus reduced the driving force across the membrane in the dcmd process similar results have been reported by guendouzi et al and it could be interpreted as the partial vapor pressure was reduced from the decreased water activity by the hydration of ion and ionic association in the salt solution 43 compared to the permeate water flux at 50 c and 60 c the slope of the curve became steeper when the temperature raised to 70 c the water flux reduction increased from 2 76 and 3 98 to 6 10 kg m2h with the feed temperature raised from 50 c and 60 c to 70 c respectively this result is consistent with the previous results that polarization affects more severe at elevated operating temperature and the membrane losses more driving force due to an increased temperature polarization at higher feed temperature 44 thermal efficiency is a critical parameter that contributes to the operational cost of a dcmd process compared to commercially available reverse osmosis ro processes energy consumption is a major challenge in the membrane distillation process the effect of feed concentration and temperature on the thermal efficiency of the pvdf si r membrane in dcmd was plotted in fig 5 it is obvious that the thermal efficiency increased with the feed temperature but decreased with the feed concentration when the feed concentration is 10 000 ppm the thermal efficiency is 19 36 20 14 and 28 73 for the feed temperature of 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively this is because the vapor partial pressure which is the driving force for water vaporization would increase exponentially with the increase of feed temperature while the energy dissipation only rises linearly namely more increased energy would be consumed for water evaporation not energy loss as a result the dcmd process operating under elevated temperature would have high thermal efficiency in addition the relatively high thickness of the sponge like layer as shown in fig 2 b might reduce the energy lost via transmembrane conduction and result in high thermal efficiency 21 the effect of feed velocity on the dcmd performance of the pvdf si r hfm was studied in terms of permeate water flux and thermal efficiency as shown in fig 6 a and b when the feed velocity and cold permeate water temperature were fixed the water flux increased sharply with the increase of feed temperature especially under the feed velocity of 1 5 m s besides for a fixed temperature differential along the membrane the water flux increased more obviously at a high feed velocity this phenomenon is mainly attributed to two aspects the linear increase of feed temperature led to an exponential increase of the vapor pressure of the feed solution and the high feed velocity speeded up the heat transfer process in the feed side which reduced both the temperature and concentration polarization effects consequently the permeate water flux increased more obviously at the higher feed velocity as the permeate water temperature augmented from 9 c to 22 c it can be seen in fig 6 b that the water flux slightly declined however the thermal efficiency was located at an almost same window ranged from 8 to 30 as shown in fig 6 c and d referring back to fig 4 and fig 5 the increase of feed temperature seems more effective in increasing the dcmd performance as compared to the decrease in the cold permeate water temperature 3 3 long term performance of the membrane to evaluate the long term performance of the dcmd process a 60 h of continuous membrane distillation experiment was carried out a simulated pw was employed as feed solution for the experiment the feed velocity was 2 73 m s and the cold permeate velocity was 0 09 m s the variation of water flux and ec of the permeate side were plotted in fig 7 the maximum permeate water flux was obtained at the beginning of the dcmd process followed by a slight flux decline from 5 05 kg m2h to 4 69 kg m2h after 35 h and then remained stable until the end of the experiment the decrease in the water flux should be more likely attributed to membrane fouling on the pw faced surface of the pvdf si r membrane which might be caused by the gradually accumulated salt deposit namely inorganic salt scaling and absorption of organic foulants it seems that the membrane fouling stops further deteriorating after 35 h of dcmd operation which was probably because the fouling layer thickness formed but did not build up accordingly the ec of the cold permeate water slightly increased in the first 35 h and then became stable in the following 25 h it is also found that the slight decline of water flux and increase of ec magnitude are almost synchronous indicating the slight membrane fouling may quickly trigger partial membrane pore wetting during the 55 h 60 h period of the test the harvested clean water was 86 85 g at the permeate side and the increment of salt concentration was only 4 45 ppm the salt rejection of the dcmd process was maintained at above 99 9 after the continuous 60 h dcmd operation these experimental results revealed that the membrane fouling and wetting were not serious yet to impair the separation ability of the pvdf si r membrane via a 60 h of dcmd process and the surface fouling has not been further deteriorated into membrane matrix during the dcmd process the high salinity feed solution would get supersaturated and then crystallize at the membrane surface due to water vapor transfer and temperature polarization at evaporation interface 22 44 previous investigations indicated that the salt crystallization or precipitation was peculiarly prone to completely cover the membrane surfaces and has been found to significantly reduce water flux and result in rapid deterioration of water quality 12 13 surprisingly although such a high salinity analog pw was used as a feed solution for dcmd operation neither a sharp decline in water or an ec rise has been found in this study the fesem technique was performed to the membrane surface and cross section edge of pvdf si r hfm after the 60 h of dcmd process for analyzing the fouling condition the obtained membrane morphology fig 8 a exhibited that the outer surface of the used membrane remained as clean as the fresh membrane shown in fig 2 c while numerous small stick like contaminates were found on the inner surface of the membrane fig 8 b these stick like contaminates seems to be relatively isolated and evenly distributed on the membrane surface and the clearly interconnected pore structure of the inner surface fig 2 d cannot be distinguished from such an image resolution any more these stick like contaminates as a result of the fouling may attribute to the combined effect of the deposition of dissolved salts and absorption of hydrocarbons to the membrane surface during the dcmd process fig 8 c and d exhibits the cross sectional morphology of the outer and inner membrane edges it is clear for all the pores along both the inner surface and the outer surface just as analyzed earlier it seems that the stick like contaminant was only attached on the lumen surface the foulants could not form large area deposit layer or penetrate into the membrane matrix because there was no liquid carrier to bring them there and no salt crystal were formed underneath of the inner surface in addition although identified with membrane fouling salt crystal and lumpish salt clusters that frequently reported in other references were not observed on the lumen surface of the pvdf si r hfm contributing to the small pore size on the membrane inner surface 12 45 46 which indicate a better antifouling ability of the pvdf si r membrane than the previously reported membranes 43 44 4 conclusions pvdf si r hfm was prepared using a dry jet wet spinning technique for treatment of hypersaline pw via a dcmd process the pvdf si r hfm consisted of a thick porous middle layer sandwiched between two very thin dense surfaces at outside and inside the membrane properties characterization results showed that the pores size of the inner surface was much smaller than that of the outer surface the permeate flux of the pvdf si hfm based dcmd process increased with the increase of transmembrane temperature difference and the feed velocity while declined with the rising of feed salinity the dcmd performance including water flux and thermal efficiency can be both improved through the increase of feed temperature than the cooling of the stream at the permeate side the dcmd process showed favorable water flux in the treatment of flowback water with the total dissolved solids as high as 250 000 ppm during the dcmd process almost all the foulants were found on the inner surface but could not penetrated to the middle layer and outer surface of the hfm which is helpful to guarantee the antifouling ability of the hfms by restraining the crystallization of salts on its inner surface without greatly sacrificing the mass transfer of the membrane as the pvdf si r hybrid hfm seems promising for practical application in treating oilfield pw it is believed that this work opens a new light on the engineering of pvdf hfm fabricated specifically for treating high salinity via dcmd process

partially evaporated across a hydrophobic membrane and freshwater was collected by condensing the water vapor that penetrated through the pores of the hydrophobic membrane 20 22 the unique advantages of the dcmd include 1 no hydraulic pressure required 2 theoretically 100 salt rejection 3 less vulnerable to concentration polarization and 4 low temperature applicability so that green and renewable energy or even waste heat can be used as heating source 23 24 despite these advantages there is still a certain distance from the pitch to large scale commercial application of the dcmd process for high salinity pw treatment the major challenge includes quick membrane pore wetting low permeate water flux and membrane fouling from both organic and inorganic contaminants 20 25 in the decades different attempts have been performed to design and fabricate membranes for dcmd 26 29 the improvement of the membrane hydrophobicity is a routine strategy to enhance membrane antifouling ability and slow down membrane wetting in a dcmd process prince et al prepared hydrophobic macromolecules modified pvdf membrane for dcmd 30 the obtained membrane exhibited a higher contact angle and liquid entry pressure lep than the neat pvdf membrane however the incorporation of the surface modifying macromolecules reduced the mean pore size which results in a significant decrease in the permeate water flux lu et al prepared a hfm with outstanding anti wetting performance by coating perfluorinated polymer onto the outer surface of the pvdf hfm 23 the outer surface hydrophobicity of perfluorinated polymer coated pvdf membrane was found to be significantly augmented that the contact angle increased by 35 as compared to the substrate and the wetting resistance of the membrane was enhanced accordingly the tailoring of membrane structure including surface roughness and pore characteristic has been also considered as an alternative way to improve membrane performance 31 33 zhang et al synthesized a pvdf with superhydrophobic characteristic membrane by coating a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane pdms and hydrophobic silicon dioxide nanoparticles onto the substrate 32 the coated membrane was found with smaller pores on its outer surface as well as higher anti fouling ability compared to the neat pvdf membrane substrate in 40 h of continuous dcmd operation wang et al fabricated pvdf hfm with ethylene glycol eg as additive 33 the resulted membrane showed smaller pore size on its inner surface while larger pore size on its outer surface in contrast to the neat membrane prepared without eg the permeate water flux reached up to almost 5 times of the neat membrane when the feed solution temperature was 80 c however since the membrane hydrophobicity is mainly originated from the intrinsic property of the pvdf matrix there is still effort required to further improve the dcmd performance of the pvdf hfms in general large pores facilitate mass transfer but also accelerated membrane wetting while small pores could help restrict membrane fouling but may reduce the roughness and hydrophobicity of the membrane surface 33 35 from this point of view for the challenging impaired water such as oily and high salinity pw treatment via the dcmd process the membrane with desired wetting resistant that should be customized as relatively small pore size elevated porosity and high hydrophobicity on the membrane surface in our previous works we exploited a two step method to synthesize hydrophobic si r sol for improving the fouling and wetting resistance of membrane 22 36 37 pvdf si r hybrid hfm was fabricated by a in situ sol gel spinning technique it is worth quoting that the developed technique has a unique merit over other reported methods as the synthesis of hydrophobic si r was under n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp condition the si r sol could be directly incorporated into pvdf nmp system without solvent removal process we have spun different pvdf si r hybrid hfm contactors under well designed parameters for carbon dioxide capture and water treatment and desirable results have been disclosed in our published literatures in this work we further elucidate the fundamental science of the incorporation of si r on pvdf hfm formation and customized the membrane with desirable characteristics for treating super high salinity pw by dcmd process the research work aims to 1 elucidate the correlation between membrane formation matrix morphology and pore characteristics with incorporating of si r into pvdf nmp solution and 2 to evaluate dcmd performance of the customized pvdf si r hybrid hfm 2 experiment 2 1 materials the commercial resin pvdf was kindly provided by arkema inc type kynar 761 n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp ar tetraethyl orthosilicate teos ar chlorotrimethylsilane cmts ar and hydrochloric acid hcl 36 5 38 were ordered from sigma aldrich for spinning of the pvdf si r hfms methanol moh 99 8 and hexane for hfm post treatment and isopropanol ipa and kerosene for membrane characterization were obtained from sigma aldrich salts including nacl mgcl2 cacl2 and na2so4 in analytical grade and hydrocarbons including benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene were also received from sigma aldrich to mimic pw 2 2 membrane fabrication 2 2 1 synthesis of hydrophobic si r sol hydrophobic si r sol was synthesized according to the procedure detailed in our previous work 36 a two step process was performed to synthesize the si r under acid catalyzed hcl and aprotic solvent nmp condition briefly the teos was diluted into a certain amount of nmp and it was fully hydrolyzed with a partial amount of water under hcl as the catalyst afterward the resultant hydroxyl groups on silica sol were reacted with an excessive amount of cmts finally the residual h2o hcl and ctms were evaporated under high temperature to obtain the hydrophobic si r nmp sol 2 2 2 dope solution formulation the pvdf powder was then directly dissolved into the hydrophobic si r nmp sol with continuous mechanical stirring at room temperature until a transparent and brown pvdf si r nmp dope solution was obtained the dope solution was degassed overnight before phase inversion study and hfm spinning 2 2 3 membrane formation study to reveal the influence of si r incorporation on membrane formation a titration method based on cloud point measurements was performed to determine the liquid liquid boundary briefly a minuscule amount of water was slowly and intermittently dropped into the solution with constantly agitating the solution in case when the solution become permanently turbid and could not return back to homogenous state the cloud point was considered to be reached the binodal cure was plotted based on the set of composition points at different polymer concentration 2 2 4 hfm spinning pvdf si r hfm was spun via a dry jet wet spinning technique the pvdf si r solution was filtered by a metal filter 60 μm before pumping through a stainless spinneret as well as bore fluid the discharged solution and bore fluid experienced an air gap distance region before falling into coagulant bath the spinning parameters for hfm are tabulated in table 1 the details of the membrane spinning and post treatment process hfm can be found in our previous study 36 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 membrane morphology morphology of the pvdf si r hfm was analysized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem quanta 200f fei for the observation of cross section and inner surface the hfm was frozen in liquid nitrogen for 10 min and then fractured all of the samples were deposited with a thin carbon layer for electrical conduction prior to observation 2 3 2 water contact angle measurement contact angle measurement was performed by dropping 2 μl water droplets onto the outer surfaces of the pvdf si r hfm which lumen side was glued to a glass slide the contact angle magnitude was averaged from five observation and analysis fromsca20 software 2 3 3 overall porosity pore size lep and effective porosity the hfm overall porosity is obtained by the kerosene immersion method 38 briefly the length and cross sectional area were first measured and calculated to determine the total volume of the membrane the dry sample fiber was then weighted before it was immersed in kerosene for 5 days to make sure the membrane was completely wetted afterward the mass of the wetted hfm was weighted and the pore volume of the fiber was calculated the membrane overall porosity was determined by the ratio of the pore volume to the total volume of the membrane gas permeation test is considered as an effective technique to evaluate mean pore size and effective porosity it is easy to perform because only the gas flow rate across the membrane matrix was measured at different trans membrane pressure the estimation of the mean pore size and effective porosity are detailed elsewhere 39 the liquid entry pressure lep is considered as an important metric for anti wetting ability evaluation the combined effect of surface hydrophobicity and maximum pore size determine the final magnitude it was evaluated using a lab made set up as described in ref 39 2 4 dcmd experiment 2 4 1 experimental setup the epoxy potting technique was carried out to seal the ends of pvdf si r module prior to the dcmd experiments the pvdf si r fibers with effective length at 22 cm were assembled to a stainless tube and then sealed using epoxy resin hfm dcmd experiments were performed using the apparatus illustrated schematically in fig 1 pw with elevated temperature circulated in the lumen side of the hfms permeate water was maintained at a constant low temperature and before circulated into the shell side of the membranes the temperatures of both hot feed solution and cold permeate water at the inlets t1 and t3 and outlets t2 and t4 were in situ monitored with temperature transducers during the dcmd process the flow rates of the feed and permeate streams were controlled by two peristaltic pumps the weights of the recovered water at the permeate side was recorded with a balance to evaluate the permeate water flux the tds and electrical conductivity ec at the permeate side were examined by a multi meter hach hq40d for salt rejection calculation the specific ion concentration was measured with dionex ion chromatography ics1100 thermo dionex 2 4 2 water flux calculation the water permeate flux was evaluated by eq 1 listed below 1 f m a t where f is the water flux kg m2h m is the mass of recovered water kg a is the membrane effective area m2 and t is the time h 2 4 3 thermal efficiency analysis during the dcmd process the heat transfer is a complex process which mainly includes the effective consumption of energy for vaporization of water qn as shown in eq 2 and the undesirable heat loss of conductive heat transfer across the membrane material qc as shown in eq 3 the thermal efficiency in this study can be defined as the fraction of qn to the total heat transported across the membrane qn qc as shown in eq 4 21 2 q n f hv 3 q c γ m δ m t f m t p m 4 ee f hv f hv γ m δ m t f m t p m 100 where f is water flux kg m2h δhv is the latent heat of water vaporization γm is the heat conductivity of the membrane δm is membrane thickness tf m and tp m are the temperature at membrane surface on the feed and permeate sides respectively 2 4 4 evaluation of membrane long term stability in order to evaluate long term stability namely fouling and wetting resistance of the pvdf si r hfm during the dcmd process of hypersaline pw pw simulated one was prepared with the similar composition of pw obtained from an oilfield in permian basin the constituents in the synthesized pw were in table 2 the tds of the synthesized pw is 89 637 ppm a 60 h continuous dcmd process was carried out with the synthesized pw the inlet temperatures of cold permeate and feed solution were set as 20 c and 40 c respectively and the linear velocities of the hot and cold streams were set as 2 73 m s and 0 09 m s respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the cross sectional and surfaces fesem image of the pvdf si r hfm are presented in fig 2 as it can be seen in fig 2 a that the inner and outer diameters of the hfm are around 545 μm and 364 μm respectively and the membrane thickness is around 90 μm in fig 2 b the pvdf si r hfm possesses a typical asymmetric structure with a thick porous middle layer sandwiched between a dense outer surface and a porous inner surface the thin and dense surface contributes to a rapid phase inversion during the spinning process the finger like and sponge like micropores in the middle layer was formed through a slow exchange between the solvent and non solvent during the membrane fabrication process fig 2 c and d show the fesem images of both the outer surface and the inner surface of the hfm it is obvious that large amounts of isolated pores are clearly present on the outer surface in contrast the pores are interconnected at the inner surface the smaller pore size on the inner surface was probably due to the molecular orientation caused by the large air gap 10 cm and stretching rate during the membrane spinning process besides it is also observed that the inner surface layer possessed a more porous structure than the outer surface this phenomenon was probably due to the slower phase inversion on the inner surface than that on the outer surface 40 42 as indicated in fig 3 that the isothermal cloud point curve shifts toward the polymer solvent axis with the embedding of superhydrophobic si r nanoparticles which means less water is required to disturb the dope system equilibrium and induce the polymer precipitation it is obvious in fig 2 d that most silica particles deposit on the inner surface of the hfm but not the outer surface of the membrane which helps further slowdown the phase inversion at the lumen side and inversely facilitates the deposition of more silica nanoparticles on the inner surface rather than getting embedded within the polymer matrix the characteristics of the pvdf si r hfm were tabulated in table 3 including surface water contact angle wca overall porosity effective porosity mean pore size and lep the wca was 126 and it was much bigger than the neat hfm spun from pvdf kynar 761 nmp dope solution 36 the enhanced contact angle might originate from the surface free energy reduction or roughness improvement due to the hybridization of silica nanoparticles into the membrane matrix 38 the hfm possessed porosity of 48 3 mean pore size 47 2 nm and effective porosity of 107 8 m 1 respectively generally dcmd hfm owning smaller porosity mean pore size and effective porosity indicated higher mass transfer resistance and disadvantage of thermal conductivity however fouling and wetting issues make it rather subtle to treat the oilfield pw therefore dcmd membrane for pw treatment prefer to have smaller pore size in order to mitigate the fouling it shows in table 3 that the lep magnitude of the membrane reaches up to 5 25 bar this superior lep is much higher than most of hydrophobic hfm reported in md process indicating excellent anti wetting phenomenon in dcmd the high lep is not only because the small pore size but also could ascribe to its thick sponge like structure in the middle region the resultant sandwich structure can effectively augment the hfm tortuosity and largely enhances the wetting resistance 3 2 effects of operating parameters on membrane performances fig 4 shows the permeate flux of the pvdf si r hfm based dcmd process as a function of stream salinity at different feed temperatures the flow velocities of the feed and permeate solution was 2 37 m s and 0 09 m s respectively in all the experiments the pvdf si r hfm showed salt rejection above 99 7 as illustrated in fig 3 that the permeate flux of the pvdf si r membrane gradually increased with the increase of feed temperature at all feed concentrations which contributes the fact that the vapor pressure on the feed side increased with the increase of the temperature difference across the membrane 12 in fig 4 the permeate flux declined with the increase in feed concentration at different feed temperatures due to the declined partial vapor pressure of water at the feed side and thus reduced the driving force across the membrane in the dcmd process similar results have been reported by guendouzi et al and it could be interpreted as the partial vapor pressure was reduced from the decreased water activity by the hydration of ion and ionic association in the salt solution 43 compared to the permeate water flux at 50 c and 60 c the slope of the curve became steeper when the temperature raised to 70 c the water flux reduction increased from 2 76 and 3 98 to 6 10 kg m2h with the feed temperature raised from 50 c and 60 c to 70 c respectively this result is consistent with the previous results that polarization affects more severe at elevated operating temperature and the membrane losses more driving force due to an increased temperature polarization at higher feed temperature 44 thermal efficiency is a critical parameter that contributes to the operational cost of a dcmd process compared to commercially available reverse osmosis ro processes energy consumption is a major challenge in the membrane distillation process the effect of feed concentration and temperature on the thermal efficiency of the pvdf si r membrane in dcmd was plotted in fig 5 it is obvious that the thermal efficiency increased with the feed temperature but decreased with the feed concentration when the feed concentration is 10 000 ppm the thermal efficiency is 19 36 20 14 and 28 73 for the feed temperature of 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively this is because the vapor partial pressure which is the driving force for water vaporization would increase exponentially with the increase of feed temperature while the energy dissipation only rises linearly namely more increased energy would be consumed for water evaporation not energy loss as a result the dcmd process operating under elevated temperature would have high thermal efficiency in addition the relatively high thickness of the sponge like layer as shown in fig 2 b might reduce the energy lost via transmembrane conduction and result in high thermal efficiency 21 the effect of feed velocity on the dcmd performance of the pvdf si r hfm was studied in terms of permeate water flux and thermal efficiency as shown in fig 6 a and b when the feed velocity and cold permeate water temperature were fixed the water flux increased sharply with the increase of feed temperature especially under the feed velocity of 1 5 m s besides for a fixed temperature differential along the membrane the water flux increased more obviously at a high feed velocity this phenomenon is mainly attributed to two aspects the linear increase of feed temperature led to an exponential increase of the vapor pressure of the feed solution and the high feed velocity speeded up the heat transfer process in the feed side which reduced both the temperature and concentration polarization effects consequently the permeate water flux increased more obviously at the higher feed velocity as the permeate water temperature augmented from 9 c to 22 c it can be seen in fig 6 b that the water flux slightly declined however the thermal efficiency was located at an almost same window ranged from 8 to 30 as shown in fig 6 c and d referring back to fig 4 and fig 5 the increase of feed temperature seems more effective in increasing the dcmd performance as compared to the decrease in the cold permeate water temperature 3 3 long term performance of the membrane to evaluate the long term performance of the dcmd process a 60 h of continuous membrane distillation experiment was carried out a simulated pw was employed as feed solution for the experiment the feed velocity was 2 73 m s and the cold permeate velocity was 0 09 m s the variation of water flux and ec of the permeate side were plotted in fig 7 the maximum permeate water flux was obtained at the beginning of the dcmd process followed by a slight flux decline from 5 05 kg m2h to 4 69 kg m2h after 35 h and then remained stable until the end of the experiment the decrease in the water flux should be more likely attributed to membrane fouling on the pw faced surface of the pvdf si r membrane which might be caused by the gradually accumulated salt deposit namely inorganic salt scaling and absorption of organic foulants it seems that the membrane fouling stops further deteriorating after 35 h of dcmd operation which was probably because the fouling layer thickness formed but did not build up accordingly the ec of the cold permeate water slightly increased in the first 35 h and then became stable in the following 25 h it is also found that the slight decline of water flux and increase of ec magnitude are almost synchronous indicating the slight membrane fouling may quickly trigger partial membrane pore wetting during the 55 h 60 h period of the test the harvested clean water was 86 85 g at the permeate side and the increment of salt concentration was only 4 45 ppm the salt rejection of the dcmd process was maintained at above 99 9 after the continuous 60 h dcmd operation these experimental results revealed that the membrane fouling and wetting were not serious yet to impair the separation ability of the pvdf si r membrane via a 60 h of dcmd process and the surface fouling has not been further deteriorated into membrane matrix during the dcmd process the high salinity feed solution would get supersaturated and then crystallize at the membrane surface due to water vapor transfer and temperature polarization at evaporation interface 22 44 previous investigations indicated that the salt crystallization or precipitation was peculiarly prone to completely cover the membrane surfaces and has been found to significantly reduce water flux and result in rapid deterioration of water quality 12 13 surprisingly although such a high salinity analog pw was used as a feed solution for dcmd operation neither a sharp decline in water or an ec rise has been found in this study the fesem technique was performed to the membrane surface and cross section edge of pvdf si r hfm after the 60 h of dcmd process for analyzing the fouling condition the obtained membrane morphology fig 8 a exhibited that the outer surface of the used membrane remained as clean as the fresh membrane shown in fig 2 c while numerous small stick like contaminates were found on the inner surface of the membrane fig 8 b these stick like contaminates seems to be relatively isolated and evenly distributed on the membrane surface and the clearly interconnected pore structure of the inner surface fig 2 d cannot be distinguished from such an image resolution any more these stick like contaminates as a result of the fouling may attribute to the combined effect of the deposition of dissolved salts and absorption of hydrocarbons to the membrane surface during the dcmd process fig 8 c and d exhibits the cross sectional morphology of the outer and inner membrane edges it is clear for all the pores along both the inner surface and the outer surface just as analyzed earlier it seems that the stick like contaminant was only attached on the lumen surface the foulants could not form large area deposit layer or penetrate into the membrane matrix because there was no liquid carrier to bring them there and no salt crystal were formed underneath of the inner surface in addition although identified with membrane fouling salt crystal and lumpish salt clusters that frequently reported in other references were not observed on the lumen surface of the pvdf si r hfm contributing to the small pore size on the membrane inner surface 12 45 46 which indicate a better antifouling ability of the pvdf si r membrane than the previously reported membranes 43 44 4 conclusions pvdf si r hfm was prepared using a dry jet wet spinning technique for treatment of hypersaline pw via a dcmd process the pvdf si r hfm consisted of a thick porous middle layer sandwiched between two very thin dense surfaces at outside and inside the membrane properties characterization results showed that the pores size of the inner surface was much smaller than that of the outer surface the permeate flux of the pvdf si hfm based dcmd process increased with the increase of transmembrane temperature difference and the feed velocity while declined with the rising of feed salinity the dcmd performance including water flux and thermal efficiency can be both improved through the increase of feed temperature than the cooling of the stream at the permeate side the dcmd process showed favorable water flux in the treatment of flowback water with the total dissolved solids as high as 250 000 ppm during the dcmd process almost all the foulants were found on the inner surface but could not penetrated to the middle layer and outer surface of the hfm which is helpful to guarantee the antifouling ability of the hfms by restraining the crystallization of salts on its inner surface without greatly sacrificing the mass transfer of the membrane as the pvdf si r hybrid hfm seems promising for practical application in treating oilfield pw it is believed that this work opens a new light on the engineering of pvdf hfm fabricated specifically for treating high salinity via dcmd process

13244,the membrane based process is attractive for the treatment of oil water emulsion because of its effectiveness in handling micron size oil droplets however membrane fouling due to the strong oil droplets membrane surface interplay remains its major challenge that limits its widespread application this study reports a new approach for membrane fouling control via a wavy flow channel to enhance the effective area and improve the local mixing the hydraulic performance of a membrane was used to assess the effectiveness of the system against the traditional straight flow for oil water emulsion treatment results show that the wavy flow channel offers two main advantages increasing the membrane effective surface area and facilitate swirling flows that effectively promote fouling control the wavy flow channel showed up to 58 higher permeability of 219 1 5 8 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 than the reference in which 18 was due to the enhanced flow property the energy loss due to additional shear stress and longer flow path only contributed to a 7 additional pressure drop the energy to overcome the pressure drop was insignificant to the specific energy consumption which showed that the wavy membrane offered 21 energy saving 0 015 vs 0 019 kwh m3 this study opens an option in improving membrane filtration performances via a simple module scale modification suitable for fouling prone pressure driven membrane systems keywords oil water emulsion membrane fouling flow channel modification hydrodynamic effect computational fluid dynamics energy consumption 1 introduction treatment of oil water emulsion streams in industrial wastewater such as oil and gas pharmaceuticals food and cosmetics remains a major challenge conventional methods for the treatment of oil water emulsion suffer from low separation efficiency high cost and generation of secondary pollutants 1 moreover they are also inefficient in handling oil water emulsion with oil droplets size 10 μm 1 2 those limitations hinder their continuous widespread adoption 3 therefore there is an intense need for sustainable technology for this application 4 membrane technology provides not only an efficient approach for oil water emulsion treatment but also offers the best option for oil and water recovery 5 the technology has shown great promise for oil water emulsion treatment 6 7 however accumulation of oil droplets on and or within the membrane due to intensive oil droplets membrane surface interaction known as membrane fouling remains its major setback 8 9 the accumulated oil droplets acting as foulant form a cake layer that eventually increases the membrane hydraulic resistance and lowers its hydraulic performances 10 conventionally the membrane performances could be restored through maintenance and or intensive chemical cleanings that degrade the persistent foulant dissolve and diffuse it out from the membrane matrix 11 12 however these chemicals not only shorten the membrane life span due to material degradation but also possess both health and environmental risks 11 13 apart from the chemical cleaning membrane process inherently accompanied with regular physical cleaning system either by applying two phase flow in form of aeration backwashing and or relaxation dynamic module systems engineered membrane surface chemical and or physical modifications etc membrane surface patterning offers a generic approach that hinders the formation of the cake layer from the first instant by thinning the boundary layer and has recently been a popular approach for membrane fouling control 14 15 such an advantage was achieved thanks to the high wall shear stress generated by the membrane surface patterns via the hydrodynamic effect 16 the pattern on the membrane surface disturb the flow pattern create local mixing that helps in scouring off foulant and reduces concentration polarization moreover it also increases the membrane effective area packing density and therefore improves its hydraulic performances by offering a higher membrane filtration area per unit volume of a module packing density 17 18 conventionally membrane surfaces are patterned by either in situ or ex situ techniques the former involves the formation of surface patterns during membrane fabrication as reported elsewhere 19 21 while the latter involves patterning a ready made membrane 22 23 kim et al 24 fabricated patterned hollow fiber membrane using an in situ approach and reported up to 25 improvement in the hydraulic and fouling resistance performances against its flat counterpart in another study maruf et al 25 employed an ex situ surface patterning technique the patterned membrane recorded 22 enhancement in hydraulic and antifouling performances than the flat membrane they attributed the improved performances of the patterned membrane to the increase in the membrane effective area and the hydrodynamic effect induced by the surface patterns however despite the performances demonstrated by the in situ and ex situ technique they both suffered from low pattern fidelity susceptibility to membrane defect and a limited range of fabrication parameters 13 26 therefore those limitations restrict their widespread adoption and limit their development into industrial scale modules recently researchers explore new or advance the established methods to produce patterned membranes the new approaches result in excellent hydraulic and fouling mitigation performances with improved pattern fidelity limited membrane defect and a level of fabrication parameters control marbelia et al 27 fabricated flat and patterned cellulose acetate ca and polyacrylonitrile pan membranes via an integrated modified patterned casting knife and phase inversion approach the patterned casting knife imposed a surface pattern on the cast film and non solvent was sprayed immediately after the passage of the patterned knife to quickly solidify the cast film that maintained the top surface pattern the patterned membrane recorded higher hydraulic and fouling resistance performances of up to 3 times than the reference flat pan membrane and 50 times higher than the reference flat ca membrane recent researches reported energy saving exhibited by the patterned membranes compared to the flat counterparts 28 29 the improvement in hydraulic and fouling resistance performances of the patterned membranes overwhelmed the higher pressure loss induced by the rough surface of the patterned membrane scott et al 30 compared the specific energy consumption of flat and patterned membranes and reported up to 88 energy saving exhibited by the patterned membrane despite the higher pressure loss despite showing encouraging performances membrane surface patterning faces several challenges it is a challenge to maintain the same membrane properties membrane thickness pore size and porosity etc for both the flat and the patterned membrane 27 difficulty to produce defect free patterned membranes 31 the resulting surface patterns are typically permanent and cannot be modified or removed 27 in this study the limitations of the current surface patterning methods are addressed through membrane flow channel modification we propose a wavy flow channel that shapes the flow path allowing a conventional flat membrane to exert advantages offered by the surface patterned membranes modification of the fluid flow pattern in the feed channel has also been proposed through module scale design engineering helical baffle around the hollow fiber membrane was introduced to generate a swirling flow 32 as such the filtration performance was improved with swirl number increase swirling flow induced by the helical baffle was found more effective for suppressing membrane fouling than turbulent flow from a high cross flow velocity combination of helical baffle and oscillatory flow could also intensify cross flow filtration in a hollow fiber module in which the unsteady vortex motion disturbed concentration polarization layer and remove foulant by increasing shear stress at the membrane surface 33 swirling flow induced by the sinusoidal wavy flow channel was reported to enhance the performances of a reserve osmosis filtration system 34 the flux increased by factor of two for the flow channel that follow 6 sin π 2 function in comparison with the straight channel 35 they attributed the flux enhancement to generation of vortices with maximum flow velocities that increased with the amplitude and decreased with the wavelength of the sinusoid the vortices increased mixing that reduced the concentration at the membrane enhancing the permeate flux more recently the swirling flow was introduced in the feed channel of a plate and frame submerged membrane bioreactor module by introducing an array of micro channel turbulence promoters that caused frequent changes in flow directions and generated small eddies and a velocity gradient as proved from cfd simulation 36 37 the spacer orientation was also proven to affect the liquid and gas velocity profile in which the vertical orientation showed a lower filtration resistance of 28 3 37 swirling fluidization involving liquid and particle was also proven effective in preventing membrane fouling in an anoxic membrane bioreactor 38 high shear stress from the swirling flow was associated to low soluble microbial products attachment on membrane walls leading to a reduced membrane fouling energy analysis of the modified flow channel from earlier reports showed encouraging outcomes scott et al 30 reported significant energy savings by the patterned membrane against the flat membrane in expense of higher pressure drop the specific energy consumptions of 1 3 kwh m3 reported by barillon et al 39 was obtained for a membrane bioreactor massé et al 40 reported 0 310 kwh m3 energy consumption for a cross flow pilot plant operated at 0 4 bar for the treatment of salted suspensions using polysulfone membrane bahnasawy and shenana 41 evaluated the energy consumption for concentrating milk in a cross flow filtration set up they reported 62 54 kj l energy consumption for the retentate and 21 65 kj l for the permeate this study presents a new one step approach to generate inherent local mixing and swirling flow through a wavy membrane flow channel the wavy flow path was expected to facilitate swirling flows along the flow channel to mimic the effect of surface patterned membranes or internal baffles that were proven effective for membrane fouling control 32 33 38 the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of the system were analyzed and compared with the conventional straight flat flow channel for treating a synthesized oil water emulsion model foulant using a flat polysulfone psf membrane the pressure drops and specific energy consumption of the systems were evaluated and compared finally computational fluid dynamics cfd was conducted to visualize the wall shear stress distribution of the resulting flat and wavy systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials transparent poly methyl methacrylate temperature range 100 250 c pressure limit 20 mpa was used to fabricate the flat and wavy flow channel filtration cells the membrane was fabricated via the non solvent induced phase separation from a dope solution containing 18 wt of psf mw 78 0 103 g mol sigma aldrich usa and 80 9 wt of dimethylacetamide dmac 99 8 purity sigma aldrich usa as the polymer and the solvent respectively both lithium chloride licl mw 42 38 g mol acros organics belgium of 0 1 wt and polyethylene glycol peg mw 10 000 kg mol sigma aldrich usa of 1 wt were used as additives in the dope solution distilled water and novatexx 24 413 freedenberg filter weinheim germany were used as the nonsolvent and nonwoven support respectively the oil water emulsion was synthesized from crude oil obtained from an offshore oil well in malaysia distilled water and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds 98 purity sigma aldrich usa as oil water and surfactant respectively the oil water emulsion was synthesized by stir mixing of 1 g oil and sds solution at 1 99 sds to oil ratio to a liter of water at 3500 rpm for 24 h stabilized 1000 ppm oil water emulsion was obtained 2 2 flat and wavy flow filtration cells fig 1 shows the detailed specifications of the wavy flow channel module the filtration cell flow channels were constructed from poly methyl methacrylate material the filtration cell with the straight flat flow channel was mounted with a 0 0037 m2 effective area whereas the filtration cell with the wavy flow channel was mounted with 0 0036 m2 and 0 0048 m2 projected and actual or effective area respectively for both filtration cells the membrane was placed in between the offer and the bottom part by tightening the bolt with the nut the membrane was held firmly feed inlet outlet and permeate collection points were provided for all the filtration cells the flow channel had a depth of 2 mm while the amplitude and wavelength were set at 5 mm and 20 mm respectively the wave design was based on fabrication practicality and could still be optimize in the future 2 3 membrane preparation and characterization the membrane was prepared and characterized according to the previous study 42 briefly the homogeneous dope solution was obtained by dissolving psf peg and licl into the dmac by stirring using a magnetic stirrer at 60 c after homogeneous the solution was then degassed and cast on the nonwoven support under a wet casting thickness of 0 22 mm after casting the cast film was exposed to humid air 70 for 60 s before immersion into the nonsolvent bath for completion of the membrane formation the resulting membrane was stored in fresh nonsolvent until usage few days to release the residual solvent the surface and cross section morphology of the membrane was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem zeiss evo ls 15 germany while pore size distribution water contact angle and oil rejection were investigated using a capillary flow porometer porolux 1000 berlin germany goniometer ramé hart 260 new jersey usa and uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv 2600 kyoto japan at a wavelength of 227 nm respectively the membrane properties obtained in the previous study 43 reveal that the membrane exhibited pore size porosity thickness water contact angle and oil rejection of 0 032 μm 72 8 0 4 235 7 1 7 μm 57 72 0 61o and 99 81 0 1 respectively the same membrane was used for both the straight and the wavy flow channel filtration cells 2 4 filtration and membrane fouling analysis the membrane samples were cut and mounted into both straight and wavy flow channel modules membrane compaction and clean water permeability cwp were done at once by performing filtration under 0 2 bar trans membrane pressure p until nearly three constant consecutive values of the permeability collected every 10 mins were obtained the value was then recorded as the cwp subsequently the oil water emulsion feed was introduced and the filtration was run for 90 min the permeate samples were collected every 10 min evaluated recorded and returned to the feed tank to maintain the feed condition thereafter the membrane was flushed with clean water for 10 min before a re evaluation of the cwp this procedure was considered a complete filtration cycle to evaluate the membrane s performances adequately five filtration cycles were conducted for each set of the testing parameters each set of parameters was done thrice to ensure sufficient reproducibility and reported as an average standard deviation value eq 1 was used to evaluate the cwp l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 similar equation was also applied to measure the oil water emulsion permeability 1 cwp v a t p where v is the volume of the permeate collected l t is the filtration time h p is the trans membrane pressure bar a is the membrane effective area m2 since the wavy flow channel exhibited two areas projected and actual area therefore its cwp was evaluated based on the projected area measured cwp and the actual available area calculated cwp the projected area was the same as the one in the straight flow channel the fouling resistance of the filtration using the straight and the wavy flow channel was analyzed by calculating the fouling indices namely permeance recovery pr reversible fouling rf irreversible fouling irf and residual permeance rp using eqs 2 5 respectively 2 pr cwp wi n cwp wi 100 3 rf cwp wi n f oi cwp wi 100 4 irf cwp wi cwp wi n cwp wi 100 5 rp cwp i rf irf where cwp wi is the initial cwp cwp wi n is the cwp of the nth filtration cycle cwp i is total percentage of cwp of 100 and f oi is the oil water emulsion permeability 2 5 estimation of energy consumption the basic attribute of a cross flow filtration set up comprises only a feed pump as the energy demanding element therefore the total specific energy consumptions per unit volume of the permeate sec kwh m 3 for the straight and the wavy membrane could simply be calculated using eq 6 where ṁ is the mass rate kg s 1 defined by eq 8 w p the work done by the feed pump j kg 1 defined by eq 9 and v p the volume of permeate produced by the membrane m3 hr 1 6 sec ṁ w p v p 7 ṁ ρ v wl 8 w p p ρ v 2 2 f where ρ is water density kg m 3 v the cross flow velocity m s 1 w the width of the membrane sample m l the depth of the flow area m p the feed pressure pa and f the friction loss in the membrane flow channel m2 s2 the pressure drops per unit length p d pa m along the flow channel were evaluated using eq 9 9 p d p 1 p 2 l where p1is the pressure at the module inlet pa and p2 is the pressure at the module outlet pa l the module length m 2 6 cfd simulation three dimensional 3d hydraulic modeling was carried out using ansys fluent 2020 r2 student version to study the fluid mechanics of the straight and the wavy flow channels the applied flow governing equations were the navier stokes equation for incompressible fluid and continuity equation expressed by eqs 10 and 11 respectively the governing equations were coupled using the simple algorithm accompanied by a steady state standardized k ε model the wavy and straight domains were discretized into rectangular elements and solved using the finite element method by assuming the feed as pure water at 25 c and by employing the following boundary conditions of fully developed flow throughout the impermeable fixed domain the convective flow of permeate was ignored since it was much smaller 0 24 than the feed velocity the inlet velocity of 0 058 m s was employed the no slip condition was applied to all solid walls 10 u 0 11 ρ u u p μ 2 u where u is the velocity vector p the pressure ρ the water density kg m 3 and μ the water dynamic viscosity kg m 1 s 1 2 7 meshing sensitivity prior to the main simulation results the sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the optimum mesh size required for the simulation volume domain the meshing qualities were varied in terms of their mesh sizes from the lowest quality of course mesh mesh 1 to the highest quality of fine mesh mesh 7 as described in table 1 and illustrated few examples of the mesh quality shown in figs 2 b c in general the finest mesh will give the highest accuracy of simulation result the analysis was performed using the wavy flow channel fig 2a shows the velocity plot across the flow channel the lowest meshing quality mesh 1 shows bad profile compared with other meshing due to limited no of mesh across the channel when the mesh quality improved to finer mesh 7 the profile becomes smoother however the finest mesh has high computational cost due to the highest number of elements of 9 million alternatively mesh 6 that has lower number elements shows relatively same result with mesh 7 which can be defined as asymptotic value with the finest mesh therefore mesh 6 was taken as the optimum mesh quality and was used for the rest of simulation throughout the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 clean water permeability results in figs 3 4 demonstrate that the wavy system outperforms the flat straight system in terms of cwp as well as in fouling resistance performances even after prolong fouling filtration tests unlike in many studies where the patterned and flat membrane exhibited different membrane properties which make it very difficult to justify the main factor that influences the performance improvement 43 herein the membrane sample in both the flat and the wavy systems exhibited the same properties hence the distinct performance between the two systems can be exclusively attributed to the flow channel configuration or the membrane alignments fig 3 shows that the clean water permeability was similar when the membrane sample was mounted in both the straight and the wavy flow channel however the wavy flow channel offers hydraulic advantages from the additional membrane area required to compensate for the wavy alignment the wavy alignment leads to a longer membrane sheet since the actual membrane area is larger than the projected area the projected area is defined the area in the straight alignment because of the two perspectives in looking at the area of the wavy alignment the membrane exhibits cwp of 673 1 8 3 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 using the projected area measured cwp while the straight counterpart is just 501 8 8 9 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 this accounts for a 34 improvement in cwp by the wavy membrane thanks to the enhanced area induced by the wavy sheet alignment 23 44 when calculated using the actual membrane area the wavy alignment system has a cwp calculated cwp of 504 9 6 2 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 very close 0 62 higher to the straight alignment this finding indicates that membrane sample variation is negligible and any difference in performance can be attributed to the wavy vs the flat surface alignments a similar result was reported by mazinani et al 45 the patterned membrane had a 10 improvement in measured cwp attributed to the enhanced effective filtration area in another study maruf et al 25 also reported a 22 improvement in cwp of a patterned thin film composite membrane against its flat counterpart it is widely reported that the extra curve on the membrane surface or the wavy geometry offers an enhanced effective membrane area 19 46 the finding in this study demonstratively proof the contribution of excess surface area on the hydraulic performance because the actual area and the projected area can be measured precisely on another hand the earlier report relied on estimation by assuming a certain shape or geometry of the patterns on the membrane surface 3 2 oil water emulsion filtration fig 4 compares the flat membrane with the actual area of the wavy membrane the latter poses up to 18 higher permeability suggesting that modification of the flow channel geometry enhanced both the hydraulic and fouling mitigation performances when the wavy flow channel projected area was counted it offered up to 58 improvement in hydraulic performance for treating oil water emulsion feed even after the 5th filtration cycle the cwp was maintained at 219 1 5 8 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 at the 5th cycle against 139 1 0 4 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 for the flat membrane based on the results in fig 4 the advantages offered by the wavy membrane over the flat membrane can be attributed to two factors enhancement of the effective membrane area and a certain degree of membrane fouling control due to wavy flow channel geometry the wavy membrane surface facilitates local mixing or swirling flow as detailed in section 3 3 to restricted oil droplet membrane surface interaction and therefore improves the membrane fouling resistance as reported for other patterned membrane systems 26 43 the vortexes generated by the wavy patterns enhanced the shear stress atop the membrane surface and thus provide the shear that restricted oil droplet adsorption as also reported elsewhere 46 such a situation enables the 10 mins in line water cleaning in between filtration cycles to effectively detach and drive away the loosely bonded oil droplets from the membrane surface as also reported by others 13 the local mixing facilitates water transport across the membrane due to the continuous renewal of the boundary layer 44 47 48 fig 5 details the evolution of fouling indices for both the straight flat and wavy membrane systems demonstrating that the latter shows higher pr than the former during all filtration cycles the wavy membrane exhibited up to 32 5 0 7 pr even after the 5th filtration cycle whereas the flat membrane sustained only 27 7 0 58 suggesting better fouling resistance of the wavy membrane which is in line with the finding for the conventional patterned membrane reported elsewhere 44 it is worth noting that the pr was calculated using the cwp as the reference resulting in a low pr value however when the irf values between cycles for the wavy membrane are compared only slight changes are observed for the last two cycles 66 5 0 9 vs 67 5 0 7 closer than the flat membrane 70 1 1 2 vs 72 3 1 2 suggesting that the performance would have been maintained for the following cycles for all the filtration cycles the wavy membrane demonstrates superior fouling control performance as ascribed from higher rfs and rps and lower irfs shown in fig 5 the wavy membrane sustains the rf the rp and the irf of 9 6 0 4 22 9 0 7 and 67 5 0 7 respectively even after the 5th filtration cycle on contrary the flat membrane possesses only 6 5 21 2 0 4 and 72 3 0 4 for the rf the rp and the irf respectively maintaining higher rf and rp and lower irf signifies a tremendous improvement in fouling resistance as detailed elsewhere 13 45 therefore the results demonstrated by the wavy membrane justify its superior fouling resistance performances against the flat membrane the favorable fouling control in the wavy membrane can be attributed to the fluid eddies generated by the flow channel geometry that promotes swirling flow that disrupted boundary layers near the membrane as a consequence it hindered the prolonged existence of the concentration polarization and thus restricted the fouling formation as also suggested in an earlier report 27 45 the positive role of surface pattern or geometry in the context of this study has been constantly reported won et al 49 also reported a better fouling resistance performances of the patterned membrane against a flat reference membrane the patterned membrane allowed only 10 mg latex particle deposit against 75 mg for the flat membrane after the fouling filtration test recently the group of vankelecom 25 44 also reported improvements in fouling resistance of the patterned membranes for different feeds they attributed the improved performances of the membrane to the hydrodynamic effect induced by its surface patterns irregular surface patterns under a certain flow regime can promote eddies beneficial in interrupting and thinning the concentration polarization layer thereby restricted the fouling formation from the first instance as detailed elsewhere 44 50 3 3 cfd simulation in most of the earlier reports the hydraulic advantage of the patterned membrane has been attributed mostly to the role of the patterns in generating local mixing however it has been acknowledged that additional surface areas that govern the patterns also contribute to the permeation 18 47 51 as also demonstrated in this study section 3 1 similarly for the wavy membrane proposed in this study cfd simulation was used to extract the flow properties and understand how it favors the overall filtration performance figs 6 7 compare the membrane wall shear stress distributions and their magnitudes at various positions visualized from the cfd model for the wavy and the straight flow channel systems respectively as shown in fig 6 the shear stress distribution of the wavy membrane exhibited four important positions labeled as a b c and d each position poses a different shear stress profile and therefore their magnitudes were extracted and compared with that of the straight flat membrane that demonstrated the equally distributed shear stress the wavy membrane poses up to 251 improvement in shear stress at the highest shear stress point position c of 0 596 pa as shown in fig 7 the flat membrane exhibits uniformly distributed shear stress of 0 17 pa at all positions a b c and d after the flow is fully developed a few mm from the entrance as also reported elsewhere 52 the shear stress magnitudes at all positions are also equal in the z direction and are represented by a thick red line in fig 7 on the other hand the wavy flow channel demonstrated various shear stress distributions depending on the point location relative to the wavy geometry the variations can be ascribed by unequal mixing of the streamlines at each position as also suggested by others 45 jung et al 53 and choi et al 54 similarly reported uniform distribution of shear stress and velocity for the flat membrane whereas the patterned membrane showed non uniform distribution and the highest value was obtained at the hill while the valley recorded the lowest recently homogeneous flow distribution was also reported for a straight flow path but substantially varied in a presence of a baffle 55 spatial analysis shows that the wavy flow channel exhibited shear stress improvement of up to 132 and 31 at positions b and d respectively relative to the average location of the straight flow path moreover even at the lowest shear stress position a the wavy flow channel shows 0 18 pa shear stress this accounts for 6 improvement as compared to the flat flow channel variation of wall shear stress is strongly affected by the flow channel geometry moreover the higher value of the shear stress for the wavy flow channel over the flat straight flow channel is due to its higher average velocity the enhanced membrane wall shear stress demonstrated by the wavy flow channel justifies its superior experimental performances accompanied by a higher pressure drop that contributes to the pumping energy addressed in section 3 4 the higher wall shear stress exhibited by the wavy flow channel restricted the oil droplets membrane surface interplay by scraping and back transport of the oil droplets from the membrane surface nonetheless the variability of the shear stress acting on the membrane surface may have a detrimental impact in the long run in which the locations with low shear stress are more vulnerable from membrane fouling 55 or acting as a dead zone that initiates the fouling 47 figs 8 10 show the velocity profile and velocity magnitudes at the selected positions of a b c and d respectively the velocity vector showing the swirling flow in the wavy flow channel is clearly shown in the magnified image in fig 9 the findings demonstrate the effect of the wavy geometry in promoting swirling flow and thus enhances the velocity along the flow channel for the straight flat membrane the developed velocity profile of 0 084 m s was obtained same magnitude throughout the membrane surface whereas the wavy membrane demonstrated uniformly distributed developed velocity magnitude of up to 0 105 m s fig 8 this accounts for a 25 improvement in the flow velocity and thus enhances the fouling mitigation as reported elsewhere 17 56 the increase in velocity enhanced the shear stress that help to scour off foulant on the membrane surface the overwhelming advantage has been reported on the effect of membrane surface patterning in improving overall membrane performance mazinani et al 45 visualizes the shear stress distribution of flat and patterned membranes and reported enhancement in the shear stress recorded by the latter the patterned membrane exhibited wall shear stress of 1 43 pa whereas the flat demonstrated 0 26 pa choi et al 54 also analyzes the hydrodynamics of the flat and patterned membrane in which the patterned membrane showed 5 fold higher shear stress compared to the flat membrane both studies attributed the improvement of the shear stress and the velocity demonstrated by the patterned membrane to the increased frictional force induced by its surface patterns that facilitate water transport as well as the detachment of the foulant from the membrane surface however we believed that the magnitude of improvement is restricted by the spatial variation of the impact for instance by referring to the data in figs 8 10 of this study points b and c favor the top side membrane while points a and d favor the bottom side membrane 3 4 energy consumption and practical implementation fig 11 demonstrates that the wavy membrane offers significant energy savings of up to 21 the specific energy consumption for the wavy flow channel is 0 015 kwh m3 while the straight flow channel is 0 019 kwh m3 the substantial energy saving is attributed to the improved hydraulic and fouling resistance performances induced by the wavy flow channels the earlier study also reported substantial improvement in energy saving attributed to the surface patterning role in enhancing hydraulic performance 26 the low energy input on the wavy system can be attributed to the increased frictional force inform of shear stress resulted in the higher resistance to axial flow in line with an earlier report 10 56 to overcome the shear the wavy flow system was run at a slightly higher crossflow velocity experimental data of the lab scale module suggest that the pressure drop due to additional shear exerted by longer flow path and swirling fluid flow was rather small the wavy flow channel had only a 7 higher pressure drop p d pa m than the straight flow channel however the energy associated with the additional mass flow was overcome by the higher permeability resulting in a more energy efficient system fig 11 the low specific energy consumption found in this study is mostly due to the application of very low pressure 0 2 bar and because they were counted only for pumping overall results indicate that the concept of patterning membrane surface via a novel flow channel modification offers enhanced performances to the hydrodynamic effect since both flat and wavy membrane exhibited the same membrane properties 13 moreover it can be easily applied to any established membrane since the modification is not on the membrane itself but the flow channel 17 it can also be simply scale up by redesigning the flow channel frame i e through 3d printing 57 the proposed module system to manipulate the flow property instead of direct imprinting surface pattern on a membrane material opens an attractive possibility for membrane process development since the challenge of membrane fouling experienced by membrane based technology was systematically managed the proposed concept can also be applied for multiple pressure driven membrane applications the energy consumption can future be lowered by applying ultra low pressure filtration system and engineering modification of a spacer in the flow channel as recently reported in other reports 58 59 4 conclusion this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a wavy flow channel in enhancing the filterability of a psf membrane for the treatment of oil water emulsion the wavy membrane formed by the flow channel alignment leads to an increase in effective membrane area by 34 as well as impose fouling control means fouling filtration of oil water emulsion shows a 58 overall increment in permeability in which 18 is due to flow properties the wavy flow channel promotes swirling flow that is believed to disturb boundary layers via fluid eddies to induces higher shear stress at the membrane walls the energy loss due to additional shear stress and longer flow path only contributes to a 7 pressure drop increment and shows no effect on specific energy consumption projection of the specific energy consumption using full scale module systems shows that the wavy membrane offers up to 21 energy saving 0 015 vs 0 019 kwh m3 this study opens a new avenue to enhance the membrane filtration performance by a simple modification of the module to allow swirling flow via a wavy flow path the system is believed to offer similar effectiveness for handling other feeds declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgment this research was funded by yayasan universiti teknologi petronas

13244,the membrane based process is attractive for the treatment of oil water emulsion because of its effectiveness in handling micron size oil droplets however membrane fouling due to the strong oil droplets membrane surface interplay remains its major challenge that limits its widespread application this study reports a new approach for membrane fouling control via a wavy flow channel to enhance the effective area and improve the local mixing the hydraulic performance of a membrane was used to assess the effectiveness of the system against the traditional straight flow for oil water emulsion treatment results show that the wavy flow channel offers two main advantages increasing the membrane effective surface area and facilitate swirling flows that effectively promote fouling control the wavy flow channel showed up to 58 higher permeability of 219 1 5 8 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 than the reference in which 18 was due to the enhanced flow property the energy loss due to additional shear stress and longer flow path only contributed to a 7 additional pressure drop the energy to overcome the pressure drop was insignificant to the specific energy consumption which showed that the wavy membrane offered 21 energy saving 0 015 vs 0 019 kwh m3 this study opens an option in improving membrane filtration performances via a simple module scale modification suitable for fouling prone pressure driven membrane systems keywords oil water emulsion membrane fouling flow channel modification hydrodynamic effect computational fluid dynamics energy consumption 1 introduction treatment of oil water emulsion streams in industrial wastewater such as oil and gas pharmaceuticals food and cosmetics remains a major challenge conventional methods for the treatment of oil water emulsion suffer from low separation efficiency high cost and generation of secondary pollutants 1 moreover they are also inefficient in handling oil water emulsion with oil droplets size 10 μm 1 2 those limitations hinder their continuous widespread adoption 3 therefore there is an intense need for sustainable technology for this application 4 membrane technology provides not only an efficient approach for oil water emulsion treatment but also offers the best option for oil and water recovery 5 the technology has shown great promise for oil water emulsion treatment 6 7 however accumulation of oil droplets on and or within the membrane due to intensive oil droplets membrane surface interaction known as membrane fouling remains its major setback 8 9 the accumulated oil droplets acting as foulant form a cake layer that eventually increases the membrane hydraulic resistance and lowers its hydraulic performances 10 conventionally the membrane performances could be restored through maintenance and or intensive chemical cleanings that degrade the persistent foulant dissolve and diffuse it out from the membrane matrix 11 12 however these chemicals not only shorten the membrane life span due to material degradation but also possess both health and environmental risks 11 13 apart from the chemical cleaning membrane process inherently accompanied with regular physical cleaning system either by applying two phase flow in form of aeration backwashing and or relaxation dynamic module systems engineered membrane surface chemical and or physical modifications etc membrane surface patterning offers a generic approach that hinders the formation of the cake layer from the first instant by thinning the boundary layer and has recently been a popular approach for membrane fouling control 14 15 such an advantage was achieved thanks to the high wall shear stress generated by the membrane surface patterns via the hydrodynamic effect 16 the pattern on the membrane surface disturb the flow pattern create local mixing that helps in scouring off foulant and reduces concentration polarization moreover it also increases the membrane effective area packing density and therefore improves its hydraulic performances by offering a higher membrane filtration area per unit volume of a module packing density 17 18 conventionally membrane surfaces are patterned by either in situ or ex situ techniques the former involves the formation of surface patterns during membrane fabrication as reported elsewhere 19 21 while the latter involves patterning a ready made membrane 22 23 kim et al 24 fabricated patterned hollow fiber membrane using an in situ approach and reported up to 25 improvement in the hydraulic and fouling resistance performances against its flat counterpart in another study maruf et al 25 employed an ex situ surface patterning technique the patterned membrane recorded 22 enhancement in hydraulic and antifouling performances than the flat membrane they attributed the improved performances of the patterned membrane to the increase in the membrane effective area and the hydrodynamic effect induced by the surface patterns however despite the performances demonstrated by the in situ and ex situ technique they both suffered from low pattern fidelity susceptibility to membrane defect and a limited range of fabrication parameters 13 26 therefore those limitations restrict their widespread adoption and limit their development into industrial scale modules recently researchers explore new or advance the established methods to produce patterned membranes the new approaches result in excellent hydraulic and fouling mitigation performances with improved pattern fidelity limited membrane defect and a level of fabrication parameters control marbelia et al 27 fabricated flat and patterned cellulose acetate ca and polyacrylonitrile pan membranes via an integrated modified patterned casting knife and phase inversion approach the patterned casting knife imposed a surface pattern on the cast film and non solvent was sprayed immediately after the passage of the patterned knife to quickly solidify the cast film that maintained the top surface pattern the patterned membrane recorded higher hydraulic and fouling resistance performances of up to 3 times than the reference flat pan membrane and 50 times higher than the reference flat ca membrane recent researches reported energy saving exhibited by the patterned membranes compared to the flat counterparts 28 29 the improvement in hydraulic and fouling resistance performances of the patterned membranes overwhelmed the higher pressure loss induced by the rough surface of the patterned membrane scott et al 30 compared the specific energy consumption of flat and patterned membranes and reported up to 88 energy saving exhibited by the patterned membrane despite the higher pressure loss despite showing encouraging performances membrane surface patterning faces several challenges it is a challenge to maintain the same membrane properties membrane thickness pore size and porosity etc for both the flat and the patterned membrane 27 difficulty to produce defect free patterned membranes 31 the resulting surface patterns are typically permanent and cannot be modified or removed 27 in this study the limitations of the current surface patterning methods are addressed through membrane flow channel modification we propose a wavy flow channel that shapes the flow path allowing a conventional flat membrane to exert advantages offered by the surface patterned membranes modification of the fluid flow pattern in the feed channel has also been proposed through module scale design engineering helical baffle around the hollow fiber membrane was introduced to generate a swirling flow 32 as such the filtration performance was improved with swirl number increase swirling flow induced by the helical baffle was found more effective for suppressing membrane fouling than turbulent flow from a high cross flow velocity combination of helical baffle and oscillatory flow could also intensify cross flow filtration in a hollow fiber module in which the unsteady vortex motion disturbed concentration polarization layer and remove foulant by increasing shear stress at the membrane surface 33 swirling flow induced by the sinusoidal wavy flow channel was reported to enhance the performances of a reserve osmosis filtration system 34 the flux increased by factor of two for the flow channel that follow 6 sin π 2 function in comparison with the straight channel 35 they attributed the flux enhancement to generation of vortices with maximum flow velocities that increased with the amplitude and decreased with the wavelength of the sinusoid the vortices increased mixing that reduced the concentration at the membrane enhancing the permeate flux more recently the swirling flow was introduced in the feed channel of a plate and frame submerged membrane bioreactor module by introducing an array of micro channel turbulence promoters that caused frequent changes in flow directions and generated small eddies and a velocity gradient as proved from cfd simulation 36 37 the spacer orientation was also proven to affect the liquid and gas velocity profile in which the vertical orientation showed a lower filtration resistance of 28 3 37 swirling fluidization involving liquid and particle was also proven effective in preventing membrane fouling in an anoxic membrane bioreactor 38 high shear stress from the swirling flow was associated to low soluble microbial products attachment on membrane walls leading to a reduced membrane fouling energy analysis of the modified flow channel from earlier reports showed encouraging outcomes scott et al 30 reported significant energy savings by the patterned membrane against the flat membrane in expense of higher pressure drop the specific energy consumptions of 1 3 kwh m3 reported by barillon et al 39 was obtained for a membrane bioreactor massé et al 40 reported 0 310 kwh m3 energy consumption for a cross flow pilot plant operated at 0 4 bar for the treatment of salted suspensions using polysulfone membrane bahnasawy and shenana 41 evaluated the energy consumption for concentrating milk in a cross flow filtration set up they reported 62 54 kj l energy consumption for the retentate and 21 65 kj l for the permeate this study presents a new one step approach to generate inherent local mixing and swirling flow through a wavy membrane flow channel the wavy flow path was expected to facilitate swirling flows along the flow channel to mimic the effect of surface patterned membranes or internal baffles that were proven effective for membrane fouling control 32 33 38 the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of the system were analyzed and compared with the conventional straight flat flow channel for treating a synthesized oil water emulsion model foulant using a flat polysulfone psf membrane the pressure drops and specific energy consumption of the systems were evaluated and compared finally computational fluid dynamics cfd was conducted to visualize the wall shear stress distribution of the resulting flat and wavy systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials transparent poly methyl methacrylate temperature range 100 250 c pressure limit 20 mpa was used to fabricate the flat and wavy flow channel filtration cells the membrane was fabricated via the non solvent induced phase separation from a dope solution containing 18 wt of psf mw 78 0 103 g mol sigma aldrich usa and 80 9 wt of dimethylacetamide dmac 99 8 purity sigma aldrich usa as the polymer and the solvent respectively both lithium chloride licl mw 42 38 g mol acros organics belgium of 0 1 wt and polyethylene glycol peg mw 10 000 kg mol sigma aldrich usa of 1 wt were used as additives in the dope solution distilled water and novatexx 24 413 freedenberg filter weinheim germany were used as the nonsolvent and nonwoven support respectively the oil water emulsion was synthesized from crude oil obtained from an offshore oil well in malaysia distilled water and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds 98 purity sigma aldrich usa as oil water and surfactant respectively the oil water emulsion was synthesized by stir mixing of 1 g oil and sds solution at 1 99 sds to oil ratio to a liter of water at 3500 rpm for 24 h stabilized 1000 ppm oil water emulsion was obtained 2 2 flat and wavy flow filtration cells fig 1 shows the detailed specifications of the wavy flow channel module the filtration cell flow channels were constructed from poly methyl methacrylate material the filtration cell with the straight flat flow channel was mounted with a 0 0037 m2 effective area whereas the filtration cell with the wavy flow channel was mounted with 0 0036 m2 and 0 0048 m2 projected and actual or effective area respectively for both filtration cells the membrane was placed in between the offer and the bottom part by tightening the bolt with the nut the membrane was held firmly feed inlet outlet and permeate collection points were provided for all the filtration cells the flow channel had a depth of 2 mm while the amplitude and wavelength were set at 5 mm and 20 mm respectively the wave design was based on fabrication practicality and could still be optimize in the future 2 3 membrane preparation and characterization the membrane was prepared and characterized according to the previous study 42 briefly the homogeneous dope solution was obtained by dissolving psf peg and licl into the dmac by stirring using a magnetic stirrer at 60 c after homogeneous the solution was then degassed and cast on the nonwoven support under a wet casting thickness of 0 22 mm after casting the cast film was exposed to humid air 70 for 60 s before immersion into the nonsolvent bath for completion of the membrane formation the resulting membrane was stored in fresh nonsolvent until usage few days to release the residual solvent the surface and cross section morphology of the membrane was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem zeiss evo ls 15 germany while pore size distribution water contact angle and oil rejection were investigated using a capillary flow porometer porolux 1000 berlin germany goniometer ramé hart 260 new jersey usa and uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv 2600 kyoto japan at a wavelength of 227 nm respectively the membrane properties obtained in the previous study 43 reveal that the membrane exhibited pore size porosity thickness water contact angle and oil rejection of 0 032 μm 72 8 0 4 235 7 1 7 μm 57 72 0 61o and 99 81 0 1 respectively the same membrane was used for both the straight and the wavy flow channel filtration cells 2 4 filtration and membrane fouling analysis the membrane samples were cut and mounted into both straight and wavy flow channel modules membrane compaction and clean water permeability cwp were done at once by performing filtration under 0 2 bar trans membrane pressure p until nearly three constant consecutive values of the permeability collected every 10 mins were obtained the value was then recorded as the cwp subsequently the oil water emulsion feed was introduced and the filtration was run for 90 min the permeate samples were collected every 10 min evaluated recorded and returned to the feed tank to maintain the feed condition thereafter the membrane was flushed with clean water for 10 min before a re evaluation of the cwp this procedure was considered a complete filtration cycle to evaluate the membrane s performances adequately five filtration cycles were conducted for each set of the testing parameters each set of parameters was done thrice to ensure sufficient reproducibility and reported as an average standard deviation value eq 1 was used to evaluate the cwp l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 similar equation was also applied to measure the oil water emulsion permeability 1 cwp v a t p where v is the volume of the permeate collected l t is the filtration time h p is the trans membrane pressure bar a is the membrane effective area m2 since the wavy flow channel exhibited two areas projected and actual area therefore its cwp was evaluated based on the projected area measured cwp and the actual available area calculated cwp the projected area was the same as the one in the straight flow channel the fouling resistance of the filtration using the straight and the wavy flow channel was analyzed by calculating the fouling indices namely permeance recovery pr reversible fouling rf irreversible fouling irf and residual permeance rp using eqs 2 5 respectively 2 pr cwp wi n cwp wi 100 3 rf cwp wi n f oi cwp wi 100 4 irf cwp wi cwp wi n cwp wi 100 5 rp cwp i

consumption the basic attribute of a cross flow filtration set up comprises only a feed pump as the energy demanding element therefore the total specific energy consumptions per unit volume of the

hydraulic modeling was carried out using ansys fluent 2020 r2 student version to study the fluid mechanics of the straight and the wavy flow channels the applied flow governing equations were the navier stokes equation for incompressible fluid and continuity equation expressed by eqs 10 and 11 respectively the governing equations were coupled using the simple algorithm accompanied by a steady state standardized k ε model the wavy and straight domains were discretized into rectangular elements and solved using the finite element method by assuming the feed as pure water at 25 c and by employing the following boundary conditions of fully developed flow throughout the impermeable fixed domain the convective flow of permeate was ignored since it was much smaller 0 24 than the feed

simulation volume domain the meshing qualities were varied in terms of their mesh sizes from the lowest quality of course mesh mesh 1 to the highest quality of fine mesh mesh 7 as described in table 1 and illustrated few examples of the mesh quality shown in figs 2 b c in general the finest mesh will give the highest accuracy of simulation result the analysis was performed using the wavy flow channel fig 2a shows the velocity plot across the flow channel the lowest meshing quality mesh 1 shows bad profile compared with other meshing due to limited no of mesh across the channel when the mesh quality improved to finer mesh 7 the profile becomes smoother however the finest mesh has high computational cost due to the highest number of elements of 9 million alternatively mesh 6 that has lower number elements shows relatively same result with mesh 7 which can be defined as asymptotic value with the finest mesh therefore mesh 6 was taken as the optimum mesh quality and was used for the rest of simulation throughout the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 clean water permeability results in figs 3 4 demonstrate that the wavy system outperforms the flat straight system in terms of cwp as well as in fouling resistance performances even after prolong fouling filtration tests unlike in many studies where the patterned and flat membrane exhibited different membrane properties which make it very difficult to justify the main factor that influences the performance improvement 43 herein the membrane sample in both the flat and the wavy systems exhibited the same properties hence the distinct performance between the two systems can be exclusively attributed to the flow channel configuration or the membrane alignments fig 3 shows that the clean water permeability was similar when the membrane sample was mounted in both the straight and the wavy flow channel however the wavy flow channel offers hydraulic advantages from the additional membrane area required to compensate for the wavy alignment the wavy alignment leads to a longer membrane sheet since the actual membrane area is larger than the projected area the projected area is defined the area in the straight alignment because of the two perspectives in looking at the area of the wavy alignment the membrane exhibits cwp of 673 1 8 3 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 using the projected area measured cwp while the straight counterpart is just 501 8 8 9 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 this accounts for a 34 improvement in cwp by the wavy membrane thanks to the enhanced area induced by the wavy sheet alignment 23 44 when calculated using the actual membrane area the wavy alignment system has a cwp calculated cwp of 504 9 6 2 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 very close 0 62 higher to the straight alignment this finding indicates that membrane sample variation is negligible and any difference in performance can be attributed to the wavy vs the flat surface alignments a similar result was reported by mazinani et al 45 the patterned membrane had a 10 improvement in measured cwp attributed to the enhanced effective filtration area in another study maruf et al 25 also reported a 22 improvement in cwp of a patterned thin film composite membrane against its flat counterpart it is widely reported that the extra curve on the membrane surface or the wavy geometry offers an enhanced effective membrane area 19 46 the finding in this study demonstratively proof the contribution of excess surface area on the hydraulic performance because the actual area and the projected area can be measured precisely on another hand the earlier report relied on estimation by assuming a certain shape or geometry of the patterns on the membrane surface 3 2 oil water emulsion filtration fig 4 compares the flat membrane with the actual area of the wavy membrane the latter poses up to 18 higher permeability suggesting that modification of the flow channel geometry enhanced both the hydraulic and fouling mitigation performances when the wavy flow channel projected area was counted it offered up to 58 improvement in hydraulic performance for treating oil water emulsion feed even after the 5th filtration cycle the cwp was maintained at 219 1 5 8 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 at the 5th cycle against 139 1 0 4 l m 2 hr 1 bar 1 for the flat membrane based on the results in fig 4 the advantages offered by the wavy membrane over the flat membrane can be attributed to two factors enhancement of the effective membrane area and a certain degree of membrane fouling control due to wavy flow channel geometry the wavy membrane surface facilitates local mixing or swirling flow as detailed in section 3 3 to restricted oil droplet membrane surface interaction and therefore improves the membrane fouling resistance as reported for other patterned membrane systems 26 43 the vortexes generated by the wavy patterns enhanced the shear stress atop the membrane surface and thus provide the shear that restricted oil droplet adsorption as also reported elsewhere 46 such a situation enables the 10 mins in line water cleaning in between filtration cycles to effectively detach and drive away the loosely bonded oil droplets from the membrane surface as also reported by others 13 the local mixing facilitates water transport across the membrane due to the continuous renewal of the boundary layer 44 47 48 fig 5 details the evolution of fouling indices for both the straight flat and wavy membrane systems demonstrating that the latter shows higher pr than the former during all filtration cycles the wavy membrane exhibited up to 32 5 0 7 pr even after the 5th filtration cycle whereas the flat membrane sustained only 27 7 0 58 suggesting better fouling resistance of the wavy membrane which is in line with the finding for the conventional patterned membrane reported elsewhere 44 it is worth noting that the pr was calculated using the cwp as the reference resulting in a low pr value however when the irf values between cycles for the wavy membrane are compared only slight changes are observed for the last two cycles 66 5 0 9 vs 67 5 0 7 closer than the flat membrane 70 1 1 2 vs 72 3 1 2 suggesting that the performance would have been maintained for the following cycles for all the filtration cycles the wavy membrane demonstrates superior fouling control performance as ascribed from higher rfs and rps and lower irfs shown in fig 5 the wavy membrane sustains the rf the rp and the irf of 9 6 0 4 22 9 0 7 and 67 5 0 7 respectively even after the 5th filtration cycle on contrary the flat membrane possesses only 6 5 21 2 0 4 and 72 3 0 4 for the rf the rp and the irf respectively maintaining higher rf and rp and lower irf signifies a tremendous improvement in fouling resistance as detailed elsewhere 13 45 therefore the results demonstrated by the wavy membrane justify its superior fouling resistance performances against the flat membrane the favorable fouling control in the wavy membrane can be attributed to the fluid eddies generated by the flow channel geometry that promotes swirling flow that disrupted boundary layers near the membrane as a consequence it hindered the prolonged existence of the concentration polarization and thus restricted the fouling formation as also suggested in an earlier report 27 45 the positive role of surface pattern or geometry in the context of this study has been constantly reported won et al 49 also reported a better fouling resistance performances of the patterned membrane against a flat reference membrane the patterned membrane allowed only 10 mg latex particle deposit against 75 mg for the flat membrane after the fouling filtration test recently the group of vankelecom 25 44 also reported improvements in fouling resistance of the patterned membranes for different feeds they attributed the improved performances of the membrane to the hydrodynamic effect induced by its surface patterns irregular surface patterns under a certain flow regime can promote eddies beneficial in interrupting and thinning the concentration polarization layer thereby restricted the fouling formation from the first instance as detailed elsewhere 44 50 3 3 cfd simulation in most of the earlier reports the hydraulic advantage of the patterned membrane has been attributed mostly to the role of the patterns in generating local mixing however it has been acknowledged that additional surface areas that govern the patterns also contribute to the permeation 18 47 51 as also demonstrated in this study section 3 1 similarly for the wavy membrane proposed in this study cfd simulation was used to extract the flow properties and understand how it favors the overall filtration performance figs 6 7 compare the membrane wall shear stress distributions and their magnitudes at various positions visualized from the cfd model for the wavy and the straight flow channel systems respectively as shown in fig 6 the shear stress distribution of the wavy membrane exhibited four important positions labeled as a b c and d each position poses a different shear stress profile and therefore their magnitudes were extracted and compared with that of the straight flat membrane that demonstrated the equally distributed shear stress the wavy membrane poses up to 251 improvement in shear stress at the highest shear stress point position c of 0 596 pa as shown in fig 7 the flat membrane exhibits uniformly distributed shear stress of 0 17 pa at all positions a b c and d after the flow is fully developed a few mm from the entrance as also reported elsewhere 52 the shear stress magnitudes at all positions are also equal in the z direction and are represented by a thick red line in fig 7 on the other hand the wavy flow channel demonstrated various shear stress distributions depending on the point location relative to the wavy geometry the variations can be ascribed by unequal mixing of the streamlines at each position as also suggested by others 45 jung et al 53 and choi et al 54 similarly reported uniform distribution of shear stress and velocity for the flat membrane whereas the patterned membrane showed non uniform distribution and the highest value was obtained at the hill while the valley recorded the lowest recently homogeneous flow distribution was also reported for a straight flow path but substantially varied in a presence of a baffle 55 spatial analysis shows that the wavy flow channel exhibited shear stress improvement of up to 132 and 31 at positions b and d respectively relative to the average location of the straight flow path moreover even at the lowest shear stress position a the wavy flow channel shows 0 18 pa shear stress this accounts for 6 improvement as compared to the flat flow channel variation of wall shear stress is strongly affected by the flow channel geometry moreover the higher value of the shear stress for the wavy flow channel over the flat straight flow channel is due to its higher average velocity the enhanced membrane wall shear stress demonstrated by the wavy flow channel justifies its superior experimental performances accompanied by a higher pressure drop that contributes to the pumping energy addressed in section 3 4 the higher wall shear stress exhibited by the wavy flow channel restricted the oil droplets membrane surface interplay by scraping and back transport of the oil droplets from the membrane surface nonetheless the variability of the shear stress acting on the membrane surface may have a detrimental impact in the long run in which the locations with low shear stress are more vulnerable from membrane fouling 55 or acting as a dead zone that initiates the fouling 47 figs 8 10 show the velocity profile and velocity magnitudes at the selected positions of a b c and d respectively the velocity vector showing the swirling flow in the wavy flow channel is clearly shown in the magnified image in fig 9 the findings demonstrate the effect of the wavy geometry in promoting swirling flow and thus enhances the velocity along the flow channel for the straight flat membrane the developed velocity profile of 0 084 m s was obtained same magnitude throughout the membrane surface whereas the wavy membrane demonstrated uniformly distributed developed velocity magnitude of up to 0 105 m s fig 8 this accounts for a 25 improvement in the flow velocity and thus enhances the fouling mitigation as reported elsewhere 17 56 the increase in velocity enhanced the shear stress that help to scour off foulant on the membrane surface the overwhelming advantage has been reported on the effect of membrane surface patterning in improving overall membrane performance mazinani et al 45 visualizes the shear stress distribution of flat and patterned membranes and reported enhancement in the shear stress recorded by the latter the patterned membrane exhibited wall shear stress of 1 43 pa whereas the flat demonstrated 0 26 pa choi et al 54 also analyzes the hydrodynamics of the flat and patterned membrane in which the patterned membrane showed 5 fold higher shear stress compared to the flat membrane both studies attributed the improvement of the shear stress and the velocity demonstrated by the patterned membrane to the increased frictional force induced by its surface patterns that facilitate water transport as well as the detachment of the foulant from the membrane surface however we believed that the magnitude of improvement is restricted by the spatial variation of the impact for instance by referring to the data in figs 8 10 of this study points b and c favor the top side membrane while points a and d favor the bottom side membrane 3 4 energy consumption and practical implementation fig 11 demonstrates that the wavy membrane offers significant energy savings of up to 21 the specific energy consumption for the wavy flow channel is 0 015 kwh m3 while the straight flow channel is 0 019 kwh m3 the substantial energy saving is attributed to the improved hydraulic and fouling resistance performances induced by the wavy flow channels the earlier study also reported substantial improvement in energy saving attributed to the surface patterning role in enhancing hydraulic performance 26 the low energy input on the wavy system can be attributed to the increased frictional force inform of shear stress resulted in the higher resistance to axial flow in line with an earlier report 10 56 to overcome the shear the wavy flow system was run at a slightly higher crossflow velocity experimental data of the lab scale module suggest that the pressure drop due to additional shear exerted by longer flow path and swirling fluid flow was rather small the wavy flow channel had only a 7 higher pressure drop p d pa m than the straight flow channel however the energy associated with the additional mass flow was overcome by the higher permeability resulting in a more energy efficient system fig 11 the low specific energy consumption found in this study is mostly due to the application of very low pressure 0 2 bar and because they were counted only for pumping overall results indicate that the concept of patterning membrane surface via a novel flow channel modification offers enhanced performances to the hydrodynamic effect since both flat and wavy membrane exhibited the same membrane properties 13 moreover it can be easily applied to any established membrane since the modification is not on the membrane itself but the flow channel 17 it can also be simply scale up by redesigning the flow channel frame i e through 3d printing 57 the proposed module system to manipulate the flow property instead of direct imprinting surface pattern on a membrane material opens an attractive possibility for membrane process development since the challenge of membrane fouling experienced by membrane based technology was systematically managed the proposed concept can also be applied for multiple pressure driven membrane applications the energy consumption can future be lowered by applying ultra low pressure filtration system and engineering modification of a spacer in the flow channel as recently reported in other reports 58 59 4 conclusion this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a wavy flow channel in enhancing the filterability of a psf membrane for the treatment of oil water emulsion the wavy membrane formed by the flow channel alignment leads to an increase in effective membrane area by 34 as well as impose fouling control means fouling filtration of oil water emulsion shows a 58 overall increment in permeability in which 18 is due to flow properties the wavy flow channel promotes swirling flow that is believed to disturb boundary layers via fluid eddies to induces higher shear stress at the membrane walls the energy loss due to additional shear stress and longer flow path only contributes to a 7 pressure drop increment and shows no effect on specific energy consumption projection of the specific energy consumption using full scale module systems shows that the wavy membrane offers up to 21 energy saving 0 015 vs 0 019 kwh m3 this study opens a new avenue to enhance the membrane filtration performance by a simple modification of the module to allow swirling flow via a wavy flow path the system is believed to offer similar
