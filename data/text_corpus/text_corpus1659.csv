8295,study region the yeongsan river estuary the republic of korea is turbid and eutrophic under a temperate monsoon climate and has recently undergone weir impoundments in its freshwater zone study focus we conducted analyses to determine changes in the hydrology water quality and algal blooms caused by the impoundment in 2011 historical records 2004 2016 and sampling data collected along the freshwater channel zones over annual cycles from 2014 to 2015 were analyzed to identify these changes and their underlying mechanisms the kruskal wallis test mann whitney u test and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were employed for data analyses new hydrological insights for the region water levels increased after impoundment and the flow velocity significantly decreased while river discharge remained unchanged total suspended solids also significantly decreased an increase in water transparency combined with more stagnant and thermally stratified water flow during the warm seasons contributed to increases in the magnitude and frequency of algal blooms and dominance of cyanobacteria including potentially toxic species rather than diatoms seasonal peaks in turbidity and flow velocity during monsoon season which restricted algal blooms before impoundment were also sharply reduced this indicates that the impact of the impoundment on hydrology and harmful algal blooms can peak during monsoon season keywords dam weir construction harmful algal blooms habs hydrological change phytoplankton riverine ecosystem water quality 1 introduction engineered structures such as

as flow regime peñas and barquín 2019 tian et al 2019 impoundment can cause a shift from a riverine to a lacustrine habitat liro 2019 and modify communities of freshwater organisms including fungi plankton benthos and fish wu et al 2019 such effects are expected to increase along with demand for water resources and renewable energy associated with rapid human population growth and settlement in developing areas vörösmarty et al 2010 zarfl et al 2014 winemiller et al 2016 phytoplankton or microalgae living in the water column are primary producers that play a crucial role in the carbon c cycle and respond rapidly to anthropogenic and natural influences on the properties of aquatic systems schindler 1987 cloern and jassby 2012 in particular eutrophication caused by excess nutrient supply may trigger harmful algal blooms habs which cause water quality problems such as hypoxia diaz and rosenberg 2008 and release toxins that affect aquatic organisms harrison et al 2017 landsberg 2002 and threaten human public health due to consumption of the contaminated organisms horner et al 1997 nonetheless the effects of engineered structures on algal blooms in eutrophic water systems have rarely been reported wu et al 2019 clarifying algal taxonomic structure is essential for understanding such effects as the community structure can determine the composition of the food web in freshwater systems thompson and townsend 2000 changes in structure can also be utilized to identify changes in the chemical and physical properties of habitats caused by environmental changes as the algal response to environmental disturbance is reflected in their taxonomic structure particularly when the disturbance is anthropogenic such as damming and eutrophication li et al 2013 thackeray et al 2013 webber et al 2005 a shift in algal composition from diatoms to green algae due to damming has been documented in river systems humborg et al 1997 li et al 2013 the yeongsan river estuary 36 37 n 126 127 e is located in a temperate region and is a major riverine estuary in the republic of korea as industrialization and urbanization increase in the river basin large scale dams and weirs have been established in the river to reclaim tidal mudflats secure a stable water supply and mitigate flood and drought conditions a sea embankment was built 7 km from the river mouth in 1981 separating the freshwater and seawater zones and two weirs were built in 2011 in the upper river reaches of the freshwater zone fig 1 the estuary is in a monsoon climate region and receives the majority of its annual rainfall input from june to september e g 67 in 2018 and the hydrology and water quality of the freshwater zone can be influenced by heavy rainfall the freshwater zone is eutrophic and turbid particularly in the reservoir impounded by the sea embankment sin et al 2015 and algal growth is more likely limited by light than nutrient levels song et al 2010 hypoxia is frequently observed in the lower region of the freshwater zone during the warm season song et al 2015 in addition river areas near the weirs have recently experienced cyanobacterial blooms and elevated chlorophyll a concentrations malazarte et al 2017 shin et al 2015 however how impoundment behind engineered structures affects the water quality and algal community in the freshwater zone of the estuary remains unclear we expect that the magnitude and frequency of algal blooms are enhanced by an increase in light in the turbid river reaches as they shift from riverine to lacustrine conditions after weir impoundment we also expect that the presence of weirs intensify the dominance of cyanobacteria in the algal community as they are better able to survive in the stagnant water of lacustrine habitats than other taxa such as diatoms particularly during the high flow monsoon season we analyzed a 12 year long term dataset including the hydrology water quality algal biomass chlorophyll a and algal community taxonomic structure to examine how they changed with the construction of weirs in the freshwater zone and to identify the major mechanisms driving these changes this type of holistic comparison between pre damming and post damming algal communities using long term data has rarely been conducted e g domingues et al 2014 instead many studies have compared rivers with and without dams to evaluate the biological changes associated with dam construction wu et al 2019 we also investigated the seasonal and spatial variation in algal community structure and water properties over an annual cycle our results helped to clarify the dynamics of algal blooms and water quality associated with impoundment behind engineered structures in eutrophic freshwater systems and may lead to more sustainable management of such ecosystems which are threatened by increasing demand for freshwater resources and climate change at the global scale this study will also provide crucial information for water quality managers and policymakers in korea currently experiencing severe social conflicts over the continued use versus removal of weirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling

species identification we referred to hirose et al 1977 and komárek and anagnostidis 1998 2005 all species in the algal community were classified into four groups including chlorophyceae green algae cyanophyceae cyanobacteria bacillariophyceae diatoms and others to investigate the taxonomic composition before weir impoundment wi species data collected from november 2004 to august 2005 at station yg fig 1 near sw were analyzed zooplankton were collected from 20 to 50 l water samples filtered through a 60 μm net samples were preserved by adding 10 formalin 4 final concentration large zooplankton were counted using an inverted microscope at 25 to 50 magnification and smaller zooplankton were counted at 100 to 400 magnification identification was performed to the genus or species level referring to koste 1978 smirnov and timms 1983 and einsle 1993 2 4 historical water quality data collection and statistical analyses the korea ministry of environment kme has collected water quality data monthly or weekly for surface water at 14 stations along the main channel in the freshwater water zone of the yeongsan river estuary since 1989 monthly mean data collected at sts gj2 gs

oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss dissolved inorganic nitrogen din composed of ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and orthophosphate po4 3 to examine the effects of the wi historical data for the hydrology water quality and chl a were grouped into three periods before october 2004 september 2009 during october 2009 october 2011 and after november 2011 october 2016 wi construction discharge and water level data collected from april 2012 to october 2016 were used to represent the period before the wi inter annual monthly means and percentiles were calculated for these three periods to identify changes in seasonality and inter annual variability chl a levels monthly mean were categorized into four groups 20 20 49 50 100 and 100 μg l 1 the frequency and descriptive statistics of properties related to light availability solar radiation and tss and water temperature were analyzed separately for each group to investigate the frequency of potential algal blooms and the means and ranges of the properties associated with the potential algal blooms potential algal blooms were defined under circumstances in which the chl a level exceeded 50 μg l 1 and was maintained at this level for more than 2 consecutive weeks the level of potential algal blooms was selected based on the highest seasonal means observed during spring from march to may before the wi historical data were compared using the kruskal wallis test and mann whitney u test α 0 05 using pasw statistics 26 software spss simultaneous interactions between the algal community and water properties were examined using a multivariate statistical tool non metric multidimensional scaling nmds in primer ver 6 vectors of the water properties representing the direction of greatest increase were superimposed on the nmds results the length of each vector indicated the magnitude of the correlation between that water property and algal species groups bio env analyses were also performed to identify the major factors controlling the observed variation 3 results 3 1 hydrological meteorological variables water levels in the impounded areas at stations sg and yg upstream of sw and cw respectively significantly differed among sampling dates before during and after the wi p 0 001 increasing rapidly after the wi table 1 the discharge was not significantly different although the maximum values decreased sharply at stations sg and yg by contrast flow velocity significantly differed among periods p 0 001 decreasing rapidly after wi a significant difference in water level p 0 001 was observed among periods at station hp downstream of cw with a slight increase after wi a relatively low flow velocity 3 27 10 2 m s 1 was recorded at hp after wi rainfall solar radiation and duration of sunshine did not significantly differ p 0 5 among periods relative to wi table 1 seasonally rainfall was high during the warm season in particular july to september had 727 60 mm representing 54 of the annual rainfall of 1 357 7 mm and well above the monthly mean of 113 14 mm fig 2 a this seasonality indicates that the study area is under the influence of a monsoon climate discharge through the sluice gates of weirs showed similar temporal variation as rainfall solar radiation was high during the spring particularly in may 2014 when it reached 700 91 mj m 2 and the duration of sunshine showed a similar pattern with a peak 434 60 h in may fig 2b 3 2 physiochemical and biological variables including phytoplankton and zooplankton 3 2 1 historical data the temperatures of surface water at stations gs in front of sw and at ysp and hp which are upstream and downstream of cw respectively did not significantly differ p 0 1 among the periods of before during and after wi table 2 by contrast tss was significantly different p 0 001 among the periods at those stations it significantly decreased after wi at station gs whereas it increased slightly at station hp cod increased p 0 05 but the bod cod ratio significantly decreased p 0 01 data not shown after wi nutrients particularly po4 3 significantly decreased p 0 001 after wi algal biomass chl a concentration was significantly different among periods at all stations increasing significantly at stations gs and ysp table 2 the seasonality of tss and flow velocity with increases during the warm season nearly disappeared at stations gs and ysp after wi fig 3 tss showed no apparent seasonality at station hp while water level increased during the warm season flow velocity at hp showed a similar pattern to that at ysp after wi the inter annual variability of flow velocity decreased greatly after wi at all stations before wi chl a levels at stations gs and ysp varied seasonally with spring peaks of algal biomass occurring until june and then decreasing biomass during the wet monsoon season from july to september stronger spring peaks developed and chl a during the monsoon season increased after wi similar seasonality was observed at station hp before wi and additional winter peaks were observed at that site after wi the frequency n of algal biomass with chl a levels above 20 μg l 1 doubled whereas that of algal biomass with chl a levels below 20 μg l 1 decreased greatly in the river after wi table 3 the yeongsan river experienced more frequent algal blooms potential with chl a levels above 50 μg l 1 compared with before wi the means of water temperature solar radiation and tss for all groups were lower after wi than before except for tss in the group of chl a 100 μg l 1 3 2 2 sampling data analyses surface water temperature showed a typical seasonal pattern for the temperate climate zone high in summer and low in winter fig 4 a among the sampling stations temperature was generally highest at station i and decreased downstream the temperature difference between the surface and bottom water δt increased during the warm season and decreased during the cold season fig 4b vertical inversion of water temperature developed during the cold season particularly in november 2014 in general turbidity was high during the wet season and relatively low at station i increasing downstream fig 4c mean par in the mixed layers showed no clear seasonality but had a negative relationship with turbidity in temporal and spatial variations fig 4d concentrations of nitrite nitrate no2 no3 peaked in winter and maintained high levels during the warm season fig 5 a the ammonium nh4 concentration was high during the dry season spring and winter in upper reaches particularly st i and decreased downstream fig 5b dissolved silica levels were high during the wet season and decreased downstream fig 5c and a similar pattern was observed for orthophosphate po4 3 fig 5d algal biomass represented by the chl a level generally peaked in spring or summer and again in winter fig 6 a a chl a level higher than 100 μg l 1 was recorded slightly before may june 2014 the wet season at station i a chl a level higher than 90 μg l 1 was observed in june 2014 and february 2015 respectively at station iii chl a levels were lower at station iv than other stations total algal abundance was higher in upper reaches than in lower regions and was higher during the warm season than the cold season fig 6b this variation was mainly explained by the spatial and seasonal variation in green algae and cyanobacteria both of which were abundant during the warm season in the upper reaches fig 6c 6d their abundances in the impounded areas decreased in july and august when discharge from the weirs was high diatoms showed small scale peaks during the warm season then began to increase in fall and reached their peak during winter fig 6e they were generally more abundant at lower stations than upper sites except in november 2014 zooplankton abundance was generally higher during the warm season than the cold season in line with total algal abundance fig 6f zooplankton generally increased downstream except in june and september 2014 the species data collected at st sg prior to wi between november 2004 and august 2005 fig 6g indicate that diatoms were highly dominant 95 in the taxonomic groups during the cold season in contrast green algae were dominant 41 76 during the warm season cyanobacteria appeared only during the warm season at a low percentage 17 the taxonomic composition recorded at st i between may 2014 and april 2015 fig 6h shows that the dominance of diatoms generally decreased significantly p 0 05 in all seasons compared with their levels before wi by contrast cyanobacteria were observed during all seasons and their dominance increased significantly p 0 01 after wi particularly during the warm season 57 88 green algae were occasionally dominant in may 88 and october 2014 64 but their dominance during the warm season also decreased 29 3 2 3 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses nmds analyses showed that the algal community differed among seasons and locations fig 7 the algal community in the river had greater similarity in winter except december than other seasons the highest dissimilarity of the algal community was observed between winter and summer spatially dissimilarity was generally greatest between stations i and iv and was greater during the warm season the vectors of water properties indicate that variation in the algal community could be explained primarily by changes in surface water temperature fri δt kd and zooplankton abundance temperature and photosynthetic efficiency with opposite effects were mainly responsible for seasonal differences in the algal community whereas properties related to light availability such as kd and δt were responsible for the spatial pattern the results of bio env analyses showed that temperature δt and zooplankton accounted for 60 of variation in the taxonomic structure data not shown 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological and water quality changes associated with weir construction the water flow regime is one of the most crucial hydrologic variables in river systems referred to as the master variable power et al 1995 because the temporal and spatial variability of natural water flow determines the integrity of river ecosystems through effects on physical and biogeochemical processes poff et al 1997 naiman et al 2008 in this context damming of river channels with engineered structures can extensively impact river ecosystems by affecting the hydrological regime magilligan and nislow 2005 in this study the flow regime was evaluated based on water discharge magnitude of the flow regime and flow velocity after wi flow velocities in the impounded reaches significantly decreased by 8 and 6 times corresponding to 8 and 6 times longer hrt than that before wi the seasonality of velocity weakened with high values during the wet season and low values during the dry season and the velocity during the monsoon season sharply decreased in the impounded reaches after wi fig 3 this change was a result of about a 3 fold increase in water levels in the impounded reaches and suggests that sites upstream of the weirs turned from riverine lotic to lacustrine lentic habitats that experience stagnant or standing water flow in all seasons after damming a slight increase in the mean water level 0 17 m p 0 001 at hp suggests that flow velocity decreased slightly in the area downstream of cw this is in line with previous studies ogpc office of government policy coordination 2014 deng et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in addition the thermal structure of the water column may also be altered in impounded riverine systems baxter 1977 thermal stratification was frequently observed during the warm season upstream of the weirs fig 4 probably due to the development of stagnant deep water and increases in solar radiation and air temperature habitat transformation was also supported by variation in tss and turbidity in the yeongsan river the concentrations of tss significantly decreased upstream of the sw after wi table 3 and their seasonality observed prior to wi with high levels during the wet season and low levels during the dry season disappeared in the impounded reaches fig 3 no seasonal peaks of turbidity except for july at station ii were observed in the reaches fig 4c furthermore their inter annual variability was reduced particularly during the monsoon season compared with that before wi similar to that of flow velocity the observed decrease in turbidity is likely due to sinking of suspended materials to the bottom of stagnant water see baxter 1977 which eventually results in a clearer water column this anthropogenic effect on turbidity and sediment dynamics associated with damming has been reported in other altered systems syvitski et al 2005 fan et al 2015 tang et al 2016 cod an index of water quality in aquatic systems significantly increased table 2 and the bod cod ratio significantly decreased p 0 01 in areas upstream and downstream of the weirs after wi this difference indicates that water quality suffered and the non biodegradable fraction of organic matter in the river increased after wi a possible reason for this observation is that organic matter was trapped and non biodegradable organic compounds resistant to microbial breakdown accumulated in the stagnant water upstream of the weirs the retention of organic matter in impounded waters has been observed worldwide in other freshwater systems maavara et al 2017 din decreased but not significantly in areas both upstream and downstream of the weirs whereas po4 3 significantly decreased to levels 4 times lower than before impoundment table 3 this result was unexpected as nutrients generally increase in water impounded by dams due to nutrient retention maavara et al 2015 donald et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the observed reduction of nutrients in particular po4 3 is probably related to improved treatment methods at the municipal sewage treatment plant that were implemented concomitantly with wi nutrient levels in the yeongsan river are primarily affected by the discharge of treated water from the municipal sewage plant shin et al 2015 uptake of nutrients by the phytoplankton population which increased after wi may have also contributed to the reduction in nutrients 4 2 effects of weir impoundment on algal dynamics and monsoon variation the magnitude of algal blooms based on chl a concentration and abundance in the waters upstream of weirs increased greatly and during all seasons compared with their levels before wi tables 2 and 3 figs 3 and 6 the frequency of potential algal blooms 50 μg l 1 chl a also increased after wi table 3 these results suggest that the magnitude and frequency of potential algal blooms significantly increased in the river after wi particularly in the impounded reaches this change was possible because the riverine reaches became lacustrine habitats with more stagnant clear and stratified water columns that are more favorable to algal growth in some species higher algal biomass was recorded despite the lower intensity of solar radiation and water temperature compared with those before wi table 3 this suggested that algal growth due to higher light availability was increased after wi in turbid regions of the yeongsan river increases in algal biomass and abundance have been observed in other freshwater systems impounded with dams and increases in hrt or transparency of impounded water have been suggested as major mechanisms driving those changes nogueira et al 2010 li et al 2013 a significant change in the dominant algal taxonomic structure from diatoms p 0 01 and green algae to cyanobacteria p 0 05 especially during the summer was also observed upstream of the sw fig 6g and 6h after wi concomitant with the increases in biomass and abundance this suggests that the impounded reaches of the yeongsan river became more favorable to cyanobacteria than to other algal groups after damming this taxonomic change may impact the composition and function of the yeongsan river food web long term as zooplankton abundance was closely correlated with algal taxonomic variation fig 7 and was positively related to the chl a level in the river p 0 05 cyanobacteria are regarded as low quality food for zooplankton ger et al 2016 due to the features of some species such as colonial and filamentous morphology a lack of lipids and release of toxins a shift from the dominance of diatoms to that of cyanobacteria li et al 2013 liu et al 2015 or green algae fan et al 2015 associated with damming has also been observed in other river systems monsoon hydrology is vital to controlling water quality and algal dynamics in temperate freshwater systems in areas of monsoon climate lee et al 2010 huang et al 2014 yuan et al 2017 in the yeongsan river rainfall intensity from june to september averaging 66 of the annual total between 1995 and 2004 was negatively correlated with nutrient levels but positively correlated with tss kang and an 2006 this pattern indicates that rainfall can dilute nutrients and increase turbidity and that the high flushing rate during the monsoon season thereby suppresses algal blooms however the monsoon effect on algal blooms is expected to weaken due to nutrient and tss trapping and reduced flushing and mixing in the impounded water upstream of the dams this expectation is supported by the abrupt decreases in tss and flow velocity as well as their inter annual variabilities and the increases in the magnitude and frequency of potential algal blooms during the monsoon season particularly those observed in july and august fig 3 algal taxonomic structure also responded to the change in pelagic habitat resulting from the diminished monsoon effect cyanobacteria that were a minor part of the community before wi formed blooms during the monsoon season reaching 71 of algal abundance in june and september 2014 in the impounded reaches fig 6 and potentially toxic cyanobacteria such as microcystis sp flourished during those blooms malazarte et al 2017 cyanobacteria continued to be dominant 57 and 60 respectively in the algal community despite decreasing abundance in july and august this shift was likely due to reduced flushing or mixing effects and improved light availability during the monsoon season which were associated with wi however the sudden decrease in cyanobacterial blooms observed in july and august during peak discharge from the sw indicates that cyanobacterial blooms near the weirs may be mitigated by regulation of the discharge through the sluice gates c f mitrovic and hardwick 2011 in general cyanobacterial dominance in freshwater systems is driven mainly by nutrients and temperature rigosi et al 2014 as well as residence time cha et al 2017 buoyancy regulation by cyanobacteria in response to the light regime walsby and booker 1980 may favor their dominance over other taxonomic groups in the stable pelagic habitat the results of field sampling in this study showed that cyanobacteria did not exceed 50 103 cells ml 1 when the monthly mean flow velocity was higher than 6 10 2 m s 1 the level of cyanobacteria also did not exceed this value when the water temperature was lower than 23 c in the impounded reaches indicating that the stability and temperature of the water are important for cyanobacterial accumulation the algal response in terms of both biomass and taxonomic structure to the change in monsoon effects in the yeongsan river suggests that the impact of damming on algal dynamics including habs is enhanced in river systems with a monsoon climate due to weakening of the effects of monsoon hydrology the yeongsan river was known to be turbid and eutrophic and therefore light availability was more important to algal blooms than nutrients song et al 2010 this pattern may have changed since wi as the large increase in light availability caused by damming spurs algal growth in the river although levels of nutrients particularly po4 3 have significantly decreased recently the trophic state has remained hypereutrophic based on the criteria of nürnberg 1996 and is sufficient to support algal growth our multivariate nmds and bio env statistical analyses indicated that water temperature and thermal stratification may be the most important factors driving variation in algal groups after damming this finding suggests that the importance of water temperature to algal dynamics may be reinforced in temperate freshwater systems affected by engineered structures and that such systems may be susceptible to temperature increases due to global warming however this study is based on an analysis of pre existing and annual sampling data only and further studies such as mesocosm experiments and ecological modeling analysis at the ecosystem level are required to better understand the long term effects of impounding and the underlying mechanisms 5 conclusions water levels increased after wi and flow velocity significantly decreased sharply increasing hydraulic residence time in the impounded reaches tss levels turbidity also significantly decreased increasing the light available to microalgae and spurring their growth the increase in light combined with more stagnant and thermally stratified more lentic water conditions compared with those before wi likely contributed to increases in the frequency and magnitude of potential algal blooms and the shift in dominance to cyanobacteria from diatoms in the turbid eutrophic system seasonal peaks and inter annual variabilities in turbidity and flow velocity decreased particularly during the monsoon season indicating that the effects of monsoon rainfall suppressing algal blooms by elevating turbidity and flushing was minimized after wi this implies that the impact of the shift from a lotic to a lentic ecosystem on algal dynamics including those of habs and then on the food web via a bottom up effect may be more serious in monsoon river systems than in other climate zones our results contribute to a better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic modifications due to the impounding on monsoon river systems further studies at the ecosystem level are required and can lead to improved management of water quality and habs in freshwater systems where weirs were

8295,study region the yeongsan river estuary the republic of korea is turbid and eutrophic under a temperate monsoon climate and has recently undergone weir impoundments in its freshwater zone study focus we conducted analyses to determine changes in the hydrology water quality and algal blooms caused by the impoundment in 2011 historical records 2004 2016 and sampling data collected along the freshwater channel zones over annual cycles from 2014 to 2015 were analyzed to identify these changes and their underlying mechanisms the kruskal wallis test mann whitney u test and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were employed for data analyses new hydrological insights for the region water levels increased after impoundment and the flow velocity significantly decreased while river discharge remained unchanged total suspended solids also significantly decreased an increase in water transparency combined with more stagnant and thermally stratified water flow during the warm

freshwater systems thompson and townsend 2000 changes in structure can also be utilized to identify changes in the chemical and physical properties of habitats caused by environmental changes as the algal response to environmental disturbance is reflected in their taxonomic structure particularly when the disturbance is anthropogenic such as damming and eutrophication li et al 2013 thackeray et al 2013 webber et al 2005 a shift in algal composition from diatoms to green algae due to damming has been documented in river systems humborg et al 1997 li et al 2013 the yeongsan river estuary 36 37 n 126 127 e is located in a temperate region and is a major riverine estuary in the republic of korea as industrialization and urbanization increase in the river basin large scale dams and weirs have been established in the river to reclaim tidal mudflats secure a stable water supply and mitigate flood and drought conditions a sea embankment was built 7 km from the river mouth in 1981 separating the freshwater and seawater zones and two weirs were built in 2011 in the upper river reaches of the freshwater zone fig 1 the estuary is in a monsoon climate region and receives the majority of its annual rainfall input from june to september e g 67 in 2018 and the hydrology and water quality of the freshwater zone can be influenced by heavy rainfall the freshwater zone is eutrophic and turbid particularly in the reservoir impounded by the sea embankment sin et al 2015 and algal growth is more likely limited by light than nutrient levels song et al 2010 hypoxia is frequently observed in the lower region of the freshwater zone during the warm season song et al 2015 in addition river areas near the weirs have recently experienced cyanobacterial blooms and elevated chlorophyll a concentrations malazarte et al 2017 shin et al 2015 however how impoundment behind engineered structures affects the water quality and algal community in the freshwater zone of the estuary remains unclear we expect that the magnitude and frequency of algal blooms are enhanced by an increase in light in the turbid river reaches as they shift from riverine to lacustrine conditions after weir impoundment we also expect that the presence of weirs intensify the dominance of cyanobacteria in the algal community as they are better able to survive in the stagnant water of lacustrine habitats than other taxa such as diatoms particularly during the high flow monsoon season we analyzed a 12 year long term dataset including the hydrology water quality algal biomass chlorophyll a and algal community taxonomic structure to examine how they changed with the construction of weirs in the freshwater zone and to identify the major mechanisms driving these changes this type of holistic comparison between pre damming and post damming algal communities using long term data has rarely been conducted e g domingues et al 2014 instead many studies have compared rivers with and without dams to evaluate the biological changes associated with dam construction wu et al 2019 we also investigated the seasonal and spatial variation in algal community structure and water properties over an annual cycle our results helped to clarify the dynamics of algal blooms and water quality associated with impoundment behind engineered structures in eutrophic freshwater systems and may lead to more sustainable management of such ecosystems which are threatened by increasing demand for freshwater resources and climate change at the global scale this study will also provide crucial information for water quality managers and policymakers in korea currently experiencing severe social conflicts over the continued use versus removal of weirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling

hydrology water quality and chl a were grouped into three periods before october 2004 september 2009 during october 2009 october 2011 and after november 2011 october 2016 wi construction discharge and water level data collected from april 2012 to october 2016 were used to represent the period before the wi inter annual monthly means and percentiles were calculated for these three periods to

ranges of the properties associated with the potential algal blooms potential algal blooms were defined under circumstances in which the chl a level exceeded 50 μg l 1 and was maintained at this level for more than 2 consecutive weeks the level of potential algal blooms was selected based on the highest seasonal means observed during spring from march to may before the wi historical data were

factors controlling the observed variation 3 results 3 1 hydrological meteorological variables water levels in the impounded areas at stations sg and yg upstream of sw and cw respectively significantly differed among sampling dates before during and after the wi p 0 001 increasing rapidly after the wi table 1 the discharge was not significantly different although the maximum values decreased sharply at stations sg and yg by contrast flow velocity significantly differed among periods p 0 001 decreasing rapidly after wi a significant difference in water level p 0 001 was observed among periods at station hp downstream of cw with a slight increase after wi a relatively low flow velocity 3 27 10 2 m s 1 was recorded at hp after wi rainfall solar radiation and duration of sunshine did not significantly differ p 0 5 among periods relative to wi table 1 seasonally rainfall was high during the warm season in particular july to september had 727 60 mm representing 54 of the annual rainfall of 1 357 7 mm and well above the monthly mean of 113 14 mm fig 2 a this seasonality indicates that the study area is under the influence of a monsoon climate discharge through the sluice gates of weirs showed similar temporal variation as rainfall solar radiation was high during the spring particularly in may 2014 when it reached 700 91 mj m 2 and the duration of sunshine showed a similar pattern with a peak 434 60 h in may fig 2b 3 2 physiochemical and biological variables including phytoplankton and zooplankton 3 2 1 historical data the temperatures of surface water

contrast tss was significantly different p 0 001 among the periods at those stations it significantly decreased after wi at station gs whereas it increased slightly at station hp cod increased p 0 05 but the bod cod ratio significantly decreased p 0 01 data not shown after wi nutrients particularly po4 3 significantly decreased p 0 001 after wi algal biomass chl a concentration was significantly different among periods at all stations increasing significantly at stations gs and ysp table 2 the seasonality of tss and flow velocity with increases during the warm season nearly disappeared at stations gs and ysp after wi fig 3 tss showed no apparent seasonality at station hp while water level increased during the warm season flow velocity at hp showed a similar pattern to that at ysp after wi the inter annual variability of flow velocity decreased greatly after wi at all stations before wi chl a levels at stations gs and ysp varied seasonally with spring peaks of algal biomass occurring until june and then decreasing biomass during the wet monsoon season from july to september stronger spring peaks developed and chl a during the monsoon season increased after wi similar seasonality was observed at station hp before wi and additional winter peaks were observed at that site after wi the frequency n of algal biomass with chl a levels above 20 μg l 1 doubled whereas that of algal biomass with chl a levels below 20 μg l 1 decreased greatly in the river after wi table 3 the yeongsan river experienced more frequent algal blooms potential with chl a levels above 50 μg l 1 compared with before wi the means of water temperature solar radiation and tss for all groups were lower after wi than before except for tss in the group of chl a 100 μg l 1 3 2 2 sampling data analyses surface water temperature showed a typical seasonal pattern for the temperate climate zone high in summer and low in winter fig 4 a among the sampling stations temperature was generally highest at station i and decreased downstream the temperature difference between the surface and bottom water δt increased during the warm season and decreased during the cold season fig 4b vertical inversion of water temperature developed during the cold season particularly in november 2014 in general turbidity was high during the wet season and relatively low at station i increasing downstream fig 4c mean par in the mixed layers showed no clear seasonality but had a negative relationship with turbidity in temporal and spatial variations fig 4d concentrations of nitrite nitrate no2 no3 peaked in winter and maintained high levels during the warm season fig 5 a the ammonium nh4 concentration was high during the dry season spring and winter in upper reaches particularly st i and decreased downstream fig 5b dissolved silica levels were high during the wet season and decreased downstream fig 5c and a similar pattern was observed for orthophosphate po4 3 fig 5d algal biomass represented by the chl a level generally peaked in spring or summer and again in winter fig 6 a a chl a level higher than 100 μg l 1 was recorded slightly before may june 2014 the wet season at station i a chl a level higher than 90 μg l 1 was observed in june 2014 and february 2015 respectively at station iii chl a levels were lower at station iv than other stations total algal abundance was higher in upper reaches than in lower regions and was higher during the warm season than the cold season fig 6b this variation was mainly explained by the spatial and seasonal variation in green algae and cyanobacteria both of which were abundant during the warm season in the upper reaches fig 6c 6d their abundances in the impounded areas decreased in july and august when discharge from the weirs was high diatoms showed small scale peaks during the warm season then began to increase in fall and reached their peak during winter fig 6e they were generally more abundant at lower stations than upper sites except in november 2014 zooplankton abundance was generally higher during the warm season than the cold season in line with total algal abundance fig 6f zooplankton generally increased downstream except in june and september 2014 the species data collected at st sg prior to wi between november 2004 and august 2005 fig 6g indicate that diatoms were highly dominant 95 in the taxonomic groups during the cold season in contrast green algae were dominant 41 76 during the warm season cyanobacteria appeared only during the warm season at a low percentage 17 the taxonomic composition recorded at st i between may 2014 and april 2015 fig 6h shows that the dominance of diatoms generally decreased significantly p 0 05 in all seasons compared with their levels before wi by contrast cyanobacteria were observed during all seasons and their dominance increased significantly p 0 01 after wi particularly during the warm season 57 88 green algae were occasionally dominant in may 88 and october 2014 64 but their dominance during the warm season also decreased 29 3 2 3 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses nmds analyses showed that the algal community differed among seasons and locations fig 7 the algal community in the river had greater similarity in winter except december than other seasons the highest dissimilarity of the algal community was observed between winter and summer spatially dissimilarity was generally greatest between stations i and iv and was greater during the warm season the vectors of water properties indicate that variation in the algal community could be explained primarily by changes in surface water temperature fri δt kd and zooplankton abundance temperature and photosynthetic efficiency with opposite effects were mainly responsible for seasonal differences in the algal community whereas properties related to light availability such as kd and δt were responsible for the spatial pattern the results of bio env analyses showed that temperature δt and zooplankton accounted for 60 of variation in the taxonomic structure data not shown 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological and water quality changes associated with weir construction the water flow regime is one of the most crucial hydrologic variables in river systems referred to as the master variable power et al 1995 because the temporal and spatial variability of natural water flow determines the integrity of river ecosystems through effects on physical and biogeochemical processes poff et al 1997 naiman et al 2008 in this context damming of river channels with engineered structures can extensively impact river ecosystems by affecting the hydrological regime magilligan and nislow 2005 in this study the flow regime was evaluated based on water discharge magnitude of the flow regime and flow velocity after wi flow velocities in the impounded reaches significantly decreased by 8 and 6 times corresponding to 8 and 6 times longer hrt than that before wi the seasonality of velocity weakened with high values during the wet season and low values during the dry season and the velocity during the monsoon season sharply decreased in the impounded reaches after wi fig 3 this change was a result of about a 3 fold increase in water levels in the impounded reaches and suggests that sites upstream of the weirs turned from riverine lotic to lacustrine lentic habitats that experience stagnant or standing water flow in all seasons after damming a slight increase in the mean water level 0 17 m p 0 001 at hp suggests that flow velocity decreased slightly in the area downstream of cw this is in line with previous studies ogpc office of government policy coordination 2014 deng et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in addition the thermal structure of the water column may also be altered in impounded riverine systems baxter 1977 thermal stratification was frequently observed during the warm season upstream of the weirs fig 4 probably due to the development of stagnant deep water and increases in solar radiation and air temperature habitat transformation was also supported by variation in tss and turbidity in the yeongsan river the concentrations of tss significantly decreased upstream of the sw after wi table 3 and their seasonality observed prior to wi with high levels during the wet season and low levels during the dry season disappeared in the impounded reaches fig 3 no seasonal peaks of turbidity except for july at station ii were observed in the reaches fig 4c furthermore their inter annual variability was reduced particularly during the monsoon season compared with that before wi similar to that of flow velocity the observed decrease in turbidity is likely due to sinking of suspended materials to the bottom of stagnant water see baxter 1977 which eventually results in a clearer water column this anthropogenic effect on turbidity and sediment dynamics associated with damming has been reported in other altered systems syvitski et al 2005 fan et al 2015 tang et al 2016 cod an index of water quality in aquatic systems significantly increased table 2 and the bod cod ratio significantly decreased p 0 01 in areas upstream and downstream of the weirs after wi this difference indicates that water quality suffered and the non biodegradable fraction of organic matter in the river increased after wi a possible reason for this observation is that organic matter was trapped and non biodegradable organic compounds resistant to microbial breakdown accumulated in the stagnant water upstream of the weirs the retention of organic matter in impounded waters has been observed worldwide in other freshwater systems maavara et al 2017 din decreased but not significantly in areas both upstream and downstream of the weirs whereas po4 3 significantly decreased to levels 4 times lower than before impoundment table 3 this result was unexpected as nutrients generally increase in water impounded by dams due to nutrient retention maavara et al 2015 donald et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the observed reduction of nutrients in particular po4 3 is probably related to improved treatment methods at the municipal sewage treatment plant that were implemented concomitantly with wi nutrient levels in the yeongsan river are primarily affected by the discharge of treated water from the municipal sewage plant shin et al 2015 uptake of nutrients by the phytoplankton population which increased after wi may have also contributed to the reduction in nutrients 4 2 effects of weir impoundment on algal dynamics and monsoon variation the magnitude of algal blooms based on chl a concentration and abundance in the waters upstream of weirs increased greatly and during all seasons compared with their levels before wi tables 2 and 3 figs 3 and 6 the frequency of potential algal blooms 50 μg l 1 chl a also increased after wi table 3 these results suggest that the magnitude and frequency of potential algal blooms significantly increased in the river after wi particularly in the impounded reaches this change was possible because the riverine reaches became lacustrine habitats with more stagnant clear and stratified water columns that are more favorable to algal growth in some species higher algal biomass was recorded despite the lower intensity of solar radiation and water temperature compared with those before wi table 3 this suggested that algal growth due to higher light availability was increased after wi in turbid regions of the yeongsan river increases in algal biomass and abundance have been observed in other freshwater systems impounded with dams and increases in hrt or transparency of impounded water have been suggested as major mechanisms driving those changes nogueira et al 2010 li et al 2013 a significant change in the dominant algal taxonomic structure from diatoms p 0 01 and green algae to cyanobacteria p 0 05 especially during the summer was also observed upstream of the sw fig 6g and 6h after wi concomitant with the increases in biomass and abundance this suggests that the impounded reaches of the yeongsan river became more favorable to cyanobacteria than to other algal groups after damming this taxonomic change may impact the composition and function of the yeongsan river food web long term as zooplankton abundance was closely correlated with algal taxonomic variation fig 7 and was positively related to the chl a level in the river p 0 05 cyanobacteria are regarded as low quality food for zooplankton ger et al 2016 due to the features of some species such as colonial and filamentous morphology a lack of lipids and release of toxins a shift from the dominance of diatoms to that of cyanobacteria li et al 2013 liu et al 2015 or green algae fan et al 2015 associated with damming has also been observed in other river systems monsoon hydrology is vital to controlling water quality and algal dynamics in temperate freshwater systems in areas of monsoon climate lee et al 2010 huang et al 2014 yuan et al 2017 in the yeongsan river rainfall intensity from june to september averaging 66 of the annual total between 1995 and 2004 was negatively correlated with nutrient levels but positively correlated with tss kang and an 2006 this pattern indicates that rainfall can dilute nutrients and increase turbidity and that the high flushing rate during the monsoon season thereby suppresses algal blooms however the monsoon effect on algal blooms is expected to weaken due to nutrient and tss trapping and reduced flushing and mixing in the impounded water upstream of the dams this expectation is supported by the abrupt decreases in tss and flow velocity as well as their inter annual variabilities and the increases in the magnitude and frequency of potential algal blooms during the monsoon season particularly those observed in july and august fig 3 algal taxonomic structure also responded to the change in pelagic habitat resulting from the diminished monsoon effect cyanobacteria that were a minor part of the community before wi formed blooms during the monsoon season reaching 71 of algal abundance in june and september 2014 in the impounded reaches fig 6 and potentially toxic cyanobacteria such as microcystis sp flourished during those blooms malazarte et al 2017 cyanobacteria continued to be dominant 57 and 60 respectively in the algal community despite decreasing abundance in july and august this shift was likely due to reduced flushing or mixing effects and improved light availability during the monsoon season which were associated with wi however the sudden decrease in cyanobacterial blooms observed in july and august during peak discharge from the sw indicates that cyanobacterial blooms near the weirs may be mitigated by regulation of the discharge through the sluice gates c f mitrovic and hardwick 2011 in general cyanobacterial dominance in freshwater systems is driven mainly by nutrients and temperature rigosi et al 2014 as well as residence time cha et al 2017 buoyancy regulation by cyanobacteria in response to the light regime walsby and booker 1980 may favor their dominance over other taxonomic groups in the stable pelagic habitat the results of field sampling in this study showed that cyanobacteria did not exceed 50 103 cells ml 1 when the monthly mean flow velocity was higher than 6 10 2 m s 1 the level of cyanobacteria also did not exceed this value when the water temperature was lower than 23 c in the impounded reaches indicating that the stability and temperature of the water are important for cyanobacterial accumulation the algal response in terms of both biomass and taxonomic structure to the change in monsoon effects in the yeongsan river suggests that the impact of damming on algal dynamics including habs is enhanced in river systems with a monsoon climate due to weakening of the effects of monsoon hydrology the yeongsan river was known to be turbid and eutrophic and therefore light availability was more important to algal blooms than nutrients song et al 2010 this pattern may have changed since wi as the large increase in light availability caused by damming spurs algal growth in the river although levels of nutrients particularly po4 3 have significantly decreased recently the trophic state has remained hypereutrophic based on the criteria of nürnberg 1996 and is sufficient to support algal growth our multivariate nmds and bio env statistical analyses indicated that water temperature and thermal stratification may be the most important factors driving variation in algal groups after damming this finding suggests that the importance of water temperature to algal dynamics may be reinforced in temperate freshwater systems affected by engineered structures and that such systems may be susceptible to temperature increases due to global warming however this study is based on an analysis of pre existing and annual sampling data only and further studies such as mesocosm experiments and ecological modeling analysis at the ecosystem level are required to better understand the long term effects of impounding and the underlying mechanisms 5 conclusions water levels increased after wi and flow velocity significantly decreased sharply increasing hydraulic residence time in the impounded reaches tss levels turbidity also significantly decreased increasing the light available to microalgae and spurring their growth the increase in light combined with more stagnant and thermally stratified more lentic water conditions compared with those before wi likely contributed to increases in the frequency and magnitude of potential algal blooms and the shift in dominance to cyanobacteria from diatoms in the turbid eutrophic system seasonal peaks and inter annual variabilities in turbidity and flow velocity decreased particularly during the monsoon season indicating that the effects of monsoon rainfall suppressing algal blooms by elevating turbidity and flushing was minimized after wi this implies that the impact of the shift from a lotic to a lentic ecosystem on algal dynamics including those of habs and then on the food web via a bottom up effect may be more serious in monsoon river systems than in other climate zones our results contribute to a better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic modifications due to the impounding on monsoon river systems further studies at the ecosystem level are required and can lead to improved management of water quality and habs in freshwater systems where weirs were

naples and northern campania region total habitants about 3 8 million became huge after the postwar period in addition to the historical source points water resources of maggiore and matese mts fig 1b were exploited causing discontent among farmers and industrialists thus casmez agency cassa per il mezzogiorno development fund for the south of italy financed the wcw western campania waterworks by

equipped with 19 water wells drilled inside the tunnel water wells modulate the water abstraction in function of the water demand in venafro city t2 tunnel drainage is equipped with lateral sluice gates that control the outflow rate fig 2 wcw exploits additional aquifers southward out of the investigated area sammucro and venafro drainage systems intercept the groundwater at higher elevation with respect to natural springs to limit operational costs from the managerial prospective this approach was preferred to balancing the high fee of gw waterworks table 2 which requires lifting the water up to tlp trocchio lifting point to overcome the hydraulic head between gw and tlp a flow rate of 1 m3 s of water requires a power of 1450 kw roughly corresponding to 0 7 million euro per year waterworks characteristics of wcw are summarized in table 2 2 3 numerical features 2 3 1 steady state conditions geological and hydrogeological information as the wcw concession flow rate has been imported in a modflow groundwater model and elaborated with a gms graphic interface the model is solved in steady state and transient conditions and solutions are obtained via an nwt upw configuration newton solver upstream weighting that allows better convergences for mountainous areas niswonger et al 2011 the domain consists of a single layer discretized via 8562 square cells with a side length of 200 m the top elevation model is imported from a strm dem resolution of 30 m the bottom elevation is set at 400 m a s l whereas groundwater flow is essentially null lancia et al 2018 the model is simplified considering the vertical lithological contacts a no flow boundary is set aside at the bottom as vma is an independent carbonate aquifer saroli et al 2019 an imposed recharge flow rch package constrains the domain top and simulates the infiltration from rainfall the model takes advantage of the unsaturated zone flow uzf package ordinally applied to simulate unsaturated zone flow above the water table neglecting the aquifer s unsaturated zone properties the package allows simulating saturation excess and spring flow rate model as already applied for fens feinstein et al 2019 and urban watersheds lancia et al 2019 the method is a valid alternative to blanketing the model with land surface drains or other sink packages main springs and streambeds are represented as drains drn package that allow groundwater flowing out from the domain as overpressure occurs fig 3 b initial drain conductances were estimated from field surveys lancia et al 2018 saroli et al 2019 and further calibrated minor springs singularly represent less than 0 5 of the entire water budget and are neglected for modelling scopes the valleluce tectonic line where tortonian cu are embedded into the carbonate units pbu and du is represented with a barrier hfb6 package to locally decrease the permeability fig 3b hydraulic characteristics of the barrier is further calibrated thanks to the regional scale of the simulation fissured to karstified bedrock is schematized as porous equivalent medium as previously modelled in lancia et al 2018 bedrock is assumed as a porous equivalent medium with an average porosity of 0 3 for the limestone and 0 2 for the dolostone permeability and recharge datasets are calibrated considering a single value for each unit calibration reduces the difference between the observed spring flow dataset and the simulated ones initial recharge values derive from the central apennines budgets boni et al 1986 hydraulic conductivities from pumping tests the model uses pest parameter estimation a nonlinear parameter estimation algorithm doherty 2004 and refine the parameters as observation dataset calibration process considered the flow rates of the main springs observed in the 1970 s and 1980 s before the water abstraction performed by wcw for each spring residual after calibration is lower than 0 03 m3 s the impact of sammucro and venafro tunnel drainages on investigated groundwater flow is simulated via water wells wel1 package cone of depression induced by tunnel drainages is encompassed via modpath pollock 2016 despite the complexity of the wcw waterworks abstraction has been schematized as sinking cells 2 3 2 transient conditions the calibrated steady state solution was further improved under transient conditions between 2011 and 2018 in the simulated period 97 stress periods of 1 month with a single time step were considered the first step december 2010 was set with parameters coming from the steady state solution hydraulic conductivity and porosity are unit properties and only the aquifer recharge is considered as time dependent as direct measurement of the recharge is complex in fractured to karstified aquifers the dataset is evaluated starting from the rainfall trend measured at the atina gauge station regione lazio database between 2011 and 2018 fig 1c the monthly rainfall rate is processed via a convolution with a boxcar kernel considering a 3 month window the obtained trend is further normalized according to the following formula rch t rch ss r t r where rch t is the recharge set at the time step t rch ss is the recharge calibrated in steady state conditions r t is the convoluted rainfall rate at the time step t r is the rainfall average 2011 2018 of the convoluted rainfall dataset in the transient simulation water withdrawals pumping rate of wel1 package is considered as a steady state for additional simulation scenarios that consider a pumping rate cut off abstraction rate is homogeneously reduced from the first transient time steps january 2011 3 results and discussions 3 1 steady state numerical results the steady state numerical analysis is congruent with the groundwater setting established by literature after the calibration process the model quantitatively reproduces the average groundwater flow observed at the major springs table 1 calibrated hydraulic conductivities are in accordance with the dataset of celico 1983 and pumping tests from unpublished reports of casmez agency the recharge dataset agrees with the theoretical value predicted by boni et al 1986 for central apennines at valleluce divide fig 3 the calibrated hydraulic conductivity of the barrier confirms its role as a hydraulic barrier of the embedded cu clayey unit in fact s1 and b1 springs fig 4 a end up being fed by different sub basins table 3 reports calibrated hydraulic conductivity and recharge values simulated groundwater head ranges from 210 m a s l at the northern boundary to 25 m a s l at b3 springs fig 4a the average hydraulic gradient is about 5 8 in line with the literature value for central apennines carbonate aquifers celico 1983 boni et al 1986 between cavallo and lungo mts fig 4a a simulated gradient of 6 7 is observed whereas contact between the du dolostone unit and pu platform limestone unit occurs the difference of hydraulic conductivity between the units justifies the anomaly celico 1983 the b1 springs recharge area encompasses the north western sector of vma and the b2 springs the central and southern sector in accordance with the literature review groundwater flows from the internal sector of vma toward b2 springs fig 4b eastward s2 and s3 springs recharge area covers the eastern sector of vma the simulated velocity is low 0 0001 m s throughout the domain with peaks higher than 0 0023 m s fig 3b close to the contacts between dolostone unit du and platform limestone unit pu fig 2 numerical models elucidate the impacts of wcw on vma in steady state conditions fig 4c groundwater abstraction lowers the water table throughout the domain up to 5 m between the montaquila and cardito villages t2 waterworks with a withdrawal rate of 0 9 m3 s diverges the groundwater flow originally directed at s2 springs this spring records flow decreases of 0 95 m3 s from 1 28 m3 s to 0 33 m3 s equal to 68 of its natural mean flow rate at the same time t1 waterworks located in the middle of the vma intercepts the groundwater flow directed to b2 springs spring flow decreases to about 0 75 m3 s corresponding to 13 6 according to the numerical analysis s2 springs are affected by a lowering of 97 of the original flow and fig 4c as is expected from field observations and historical data mostly dried out the remaining flow rate 0 12 m3 s is drawn from b1 and s1 springs as the water extraction triggers a diffuse water table decrease the simulated velocity dataset slightly increases fig 4d 3 2 transient numerical result transient analysis is a relevant step forward to describe the groundwater dynamics of the investigated aquifer during extended drought periods or to simulate different water abstraction rates during the simulated period from 2011 to 2018 the groundwater head ranges 20 m a s l from the steady state solution video of the groundwater head trends under different conditions is included online resource video1 m4v the simulated flow rate for each spring is represented in fig 5 the spring flow rates following the wet and dry season cycle with a proportional groundwater head oscillation throughout the aquifer minimum flow rate occurs between september and october depending on the arrival of the first autumn rainfalls maximum flow rate is recorded between march and april compared to the bigger carbonate aquifers of the central apennines that records maximum a flow rate between may and june fiorilllo et al 2015 the maximum flow rate rate of vma is untimely this is due to the scarcity of snowfall because of the limited elevation of the mountain peaks the model also correctly simulates the 2012 and 2017 severe droughts in this span of time the spring flow rate shows a flattened trend without the typical flow rate peak expected at the end of the winter in natural conditions fig 5 introducing the water abstraction performed by wcw b1 and b2 springs have a homogeneous drawdown during the simulated years according to the model b1 and b2 springs contribute 30 and 6 respectively of the total groundwater abstraction performed by wcw s1 springs do not show flow rate variations thanks to the role of the valleluce barrier the remaining 64 of the abstracted water is charged to the s2 and s3 springs s2 springs which quickly dry out are penalized by the water pumping according to the simulated dataset groundwater flows out only during 2014 and 2015 s3 springs also decrease to a minimum of 0 30 m3 s but is more stable and less affected by the seasonal trend as s2 springs dry out s3 springs progressively also include the recharge area of s2 springs 3 3 towards sustainable management of the wcw simulation analysis suggests vma is severely affected by stress enhanced during drought conditions a pumping limitation from t1 and t2 waterworks would be a possible solution to ensure an active flow of b2 s2 and s3 springs for the same simulation period from 2011 to 2018 further scenarios simulate the groundwater dynamics of vma in case of a water abstraction cut off an initial scenario preview of t1 and t2 waterworks show a pumping rate decrease of 25 a second simulation introduces a drastic decrease abstraction rate of 50 the resulting spring flow rates are shown in fig 5 spring flow increase triggered by the pumping reduction are in fig 6 according to the model pumping rate decrement triggers a flow rate increase of b2 of about 0 096 m3 s and 0 19 m3 s respectively for the first and the second scenarios fig 5 located close by the t1 waterworks s3 springs recover 0 1 m3 s after three months about 0 162 m3 s after eight years in the first scenario these values rise to 0 2 m3 s and 0 324 m3 s for the second scenario fig 6 numerical analysis suggests a positive effect also for s maria d o spring which started recovering after the 2017 drought period after eight years of withdrawal reduction the flow rate increase of the entire vma corresponds to 48 of the abstraction cutoff for the first scenario and reaches 51 for the second one this finding highlights the limited and slow response of vma to management changes due to its hydrogeological complexity consequently the vma can be treated as a fragile groundwater system which must coexist with historical withdrawals new prolonged drought periods as observed in 2012 and in 2017 could further deplete the vma groundwater resources at the same time the occurrence of drought periods triggered additional human needs requiring an unavoidable full capacity withdrawal by wcw consequently the sole possible solution for limiting groundwater stress and ensuring sustainable use is to program and perform a detailed high frequency monitoring of natural systems definition of the abstraction plan based on recharge and exploitation balance and recovery strategies are an essential tool to support long term decisions to sum up detailed monitoring of the vma is compelling for a fine tuned management plan of vma groundwater resources in the meantime the reduction of water lost through the water supply networks currently 46 7 in campania region istat database is an accessible option that can provide immediate relief additional studies to assess the risk conditions of the surrounding carbonate aquifers are also urgent for the studied vma the recommendation of an improvement of monitoring activities involves not only withdrawals which are currently measured but also all main springs and related water tables inside the aquifer not forgetting rainfall and recharge rate all this information can used with the double purpose of i improving the numerical model reducing its uncertainties ii promoting and realizing an integrated resource monitoring network which must be adopted as management tool able to guide the wcw activities 3 4 limits and uncertainties of the model the numerical model simulates head distribution and groundwater flow at the springs under different conditions however numerous streamlinings are introduced the complex stratigraphic and tectonic setting of the vma has been strongly simplified in a single layer model to obtain a user friendly tool for groundwater management faults are implemented as hydraulic barriers only if they involve the clayey sequence characterized by low permeability local hydraulic conductivity changes in correspondence of faults and fractures is neglected recharge rate is assumed homogeneous on a yearly basis rainfall infiltration to vma is preferred at dolines tectonic karstified depressions and polje as well as impeded by strong vegetation whereas evapotranspiration is extremely high methods based on the land use cover change lamichhane and shakya 2019 2020 merged with karst features can better describe the recharge distribution without a perceivable variation of the total groundwater budget the steady state model has been calibrated by average spring dataset flow from the 1960s and 1980s discarding possible seasonal and long term changes at the same time the water abstraction by wcw was not steady during the last 20 years as water demand changed throughout the years the model also does not consider the limited lateral seepage from the carbonate layers towards the coarser alluvial layers of the cassino plain or the volturno valley for the same reason domestic water wells often unauthorized are additional pressures on vma groundwater resource modelling this apennine aquifer in transient conditions appears complex with numerous intrinsic uncertainties difficult to assess nevertheless the obtained results represent a significant attempt aimed at verifying the possible responses of the studied aquifer to the necessary water withdrawals in different future scenarios 4 conclusions analyzed vma suffers from a generalized groundwater depletion due to both the historical water abstraction performed by the wcw and the prolonged dry periods more frequently observed as happened in 2012 and 2017 overexploiting of aquifers can damage the eco systems and can cause economic loss to the local human activities associated with the water springs since the future climate scenario predicts a decrease of rainfall for the region and higher temperatures a new management approach aimed at optimizing the groundwater abstraction from vma is recommended investigated groundwater basins as well as probably other groundwater systems of the mediterranean basin bakalowicz 2015 fiorillo et al 2015 have a slow response with the recovery time estimated at the decennial scale despite the limited management costs a reduction of pumping throughout the vma is proposed to reactivate the flow rate in some springs at risk of drying out at the same time a detailed monitoring of spring flow rates and groundwater heads is needed to better assess the impact of the water abstraction both in actual conditions and in worsened scenarios an active monitoring network of both waterworks and natural conditions will be useful to promote and integrated and sustainable management of groundwater resources additionally an improvement of the entire water supply network with active detection of piping cracks and disruptions as well as checking of illegal withdrawals would minimize the water abstraction without affecting human water demand indeed central italy waterworks were designed and constructed before the establishment of detailed quantitative hydrogeological studies at current times their management must take into account increased frequency of droughts which can trigger a diffuse water emergency throughout the main urban areas of the country with serious implications for the economy detailed studies at long term scales are more generally suggested to assess the real sustainability of water abstraction throughout the aquifers of central italy following the here applied methodology the proposed model coupled with monitoring improvement surely will represent a valid management tool to tackle current and future criticalities deriving from global changes as added value this approach will represent a significant shift from passive management to a more comprehensive concept of smart water monitoring applied not only to waterworks and pipelines but also to groundwater resources in the environment fundings work was supported by the national

were individuated to supply the rising water demands of the populous northern campania region and the naples metropolitan area between the 1970s and 1990s the wcw western campania waterworks were created to exploit the groundwater resources of cassino plain and volturno valley after detailed hydrogeological studies celico 1983 boni et al 1986 however the hydrogeological conceptual models of these groundwater basins were debated at that time and aquifer extensions were undefined the wcw was designed with a controversial groundwater conceptual model in support and only recently updated

tapped amount is 200 106 m3 year gw gari waterworks exploited gari springs fig 2 via shallow water intakes table 2 tlp trocchio lifting point pumps water towards naples and the campania region at sammucro mt fig 2 t1 waterworks consist of a tunnel with water wells that increment the wcw flow rate the tunnel perforates the carbonate aquifer just below the regional groundwater table and is equipped with 19 water wells drilled inside the tunnel water wells modulate the water abstraction in function of the water demand in venafro city t2 tunnel drainage is equipped with lateral sluice gates that control the outflow rate fig 2 wcw exploits additional aquifers southward out of the investigated area sammucro and venafro drainage systems intercept the groundwater at higher elevation with respect to natural springs to limit operational costs from the managerial prospective this approach was preferred to balancing the high fee of gw waterworks table 2 which requires lifting the water up to tlp trocchio lifting point to overcome the hydraulic head between gw and tlp a flow rate of 1 m3 s of water requires a power of 1450 kw roughly corresponding to 0 7 million euro per year waterworks characteristics of wcw are summarized in table 2 2 3 numerical features 2 3 1 steady state conditions geological and hydrogeological information as the wcw concession flow rate has been imported in a modflow groundwater model and elaborated with a gms graphic interface the model is solved in steady state and transient conditions and solutions are obtained via an nwt upw configuration newton solver upstream weighting that allows better convergences for mountainous areas niswonger et al 2011 the domain consists of a single layer discretized via 8562 square cells with a side length of 200 m the top elevation model is imported from a strm dem resolution of 30 m the bottom elevation is set at 400 m a s l whereas groundwater flow is essentially null lancia et al 2018 the model is simplified considering the vertical lithological contacts a no flow boundary is set aside at the bottom as vma is an independent carbonate aquifer saroli et al 2019 an imposed recharge flow rch package constrains the domain top and simulates the infiltration from rainfall the model takes advantage of the unsaturated zone flow uzf package ordinally applied to simulate unsaturated zone flow above the water table neglecting the aquifer s unsaturated zone properties the package allows simulating saturation excess and spring flow rate model as already applied for fens feinstein et al 2019 and urban watersheds lancia et al 2019 the method is a valid alternative to blanketing the model with land surface drains or other sink packages main springs and streambeds are represented as drains drn package that allow groundwater flowing out from the domain as overpressure occurs fig 3 b initial drain conductances were estimated from field surveys lancia et al 2018 saroli et al 2019 and further calibrated minor springs singularly represent less than 0 5 of the entire water budget and are neglected for modelling scopes the valleluce tectonic line where tortonian cu are embedded into the carbonate units pbu and du is represented with a barrier hfb6 package to locally decrease the permeability fig 3b hydraulic characteristics of the barrier is further calibrated thanks to the regional scale of the simulation fissured to karstified bedrock is schematized as porous equivalent medium as previously modelled in lancia et al 2018 bedrock is assumed as a porous equivalent medium with an average porosity of 0 3 for the limestone and 0 2 for the dolostone permeability and recharge datasets are calibrated considering a single value for each unit calibration reduces the difference between the observed spring flow dataset and the simulated ones initial recharge values derive from the central apennines budgets boni et al 1986 hydraulic conductivities from pumping tests the model uses pest parameter estimation a nonlinear parameter estimation algorithm doherty 2004 and refine the parameters as observation dataset calibration process considered the flow rates of the main springs observed in the 1970 s and 1980 s before the water abstraction performed by wcw for each spring residual after calibration is lower than 0 03 m3 s the impact of sammucro and venafro tunnel drainages on investigated groundwater flow is simulated via water wells wel1 package cone of depression induced by tunnel drainages is encompassed via modpath pollock 2016 despite the complexity of the wcw waterworks abstraction has been schematized as sinking cells 2 3 2 transient conditions the calibrated steady state solution was further improved under transient conditions between 2011 and 2018 in the simulated period 97 stress periods of 1 month with a single time step were considered the first step december 2010 was set with parameters coming from the steady state solution hydraulic conductivity and porosity are unit properties and only the aquifer recharge is considered as time dependent as direct measurement of the recharge is complex in fractured to karstified aquifers the dataset is evaluated starting from the rainfall trend measured at the atina gauge station regione lazio database between 2011 and 2018 fig 1c the monthly rainfall rate is processed via a convolution with a boxcar kernel considering a 3 month window the obtained trend is further normalized according to the following formula rch t rch ss r t r where rch t is the recharge set at the time step t rch ss is the recharge calibrated in steady state conditions r t is the convoluted rainfall rate at the time step t r is the rainfall average 2011 2018 of the convoluted rainfall dataset in the transient simulation water withdrawals pumping rate of wel1 package is considered as a steady state for additional simulation scenarios that consider a pumping rate cut off abstraction rate is homogeneously reduced from the first transient time steps january 2011 3 results and discussions 3 1 steady state numerical results the steady state numerical analysis is congruent with the groundwater setting established by literature after the calibration process the model quantitatively reproduces the average groundwater flow observed at the major springs table 1 calibrated hydraulic conductivities are in accordance with the dataset of celico 1983 and pumping tests from unpublished reports of casmez agency the recharge dataset agrees with the theoretical value predicted by boni et al 1986 for central apennines at valleluce divide fig 3 the calibrated hydraulic conductivity of the barrier confirms its role as a hydraulic barrier of the embedded cu clayey unit in fact s1 and b1 springs fig 4 a end up being fed by different sub basins table 3 reports calibrated hydraulic conductivity and recharge values simulated groundwater head ranges from 210 m a s l at the northern boundary to 25 m a s l at b3 springs fig 4a the average hydraulic gradient is about 5 8 in line with the literature value for central apennines carbonate aquifers celico 1983 boni et al 1986 between cavallo and lungo mts fig 4a a simulated gradient of 6 7 is observed whereas contact between the du dolostone unit and pu platform limestone unit occurs the difference of hydraulic conductivity between the units justifies the anomaly celico 1983 the b1 springs recharge area encompasses the north western sector of vma and the b2 springs the central and southern sector in accordance with the literature review groundwater flows from the internal sector of vma toward b2 springs fig 4b eastward s2 and s3 springs recharge area covers the eastern sector of vma the simulated velocity is low 0 0001 m s throughout the domain with peaks higher than 0 0023 m s fig 3b close to the contacts between dolostone unit du and platform limestone unit pu fig 2 numerical models elucidate the impacts of wcw on vma in steady state conditions fig 4c groundwater abstraction lowers the water table throughout the domain up to 5 m between the montaquila and cardito villages t2 waterworks with a withdrawal rate of 0 9 m3 s diverges the groundwater flow originally directed at s2 springs this spring records flow decreases of 0 95 m3 s from 1 28 m3 s to 0 33 m3 s equal to 68 of its natural mean flow rate at the same time t1 waterworks located in the middle of the vma intercepts the groundwater flow directed to b2 springs spring flow decreases to about 0 75 m3 s corresponding to 13 6 according to the numerical analysis s2 springs are affected by a lowering of 97 of the original flow and fig 4c as is expected from field observations and historical data mostly dried out the remaining flow rate 0 12 m3 s is drawn from b1 and s1 springs as the water extraction triggers a diffuse water table decrease the simulated velocity dataset slightly increases fig 4d 3 2 transient numerical result transient analysis is a relevant step forward to describe the groundwater dynamics of the investigated aquifer during extended drought periods or to simulate different water abstraction rates during the simulated period from 2011 to 2018 the groundwater head ranges 20 m a s l from the steady state solution video of the groundwater head trends under different conditions is included online resource video1 m4v the simulated flow rate for each spring is represented in fig 5 the spring flow rates following the wet and dry season cycle with a proportional groundwater head oscillation throughout the aquifer minimum flow rate occurs between september and october depending on the arrival of the first autumn rainfalls maximum flow rate is recorded between march and april compared to the bigger carbonate aquifers of the central apennines that records maximum a flow rate between may and june fiorilllo et al 2015 the maximum flow rate rate of vma is untimely this is due to the scarcity of snowfall because of the limited elevation of the mountain peaks the model also correctly simulates the 2012 and 2017 severe droughts in this span of time the spring flow rate shows a flattened trend without the typical flow rate peak expected at the end of the winter in natural conditions fig 5 introducing the water abstraction performed by wcw b1 and b2 springs have a homogeneous drawdown during the simulated years according to the model b1 and b2 springs contribute 30 and 6 respectively of the total groundwater abstraction performed by wcw s1 springs do not show flow rate variations thanks to the role of the valleluce barrier the remaining 64 of the abstracted water is charged to the s2 and s3 springs s2 springs which quickly dry out are penalized by the water pumping according to the simulated dataset groundwater flows out only during 2014 and 2015 s3 springs also decrease to a minimum of 0 30 m3 s but is more stable and less affected by the seasonal trend as s2 springs dry out s3 springs progressively also include the recharge area of s2 springs 3 3 towards sustainable management of the wcw simulation analysis suggests vma is severely affected by stress enhanced during drought conditions a pumping limitation from t1 and t2 waterworks would be a possible solution to ensure an active flow of b2 s2 and s3 springs for the same simulation period from 2011 to 2018 further scenarios simulate the groundwater dynamics of vma in case of a water abstraction cut off an initial scenario preview of t1 and t2 waterworks show a pumping rate decrease of 25 a second simulation introduces a drastic decrease abstraction rate of 50 the resulting spring flow rates are shown in fig 5 spring flow increase triggered by the pumping reduction are in fig 6 according to the model pumping rate decrement triggers a flow rate increase of b2 of about 0 096 m3 s and 0 19 m3 s respectively for the first and the second scenarios fig 5 located close by the t1 waterworks s3 springs recover 0 1 m3 s after three months about 0 162 m3 s after eight years in the first scenario these values rise to 0 2 m3 s and 0 324 m3 s for the second scenario fig 6 numerical analysis suggests a positive effect also for s maria d o spring which started recovering after the 2017 drought period after eight years of withdrawal reduction the flow rate increase of the entire vma corresponds to 48 of the abstraction cutoff for the first scenario and reaches 51 for the second one this finding highlights the limited and slow response of vma to management changes due to its hydrogeological complexity consequently the vma can be treated as a fragile groundwater system which must coexist with historical withdrawals new prolonged drought periods as observed in 2012 and in 2017 could further deplete the vma groundwater resources at the same time the occurrence of drought periods triggered additional human needs requiring an unavoidable full capacity withdrawal by wcw consequently the sole possible solution for limiting groundwater stress and ensuring sustainable use is to program and perform a detailed high frequency monitoring of natural systems definition of the abstraction plan based on recharge and exploitation balance and recovery strategies are an essential tool to support long term decisions to sum up detailed monitoring of the vma is compelling for a fine tuned management plan of vma groundwater resources in the meantime the reduction of water lost through the water supply networks currently 46 7 in campania region istat database is an accessible option that can provide immediate relief additional studies to assess the risk conditions of the surrounding carbonate aquifers are also urgent for the studied vma the recommendation of an improvement of monitoring activities involves not only withdrawals which are currently measured but also all main springs and related water tables inside the aquifer not forgetting rainfall and recharge rate all this information can used with the double purpose of i improving the numerical model reducing its uncertainties ii promoting and realizing an integrated resource monitoring network which must be adopted as management tool able to guide the wcw activities 3 4 limits and uncertainties of the model the numerical model simulates head distribution and groundwater flow at the springs under different conditions however numerous streamlinings are introduced the complex stratigraphic and tectonic setting of the vma has been strongly simplified in a single layer model to obtain a user friendly tool for groundwater management faults are implemented as hydraulic barriers only if they involve the clayey sequence characterized by low permeability local hydraulic conductivity changes in correspondence of faults and fractures is neglected recharge rate is assumed homogeneous on a yearly basis rainfall infiltration to vma is preferred at dolines tectonic karstified depressions and polje as well as impeded by strong vegetation whereas evapotranspiration is extremely high methods based on the land use cover change lamichhane and shakya 2019 2020 merged with karst features can better describe the recharge distribution without a perceivable variation of the total groundwater budget the steady state model has been calibrated by average spring dataset flow from the 1960s and 1980s discarding possible seasonal and long term changes at the same time the water abstraction by wcw was not steady during the last 20 years as water demand changed throughout the years the model also does not consider the limited lateral seepage from the carbonate layers towards the coarser alluvial layers of the cassino plain or the volturno valley for the same reason domestic water wells often unauthorized are additional pressures on vma groundwater resource modelling this apennine aquifer in transient conditions appears complex with numerous intrinsic uncertainties difficult to assess nevertheless the obtained results represent a significant attempt aimed at verifying the possible responses of the studied aquifer to the necessary water withdrawals in different future scenarios 4 conclusions analyzed vma suffers from a generalized groundwater depletion due to both the historical water abstraction performed by the wcw and the prolonged dry periods more frequently observed as happened in 2012 and 2017 overexploiting of aquifers can damage the eco systems and can cause economic loss to the local human activities associated with the water springs since the future climate scenario predicts a decrease of rainfall for the region and higher temperatures a new management approach aimed at optimizing the groundwater abstraction from vma is recommended investigated groundwater basins as well as probably other groundwater systems of the mediterranean basin bakalowicz 2015 fiorillo et al 2015 have a slow response with the recovery time estimated at the decennial scale despite the limited management costs a reduction of pumping throughout the vma is proposed to reactivate the flow rate in some springs at risk of drying out at the same time a detailed monitoring of spring flow rates and groundwater heads is needed to better assess the impact of the water abstraction both in actual conditions and in worsened scenarios an active monitoring network of both waterworks and natural conditions will be useful to promote and integrated and sustainable management of groundwater resources additionally an improvement of the entire water supply network with active detection of piping cracks and disruptions as well as checking of illegal withdrawals would minimize the water abstraction without affecting human water demand indeed central italy waterworks were designed and constructed before the establishment of detailed quantitative hydrogeological studies at current times their management must take into account increased frequency of droughts which can trigger a diffuse water emergency throughout the main urban areas of the country with serious implications for the economy detailed studies at long term scales are more generally suggested to assess the real sustainability of water abstraction throughout the aquifers of central italy following the here applied methodology the proposed model coupled with monitoring improvement surely will represent a valid management tool to tackle current and future criticalities deriving from global changes as added value this approach will represent a significant shift from passive management to a more comprehensive concept of smart water monitoring applied not only to waterworks and pipelines but also to groundwater resources in the environment fundings work was supported by the national

8297,study region the impounded wujiang river southwest china study focus thermal stratification is an important factor shaping aquatic ecosystems in karst hydropower reservoirs however the underlying mechanism of thermal stratification formation is still unclear therefore water temperature and related environmental factors were investigated to understand how reservoir hydraulic load i e the ratio of the mean water depth to water retention time affects thermal stratification in eight karst hydropower reservoirs on the wujiang river new hydrological insights for the region the reservoir surface water had a higher temperature than the inflowing and released waters the variation in the reservoir thermal stratification showed an obvious seasonal pattern but the extents of the thermal stratification were different among the reservoirs the rate of water temperature change is proposed to characterize reservoir thermal stratification and is significantly negatively correlated with reservoir hydraulic load suggesting the control of both water depth and retention time on thermal stratification this empirical relationship will be helpful in quantitatively evaluating the hydrological effect on thermal stratification which further affects basic environmental parameters including ph dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a in narrow and deep karst cascade hydropower reservoirs keywords water temperature seasonal pattern hydraulic load hydropower reservoirs wujiang river 1 introduction hydroelectric exploitation is currently one of the most important human disturbances to rivers the development of cascade reservoirs can maximize hydroenergy exploitation and is thus preferred currently approximately 70 of rivers in the world are affected by dam construction vörösmarty et al 1997 and china built more than 20 000 large reservoirs 15 m dam height on its rivers by 2015 including on all the karst rivers in southwest china such as the wujiang river cascade dam construction alters the hydrological conditions of a river and the biogeochemical cycling of biogenic elements including carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silicon chao et al 2008 maavara et al 2020 wang et al 2018b and thus triggers ecological and environmental issues such as eutrophication and the release of greenhouse gases barros et al 2011 chen et al 2018 the karst basin is usually underlain by carbonate rocks and is typically characterized by canyon landforms under hydraulic erosion accordingly hydropower reservoirs formed by river damming are always narrow and deep cascade dam construction modifies river runoff and heat distributions and thus temporal and spatial patterns in water temperature wt wang et al 2019 dam interception results in an increase in water retention time and wt and hydropower reservoirs thus exhibit limnological characteristics such as thermal and chemical stratifications to some extent hydropower reservoirs are characterized by artificial bottom water release and off season water storage wt is an important environmental driving factor and the thermal stratification of a reservoir has a profound impact on its physical chemical and biological processes hannan and young 1974 noori et al 2018 he et al 2019 yang et al 2020 for example changes in the wt of released water will affect downstream phytoplankton and fish matsuura et al 2015 compared with lakes there are few systematic studies on the thermal stratification of cascade reservoirs and the underlying mechanism of reservoir thermal stratification is still unknown because cascade dam construction first changes the water retention time and depth we hypothesized that hydraulic load i e a ratio of mean water depth to water retention time is a critical controlling factor of the thermal stratification in karst cascade hydropower reservoirs the wujiang river sw china is a typical karst river and one of the thirteen state hydropower bases in this defined geographical region with similar environmental conditions there are many cascade hydropower reservoirs of different ages and volumes which can represent different phases of reservoir evolution therefore it is an ideal place to evaluate our hypothesis the wt and related environmental parameters of eight cascade reservoirs on the wujiang river were investigated the main purpose of this study is to understand how hydrological conditions affect the thermal stratifications in the wujiang karst cascade hydropower reservoirs 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and site monitoring the wujiang river originates from the wumeng ranges on the yunnan guizhou plateau and merges into the yangtze river at chongqing the wujiang river is the largest river in guizhou province with a total length of 1037 km and a drainage area of 88 267 km2 the mean annual flow of the wujiang river is 1650 m3 s and the mean annual runoff is 51 9 billion m3 the drop of the wujiang river is 2124 m a total of eight reservoirs were involved in the study including the hongjiadu hjd dongfeng df suofengying sfy wujiangdu wjd silin sl pengshui ps and yinpan yp reservoirs on the main stream of the wujiang river and the hongfeng hf reservoir on the tributary maotiao river fig 1 table 1 the hjd df sfy and wjd reservoirs are in the upper reaches the sl reservoir is in the middle reaches and the ps and yp reservoirs are in the lower reaches seasonal sampling was carried out in the winter january spring april summer june july and august and autumn october of 2017 respectively a total of 44 sites were investigated including the inflowing reservoir and released waters fig 1 the sfy reservoir was not measured in june the surface water upper 0 5 m was measured from all sites while the water profiles were determined at the reservoirs the water profiles were measured every meter in the upper 10 m and every five meters below 10 m in the w2 w5 hjd w8 w10 df w12 sfy and w14 w17 wj in the sites of w21 sl w24 w25 ps and w28 yp measurements were made every five meters in the water profiles the wt dissolved oxygen do ph and chlorophyll a chl a were determined in situ using a multiparameter probe with precorrection ysi exo1 america 2 2 data analyses the traditional thermocline strength index tsi is calculated using the equation tsi δt δh m where δt and δh are the difference in wt and water depth m respectively between the upper and lower edges of a certain layer horne and goldman 1994 in this study wt is considered to have stratification when tsi 0 2 the depth at which tsi 0 2 occurred for the first time is defined as the thermocline depth the corresponding water depth range as the thermocline thickness and the ratio of the wt difference in the thermocline range to the thermocline thickness as the thermocline strength zhang et al 2014 hydraulic load h is calculated using the equation h z t m d where z and t are the average water depth m and water retention time d of the reservoir respectively wollheim et al 2006 to characterize the temporal variation in thermocline strength the rate of wt change rt was proposed and denotes the change rate of the monthly maximum tsi in the water profile tsim with time rt is calculated using the equation rt δy δx m d where δy is the difference between the minimum and maximum tsim in the water profile and δx is the corresponding time difference throughout the year microsoft excel 2016 and origin 2018 were used for statistical analyses and spss 26 0 was used for pearson correlation analyses 3 results 3 1 variation in water temperature the water temperature in the study varied from 8 22 to 31 17 with an average of 18 63 the average wt in the water profile of the cascade reservoir tended to increase from upstream to downstream in the wujiang river and the increasing trend was consistent with the increase in the corresponding average air temperature table 1 fig 2 a spatially the reservoir surface water had a higher temperature than the inflowing and released waters temporally the average reservoir wt and the difference between the average surface wt and profile wt gradually increased from january to august and then began to decrease fig 2b 3 2 thermal stratification in the reservoirs the thermocline strength index ranged from 0 to 4 57 m with an average of 0 15 m except for the ps and yp reservoirs all the reservoirs showed obvious seasonal thermal stratification and the degree of stratification varied among the reservoirs figs 3 and 4 the reservoir thermal stratification usually started in spring became strongest in summer and gradually disappeared from autumn there was no thermal stratification in winter tsi less than 0 2 the wt differences between the surface and bottom waters in spring and summer were large and more than 5 in the stratified reservoirs during thermal stratification the layers of tsi greater than 0 2 were usually located in the euphotic zone of the reservoirs in the water profile of the hf reservoir in july two tsi peaks were found indicating that its hydrological conditions are more complicated than those of the other reservoirs fig 4 3 3 thermocline depth thickness and strength in the reservoirs the reservoirs showed obvious temporal and spatial variations in the depth thickness and strength of the thermocline fig 5 the parameters of the ps and yp reservoirs were 0 due to the absence of thermal stratification the thermocline depth varied from 0 to 15 m with an average of 1 15 m there were two peaks of thermocline depth in the hjd df and hf reservoirs while there was only one peak in each of the other stratified reservoirs the thermocline thickness ranged from 0 to 20 m with an average of 4 19 m and there were usually two peaks with time for the stratified reservoirs the thermocline depths of the hjd and hf reservoirs were greater than those of the other reservoirs the thermocline strength varied from 0 to 2 33 m with an average of 0 44 m similarly the stratified reservoirs generally had two peaks of thermocline strength with time but the peak time was different among the reservoirs fig 5 3 4 rate of wt change in the reservoirs generally the tsim showed a good unimodal relationship with time in the stratified reservoirs and the time of the peak varied among the reservoirs fig 6 a the rate of wt change decreased with increasing reservoir hydraulic load and the extent of the decrease varied among the reservoirs fig 6b meanwhile rt showed a significant positive power relationship with water residence time wrt r2 0 65 p 0 01 indicating the effect of wrt on reservoir thermal stratification 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal thermal stratification the study area has a subtropical monsoon humid climate and its air temperature shows obvious seasonal cycles and is lowest in winter and highest in summer the thermal stratifications of the reservoirs conform to this climate pattern and are consistent with studies on other subtropical deep reservoirs zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2019a essentially reservoir thermal stratification depends on the physical properties of water that is expansion with heat and contraction with cold when the temperature is above 4 the reservoir wt is greater than 4 throughout the year in this study under intense solar radiation in spring and summer the surface wt increases and the water density decreases accordingly in turn the bottom wt is not heated and the water density is comparatively high as a result the heavier bottom water cannot exchange with the lighter surface water and thermal stratification occurs in the water profile the epilimnion thermocline and hypolimnion form from top to bottom fig 3 starting in autumn the air temperature and surface wt begin to decrease with weakening solar radiation and reservoir thermal stratification gradually disappears accordingly in winter the reservoirs are completely in a state of mixing this is a typical monomictic pattern tafas et al 1997 zhang et al 2014 4 2 control of hydraulic load on thermal stratification the factors affecting reservoir thermal stratification include the reservoir topography i e depth length width and area solar radiation water temperature and transparency and water movement fee et al 1996 yu and wang 2011 ma et al 2015 león et al 2016 for reservoirs or lakes at a certain geographical location thermal stratification is mainly controlled by hydrological factors such as water depth and retention time townsend 1998 straskraba and hocking 2002 in this study hydraulic load combines water retention time and depth and is considered a characteristic hydrological parameter of reservoirs the rate of wt change embodies the temporal and spatial variation in wt and can characterize reservoir thermal stratification water depth is a prerequisite for water thermal stratification generally deep reservoirs and lakes have thermal stratification with seasonal changes and wind force seldom affects this process saber et al 2018 weinke and biddanda 2019 however shallow reservoirs and lakes are easily affected by daily solar radiation and wind force and have thermal stratification in the daytime in this situation the wt difference in the water profile is small the duration is short and the change is fast jacobs et al 1997 yang et al 2018 2019b in this study the hf reservoir has a shallower water depth than the other reservoirs and its thermal stratification is thus more complex fig 4 water retention time is another key factor controlling reservoir thermal stratification the hf hjd and wjd reservoirs with long wrts showed strong thermal stratification while the yp and ps reservoirs with short wrts had no thermal stratification the effects of water depth and retention time ultimately lead to a negative correlation between the rate of wt change and hydraulic load in these reservoirs this empirical relationship will help to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological effect on thermal stratification in cascade hydropower reservoirs 4 3 environmental effects of thermal stratification thermal stratification greatly influences the water environment of cascade hydropower reservoirs wt significantly correlated with ph do and chl a see tables s1 2 in supplementary materials and these parameters showed similar spatiotemporal variations figs s1 6 thermal stratification affects other physical and chemical factors by limiting migration and or interacting with them in the reservoir water profile in the upper euphotic zones of the reservoirs an increase in wt can promote the growth of phytoplankton wang et al 2018a which absorb co2 and release oxygen through photosynthesis resulting in increases in do and ph during thermal stratification the high do and ph in the upper layer cannot exchange with those in the lower layer meanwhile the respiration at the water bottom consumes oxygen and produces inorganic carbon leading to decreases in do and ph thus do and ph stratifications are formed with thermal stratification furthermore the change in do in the water profile can substantially affect carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling and the microbial community structure liang et al 2019 huang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 with the disappearance of thermal stratification chemical factors such as ph and do are mixed in the water profile therefore thermal stratification is an important basic factor in shaping the reservoir water environment 5 conclusions water temperature showed notable temporal and spatial variations in the wujiang cascade hydropower reservoirs the wt ranged from 8 22 to 31 17 with an average of 18 63 seasonal thermal stratification was found in the reservoirs stratification usually starts in spring reaches its peak in summer gradually disappears from autumn and mixes evenly in winter the thermocline depth thickness and intensity vary greatly among the stratified reservoirs the rate of wt change can characterize reservoir thermal stratification and is significantly negatively correlated with hydraulic load in these reservoirs thermal stratification is an important factor affecting other physical chemical and biological parameters in cascade hydropower reservoirs since hydropower reservoirs are highly artificially regulated an understanding of the empirical relationship between the rate of wt change and hydraulic load is helpful for providing theoretical support for ecological protection measures in cascade hydropower exploitation author statement we certify that we have participated

cascade dam construction modifies river runoff and heat distributions and thus temporal and spatial patterns in water temperature wt wang et al 2019 dam interception results in an increase in water retention time and wt and hydropower reservoirs thus exhibit limnological characteristics such as thermal and chemical stratifications to some extent hydropower reservoirs are characterized by artificial bottom water release and off season water storage wt is an important environmental driving factor and the thermal stratification of a reservoir has a profound impact on its physical chemical and biological processes hannan and young 1974 noori et al 2018 he et al 2019 yang et al 2020 for example changes in the wt of released water will affect downstream phytoplankton and fish matsuura et al 2015 compared with lakes there are few systematic studies on the thermal stratification of cascade reservoirs and the underlying mechanism of reservoir thermal stratification is still unknown because cascade dam construction first changes the water retention time and depth we hypothesized that hydraulic load i e a ratio of mean water depth to water retention time is a critical controlling factor of the thermal stratification in karst cascade hydropower reservoirs the wujiang river sw china is a typical karst river and one of the thirteen state hydropower bases in this defined geographical region with similar environmental conditions there are many cascade hydropower reservoirs of different ages and volumes which can represent different phases of reservoir evolution therefore it is an ideal place to evaluate our hypothesis the wt and related environmental parameters of eight cascade reservoirs on the wujiang river were investigated the main purpose of this study is to understand how hydrological conditions affect the thermal stratifications in the wujiang karst cascade hydropower reservoirs 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and site monitoring the wujiang river originates from the wumeng ranges on the yunnan guizhou plateau and merges into the yangtze river at chongqing the wujiang river is the largest river in guizhou province with a total length of 1037 km and a drainage area of 88 267 km2 the mean annual flow of the wujiang river is 1650 m3 s and the mean annual runoff is 51 9 billion m3 the drop of the wujiang river is 2124 m a total of eight reservoirs were involved in the study including the hongjiadu hjd dongfeng df suofengying sfy wujiangdu wjd silin sl pengshui ps and yinpan yp reservoirs on the main stream of the wujiang river and the hongfeng hf reservoir on the tributary maotiao river fig 1 table 1 the hjd df sfy and wjd reservoirs are in the upper reaches the sl reservoir is in the middle reaches and the ps and yp reservoirs are in the lower reaches seasonal sampling was carried out in the winter january spring april summer june july and august and autumn october of 2017 respectively a total of 44 sites were investigated including the inflowing reservoir and released waters fig 1 the sfy reservoir was not measured in june the surface water upper 0 5 m was measured from all sites while the water profiles were determined at the reservoirs the water profiles were measured every meter in the upper 10 m and every five meters below 10 m in the w2 w5 hjd w8 w10 df w12 sfy and w14 w17 wj in the sites of w21 sl w24 w25 ps and w28 yp measurements were made every five meters in the water profiles the wt dissolved oxygen do ph and chlorophyll a chl a were determined in situ using a multiparameter probe with precorrection ysi exo1 america 2 2 data analyses the traditional thermocline strength index tsi is calculated using the equation tsi δt δh m where δt and δh are the difference in wt and water depth m respectively between the upper and lower edges of a certain layer horne and goldman 1994 in this study wt is considered to have stratification when tsi 0 2 the depth at which tsi 0 2 occurred for the first time is defined as the thermocline depth the corresponding water depth range as the thermocline thickness and the ratio of the wt difference in the thermocline range to the thermocline thickness as the thermocline strength zhang et al 2014 hydraulic load h is calculated using the equation h z t m d where z and t are the average water depth m and water retention time d of the reservoir respectively wollheim et al 2006 to characterize the temporal variation in thermocline strength the rate of wt change rt was proposed and denotes the change rate of the monthly maximum tsi in the water profile tsim with time rt is calculated using the equation rt δy δx m d where δy is the difference between the minimum and maximum tsim in the water profile and δx is the corresponding time difference throughout the year microsoft excel 2016 and origin 2018 were used for statistical analyses and spss 26 0 was used for pearson correlation analyses 3 results 3 1 variation in water temperature the water temperature in the study varied from 8 22 to 31 17 with an average of 18 63 the average wt in the water profile of the cascade reservoir tended to increase from upstream to downstream in the wujiang river and the increasing trend was consistent with the increase in the corresponding average air temperature table 1 fig 2 a spatially the reservoir surface water had a higher temperature than the inflowing and released waters temporally the average reservoir wt and the difference between the average surface wt and profile wt gradually increased from january to august and then began to decrease fig 2b 3 2 thermal stratification in the reservoirs the thermocline strength index ranged from 0 to 4 57 m with an average of 0 15 m except for the ps and yp reservoirs all the reservoirs showed obvious seasonal thermal stratification and the degree of stratification varied among the reservoirs figs 3 and 4 the reservoir thermal stratification usually started in spring became strongest in summer and gradually disappeared from autumn there was no thermal stratification in winter tsi less than 0 2 the wt differences between the surface and bottom waters in spring and summer were large and more than 5 in the stratified reservoirs during thermal stratification the layers of tsi greater than 0 2 were usually located in the euphotic zone of the reservoirs in the water profile of the hf reservoir in july two tsi peaks were found indicating that its hydrological conditions are more complicated than those of the other reservoirs fig 4 3 3 thermocline depth thickness and strength in the reservoirs the reservoirs showed obvious temporal and spatial variations in the depth thickness and strength of the thermocline fig 5 the parameters of the ps and yp reservoirs were 0 due to the absence of thermal stratification the thermocline depth varied from 0 to 15 m with an average of 1 15 m there were two peaks of thermocline depth in the hjd df and hf reservoirs while there was only one peak in each of the other stratified reservoirs the thermocline thickness ranged from 0 to 20 m with an average of 4 19 m and there were usually two peaks with time for the stratified reservoirs the thermocline depths of the hjd and hf reservoirs were greater than those of the other reservoirs the thermocline strength varied from 0 to 2 33 m with an average of 0 44 m similarly the stratified reservoirs generally had two peaks of thermocline strength with time but the peak time was different among the reservoirs fig 5 3 4 rate of wt change in the reservoirs generally the tsim showed a good unimodal relationship with time in the stratified reservoirs and the time of the peak varied among the reservoirs fig 6 a the rate of wt change decreased with increasing reservoir hydraulic load and the extent of the decrease varied among the reservoirs fig 6b meanwhile rt showed a significant positive power relationship with water residence time wrt r2 0 65 p 0 01 indicating the effect of wrt on reservoir thermal stratification 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal thermal stratification the study area has a subtropical monsoon humid climate and its air temperature shows obvious seasonal cycles and is lowest in winter and highest in summer the thermal stratifications of the reservoirs conform to this climate pattern and are consistent with studies on other subtropical deep reservoirs zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2019a essentially reservoir thermal stratification depends on the physical properties of water that is expansion with heat and contraction with cold when the temperature is above 4 the reservoir wt is greater than 4 throughout the year in this study under intense solar radiation in spring and summer the surface wt increases and the water density decreases accordingly in turn the bottom wt is not heated and the water density is comparatively high as a result the heavier bottom water cannot exchange with the lighter surface water and thermal stratification occurs in the water profile the epilimnion thermocline and hypolimnion form from top to bottom fig 3 starting in autumn the air temperature and surface wt begin to decrease with weakening solar radiation and reservoir thermal stratification gradually disappears accordingly in winter the reservoirs are completely in a state of mixing this is a typical monomictic pattern tafas et al 1997 zhang et al 2014 4 2 control of hydraulic load on thermal stratification the factors affecting reservoir thermal stratification include the reservoir topography i e depth length width and area solar radiation water temperature and transparency and water movement fee et al 1996 yu and wang 2011 ma et al 2015 león et al 2016 for reservoirs or lakes at a certain geographical location thermal stratification is mainly controlled by hydrological factors such as water depth and retention time townsend 1998 straskraba and hocking 2002 in this study hydraulic load combines water retention time and depth and is considered a characteristic hydrological parameter of reservoirs the rate of wt change embodies the temporal and spatial variation in wt and can characterize reservoir thermal stratification water depth is a prerequisite for water thermal stratification generally deep reservoirs and lakes have thermal stratification with seasonal changes and wind force seldom affects this process saber et al 2018 weinke and biddanda 2019 however shallow reservoirs and lakes are easily affected by daily solar radiation and wind force and have thermal stratification in the daytime in this situation the wt difference in the water profile is small the duration is short and the change is fast jacobs et al 1997 yang et al 2018 2019b in this study the hf reservoir has a shallower water depth than the other reservoirs and its thermal stratification is thus more complex fig 4 water retention time is another key factor controlling reservoir thermal stratification the hf hjd and wjd reservoirs with long wrts showed strong thermal stratification while the yp and ps reservoirs with short wrts had no thermal stratification the effects of water depth and retention time ultimately lead to a negative correlation between the rate of wt change and hydraulic load in these reservoirs this empirical relationship will help to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological effect on thermal stratification in cascade hydropower reservoirs 4 3 environmental effects of thermal stratification thermal stratification greatly influences the water environment of cascade hydropower reservoirs wt significantly correlated with ph do and chl a see tables s1 2 in supplementary materials and these parameters showed similar spatiotemporal variations figs s1 6 thermal stratification affects other physical and chemical factors by limiting migration and or interacting with them in the reservoir water profile in the upper euphotic zones of the reservoirs an increase in wt can promote the growth of phytoplankton wang et al 2018a which absorb co2 and release oxygen through photosynthesis resulting in increases in do and ph during thermal stratification the high do and ph in the upper layer cannot exchange with those in the lower layer meanwhile the respiration at the water bottom consumes oxygen and produces inorganic carbon leading to decreases in do and ph thus do and ph stratifications are formed with thermal stratification furthermore the change in do in the water profile can substantially affect carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling and the microbial community structure liang et al 2019 huang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 with the disappearance of thermal stratification chemical factors such as ph and do are mixed in the water profile therefore thermal stratification is an important basic factor in shaping the reservoir water environment 5 conclusions water temperature showed notable temporal and spatial variations in the wujiang cascade hydropower reservoirs the wt ranged from 8 22 to 31 17 with an average of 18 63 seasonal thermal stratification was found in the reservoirs stratification usually starts in spring reaches its peak in summer gradually disappears from autumn and mixes evenly in winter the thermocline depth thickness and intensity vary greatly among the stratified reservoirs the rate of wt change can characterize reservoir thermal stratification and is significantly negatively correlated with hydraulic load in these reservoirs thermal stratification is an important factor affecting other physical chemical and biological parameters in cascade hydropower reservoirs since hydropower reservoirs are highly artificially regulated an understanding of the empirical relationship between the rate of wt change and hydraulic load is helpful for providing theoretical support for ecological protection measures in cascade hydropower exploitation author statement we certify that we have participated

8298,study region the study area is located in the southwest kaeng khoi district and the east muang district saraburi province thailand based on its hydrostratigraphic characteristics the aquifer in this area can be divided into an unconsolidated floodplain deposit aquifer qfd and a volcanic aquifer vc study focus this research investigated the hydrogeological characteristics and hydrogeochemical parameters of 42 groundwater samples obtained in the summer and rainy seasons principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca were used to identify the natural and anthropogenic impacts that likely influenced groundwater quality new hydrological insights for the region the groundwater type in qfd and vc is mainly ca na hco3 suggesting that the hydrochemical groundwater of both aquifers is affected by the same sources this study found evidence of ion exchange between ca2 and na in both seasons the five principal components had a cumulative variance greater than 76 11 and 77 88 in the rainy and summer seasons respectively based on correlation analysis and pca the sources of the groundwater chemistry are generally silicate and calcite weathering from geological formations including alkali feldspar and ca2 and mg2 rich minerals moreover some ions arose from anthropogenic activities typically irrigation water and sewage wastewater the presence of photphate po4 3 may be related to the dissolution of apatite and associated with anthropogenic activities causing an increase in po4 3 in the rainy season keywords hydrogeochemical characteristic groundwater principal component analysis saraburi thailand volcanic aquifer 1 introduction over the last few decades the growth of populations and expansion of economic activities have influenced groundwater storage and groundwater quality the situation has continued and the government has not provided appropriate policies as guidelines for the community as a result the overexploitation of groundwater resources for activities such as cultivation household consumption and industrial activities has become intense and this issue will become a serious problem with associated environmental impacts in the future chotpantarat and chanyatha 2003 chotpantarat et al 2011 2014 chotpantarat et al 2020 boonkaewwan et al 2020 konkul et al 2014 wongsasuluk et al 2018a b ratchawang and chotpantarat 2019b sae ju et al 2020 however the appropriate approach for solving this problem needs to be reinforced by the government to sustain groundwater resources in terms of quantity and quality leading to groundwater use efficiency the chemistry of natural groundwater generally depends on geological formations in the local area the residence time in contact with the aquifer media and the direction of groundwater flow also affect the quantity of dissolved ions in groundwater deterioration of groundwater quality is a serious problems found in many areas of the world shrestha and kazama 2007 singh et al 2012a 2013 avtar et al 2013 rina et al 2013a singh and mukherjee 2014 wongsasuluk et al 2014 singh et al 2017 pipattanajaroenkul et al 2018 tiankao and chotpantarat 2018 ratchawang and chotpantarat 2019a sonthiphand et al 2019 chotpantarat et al 2020 thailand is a predominantly agricultural country with agriculture covering approximately 54 36 of the land area particularly in the central and northern areas which have a large proportion of rice cultivated area western areas of thailand such as kanchanaburi and suphanburi provinces are the main areas of asparagus cultivation asparagus cultivation requires high doses of fertilizers high use of other agrochemicals such as herbicides insecticides and essential biological elements including nitrogen and phosphorus is also noted in thailand boqiang et al 2012 leading to eutrophication due to inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen duncan et al 2012 after entering the soil directly these agrochemicals and elements may be leached by rainfall infiltration into lakes reservoirs kaff 2012 minaudo et al 2015 masipan et al 2016 boonkaewwan and chotpantarat 2014 chotpantarat and boonkaewwan 2018 and the groundwater system causing

multivariate statistical techniques can be used to observe and analyze the many different hydrochemical variables to enable an understanding of the geochemical processes involved including weathering the dissolution of carbonate formations nakhaei et al 2016 and the interaction between fresh groundwater and coastal groundwater amiri et al 2016a b 2017 sohrabi et al 2017 boonkaewwan et al 2020 the characteristics of groundwater are defined for each individual aquifer and sources of groundwater contamination are identified singh et al 2009 2012 nakhaei et al 2015 kumar and singh 2015 kumar et al 2015 2017 mallick et al 2018 therefore the aim of this study was to apply a correlation matrix and principal component analysis pca to describe the relationship between various hydrochemical parameters in a volcanic aquifer vc and floodplain deposit aquifer qfd the results of this study could be used to elucidate the origin and controls of the groundwater chemistry associated with the variation in water quality underneath areas of intensive agriculture this information can be beneficially used to construct a database for groundwater development and for the monitoring of groundwater quality conservation moreover it is helpful to plan appropriate remediation programs for the safe consumption and household usage of such water in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located between latitude 14 40 n to 14 58 n and longitude 100 96 e to 101 13 e in the southwest of kaeng khoi district and the east of muang district saraburi province thailand the study area covers approximately 262 km2 fig 1 the climatic conditions are under the influence of both the northeast and southwest monsoons the middle of february to the middle of may is the summer season

areas mainly appear in the southern and eastern regions of the study area whereas the pasak river is in the northwest region of the area the bedrock geology of the study area consists of permo triassic igneous rocks khao yai group including rhyolite and andesite which are mainly composed of alkali feldspar amphibole and biotite phenocrysts with a groundmass of plagioclase and quartz chutakositkanon et al 2000 fig 1 the quaternary sediments consist of clays sands and silts that spread over the central and western regions of the study area and expand vertically regarding hydrostratigraphic characteristics the aquifer can be divided into the unconsolidated floodplain deposit aquifer qfd from approximately 60 100 m the qfd consists of dark brown silty clay as topsoil and is mainly yellowish brown fine sand to coarse sand subangular to subrounded and well sorted at a depth of 20 50 m from ground level at 50 100 m from ground level the qfd consists of dark brown sandy gravel that is rounded and moderate to well sorted the volcanic aquifer vc consists of greenish purplish gray andesite and dark reddish brown rhyolite that is dense has a porphyritic texture and is composed of feldspar and quartz the vc typically underlines the bottom of the floodplain deposit aquifer which varies in depth from 13 to 110 m fig 1 most of the groundwater recharges from local rainfall the groundwater recharge area is the khao kaew mountain range in the southeast of the study area some recharge also occurs in the khao yae mountains khao tham suea and khao champa in the central and north regions of the study area respectively these areas represent the moderate potential recharge zone whereas the western areas represent the high potential recharge zone chotpantarat et al 2015 the main irrigation water is primarily derived from surface water the irrigated agriculture receives water from two reservoirs the khlong phriao reservoir which is in the west of the study area and is an outlet of the aquifer and the ban dong reservoir which is located in the northeast of the study area the creeks within the area mainly flow from east to west groundwater is intensively extracted for irrigation mainly in the summer season yet the groundwater table level did not differ across both seasons the average groundwater level in the summer season dropped by 1 39 m and was approximately 44 80 m above mean sea level amsl in november 2014 and approximately 43 41 m amsl in may 2015 the groundwater mainly flows from east to west as shown in fig 2 according to wisittammasri et al 2016 the groundwater that intereacts with surface water is mainly distributed in the central and west of the study area the soil characteristics are loam clay loam sandy loam loamy sand silt loam and clay land development department 2009 and deeper layers might contain fe and mn deposits 2 2 groundwater sampling method a total of 42 groundwater samples were collected in each season fig 1 from 10 to 13 november 2014 rainy season and 11 14 may 2015 summer season all of the samples were collected in 500 ml polyethylene bottles and were acidified for the analysis of cations 1 l samples were collected for anion analysis the depth of the wells ranged from 24 to 160 m with an average of 75 m the ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured ph 3210 wtw the instrument was standardized with a wtw technical buffer solution and had an instrument accuracy of 0 01 for ph and 0 3 for orp electric conductivity ec was measured using the hach sension5 with an accuracy for ec of

flooded with water for at least 10 min the do probe was not used until the atmosphere in the chamber reached a steady state the groundwater levels were measured during the fieldwork using global water s el500 water level sounder and the accuracy of the meter was 0 008 2 3 laboratory analysis the groundwater samples were filtered using a 0 22 μm nylon filter syringe and sent to the laboratory of the

respectively the detection limits for cl f br no2 no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were 0 007 0 006 0 007 0 005 0 016 0 012 and 0 01 mg l respectively the precisions of the cations were 0 04 for ca2 0 03 for mg2 0

hco3 was determined using titration at the department of geology faculty of science chulalongkorn university an error of ion charge balance was calculated to determine the precision of the ion measurement which was within 10 als environmental ltd 2014 boyd 2002 dhv consultants bv 1999 2 4 statistical analyses all of the hydrochemical parameters field and laboratory data were standardized to a z scale as shown in eq 1 below aruga et al 1995 avtar et al 2010 singh et al 2011 this is a preliminary step taken to avoid differences in the range of variance and misclassifications from the use of different units of measurement hydrochemical data are normally distributed ledesma ruiz et al 2015 liu et al 2003 singh et al 2004 the relationship between the hydrochemical parameters was considered by creating a correlation matrix accepting significance at the p 0 01 level subsequently principal component analysis pca was performed to build a hierarchy of clusters based on their similarity within a class omo irabor et al 2008 panda et al 2006 scott and clarke 2000 1 z i x i x m s i here zi is a standardized variable xi is the raw variable xm is the mean and si is the standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics following the calculation of the ion charge balance seven stations yielded results with errors greater than 10 so the data from these wells were ignored in the interpretation all of the parameters of the groundwater from the qfd are shown in table 1 the ph values in the rainy season indicated mild alkaline conditions in the summer season the ec value was increased 1 42 fold compared with the rainy season the average do was 4 3 mg l in the summer season only bicarbonate hco3 was the dominant anion in the groundwater in both seasons comparison of the average concentrations of each ion in both seasons revealed that most ions were present at higher concentrations in the summer season than in the rainy season with the exception of ca2 f po4 3 and no2 the parameters of the vc are shown in table 1 similar to the qfd the ph values in the summer and rainy seasons were mildly alkaline in the summer season the ec value was 1 30 fold higher than that in the rainy season and lower than that in the qfd comparison of the average concentrations of each ion in both seasons revealed that most ions were present at higher concentrations in summer than in the rainy season with the exception of so4 2 in both seasons the physicochemical parameters of the qfd were higher than those of the vc except ec t na and nh4 orp and so4 2 of the vc were increased in summer compared with the rainy season the concentrations of the principal ions were ranked as follows ca2 na mg2 for cations and hco3 so4 2 cl for anions generally na is derived from the dissolution of plagioclase in rhyolite and andesite fig 1 whereas k is derived from orthoclase and muscovite minerals in those rocks jiang et al 2009 furthermore the so4 2 concentration specifies natural processes such as the weathering process and the dissolution of sulfide minerals in andesite rocks as well as human activities such as the use of fertilizer chloride cl can be derived from wastewater manure and septic effluent bohlke and horan 2000 boonkaewwan et al 2020 li et al 2014 valdes et al 2007 zimbelman et al 2005 as well as natural sources such as rainfall or cl bearing minerals negrel 1999 the no3 concentrations were in the range of 0 02 7 10 mg l with an average value of 1 41 mg l in the rainy season and 0 2 5 59 mg l with an average value of 1 75 mg l in the summer season thus the no3 concentrations did not exhibit seasonal variation and were mainly derived from natural sources similarly no2 cl and f concentrations did not exhibit any significant seasonal changes generally the cl concentration can be used as an indicator to identify sources of contaminants because it is not an abundant element in the minerals of local rocks potassium k is less abundant than other ions and is generally present in groundwater at concentrations of less than 5 mg l however two and three groundwater samples well nos 11 and 67 in both seasons and well no 13 in the summer season exhibited increased k concentrations in the rainy and summer seasons respectively these samples may be affected by contamination from wastewater or common fertilizers water quality variables were then plotted as a piper diagram to identify the hydrochemical facies of the groundwater piper 1944 the piper diagram is presented in fig 3 the water types were mostly ca na hco3 ca hco3 and na hco3 these results suggest that the interaction between rocks and the percolated water is the dominant controlling factor of the groundwater chemistry in both the qfd and vc a number of points lying between ca hco3 and na hco3 in both seasons were disparate which is not surprising because ca2 ions in groundwater can be replaced by na as shown in eq 2 2 2n a ca x 2 c a 2 2nax the reactions shown in eqs 3 and 4 are influenced by the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the dissolution of co2 gas li et al 2014 resulting in increased hco3 concentrations and ph values baba and olowoyeye 2011 moreover hco3 can originate from the alternation of silicates e g orthoclase microcline kaolinite in eq 5 and albite kaolinite in eq 6 ta et al 2020 3 cac o 3 c o 2 g h 2 o c a 2 2hc o 3 4 c o 2

the piper diagram fig 3 is used to refer to the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the groundwater from both aquifers no significant change in hydrochemical facies is noted between the two aquifers the qfd and vc further the hydrogeologic cross section of the study area fig 1 shows the sediments deposited on volcanic rock which indicates that most of the sediments were obtained by the weathering of volcanic rock in addition the dissolution of these minerals may control the groundwater chemistry the relationship among each of the hydrogeochemical parameters was considered according to a pearson correlation matrix as shown in tables 2 and 3 the text highlighted in bold signifies a significant relationship at p 0 01 in the rainy season so4 2 exhibited a closer relationship with na and na exhibited a correlation with hco3 these results suggests that na is derived from silicate weathering in addition hco3 was correlated with ca2 suggesting the dissolution of carbonate minerals cloutier et al 2008 biswas et al 2012 esteller et al 2017 the relationship among hco3 ca2 na and so4 2 suggests a common source such as mineral dissolution from geological formations based on the geology na can be released by the silicate weathering process as shown in eq 6 note that na cannot be derived from the dissolution of halite given that a relationship between na and cl qian et al 2016

mg2 ca2 cl hco3 no2 po4 3 and f implying that they are possibly derived from human activities the strong relationship between ca2 po4 3 and cl can be explained by the fact that ca2 is partially derived from phosphate fertilizer ca h2po4 2 h2o as well as from domestic wastewater other chemical fertilizers and manure li et al 2014 furthermore ca2 po4 3 and f are commonly released from the dissolution of various silicates of fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and f in water is due to the weathering of volcanic and pyroclastic rocks hem 1985 singh et al 2011 nh4 was negatively correlated with the orp in both seasons as noted in table 3 ca2 had a negative correlation with na which is evidence of ion exchange thus the concentration of na increased while the concentration of ca2 decreased in the summer season qian et al 2016 furthermore the groundwater ph had a negative effect on the dissolution of ca2 abbas et al 2015 sae ju et al 2020 which is explained by eq 3 3 2 2 pca pca depends on the kaiser criterion using the varimax method to rotate the parameters all of the parameters in both seasons were classified into five components as presented in table 4 for each component the values in bold represent a good correlation r 0 5 the five groups have eigen values greater than 1 and a cumulative variance greater than 76 11 in the rainy season and 77 88 in the summer season for the rainy season pc1 had high positive correlations with mg2 nh4 cl and br and a negative correlation with orp which is typical for irrigation water return flow impacts in an agricultural and rural urban drainage area the contaminated water of these areas was accumulated and recharged through the groundwater system during the rainfall period the pc2 was correlated with ph ec ca2 and hco3 indicating the contribution from a calcite weathering process mu et al 2015 qian et al 2016 sathiyamurthi and saravanan 2013 however the dissolution of anorthite may be a source of ca2 malenda 2019 in terms of the regional scale limestone was found in the northern part of the study area as a result the groundwater might be infiltrated from the recharge area through the groundwater system in the deeper consolidated aquifers the pc3 was correlated with ec na and so4 2 suggesting that these ions are derived from anthropogenic contamination mu et al 2015 such as wastewater and precipitation of sulfur from industrial processes zhang et al 2015 as well as geological factors such as the occurrence impact of sodium sulfate bearing minerals deposits e g thenardite in the sediments salyapongse et al 2002 pc4 exhibited a positive correlation with no2 po4 3 and f suggesting that these ions are derived from the dissolution of various silicates in volcanic ash i e hornblende and mica hem 1985 singh et al 2011 no3 was separated into the last component pc5 and the level of no3 contamination in the groundwater during both seasons was lower than the maximum allowable level for drinking water macler 2006 woolverton 2015 the median values of no3 were 0 82 mg l and 1 39 mg l for the rainy and summer seasons respectively which correspond to pristine water with a negligible impact from no3 thus the source of no3 is principally from nature according to kaown et al 2009 the ca hco3 groundwater type in kangwon korea was characterized by a low no3 n 3 mg l whereas the ca cl no3 so4 type exhibited a high no3 n 10 mg l since the concentrations of nh4 and no2 were insufficient to initiate a reaction no3 consequently had a low generation potential ammonification is not completely achieved and denitrification does not occur due to the presence of dissolved oxygen at levels 1 mg l however nh4 can be removed by the ion exchange processes na is replaced by nh4 hence na increases in the groundwater table 1 demir et al 2002 lambert et al 2004 megonigal et al 2003 pasten zapata et al 2014 in the summer season ec ca2 mg2 no2 po4 3 cl and br were included in pc1 highest loading factor whereas ph ec na and hco3 were included in pc2 which exhibited a positive loading and could be explained by the groundwater geological interactions yadav et al 2014 the control of ph and the so4 2 hco3 ec ca2 mg2 na k and cl levels was assumed to occur by natural processes belkhiri et al 2011 in addition pc2 in the summer season was analogous to pc2 in the rainy season except that it was dominated by na instead of ca2 the third component pc3 exhibited a correlation between k and nh4 implying that groundwater might be contaminated from sewage and fertilizer choi 1988 whereas pc4 exhibited a positive relationship between the orp and do indicating oxidizing conditions as a result nitrification possibly occurred in the groundwater system due to oxidation reactions nh3 nh4 is converted to no2 nh4 decrease and no2 is consecutively converted to no3 no2 decrease resulting in an increased concentration of no3 and decreased concentrations of no2 and nh4 bӧhlke et al 2006 according to the study of aravena and mayer 2010 nitrification can occur rapidly even at a dissolved o2 concentration of approximately 0 3 mg l the last component pc5 exhibited a negative correlation for so4 2 with no3 due to the oxidation process indicating that these ions were derived from domestic and agricultural sources hernández antonio et al 2015 however this result is not consistent with the results from the study by omo irabor et al 2008 where so4 2 and no3 were positively correlated all the variables were also plotted in rotated space fig 4 the no3 concentration in most wells in the summer season were greater than that in the rainy season supplementary information fig s1 which is similar to the finding from previous studies gao et al 2012 guo and jiang 2009 mo et al 2016 that found that no3 concentrations in the rainy season november were lower than those in the summer season may nevertheless the average no3 concentration in the rainy season was not significantly increased compared with that in summer p 0 05 and the distribution pattern was similar in both seasons possibly due to better assimilation by plants in summer pasten zapata et al 2014 the increasing no3 concentration in summer was rather high and was the result of the increased nitrification process and the decreased ph in summer was potentially the consequence of the nitrification process ndegwa et al 2007 silva et al 2015 however some wells exhibited a lower no3 concentration in the summer season due to the lower natural soil n content pasten zapata et al 2014 3 2 3 hierarchical cluster analysis hca since all the parameters were measured in both seasons the averages were generated before hca in this study we used the ward linkage method for cluster analysis and measured intervals using squared euclidean distances hca was used to evaluate the hydrochemical similarities among all of the wells distributed over the area belkhiri et al 2011 and the revealed three clustered groups fig 5 the first cluster included 27 well samples whereas the second cluster included seven well samples nos 19 21 23 26 29 30 and 61 the last cluster included only well no 67 because it had the highest concentrations of ec 1399 50 μs cm ca2 111 07 mg l mg2 66 02 mg l cl 203 35 mg l and br 1 91 mg l among all the wells and its orp value was negative although the first and second groups exhibited some similarities the average values of ec na hco3 and so4 2 in the second group were obviously increased at 1007 88 μs cm 112 15 mg l 366 07 mg l and 91 17 mg l respectively wheareas the averages in the first group were 685 86 μs cm 46 03 mg l 301 50 mg l and 18 59 mg l respectively figs 6 and 7 as mentioned above these results are consistent with the consequences of evaporitic dissolution of quaternary deposits which were mainly located in the discharge area moreover the water types of the samples in the second group were different because they mainly consisted of cl and so4 2 however some hydrochemical parameters in the first group exhibited higher values namely ph 7 88 no3 6 35 mg l no2 0 28 mg l po4 3 7 62 mg l k 10 30 mg l and nh4 5 89 mg l concentrations according to cluster analysis well no 67 which is located at the northeast of the area was a significant anomaly compared to the other wells fig si 2 a no3 concentration greater than 2 mg l kolpin et al 1999 or 3 mg l pasten zapata et al 2014 indicates a strong anthropogenic influence a mixing triangle curve which plots cations and or anions from hydrogeochemical analysis along with curves containing the endpoints of each contaminant source was used to identify the sources generally cl is a conservative anion and has minimal interactions with the surrounding substrate as it migrates into groundwater pasten zapata et al 2014 the relationship between the no3 cl ratio and the cl concentration was therefore used as a proxy to trace the possible sources of contaminants which can be classified as agriculture wastewater and natural zhang et al 2015 the representative sources were the ban dong reservoir for natural conditions wells in the anubanpattananikom school for wastewater and wells in khao phra non villages for agricultural activities in fig s2 well no 67 explicitly deviated to the right hand side of the diagram indicating that no3 was derived from wastewater in both seasons which is consistent with the characteristics of land use interestingly wisittammasri and chotpantarat 2016 analyzed the stable isotopes 18o and d in the groundwater surface water and rainfall in this study area to investigate the hydrological system they proposed that the groundwater could be separated into two groups the first group is directly impacted by rainfall whereas the second group is impacted by the interaction of the surface water and evaporation process most of the groundwater samples in hca1 were within a recharge area where the aquifer receives rainfall directly 3 3 hydrogeochemical processes influencing the groundwater quality as presented in tables 2 and 3 a strong relationship between ca2 and hco3 was evident in both the rainy and summer seasons this relationship is affected by carbonate rock weathering because the northern part of the area includes the saraburi group limestone outcrop of permian age fig 8 a confirms that the groundwater chemistry is affected by silicate weathering and or ion exchange given that ca2 mg2 versus hco3 are not within the theoretical range of 1 1 or 1 2 wu et al 2013 as most of the data in both seasons tended to be below a ratio of 1 2 these results imply that the hydrochemical composition of the groundwater was consistent with silicate minerals in andesite daniele et al 2013 in fig 8b the ratio of mg2 and ca2 exceeds 2 suggesting that most samples have a silicate source of ca2 and mg2 which is similar to that reported in another study qian et al 2016 however one half of wells in the summer season are close to the 1 1 line which indicates the dominance of carbonate dissolution the relationship of ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 and na k cl has been used to confirm the possibility of an ion exchange process amiri et al 2015 the results were quite close to a straight line indicating that ion exchange significantly affected the hydrochemical facies of groundwater in both seasons as mentioned previously moussa et al 2010 fig 8c naturally the level of so4 2 in groundwater is below 113 mg l van dijk looijaard and fonds 1985v sonkamble et al 2012 or ranges from 0 230 mg l world health organization canada centre for inland waters who 1990 and 30 150 mg l in streams without human induced sources iowa department of natural resources idnr 2009 in this study most wells have so4 2 concentrations less than 113 mg l suggesting that the background level of so4 2 is derived from natural sources indeed the low so4 2 level correlated with na implying natural sources such as the weathering of rock minerals and soils molinari et al 2015 moreover the dissimilatory so4 2 reduction by bacteria the activity of which follows the organic carbon content and produces hco3 leads to an increased ph especially in the rainy season miao et al 2012 in addition a relationship between mg2 and hco3 was not found thus olivines and pyroxenes are not likely to be present in the area bellia et al 2015 especially in the rainy season brockmann and janse 2008 kim and yun 2005 however the plot of ca2 and hco3 fig 9 a shows that most of the data fall above the 1 1 line especially for well nos 19 21 26 and 67 the ca2 hco3 ratios of both seasons are low ratio 1 which may be due to either ca2 depletion by cation exchange or hco3 enrichment most of the points are placed below the 1 1 line in the comparison of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 fig 9b indicating the dominance of silicate weathering kumar et al 2008 with the exception of well nos 21 and 67 which exhibit a reverse ion exchange shifting to the left due to excess of ca2 and mg2 moreover well nos 7 47 and 40 in the rainy season and well nos 2 42 and 46 in the summer season are close to the 1 1 line thus these wells are affected by the dissolution of calcite and dolomite sonkamble et al 2012 the results are plotted as na versus cl in a diagram fig 9c all of the samples are below the theoretical 1 1 line implying excess na these high levels of na are mainly derived from silicate weathering which potentially involves by the weathering of soda feldspar albite and potash feldspars orthoclase and microcline kumar et al 2008 with the exception of well no 67 which had high cl levels generally cl in basic volcanic rocks ranges from 5 9 to 112 9 mg l prada et al 2005 well no 67 reveals that cl in the rainy and summer seasons were 188 15 and 218 56 mg l respectively the 25th and 75th percentiles of cl were 6 22 and 27 95 mg l respectively in the rainy season and 6 42 and 29 74 mg l respectively in the summer season this finding is probably due to anthropogenic activites poor drainage and agricultural activities gui 2012 the cl concentrations of the other wells ranged from 1 07 60 35 mg l so the cl concentrations may result from the interaction of water with entrained volcanic gases bellia et al 2015 based on fig 9d the samples fall above the 1 1 line towards ca2 whereas well no 67 and a few samples including well nos 23 29 and 30 fall below the line this result indicates the carbonic acid contribution towards silicate dissolution in the study area raju et al 2015 earle 2015 as shown in eq 7 7 caa l 2 s i 2 o 8 h 2 c o 3 1 2 o 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 c a 2 c o 3 2 plagioclase carbonic acid kaolinite dissolved calcium carbonate ions silicate weathering can be understood by estimating the ratio of na k and total cations tz fig 9e most of the data in the rainy season are greater than 0 5 tz indicating alkali feldspar weathering on the other hand wells no 26 and 29 and some of the data in the summer season fall between 0 5 tz and 1 tz which is indicative of the other silicate minerals weathering and is mainly involved in the contribution of ฟsodium and potassium ions to groundwater fig 9f presents a plot of ca2 and mg2 versus total cations tz with a linear spread between 0 5 tz and 1 tz indicating that some of these ions resulted from the weathering of ca2 and mg2 rich minerals with the exception of well nos 26 and 29 in the rainy season and some of the data in the summer season greater than 0 5 tz indicate that these samples are rich in alkali feldspar kumar et al 2008 thus the groundwater composition is influenced by the weathering process of volcanic rocks that contain many minerals such as biotite hornblende muscovite sodium and calcium feldspars and quartz which is the dominant process in the study area qian et al 2016 furthermore many samples in the summer season show the dominant carbonate dissolution process generally po4 3 in young groundwater is less than 0 04 mg l morgenstern et al 2004 which is similar to the level found in most of wells in the summer season except well no 67 in addition some wells nos 7 13 19 46 56 62 and 67 exhibited increased po4 3 at concentrations greater than 13 mg l in the rainy season which was associated with sites with a high recharge rate wisittammasri and chotpantarat 2016 additionally phosphate is often associated with anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer use and can cause an increase in po4 3 in subsurface water especially in the rainy season andres and sims 2013 this study found that the relationship between po4 3 and hco3 was very weak which indirectly suggests that po4 3 is mainly derived from anthropogenic activities yadav et al 2014 in general reducing conditions low eh result in increased po4 3 concentrations zurawsky et al 2004 in general the br concentrations was typically less than 0 01 mg l flury and papritz 1993 the br concentration in the aquifers did not exceed the 0 1 mg l level found in the rainy season edmunds 1996 and ranged between 0 5 and 43 μg l in soil solutions the levels depended on the organic matter that can easily be leached from soil profiles wishkerman 2006 and the 25th and 75th percentiles of br were 0 01 and 0 04 mg l respectively in the rainy season and 0 75 and 1 11 mg l respectively in the summer season the increased br concentration in the summer season is likely the result of increased evapotranspiration edmunds 1996 furthermore the results from the correlation matrix and pca for both seasons revealed a strong relationship for mg2 with cl and br so these ions are likely influenced by the same source as previously mentioned the northeast of the study area in the lam phaya klang and lam somphung sub districts muak lek saraburi appears to have some potential gold ore deposits wongsamuth 2014 moreover halogens are generally enriched in rhyolites in volcanic rocks shinonaga et al 1994 volatile components in erupting silicate magmas mostly consist of methyl halides ch3cl and ch3br alcalá and custodio 2008 goni et al 2001 and the concentration of br in glassy volcanic andesite and rhyolitic rocks exceeds that in coarser igneous crystalline rocks aiuppa et al 2009 in addition a relationship between br and cl is widely observed in aquifers of the mesozoic age edmunds 1996 which was confirmed in the indosinian i orogeny where the volcano erupted simultaneously with an intrusion of andesite in the upper permian to triassic period department of groundwater resources 2007 both elements can occur in rather rare minerals such as embolite ag cl br iodobromite 2agcl 2agbr agi cerargyrite agcl and bromyrite agbr which are associated with galena pbs gianella 1941 in mineral veins and their alteration products hedenquist and lowenstern 1994 the natural background level of f in groundwater ranges between 3 6 and 15 mg l ducci and sellerino 2012 and commonly originates from the dissolution of various phosphates of fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f halides of fluorite caf2 and various silicates in volcanic ash such as hornblende and some micas which may contain f and have replaced some of the hydroxide component thus f in water is due to the weathering of volcanic and pyroclastic rocks hem 1985 singh et al 2011 and the 25th and 75th percentiles of f were 0 15 and 0 67 mg l respectively in the rainy season and 0 20 and 0 36 mg l respectively in the summer season the concentration of k ranged from 2 39 to 8 95 mg l also indicating silicate weathering esteller et al 2017 the 25th and 75th percentiles of k were 1 01 and 2 87 mg l respectively in the rainy season and 0 92 and 3 07 mg l respectively in the summer season shamsuddin et al 2016 reported that k could originate from rainfall rivers potash feldspar and micaceous minerals 0 1 8 mg l 4 conclusions the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater such as ph temperature and ec were increased in the summer compared with the rainy season most ions were present at higher concentrations in the summer season than in the rainy season in both aquifers the groundwater types of both aquifers mainly consisted of ca na hco3 ca hco3 and ca na hco3 ca hco3 in the rainy season whereas ca na hco3 na hco3 and ca hco3 were dominant in the summer season the redox potential eh in both seasons mainly revealed the prevailing oxidizing conditions and a high temperature was observed in the summer season based on pca the five main groups have a cumulative variance of greater than 76 11 and 77 88 in the rainy and in the summer seasons respectively the sources of ions are both natural factors such as silicate and calcite weathering and anthropogenic activities which is typical of irrigation water and sewage wastewater especially in the rainy season some of the wells are affected by anthropogenic activities especially well no 67 furthermore ion exchange was found which affects the ion concentrations as well the relationship between ca2 and po4 3 may be related to the dissolution of apatite and some wells exhibited a relatively higher concentration of po4 3 in the rainy season than in summer season which was associated with sites with a high recharge rate phosphate might be released from agricultural areas activities causing an increase in po4 3 in subsurface water especially in the rainy season although multivariate statistical analysis of the hydrogeochemical data was used to identify the preliminary sources of ions in the future this information will be used for further interpretation of stable isotope data collected from a previous study to aid in tracing the active processes that occur in the area thus these data may be an efficient tool to clearly separate different sources and various mechanisms of hydrogeochemistry in groundwater which would be of considerable benefit for the management of groundwater resources in the future credit authorship contribution statement wanlapa wisitthammasri data curation visualization investigation

8298,study region the study area is located in the southwest kaeng khoi district and the east muang district saraburi province thailand based on its hydrostratigraphic characteristics the aquifer in this area can be divided into an unconsolidated floodplain deposit aquifer qfd and a volcanic aquifer vc study focus this research investigated the hydrogeological characteristics and hydrogeochemical parameters of 42 groundwater samples obtained in the summer and rainy seasons principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca were used to identify the natural and anthropogenic impacts that likely influenced groundwater quality new hydrological insights for the region the groundwater type in qfd and vc is mainly ca na hco3 suggesting that the hydrochemical groundwater of both aquifers is affected by the same sources this study found evidence of ion exchange between ca2 and na in both seasons the five principal components had a cumulative variance greater than 76 11 and 77 88 in the rainy and summer seasons respectively based on correlation analysis and pca the sources of the groundwater chemistry are generally silicate and calcite weathering from geological formations including alkali feldspar and ca2 and mg2 rich minerals moreover some ions arose from anthropogenic activities typically irrigation water and sewage wastewater the presence of photphate po4 3 may be related to the dissolution of apatite and associated with anthropogenic activities causing an increase in po4 3 in the rainy season keywords hydrogeochemical characteristic groundwater principal component analysis saraburi thailand volcanic aquifer 1 introduction over the last few decades the growth of populations and expansion of economic activities have influenced groundwater storage and groundwater quality the situation has continued and the government has not provided appropriate policies as guidelines for the community as a result the overexploitation of groundwater resources for activities such as cultivation household consumption and industrial activities has become intense and this issue will become a serious problem with associated environmental impacts in the future chotpantarat and chanyatha 2003 chotpantarat et al 2011 2014 chotpantarat et al 2020 boonkaewwan et al 2020 konkul et al 2014 wongsasuluk et al 2018a b ratchawang and chotpantarat 2019b sae ju et al 2020 however the appropriate approach for solving this problem needs to be reinforced by the government to sustain groundwater resources in terms of quantity and quality leading to groundwater use efficiency the chemistry of natural groundwater generally depends on geological formations in the local area the residence time in contact with the aquifer media and the direction of groundwater flow also affect the quantity of dissolved ions in groundwater deterioration of groundwater quality is a serious problems found in many areas of the world shrestha and kazama 2007 singh et al 2012a 2013 avtar et al 2013 rina et al 2013a singh and mukherjee 2014 wongsasuluk et al 2014 singh et al 2017 pipattanajaroenkul et al 2018 tiankao and chotpantarat 2018 ratchawang and chotpantarat 2019a sonthiphand et al 2019 chotpantarat et al 2020 thailand is a predominantly agricultural country with agriculture covering approximately 54 36 of the land area particularly in the central and northern areas which have a large proportion of rice cultivated area western areas of thailand such as kanchanaburi and suphanburi provinces are the main areas of asparagus cultivation asparagus cultivation requires high doses of fertilizers high use of other agrochemicals such as herbicides insecticides and essential biological elements including nitrogen and phosphorus is also noted in thailand boqiang et al 2012 leading to eutrophication due to inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen duncan et al 2012 after entering the soil directly these agrochemicals and elements may be leached by rainfall infiltration into lakes reservoirs kaff 2012 minaudo et al 2015 masipan et al 2016 boonkaewwan and chotpantarat 2014 chotpantarat and boonkaewwan 2018 and the groundwater system causing changes in the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater rina et al 2013b singh et al 2013b hassen et al 2016 boonsrang et al 2018 chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 sae ju et al 2020 multivariate statistical techniques can be used to observe and analyze the many different hydrochemical variables to enable an understanding of the geochemical processes involved including weathering the dissolution of carbonate formations nakhaei et al 2016 and the interaction between fresh groundwater and coastal groundwater amiri et al 2016a b 2017 sohrabi et al 2017 boonkaewwan et al 2020 the characteristics of groundwater are defined for each individual aquifer and sources of groundwater contamination are identified singh et al 2009 2012 nakhaei et al 2015 kumar and singh 2015 kumar et al 2015 2017 mallick et al 2018 therefore the aim of this study was to apply a correlation matrix and principal component analysis pca to describe the relationship between various hydrochemical parameters in a volcanic aquifer vc and floodplain deposit aquifer qfd the results of this study could be used to elucidate the origin and controls of the groundwater chemistry associated with the variation in water quality underneath areas of intensive agriculture this information can be beneficially used to construct a database for groundwater development and for the monitoring of groundwater quality conservation moreover it is helpful to plan appropriate remediation programs for the safe consumption and household usage of such water in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located between latitude 14 40 n to 14 58 n and longitude 100 96 e to 101 13 e in the southwest of kaeng khoi district and the east of muang district saraburi province thailand the study area covers approximately 262 km2 fig 1 the climatic conditions are under the influence of both the northeast and southwest monsoons the middle of february to the middle of may is the summer season whereas the middle of may to the middle of october is the rainy season the middle of october to the middle of february is the winter season in this area the average annual temperature is approximately 25 9 28 8 c and annual rainfall is approximately 1140 mm the rainfall in november 2014 was approximately 100 6 mm and the rainfall in may 2015 was 72 3 mm the topography of the western and central areas predominantly consists of alluvial plain as these areas are part of the lower chao phraya plain which includes alluvial plain flood plain terrace plain and river terrace features mountainous areas mainly appear in the southern and eastern regions of the study area whereas the pasak river is in the northwest region of the area the bedrock geology of the study area consists of permo triassic igneous rocks khao yai group including rhyolite and andesite which are mainly composed of alkali feldspar amphibole and biotite phenocrysts with a groundmass of plagioclase and quartz chutakositkanon et al 2000 fig 1 the quaternary sediments consist of clays sands and silts that spread over the central and western regions of the study area and expand vertically regarding hydrostratigraphic characteristics the aquifer can be divided into the unconsolidated floodplain deposit aquifer qfd from approximately 60 100 m the qfd consists of dark brown silty clay as topsoil and is mainly yellowish brown fine sand to coarse sand subangular to subrounded and well sorted at a depth of 20 50 m from ground level at 50 100 m from ground level the qfd consists of dark brown sandy gravel that is rounded and moderate to well sorted the volcanic aquifer vc consists of greenish purplish gray andesite and dark reddish brown rhyolite that is dense has a porphyritic texture and is composed of feldspar and quartz the vc typically underlines the bottom of the floodplain deposit aquifer which varies in depth from 13 to 110 m fig 1 most of the groundwater recharges from local rainfall the groundwater recharge area is the khao kaew mountain range in the southeast of the study area some recharge also occurs in the khao yae mountains khao tham suea and khao champa in the central and north regions of the study area respectively these areas represent the moderate potential recharge zone whereas the western areas represent the high potential recharge zone chotpantarat et al 2015 the main irrigation water is primarily derived from surface water the irrigated agriculture receives water from two reservoirs the khlong phriao reservoir which is in the west of the study area and is an outlet of the aquifer and the ban dong reservoir which is located in the northeast of the study area the creeks within the area mainly flow from east to west groundwater is intensively extracted for irrigation mainly in the summer season yet the groundwater table level did not differ across both seasons the average groundwater level in the summer season dropped by 1 39 m and was approximately 44 80 m above mean sea level amsl in november 2014 and approximately 43 41 m amsl in may 2015 the groundwater mainly flows from east to west as shown in fig 2 according to wisittammasri et al 2016 the groundwater that intereacts with surface water is mainly distributed in the central and west of the study area the soil characteristics are loam clay loam sandy loam loamy sand silt loam and clay land development department 2009 and deeper layers might contain fe and mn deposits 2 2 groundwater sampling method a total of 42 groundwater samples were collected in each season fig 1 from 10 to 13 november 2014 rainy season and 11 14 may 2015 summer season all of the samples were collected in 500 ml polyethylene bottles and were acidified for the analysis of cations 1 l samples were collected for anion analysis the depth of the wells ranged from 24 to 160 m with an average of 75 m the ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured ph 3210 wtw the instrument was standardized with a wtw technical buffer solution and had an instrument accuracy of 0 01 for ph and 0 3 for orp electric conductivity ec was measured using the hach sension5 with an accuracy for ec of

was standardized in water saturated air by opening the bottom of the chamber and inserting a water soaked sponge then the do probe was inserted into the storage chamber such that its tip was not flooded with water for at least 10 min the do probe was not used until the atmosphere in the chamber reached a steady state the groundwater levels were measured during the fieldwork using global water s el500 water level sounder and the accuracy of the meter was 0 008 2 3 laboratory analysis the groundwater samples were filtered using a 0 22 μm nylon filter syringe and sent to the laboratory of the thailand institute of nuclear technology tint for analysis of the major cations na k ca2 mg2 and nh4 and anions cl f br no2 no3 so4 2 and po4 3 by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 with an accuracy

respectively the detection limits for cl f br no2 no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were 0 007 0 006 0 007 0 005 0 016 0 012 and 0 01 mg l respectively the precisions of the cations were 0 04 for ca2 0 03 for mg2 0

hco3 was determined using titration at the department of geology faculty of science chulalongkorn university an error of ion charge balance was calculated to determine the precision of the ion measurement which was within 10 als environmental ltd 2014 boyd 2002 dhv consultants bv 1999 2 4 statistical analyses all of the hydrochemical parameters field and laboratory data were standardized to a z scale as shown in eq 1 below aruga et al 1995 avtar et al 2010 singh et al 2011 this is a preliminary step taken to avoid differences in the range of variance and misclassifications from the use of different units of measurement hydrochemical data are normally distributed ledesma ruiz et al 2015 liu et al 2003 singh et al 2004 the relationship between the hydrochemical parameters was considered by creating a correlation matrix accepting significance at the p 0 01 level subsequently principal component analysis pca was performed to build a hierarchy of clusters based on their similarity within a class omo irabor et al 2008 panda et al 2006 scott and clarke 2000 1 z i x i x m s i here zi is a standardized variable xi is the raw variable xm is the mean and si is the standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics following the calculation of the ion charge balance seven stations yielded results with errors greater than 10 so the data from these wells were ignored in the interpretation all of the parameters of the groundwater from the qfd are shown in table 1 the ph values in the rainy season indicated mild alkaline conditions in the summer season the ec value was increased 1 42 fold compared with the rainy season the average do was 4 3 mg l in the summer season only bicarbonate hco3 was the dominant anion in the groundwater in both seasons comparison of the average concentrations of each ion in both seasons revealed that most ions were present at higher concentrations in the summer season than in the rainy season with the exception of ca2 f po4 3 and no2 the parameters of the vc are shown in table 1 similar to the qfd the ph values in the summer and rainy seasons were mildly alkaline in the summer season the ec value was 1 30 fold higher than that in the rainy season and lower than that in the qfd comparison of the average concentrations of each ion in both seasons revealed that most ions were present at higher concentrations in summer than in the rainy season with the exception of so4 2 in both seasons the physicochemical parameters of the qfd were higher than those of the vc except ec t na and nh4 orp and so4 2 of the vc were increased in summer compared with the rainy season the concentrations of the principal ions were ranked as follows ca2 na mg2 for cations and hco3 so4 2 cl for anions generally na is derived from the dissolution of plagioclase in rhyolite and andesite fig 1 whereas k is derived from orthoclase and muscovite minerals in those rocks jiang et al 2009 furthermore the so4 2 concentration specifies natural processes such as the weathering process and the dissolution of sulfide minerals in andesite rocks as well as human activities such as the use of fertilizer chloride cl can be derived from wastewater manure and septic effluent bohlke and horan 2000 boonkaewwan et al 2020 li et al 2014 valdes et al 2007 zimbelman et al 2005 as well as natural sources such as rainfall or cl bearing minerals negrel 1999 the no3 concentrations were in the range of 0 02 7 10 mg l with an average value of 1 41 mg l in the rainy season and 0 2 5 59 mg l with an average value of 1 75 mg l in the summer season thus the no3 concentrations did not exhibit seasonal variation and were mainly derived from natural sources similarly no2 cl and f concentrations did not exhibit any significant seasonal changes generally the cl concentration can be used as an indicator to identify sources of contaminants because it is not an abundant element in the minerals of local rocks potassium k is less abundant than other ions and is generally present in groundwater at concentrations of less than 5 mg l however two and three groundwater samples well nos 11 and 67 in both seasons and well no 13 in the summer season exhibited increased k concentrations in the rainy and summer seasons respectively these samples may be affected by contamination from wastewater or common fertilizers water quality variables were then plotted as a piper diagram to identify the hydrochemical facies of the groundwater piper 1944 the piper diagram is presented in fig 3 the water types were mostly ca na hco3 ca hco3 and na hco3 these results suggest that the interaction between rocks and the percolated water is the dominant controlling factor of the groundwater chemistry in both the qfd and vc a number of points lying between ca hco3 and na hco3 in both seasons were disparate which is not surprising because ca2 ions in groundwater can be replaced by na as shown in eq 2 2 2n a ca x 2 c a 2 2nax the reactions shown in eqs 3 and 4 are influenced by the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the dissolution of co2 gas li et al 2014 resulting in increased hco3 concentrations and ph values baba and olowoyeye 2011 moreover hco3 can originate from the alternation of silicates e g orthoclase microcline kaolinite in eq 5 and albite kaolinite in eq 6 ta et al 2020 3 cac o 3 c o 2 g h 2 o c a 2 2hc o 3 4 c o 2

were distinctive in terms of their elevated so4 2 and cl concentrations in particular well no 67 which is located in the vc based on the well depth and hydrogeological cross section represented a ca

the piper diagram fig 3 is used to refer to the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the groundwater from both aquifers no significant change in hydrochemical facies is noted between the two aquifers the qfd and vc further the hydrogeologic cross section of the study area fig 1 shows the sediments deposited on volcanic rock which indicates that most of the sediments were obtained by the weathering of volcanic rock in addition the dissolution of these minerals may control the groundwater chemistry the relationship among each of the hydrogeochemical parameters was considered according to a pearson correlation matrix as shown in tables 2 and 3 the text highlighted in bold signifies a significant relationship at p 0 01 in the rainy season so4 2 exhibited a closer relationship with na and na exhibited a correlation with hco3 these results suggests that na is derived from silicate weathering in addition hco3 was correlated with ca2 suggesting the dissolution of carbonate minerals cloutier et al 2008 biswas et al 2012 esteller et al 2017 the relationship among hco3 ca2 na and so4 2 suggests a common source such as mineral dissolution from geological formations based on the geology na can be released by the silicate weathering process as shown in eq 6 note that na cannot be derived from the dissolution of halite given that a relationship between na and cl qian et al 2016 was not found br is easily incorporated into organic compounds and is highly soluble in water but it is readily volatilized at room temperature anthropogenic sources of br are associated with mining urban runoff pesticides and disinfectant products bringha and elango 2013 van briesen 2018 and br is associated with mg2 cl and nh4 in the rainy season in the summer season br is associated with ec mg2 ca2 cl hco3 no2 po4 3 and f implying that they are possibly derived from human activities the strong relationship between ca2 po4 3 and cl can be explained by the fact that ca2 is partially derived from phosphate fertilizer ca h2po4 2 h2o as well as from domestic wastewater other chemical fertilizers and manure li et al 2014 furthermore ca2 po4 3 and f are commonly released from the dissolution of various silicates of fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and f in water is due to the weathering of volcanic and pyroclastic rocks hem 1985 singh et al 2011 nh4 was negatively correlated with the orp in both seasons as noted in table 3 ca2 had a negative correlation with na which is evidence of ion exchange thus the concentration of na increased while the concentration of ca2 decreased in the summer season qian et al 2016 furthermore the groundwater ph had a negative effect on the dissolution of ca2 abbas et al 2015 sae ju et al 2020 which is explained by eq 3 3 2 2 pca pca depends on the kaiser criterion using the varimax method to rotate the parameters all of the parameters in both seasons were classified into five components as presented in table 4 for each component the values in bold represent a good correlation r 0 5 the five groups have eigen values greater than 1 and a cumulative variance greater than 76 11 in the rainy season and 77 88 in the summer season for the rainy season pc1 had high positive correlations with mg2 nh4 cl and br and a negative correlation with orp which is typical for irrigation water return flow impacts in an agricultural and rural urban drainage area the contaminated water of these areas was accumulated and recharged through the groundwater system during the rainfall period the pc2 was correlated with ph ec ca2 and hco3 indicating the contribution from a calcite weathering process mu et al 2015 qian et al 2016 sathiyamurthi and saravanan 2013 however the dissolution of anorthite may be a source of ca2 malenda 2019 in terms of the regional scale limestone was found in the northern part of the study area as a result the groundwater might be infiltrated from the recharge area through the groundwater system in the deeper consolidated aquifers the pc3 was correlated with ec na and so4 2 suggesting that these ions are derived from anthropogenic contamination mu et al 2015 such as wastewater and precipitation of sulfur from industrial processes zhang et al 2015 as well as geological factors such as the occurrence impact of sodium sulfate bearing minerals deposits e g thenardite in the sediments salyapongse et al 2002 pc4 exhibited a positive correlation with no2 po4 3 and f suggesting that these ions are derived from the dissolution of various silicates in volcanic ash i e hornblende and mica hem 1985 singh et al 2011 no3 was separated into the last component pc5 and the level of no3 contamination in the groundwater during both seasons was lower than the maximum allowable level for drinking water macler 2006 woolverton 2015 the median values of no3 were 0 82 mg l and 1 39 mg l for the rainy and summer seasons respectively which correspond to pristine water with a negligible impact from no3 thus the source of no3 is principally from nature according to kaown et al 2009 the ca hco3 groundwater type in kangwon korea was characterized by a low no3 n 3 mg l whereas the ca cl no3 so4 type exhibited a high no3 n 10 mg l since the concentrations of nh4 and no2 were insufficient to initiate a reaction no3 consequently had a low generation potential ammonification is not completely achieved and denitrification does not occur due to the presence of dissolved oxygen at levels 1 mg l however nh4 can be removed by the ion exchange processes na is replaced by nh4 hence na increases in the groundwater table 1 demir et al 2002 lambert et al 2004 megonigal et al 2003 pasten zapata et al 2014 in the summer season ec ca2 mg2 no2 po4 3 cl and br were included in pc1 highest loading factor whereas ph ec na and hco3 were included in pc2 which exhibited a positive loading and could be explained by the groundwater geological interactions yadav et al 2014 the control of ph and the so4 2 hco3 ec ca2 mg2 na k and cl levels was assumed to occur by natural processes belkhiri et al 2011 in addition pc2 in the summer season was analogous to pc2 in the rainy season except that it was dominated by na instead of ca2 the third component pc3 exhibited a correlation between k and nh4 implying that groundwater might be contaminated from sewage and fertilizer choi 1988 whereas pc4 exhibited a positive relationship between the orp and do indicating oxidizing conditions as a result nitrification possibly occurred in the groundwater system due to oxidation reactions nh3 nh4 is converted to no2 nh4 decrease and no2 is consecutively converted to no3 no2 decrease resulting in an increased concentration of no3 and decreased concentrations of no2 and nh4 bӧhlke et al 2006 according to the study of aravena and mayer 2010 nitrification can occur rapidly even at a dissolved o2 concentration of approximately 0 3 mg l the last component pc5 exhibited a negative correlation for so4 2 with no3 due to the oxidation process indicating that these ions were derived from domestic and agricultural sources hernández antonio et al 2015 however this result is not consistent with the results from the study by omo irabor et al 2008 where so4 2 and no3 were positively correlated all the variables were also plotted in rotated space fig 4 the no3 concentration in most wells in the summer season were greater than that in the rainy season supplementary information fig s1 which is similar to the finding from previous studies gao et al 2012 guo and jiang 2009 mo et al 2016 that found that no3 concentrations in the rainy season november were lower than those in the summer season may nevertheless the average no3 concentration in the rainy season was not significantly increased compared with that in summer p 0 05 and the distribution pattern was similar in both seasons possibly due to better assimilation by plants in summer pasten zapata et al 2014 the increasing no3 concentration in summer was rather high and was the result of the increased nitrification process and the decreased ph in summer was potentially the consequence of the nitrification process ndegwa et al 2007 silva et al 2015 however some wells exhibited a lower no3 concentration in the summer season due to the lower natural soil n content pasten zapata et al 2014 3 2 3 hierarchical cluster analysis hca since all the parameters were measured in both seasons the averages were generated before hca in this study we used the ward linkage method for cluster analysis and measured intervals using squared euclidean distances hca was used to evaluate the hydrochemical similarities among all of the wells distributed over the area belkhiri et al 2011 and the revealed three clustered groups fig 5 the first cluster included 27 well samples whereas the second cluster included seven well samples nos 19 21 23 26 29 30 and 61 the last cluster included only well no 67 because it had the highest concentrations of ec 1399 50 μs cm ca2 111 07 mg l mg2 66 02 mg l cl 203 35 mg l and br 1 91 mg l among all the wells and its orp value was negative although the first and second groups exhibited some similarities the average values of ec na hco3 and so4 2 in the second group were obviously increased at 1007 88 μs cm 112 15 mg l 366 07 mg l and 91 17 mg l respectively wheareas the averages in the first group were 685 86 μs cm 46 03 mg l 301 50 mg l and 18 59 mg l respectively figs 6 and 7 as mentioned above these results are consistent with the consequences of evaporitic dissolution of quaternary deposits which were mainly located in the discharge area moreover the water types of the samples in the second group were different because they mainly consisted of cl and so4 2 however some hydrochemical parameters in the first group exhibited higher values namely ph 7 88 no3 6 35 mg l no2 0 28 mg l po4 3 7 62 mg l k 10 30 mg l and nh4 5 89 mg l concentrations according to cluster analysis well no 67 which is located at the northeast of the area was a significant anomaly compared to the other wells fig si 2 a no3 concentration greater than 2 mg l kolpin et al 1999 or 3 mg l pasten zapata et al 2014 indicates a strong anthropogenic influence a mixing triangle curve which plots cations and or anions from hydrogeochemical analysis along with curves containing the endpoints of each contaminant source was used to identify the sources generally cl is a conservative anion and has minimal interactions with the surrounding substrate as it migrates into groundwater pasten zapata et al 2014 the relationship between the no3 cl ratio and the cl concentration was therefore used as a proxy to trace the possible sources of contaminants which can be classified as agriculture wastewater and natural zhang et al 2015 the representative sources were the ban dong reservoir for natural conditions wells in the anubanpattananikom school for wastewater and wells in khao phra non villages for agricultural activities in fig s2 well no 67 explicitly deviated to the right hand side of the diagram indicating that no3 was derived from wastewater in both seasons which is consistent with the characteristics of land use interestingly wisittammasri and chotpantarat 2016 analyzed the stable isotopes 18o and d in the groundwater surface water and rainfall in this study area to investigate the hydrological system they proposed that the groundwater could be separated into two groups the first group is directly impacted by rainfall whereas the second group is impacted by the interaction of the surface water and evaporation process most of the groundwater samples in hca1 were within a recharge area where the aquifer receives rainfall directly 3 3 hydrogeochemical processes influencing the groundwater quality as presented in tables 2 and 3 a strong relationship between ca2 and hco3 was evident in both the rainy and summer seasons this relationship is affected by carbonate rock weathering because the northern part of the area includes the saraburi group limestone outcrop of permian age fig 8 a confirms that the groundwater chemistry is affected by silicate weathering and or ion exchange given that ca2 mg2 versus hco3 are not within the theoretical range of 1 1 or 1 2 wu et al 2013 as most of the data in both seasons tended to be below a ratio of 1 2 these results imply that the hydrochemical composition of the groundwater was consistent with silicate minerals in andesite daniele et al 2013 in fig 8b the ratio of mg2 and ca2 exceeds 2 suggesting that most samples have a silicate source of ca2 and mg2 which is similar to that reported in another study qian et al 2016 however one half of wells in the summer season are close to the 1 1 line which indicates the dominance of carbonate dissolution the relationship of ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 and na k cl has been used to confirm the possibility of an ion exchange process amiri et al 2015 the results were quite close to a straight line indicating that ion exchange significantly affected the hydrochemical facies of groundwater in both seasons as mentioned previously moussa et al 2010 fig 8c naturally the level of so4 2 in groundwater is below 113 mg l van dijk looijaard and fonds 1985v sonkamble et al 2012 or ranges from 0 230 mg l world health organization canada centre for inland waters who 1990 and 30 150 mg l in streams without human induced sources iowa department of natural resources idnr 2009 in this study most wells have so4 2 concentrations less than 113 mg l suggesting that the background level of so4 2 is derived from natural sources indeed the low so4 2 level correlated with na implying natural sources such as the weathering of rock minerals and soils molinari et al 2015 moreover the dissimilatory so4 2 reduction by bacteria the activity of which follows the organic carbon content and produces hco3 leads to an increased ph especially in the rainy season miao et al 2012 in addition a relationship between mg2 and hco3 was not found thus olivines and pyroxenes are not likely to be present in the area bellia et al 2015 especially in the rainy season brockmann and janse 2008 kim and yun 2005 however the plot of ca2 and hco3 fig 9 a shows that most of the data fall above the 1 1 line especially for well nos 19 21 26 and 67 the ca2 hco3 ratios of both seasons are low ratio 1 which may be due to either ca2 depletion by cation exchange or hco3 enrichment most of the points are placed below the 1 1 line in the comparison of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 fig 9b indicating the dominance of silicate weathering kumar et al 2008 with the exception of well nos 21 and 67 which exhibit a reverse ion exchange shifting to the left due to excess of ca2 and mg2 moreover well nos 7 47 and 40 in the rainy season and well nos 2 42 and 46 in the summer season are close to the 1 1 line thus these wells are affected by the dissolution of calcite and dolomite sonkamble et al 2012 the results are plotted as na versus cl in a diagram fig 9c all of the samples are below the theoretical 1 1 line implying excess na these high levels of na are mainly derived from silicate weathering which potentially involves by the weathering of soda feldspar albite and potash feldspars orthoclase and microcline kumar et al 2008 with the exception of well no 67 which had high cl levels generally cl in basic volcanic rocks ranges from 5 9 to 112 9 mg l prada et al 2005 well no 67 reveals that cl in the rainy and summer seasons were 188 15 and 218 56 mg l respectively the 25th and 75th percentiles of cl were 6 22 and 27 95 mg l respectively in the rainy season and 6 42 and 29 74 mg l respectively in the summer season this finding is probably due to anthropogenic activites poor drainage and agricultural activities gui 2012 the cl concentrations of the other wells ranged from 1 07 60 35 mg l so the cl concentrations may result from the interaction of water with entrained volcanic gases bellia et al 2015 based on fig 9d the samples fall above the 1 1 line towards ca2 whereas well no 67 and a few samples including well nos 23 29 and 30 fall below the line this result indicates the carbonic acid contribution towards silicate dissolution in the study area raju et al 2015 earle 2015 as shown in eq 7 7 caa l 2 s i 2 o 8 h 2 c o 3 1 2 o 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 c a 2 c o 3 2 plagioclase carbonic acid kaolinite dissolved calcium carbonate ions silicate weathering can be understood by estimating the ratio of na k and total cations tz fig 9e most of the data in the rainy season are greater than 0 5 tz indicating alkali feldspar weathering on the other hand wells no 26 and 29 and some of the data in the summer season fall between 0 5 tz and 1 tz which is indicative of the other silicate minerals weathering and is mainly involved in the contribution of ฟsodium and potassium ions to groundwater fig 9f presents a plot of ca2 and mg2 versus total cations tz with a linear spread between 0 5 tz and 1 tz indicating that some of these ions resulted from the weathering of ca2 and mg2 rich minerals with the exception of well nos 26 and 29 in the rainy season and some of the data in the summer season greater than 0 5 tz indicate that these samples are rich in alkali feldspar kumar et al 2008 thus the groundwater composition is influenced by the weathering process of volcanic rocks that contain many minerals such as biotite hornblende muscovite sodium and calcium feldspars and quartz which is the dominant process in the study area qian et al 2016 furthermore many samples in the summer season show the dominant carbonate dissolution process generally po4 3 in young groundwater is less than 0 04 mg l morgenstern et al 2004 which is similar to the level found in most of wells in the summer season except well no 67 in addition some wells nos 7 13 19 46 56 62 and 67 exhibited increased po4 3 at concentrations greater than 13 mg l in the rainy season which was associated with sites with a high recharge rate wisittammasri and chotpantarat 2016 additionally phosphate is often associated with anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer use and can cause an increase in po4 3 in subsurface water especially in the rainy season andres and sims 2013 this study found that the relationship between po4 3 and hco3 was very weak which indirectly suggests that po4 3 is mainly derived from anthropogenic activities yadav et al 2014 in general reducing conditions low eh result in increased po4 3 concentrations zurawsky et al 2004 in general the br concentrations was typically less than 0 01 mg l flury and papritz 1993 the br concentration in the aquifers did not exceed the 0 1 mg l level found in the rainy season edmunds 1996 and ranged between 0 5 and 43 μg l in soil solutions the levels depended on the organic matter that can easily be leached from soil profiles wishkerman 2006 and the 25th and 75th percentiles of br were 0 01 and 0 04 mg l respectively in the rainy season and 0 75 and 1 11 mg l respectively in the summer season the increased br concentration in the summer season is likely the result of increased evapotranspiration edmunds 1996 furthermore the results from the correlation matrix and pca for both seasons revealed a strong relationship for mg2 with cl and br so these ions are likely influenced by the same source as previously mentioned the northeast of the study area in the lam phaya klang and lam somphung sub districts muak lek saraburi appears to have some potential gold ore deposits wongsamuth 2014 moreover halogens are generally enriched in rhyolites in volcanic rocks shinonaga et al 1994 volatile components in erupting silicate magmas mostly consist of methyl halides ch3cl and ch3br alcalá and custodio 2008 goni et al 2001 and the concentration of br in glassy volcanic andesite and rhyolitic rocks exceeds that in coarser igneous crystalline rocks aiuppa et al 2009 in addition a relationship between br and cl is widely observed in aquifers of the mesozoic age edmunds 1996 which was confirmed in the indosinian i orogeny where the volcano erupted simultaneously with an intrusion of andesite in the upper permian to triassic period department of groundwater resources 2007 both elements can occur in rather rare minerals such as embolite ag cl br iodobromite 2agcl 2agbr agi cerargyrite agcl and bromyrite agbr which are associated with galena pbs gianella 1941 in mineral veins and their alteration products hedenquist and lowenstern 1994 the natural background level of f in groundwater ranges between 3 6 and 15 mg l ducci and sellerino 2012 and commonly originates from the dissolution of various phosphates of fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f halides of fluorite caf2 and various silicates in volcanic ash such as hornblende and some micas which may contain f and have replaced some of the hydroxide component thus f in water is due to the weathering of volcanic and pyroclastic rocks hem 1985 singh et al 2011 and the 25th and 75th percentiles of f were 0 15 and 0 67 mg l respectively in the rainy season and 0 20 and 0 36 mg l respectively in the summer season the concentration of k ranged from 2 39 to 8 95 mg l also indicating silicate weathering esteller et al 2017 the 25th and 75th percentiles of k were 1 01 and 2 87 mg l respectively in the rainy season and 0 92 and 3 07 mg l respectively in the summer season shamsuddin et al 2016 reported that k could originate from rainfall rivers potash feldspar and micaceous minerals 0 1 8 mg l 4 conclusions the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater such as ph temperature and ec were increased in the summer compared with the rainy season most ions were present at higher concentrations in the summer season than in the rainy season in both aquifers the groundwater types of both aquifers mainly consisted of ca na hco3 ca hco3 and ca na hco3 ca hco3 in the rainy season whereas ca na hco3 na hco3 and ca hco3 were dominant in the summer season the redox potential eh in both seasons mainly revealed the prevailing oxidizing conditions and a high temperature was observed in the summer season based on pca the five main groups have a cumulative variance of greater than 76 11 and 77 88 in the rainy and in the summer seasons respectively the sources of ions are both natural factors such as silicate and calcite weathering and anthropogenic activities which is typical of irrigation water and sewage wastewater especially in the rainy season some of the wells are affected by anthropogenic activities especially well no 67 furthermore ion exchange was found which affects the ion concentrations as well the relationship between ca2 and po4 3 may be related to the dissolution of apatite and some wells exhibited a relatively higher concentration of po4 3 in the rainy season than in summer season which was associated with sites with a high recharge rate phosphate might be released from agricultural areas activities causing an increase in po4 3 in subsurface water especially in the rainy season although multivariate statistical analysis of the hydrogeochemical data was used to identify the preliminary sources of ions in the future this information will be used for further interpretation of stable isotope data collected from a previous study to aid in tracing the active processes that occur in the area thus these data may be an efficient tool to clearly separate different sources and various mechanisms of hydrogeochemistry in groundwater which would be of considerable benefit for the management of groundwater resources in the future credit authorship contribution statement wanlapa wisitthammasri data curation visualization investigation

8299,study region the medjerda is a transboundary catchment located in north eastern algeria and shared with tunisia study focus in this study we explore the causes of hydrological alteration of streamflow in a sub catchment of the medjerda in algeria the hydrological alteration was explored through the application of mann kendall test based on possible explanatory factors namely precipitation evapotranspiration temperature irrigation and normalized difference of vegetation index ndvi furthermore the causal factors of streamflow variation were addressed using convergent cross mapping ccm method new hydrological insights for the region results of the trend analysis yield that the streamflow is altered during the period 1981 2012 this is consistent with the trends of the possible explanatory factors of this alteration the convergent cross mapping ccm method showed that streamflow alteration is unidirectionally caused by changes in patterns of precipitation temperature evapotranspiration irrigation and ndvi and that there is little feedback from streamflow alteration to these causing factors overall our assessment showed that the method used to identify the causal relationships in dynamical systems based on the ccm algorithm is suitable for exploring the drivers of the hydrologic alteration in multivariate time series in particular when nonlinear dynamics determine the system keywords causality ccm hydrological alteration medjerda river trends 1 introduction the hydrological regime of a river strongly controls its different functions and ecosystem services land cover and climate change may significantly alter the hydrological regime milly et al 2005 barnett et al 2005 cohen liechti et al 2014 particularly in areas characterized by arid and semi arid climates such as the mediterranean region schilling et al 2012 in this region rainfall regimes have been altered by climatic and or physiographic characteristics strongly affecting the streamflow regime zamoum and souag gamane 2019 within the mediterreann region algeria and tunisia are considered as highly water stressed countries suffering from extreme water scarcity in recent decades fao 2018 schilling et al 2012 indeed algeria is facing low precipitation affected by high spatial and temporal variability low runoff high evapotranspiration and increased drought severity which will significantly reduce the streamflow of rivers the potential effects of climate change are expected to increase current pressures on water resources sellami et al 2016 as a result surface water and groundwater will be reduced with a direct effect on the allocation of water among sectors irrigation water supply and industry fao 2018 however climate change includes also alterations in temperature evapotranspiration vapor pressure and wind speed regimes that could conduct to structural changes of streamflow indirectly in addition other factors like land cover change dam construction and irrigation development also contribute to the hydrological alteration understanding the role of each possible causal factor on the hydrological alteration is pivotal and plays an important role in the agricultural development of the whole region the identification of the causal factors and their specific contribution to the hydrological alteration remains a challenging task several studies used correlation tests in multivariate time series to study causality including hydro climatic variables like temperature t precipitation p wind speed ws evapotranspiration et relative humidity h soil moisture sm normalized difference of vegetation index ndvi and streamflow q meng et al 2014 khazaei et al 2019 miao et al 2011 however the correlation criterion does not necessarily imply causation and vice versa it is neither necessary nor powerful for establishing a causal map of factors in multivariate time series contributing to the hydrologic alteration in particular when nonlinear dynamics determine the system van nes et al 2015 duan et al 2018 an alternative approach to identify causal relationships in dynamical systems is based on the convergent cross mapping ccm algorithm this approach is based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems developed by takens 1981 the ccm has recently been introduced in hydroclimatology to detect the causal effects of soil moisture on precipitation duan et al 2018 to quantify causal feedbacks in climate change van nes et al 2015 and to detect the causality of individual meteorological factors on local atmospheric pollution in china gao et al 2017 the ccm algorithm is particularly suitable to extract causality links from mirage correlation sugihara et al 2012 the ccm method has also the ability to detect time delayed causality and to distinguish causality in both directions from the phenomenon of synchrony influenced by strong unidirectional causation ye et al 2015 yet the efficiency and robustness of ccm algorithm compared to other causality detection methods need to be further explored the current study includes a comprehensive research on the detection of causal factors and their role on streamflow variations for an algerian sub catchment of the medjerda catchment the medjerda basin is a tunisian algerian transboundary basin subjected to hydrological alteration and water stress fehri et al 2019 the economy of the medjerda catchment depends largely on irrigated agriculture bouraoui et al 2005 the assessment of the hydrological alteration in addition to the identification of the causal factors using the ccm algorithm would be most valuable for long term water resources planning and management within the region the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the hydrological alteration of the medjerda river by assessing long term time series of possible explanatory factors using mann kendall change detection and trend analysis technic and 2 to identify and explain the causal relationships between possible explanatory factors and river flow using the ccm algorithm 2 study area the medjerda basin is located in northeast of algeria and northwest of tunisia the medjerda river is the longest river of the tunisian algerian transboundary basin with a total length of 485 km among which 135 km are situated in algeria the upstream part of the river basin is situated in the mountains of eastern algeria and includes ras alia mountain with a height of 1317 m the river subsequently flows into the northern part of tunisia and discharges in the mediterranean sea the medjerda basin has a total surface of 23 700 km2 among which 7 870 km2 are located in algeria fig 1 the water regime is typically mediterranean with a large mean seasonal flow variability the climate of the medjerda is characterized by a continental climate with mediterranean influence with warm summers and cold winters agriculture is the main economic activity within the medjerda basin the medjerda basin suffers from lack of consistent water management strategies and is highly affected by climate change and of water stress fehri et al 2019 showed that the level water stress reached 98 in 2012 upstream in the algerian side of the basin the ain dalia dam was built in 1987 along the mainstream the dam has a total capacity of 82 million m3 and is principally used for drinking and irrigation water supply in order to eliminate the anthropogenic effects of the dam construction in the analysis we limit the analysis to the sub catchment upstream of the ain dalia dam 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources in this study a long term hydroclimatic and environmental database was constructed from different sources the meteorological data were collected from a weather station monitored by the national meteorological office nmo of algeria that included precipitation and mean air temperature with respect to streamflow data were collected from a gauging station monitored by the national agency of hydraulic resources anrh table 1 fig 1 the hydroclimatic database was enriched with time series on et and ndvi both obtained from the google earth engine gee cloud based platform table 1 the modis et data is provided by the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac and estimates the terrestrial evapotranspiration at global scale the et estimates are computed following mu et al 2011 based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 at 500 m spatial resolution and at 8 day time step in our case data were aggregated at a monthly scale this product can be used to determine regional water and energy balances and the soil water status of basins hence it provides key information for water resource management the annual land cover lc maps were developed by the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci hollmann et al 2013 available at https maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer this dataset provides and describes continuous land cover changes at 300 m spatial resolution on a global scale from 1992 to 2015 li et al 2018 in order to evaluate irrigation water consumption irri at yearly scale the modis et 500 m remote sensing product was combined with land cover data irrigated lands fig 2 time series of ndvi were inferred from the landsat 5 top of atmosphere toa product the ndvi is generated from the near ir and red bands i e ndvi nir red nir red and ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 the ndvi data were created using google earth engine gee at 30 m spatial resolution and at monthly time scale for the entire medjerda basin 3 2 assessing water consumption for irrigation water supply in the study area water is pumped intensively mainly from the medjerda river and from aquifers for irrigation water supply this water pumping may be another causing factor of hydrological alteration and need therefore to be assessed however the official information about irrigation water withdrawal is not available yang et al 2018 showed that water consumption of different ecosystems could be estimated using different remote sensing evapotranspiration products furthermore zhao et al 2018 and fehri et al 2019 used modis et product as a surrogate for irrigation water consumption therefore in this study this product was adopted to estimate water consumption for irrigation in the medjerda sub catchment irrigated lands were identified from the land cover map cci lc 300 m irrigated lands and et fig 2 were combined in order to estimate monthly and yearly irrigation water consumption for the period 2000 2012 land cover and evapotranspiration products were resampled at a 100 m spatial resolution in order to reduce processing errors water consumption of irrigated lands in the entire basin was estimated from the product of the average water volume per pixel and the number of pixels yang et al 2018 fehri et al 2019 as follows 1 c i r r i g r s v p p n p where cirrig rs indicates water consumption of irrigated land vpp average irrigated water per pixel np the number of pixels for the calculation of water consumption the water efficiency in the medjerda catchment was considered and added to the estimated volume of evapotranspiration per month from irrigated lands the irrigation water efficiency in the study area is estimated to range from 55 to 40 with a decrease of 1 each year which signifies that 60 to 45 of irrigation water is lost in the system during the period 2000 2012 madr 2018 these losses include field seepage deep infiltration and conveyance losses in the irrigation system 3 3 trend analysis the mann kendall mk test the nonparametric mk test is applied for the detection of monotonic increasing or decreasing trends in the time series of hydroclimatic variables and possible explaining factors su et al 2018a khazaei et al 2019 the mk test has been widely used for trend analysis of hydrological time series mann 1945 kendall 1962 yue et al 2002 the slope of the trend is estimated in the time series using the non parametric method theil sen estimator developed by sen 1968 and theil 1992 the mk test was selected because of its robustness with respect for non normality the mk test has further the same power as its parametric competitors serrano et al 1999 the mk statistic s is given by 2 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i 3 s g n z 1 i f z 0 0 i f z 0 1 i f z 0 where x i and x j are the data value at times i and j n is the length of the data set under the null hypothesis that x i are independent and randomly ordered for n greater than 8 the statistic s is approximately normally distributed with zero mean and variance 4 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 n t i i i 1 2 i 5 18 where t i denotes the number of ties of extent i at the significance level 5 the existing trend is considered to be statistically signiﬁcant if p α 2 in the case of the two tailed test 3 4 convergent cross mapping ccm sugihara et al 2012 introduced the empirical convergent cross mapping ccm causal detection method to identify the causality in complex ecosystems associated with deterministic low dimensional and nonlinear dynamics the ccm method allows identifying causality between a couple of variables in a dynamical system based on nonlinear state space reconstruction takens 1981 it is based on the reciprocal prediction skills of two variables x and y ye et al 2015 extended the ccm method to involve time lagged predictions if x and y are interconnected in the same dynamical system the cross mapping between observed time series variables must converge which means that the cross mapping prediction skill improves with increasing library length chang et al 2017 this is due to the fact that more data in the library length produces the reconstructed manifold denser and the highly resolved attractor gives better accuracy of prediction on neighboring points chang et al 2017 convergence is therefore considered the main criterion to detect causal interactions wang et al 2018 based on a series of simple model experiments sugihara et al 2012 demonstrated that the ccm approach effectively detects mirage correlation and detects underlying causality a feedback connection can also be considered in ccm approach and allows thus revealing bilateral causality between time series variables sliva et al 2015 the ccm approach is therefore highly suitable for detecting bidirectional relationships between for instance streamflow and meteorological factors the ccm is based on generalized takens theorem saying that it should be possible to cross predict or cross map variables that belong to the same dynamical system consider two variables x and y that interact in a dynamical system then the univariate reconstructions based on x alone should uniquely identify the system state and thus the corresponding value of y and vice versa the ccm method was implemented by using the empirical dynamics modelling package within the r language environment redm https cran rproject org web packages redm vignettes redm tutorial html ye et al 2015 the analysis was based on monthly time series in the study area the following parameters are required to run the ccm method the dimensionality e i e the best embedding dimension needed to reconstruct the attractor the time delay τ and the number of nearest neighbor points to use for prediction n the value of e is varying from 1 or 10 a larger value of e induces more precise convergent maps the variable nearest neighbors are determined by e 1 the implementation procedure includes the following steps i standardize data sets standardizing a dataset involves rescaling the distribution of values so that the mean of observed values is 0 and the standard deviation is 1 standardization can be useful and even required in some machine learning algorithms when time series data have input values with different scales ii identify embedding dimension the best embedding dimension of the attractor is determined by evaluating the attractor s prediction skill for different embedding dimensions the prediction is done by using simplex projection using a nonlinear forecasting algorithm developed by sugihara and may 1990 the identification of the optimal embedding dimension e is computed using simplex projection technique from the redm package to individual time series in this method the ability of one variable to predict its own dynamics is estimated using different embedding dimensions values of e ranging from 1 to 10 the correlation coefficient ρ between predictions and observations represents the forecast skill and the optimal embedding dimension corresponds to the highest forecast skill selected by plotting predictability with respect to the embedding dimension in our case ccm analysis was computed using e 6 and τ 1 iii run convergent cross mapping using the ccm function let s consider two time series variables x and y and let s consider that they interact in the same dynamical system affected by a deterministic nonlinear process if a variable x is found to causally drive variable y then the signature about x should be encoded into the variable y the ccm method looks on to the time lagged affected variable y to see if it allows predicting the time lagged causal variable x using the delayed y coordinates my as lagged values of the affected variable the y attractor of the original manifold which governs the dynamics of y is reconstructed from the reconstructed shadow manifold of y if it is possible to predict the time series of x then the ccm algorithm concludes that y is indeed driven by x to test the predictability the nearest neighbor method called simplex projection is used in order to differentiate between correlation and causation a measurement of convergence is therefore used the following parameters are considered l the time series length the time series variable x x x 1 x 2 x l the time series variable y y y 1 y 2 y l mx my the shadow constructed manifolds of x y τ the time lag e the embedding dimension and ẋ t my the estimated variable x from cross mapping my the algorithm involves the following steps step 1 constructing the manifolds mx and my the shadow manifolds mx and my respectively are constructed for both variables x and y using the embedding dimension e this means that m x will be built based on x t x t 1 and x t 2 while my is constructed from y t y t 1 and y t 2 step 2 cross mapping from m x to m y x xmap y or from m y to m x y xmap x this step consists in selecting and locating for each t y t the contemporaneous lagged coordinate vector on my and identify its e 1 nearest neighbors points on the attractor subsequently the distance matrix measuring euclidean distances to the reference point is calculated if there is a one to one mapping between mx and my then the time indices t will detect the nearest neighbor points to mx and y is determined to drive x step 3 affect each of the time indices from the closest to the farthest of y t by t1 te 1 these time indices corresponding to the nearest neighbors to y t on my are used to locate points neighbors in x and to identify x t from a locally weighted mean of the e 1 x ti values step 4 if the coupled variables interact dynamically then nearby points in mx could be able to identify nearby points in my thus they are causally related and x is influencing y this whole process is conducted with different length size l of the data library step 5 finally ccm method is applied to test for causal interaction between variables and assess the extent to which the historical record of the affected variable y reliably estimates states of a causal variable x which is measured with the pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and observed x if the skill forecast of cross mapping increases with respect to the library of the time series the unidirectional causal effect of x on y can be deduced the relative level to which predictive skill converges can be interpreted as an estimator of the strength of the causal relationship convergence occurs with additional data as the underlying attractor manifold becomes denser and nearest neighbors get closer in our study the ccm method has been applied to monthly time series of p t et ndvi irri and q the causality is consequently revealed if the forecast skill ρ value converges with the length l of time series library conversely no causation is detected between the two variables when no convergence appears with increasing library size the power of influences exerted from one variable on another variable is evaluated by the value of cross map skill ρ value between estimated and observed values this skill ranges from 0 to 1 the ccm algorithm was used to explore the causal relationships of p q t q et q irr q and ndvi q respectively 4 results 4 1 trend detection analysis results of mann kendall trend analysis of streamflow q precipitation p temperature t evapotranspiration et normalized difference of vegetation index ndvi and irrigation irri are shown in fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3a a statistically significant downward trend significance level 5 is detected for the mean annual of p the trend magnitude yields 11 5 mm year across the study area and therefore a significant reduction of p has been identified it reveals that the rainfall pattern is altered over time which is consistent with current climate change projections for the region where precipitation is likely to decrease between 10 and 20 schilling et al 2012 fig 3b shows that a significant decrease trend is also observed for the annual q for the period 1981 2012 the trend magnitude assessed by means of the sen s slope yields 0 020 m3 s year we can therefore confirm that the hydrologic regime of the medjerda river has been significantly affected during the study period the consistency between the negative trends of p and q suggests further that the change in p contributes to the river flow alteration in the upstream region of the medjerda catchment fig 3c shows a statistically significant upward trend for mean annual temperature from 1981 to 2012 the trend magnitude reaches 0 056 c year this is therefore consistent with the projected rise of temperature between 2 and 3 c by 2050 as reported by chourghal et al 2016 the annual et trend reported in fig 3d also shows a statistically significant upward trend the sens s slope confirms that the et has increased by about 0 150 mm year as shown in fig 3e the mean annual ndvi in the upstream sub catchment indicates a significant upward trend from 1984 to 2012 the trend magnitude reaches 0 001 year finally as shown in fig 3f mean irri is also increasing from 2000 to 2012 in the upstream areas of medjerda the magnitude of the significant trend in irri 0 004 mm3 year the time series of irri displays significant seasonal patterns with an increase during spring and summer seasons respectively followed by decrease in autumn and winter season the highest value of water consumption in area study was reported in june 2012 7 057 mm3 4 2 ccm analysis forecast skill ρ value maps for each possible causal factor of q are shown in fig 4 the estimation forecast skill denoted by ρ value is quantified by calculating the pearson s correlation coefficient between observed and predicted values in dynamical hydrological systems the causation of p in q is well known fig 4a confirms that cross mapping q from p detects correctly that p drives q fig 4a the ccm method exhibits convergence with increasing library length demonstrating causation between the p and q ρ 0 59 hence high p in the medjerda basin is likely to cause high q the correlation coefficient for the cross map of q from p reach a high value of rho the significant statistical correlation ρ 0 59 reveals that p exerts influences on q directly as would be expected in contrast the cross mapping of p from q precipitation xmap streamflow shows little convergence and therefore the method detects that q obviously does not drive p the ccm method detects also that ndvi exerts a moderate influence on q since the cross map of q from ndvi converges to medium value ρ 0 49 the cross map ndvi from q has no significant feedback effect on q ρ 0 28 which suggest that the causation of ndvi to q is unidirectional fig 4b with respect to et fig 4c shows that et also drives q strong convergence is depicted with increasing library length ρ 0 45 the small feedback also suggests unilateral causation unilateral causation implies also that time series of q in the river holds enough information to predict et and hence that the reconstructed manifold of q contains enough information to predict et the ccm method shows further strong convergence with increasing library length between t and q indeed the correlation coefficient for the cross map of q from t reaches a high value of rho ρ 0 56 while q has no significant feedback effect on t fig 4d convergence suggests therefore that q is causally forced by t with respect to irri fig 4e shows that irri also drives q the ccm algorithm show indeed strong convergence well pronounced with increasing library length between irri and q indeed the ccm also exhibit a strong coupling between the variables within the system irri q as observed by high cross map skills correlation coefficient for the cross map of q from irri reach a high value of rho ρ 0 60 while the cross map irri from q has a weak feedback effect ρ 0 28 fig 4e generally the ccm results show that q is forced by p t et ndvi and irri and that there are little feedback effects of q on the possible driving factors 5 discussion 5 1 identification of the hydrological alteration the results show that the hydrological regime of the upstream part of the medjerda changed in the past decades the detected hydrologic alteration will affect and reduce directly the freshwater availability and increase the trend of extreme events droughts and floods ludwig et al 2011 the streamflow analysis trend using mann kendall test reveals a significant decrease of q with a magnitude of 0 020 m³ s year between 1981 and 2012 fig 3 b this change is in agreement with the findings of lespinas et al 2014 and sellami et al 2016 who also revealed significant decreases in annual streamflow over time for their studied mediterranean catchments precipitation time series show also a decreasing trend of 11 521 mm year fig 3 a and exhibit a similar dynamic pattern as the streamflow pattern the alteration of streamflow is indeed generally dominated by precipitation variability alkama et al 2011 according to dai et al 2009 precipitation decreased already over many low and mid latitude areas inducing the decrease in streamflow over the period 1948 2004 the t time series are increasing during the period 1981 2012 with 0 056 c year fig 3 c increased temperature may support plant growth and may modify the absorption of water and the interception during the growth phase which on its turn will influence the infiltration and runoff as reported by sellami et al 2016 results under climate change projections suggest that trends over mediterranean basins southern france and northeastern tunisia are likely to experience a decrease in rainfall regime and increase in air temperature our results for the studied catchment upstream of the medjerda are therefore consistent with these projections in coherence with the positive trends of t et is also following an increasing trend during the period 2000 2012 fig 3 d these changes are consistent with the results from trambaly et al 2019 who found that mediterranean basins are under an increase of t and et over time the ndvi time series were used to reflect vegetation change in the sub catchment of medjerda results obtained from landsat yield an increasing trend of 0 001 year fig 3 e during 1984 2012 in contrast to previous factors positive ndvi trends are mainly attributed to human interventions such as extension farmlands and irrigation activities which impact the ndvi directly in the studied catchment similarly irrigation water consumption is following a significant upward trend during the period 2000 2012 with a magnitude of 0 004 mm³ year fig 3 f this is mainly due to the intensive water abstraction dedicated to agriculture which is the largest economic activity in the region the irrigation water abstraction is primarily targeted from the medjerda river as the groundwater resources in the region are overexploited and therefore remain insufficient to support the local agricultural activities it is worth noting that even with robust statistics of the trend analysis of et and irri these results should be taken with caution since we are dealing with time series of 13 years which is considered as a relatively short data set for such analysis we conclude that the hydrological alteration of q is concurrent with a decreasing trend in p and an increasing trend of t et ndvi and irri over time in the study area however the relationship may induce complex dynamics for instance increasing transpiration and evaporation may also increase local p as t and p both interact in the atmosphere system gampe et al 2016 t and thus these interactions are therefore further investigated with the ccm method to identify and quantify the strength of causal relationships between q on the one hand and p t et ndvi and irri on the other hand 5 2 causal relationships analysis the assessment of the causal factors of streamflow using the ccm method show that q is forced by p t et ndvi and irri however it remains difficult to extract one main influential driving force for q despite the fact that the ccm method uses advanced non linear algorithms to assess the causality and its strengths it is not easy to discriminate between irri ndvi et p and t as major driving forcing term on q alteration it is also shown that there is feedback of q on driving factors feed back could be induced by different processes for instance when et increase local humidity can increase favoring the genesis of local rain hence feed back mechanisms between driving factors and q should not be excluded a priori yet in the studied catchment the feed back of q on possible driving force is rather low but not negligible the small feed back can partially be explained by the size of the study catchment which remains rather small as identified in fig 4 a e the ρ value increases for p et ndvi irr and t with the length of the library the convergence is pronounced indicating therefore significant causal effects of p t et irri and ndvi on q hence based on the ccm prediction procedure measuring the forecast skill of q on possible driving factors the causal strengths have been quantified and are significant for all factors yet they situate in the same order of magnitude and currently no robust test value is available to accept or reject the causality based on the strength of the prediction skill the significant forecast skill of q on p reveals obviously that p exerts a direct influence on q as would be expected the alteration in the p regime of the studied catchment can therefore produce a significant contribution to the alteration of q the strength of t causing q is in contrast to the study of su et al 2018 who reported that the increase in t has more effect on q than p it should also be noted that an increase in t may reduce the relative humidity and hence reduce the probability of rainfall genesis in the studied catchment the increased t will not necessarily lead locally to an increased p further q is projected to decrease when et increase fig 3 d mccabe and wolock 2011 et is indeed pivotal for studying the hydrological balance but the impact of et on q depends also on the balance between p and et gampe et al 2016 for instance the q alteration in areas where p is largely superior to et will be less influenced by changes in low p rates in these cases q will be more influenced by changes in high p rates that may induce flooding and increased erosion this will be different in areas where et is higher than p like in our study in such areas extreme droughts linked to increasing t could reduce q yet when p is less than et the increase or reduction in p does not necessarily improve reduce runoff directly similarly as in our study gampe et al 2016 and tramblay et al 2019 explored the impacts of evapotranspiration change on q in a mediterranean basins they found that et change was the main important driver causing a reduction in soil moisture and annual streamflow further as described by moraes et al 1998 the changes in the land use and land cover in particular irrigation can modify the hydrological regime indeed the increase in t in the studied semi arid region could induce more et from irrigated croplands substantially increasing the demand for water extracted from rivers dams reservoir and aquifers for irrigation agriculture all this logically potentially reduces q hence irri played an important role in streamflow reduction and this has also been confirmed by zhang et al 2015 who indicated that the expansion of farmland areas associated with increasing irri leads to declined streamflow the observed upward trend of irri is consistent with population growth in the area during the 2000 2012 period such population growth increase the demand for food and water on the national and regional scale schilling et al 2012 and induce a rapid expansion of irrigated lands population growth is therefore considered as a driving force in the demand for water and it has increased rapidly in many areas especially in africa contributing to the decreases in streamflow su et al 2018b the increased irrigation water abstraction affecting streamflow agree with results found with the study of gebremicael et al 2019 they reported that the hydrological alteration of streamflow is attributed to land management change converted into cultivable area in the northern part of ethiopia and due to an increase of irrigation water withdrawals the joint effect of the different individual factors is more difficult to elucidate with the ccm analysis indeed the increase of t fig 3 c and the reduction of p fig 3 a may jointly cause the observed reduction of q fig 3 b in the upstream part of the medjerda catchment this would be consistent with the findings of gampe et al 2016 who reported that q is positively correlated with the p and negatively correlated with the t also the increase of et s effect in our study cannot be easily separated from t and ndvi s effect increasing t may indeed induce a water deficit over irrigated agriculture produced by increasing et losses thus increasing plant water stress and desiccation which influences the vegetation growth through photosynthesis this would be consistent with the findings of yuan et al 2017 who stated that warming trends caused by high t could lead to the increase of potential et and finally a decrease of ndvi all of which contribute to streamflow alteration yet it still can be shown that the hydrological alteration of q can be fairly well explained by direct human activities such as changes in catchment characteristics including expansion of land cover and land use dynamics this is consistent with other studies considering that anthropogenic impacts caused by reservoir irrigation agricultural activity and channel irrigation exert important influences streamflow alteration considerably xue et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 2015 miao et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 6 conclusion in this study the hydrological alteration of streamflow and its causes was explored for the medjerda upstream sub catchment north east of algeria using mann kendall mk trend analysis and nonlinear timeseries analysis tool convergent cross mapping ccm the major conclusions are as follows 1 the streamflow q in the study area showed a significant decreasing trend during the period 1981 2012 with a magnitude of 0 020 m³ s year thus a significant hydrological alteration of the upstream part of the medjerda river was observed the trends of possible explanatory factors were also assessed similar and different trend behaviors to q were found i e a decrease of p 11 521 mm year and an increase of t et ndvi and irri with magnitudes of 0 056 c year 0 150 mm year 0 001 year and 0 004 mm³ year respectively 2 the causality analysis using ccm revealed causal links between q and p t et irri and ndvi the causal link between p and q were consistent with the decreasing trend of p and q the causality between t et and q can be related to the increasing trends of t and et furthermore a strong causal effect of ndvi and irri on q was observed which also is consistent with the statistical trend analysis 3 it is concluded that both climate change and human activities mainly agricultural development and irrigation are the dominant causal processes that altered the hydrological regime in the medjerda river this suggests the implementation of better operational integrated water resources plans in the region in order to reduce the pressure exerted on the medjerda river as an important water resource in the

8299,study region the medjerda is a transboundary catchment located in north eastern algeria and shared with tunisia study focus in this study we explore the causes of hydrological alteration of streamflow in a sub catchment of the medjerda in algeria the hydrological alteration was explored through the application of mann kendall test based on possible explanatory factors namely precipitation evapotranspiration temperature irrigation and normalized difference of vegetation index ndvi furthermore the causal factors of streamflow variation were addressed using convergent cross mapping ccm method new hydrological insights for the region results of the trend analysis yield that the streamflow is altered during the period 1981 2012 this is consistent with the trends of the possible explanatory factors of this alteration the convergent cross mapping ccm method showed that streamflow alteration is unidirectionally caused by changes in patterns of precipitation temperature evapotranspiration irrigation and ndvi and that there is little feedback from streamflow alteration to these causing factors overall our assessment showed that the method used to identify the causal relationships in dynamical systems based on the ccm algorithm is suitable for exploring the drivers of the hydrologic alteration in multivariate time series in particular when nonlinear dynamics determine the system keywords causality ccm hydrological alteration medjerda river trends 1 introduction the hydrological regime of a river strongly controls its different functions and ecosystem services land cover and climate change may significantly alter the hydrological regime milly et al 2005 barnett et al 2005 cohen liechti et al 2014 particularly in areas characterized by arid and semi arid climates such as the mediterranean region schilling et al 2012 in this region rainfall regimes have been altered by climatic and or physiographic characteristics strongly affecting the streamflow regime zamoum and souag gamane 2019 within the mediterreann region algeria and tunisia are considered as highly water stressed countries suffering from extreme water scarcity in recent decades fao 2018 schilling et al 2012 indeed algeria is facing low precipitation affected by high spatial and temporal variability low runoff high evapotranspiration and increased drought severity which will significantly reduce the streamflow of rivers the potential effects of climate change are expected to increase current pressures on water resources sellami et al 2016 as a result surface water and groundwater will be reduced with a direct effect on the allocation of water among sectors irrigation water supply and industry fao 2018 however climate change includes also alterations in temperature evapotranspiration vapor pressure and wind speed regimes that could conduct to structural changes of streamflow indirectly in addition other factors like land cover change dam construction and irrigation development also contribute to the hydrological alteration understanding the role of each possible causal factor on the hydrological alteration is pivotal and plays an important role in the agricultural development of the whole region the identification of the causal factors and their specific contribution to the hydrological alteration remains a challenging task several studies used correlation tests in multivariate time series to study causality including hydro climatic variables like temperature t precipitation p wind speed ws evapotranspiration et relative humidity h soil moisture sm normalized difference of vegetation index ndvi and streamflow q meng et al 2014 khazaei et al 2019 miao et al 2011 however the correlation criterion does not necessarily imply causation and vice versa it is neither necessary nor powerful for establishing a causal map of factors in multivariate time series contributing to the hydrologic alteration in particular when nonlinear dynamics determine the system van nes et al 2015 duan et al 2018 an alternative approach to identify causal relationships in dynamical systems is based on the convergent cross mapping ccm algorithm this approach is based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems developed by takens 1981 the ccm has recently been introduced in hydroclimatology to detect the causal effects of soil moisture on precipitation duan et al 2018 to quantify causal feedbacks in climate change van nes et al 2015 and to detect the causality of individual meteorological factors on local atmospheric pollution in china gao et al 2017 the ccm algorithm is particularly suitable to extract causality links from mirage correlation sugihara et al 2012 the ccm method has also the ability to detect time delayed causality and to distinguish causality in both directions from the phenomenon of synchrony influenced by strong unidirectional causation ye et al 2015 yet the efficiency and robustness of ccm algorithm compared to other causality detection methods need to be further explored the current study includes a comprehensive research on the detection of causal factors and their role on streamflow variations for an algerian sub catchment of the medjerda catchment the medjerda basin is a tunisian algerian transboundary basin subjected to hydrological alteration and water stress fehri et al 2019 the economy of the medjerda catchment depends largely on irrigated agriculture bouraoui et al 2005 the assessment of the hydrological alteration in addition to the identification of the causal factors using the ccm algorithm would be most valuable for long term water resources planning and management within the region the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the hydrological alteration of the medjerda river by assessing long term time series of possible explanatory factors using mann kendall change detection and trend analysis technic and 2 to identify and explain the causal relationships between possible explanatory factors and river flow using the ccm algorithm 2 study area the medjerda basin is located in northeast of algeria and northwest of tunisia the medjerda river is the longest river of the tunisian algerian transboundary basin with a total length of 485 km among which 135 km are situated in algeria the upstream part of the river basin is situated in the mountains of eastern algeria and includes ras alia mountain with a height of 1317 m the river subsequently flows into the northern part of tunisia and discharges in the mediterranean sea the medjerda basin has a total surface of 23 700 km2 among which 7 870 km2 are located in algeria fig 1 the water regime is typically mediterranean with a large mean seasonal flow variability the climate of the medjerda is characterized by a continental climate with mediterranean influence with warm summers and cold winters agriculture is the main economic activity within the medjerda basin the medjerda basin suffers from lack of consistent water management strategies and is highly affected by climate change and of water stress fehri et al 2019 showed that the level water stress reached 98 in 2012 upstream in the algerian side of the basin the ain dalia dam was built in 1987 along the mainstream the dam has a total capacity of 82 million m3 and is principally used for drinking and irrigation water supply in order to eliminate the anthropogenic effects of the dam construction in the analysis we limit the analysis to the sub catchment upstream of the ain dalia dam 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources in this study a long term hydroclimatic and environmental database was constructed from different sources the meteorological data were collected from a weather station monitored by the national meteorological office nmo of algeria that included precipitation and mean air temperature with respect to streamflow data were collected from a gauging station monitored by the national agency of hydraulic resources anrh table 1 fig 1 the hydroclimatic database was enriched with time series on et and ndvi both obtained from the google earth engine gee cloud based platform table 1 the modis et data is provided by the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac and estimates the terrestrial evapotranspiration at global scale the et estimates are computed following mu et al 2011 based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 at 500 m spatial resolution and at 8 day time step in our case data were aggregated at a monthly scale this product can be used to determine regional water and energy balances and the soil water status of basins hence it provides key information for water resource management the annual land cover lc maps were developed by the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci hollmann et al 2013 available at https maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer this dataset provides and describes continuous land cover changes at 300 m spatial resolution on a global scale from 1992 to 2015 li et al 2018 in order to evaluate irrigation water consumption irri at yearly scale the modis et 500 m remote sensing product was combined with land cover data irrigated lands fig 2 time series of ndvi were inferred from the landsat 5 top of atmosphere toa product the ndvi is generated from the near ir and red bands i e ndvi nir red nir red and ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 the ndvi data were created using google earth engine gee at 30 m spatial resolution and at monthly time scale for the entire medjerda basin 3 2 assessing water consumption for irrigation water supply in the study area water is pumped intensively mainly from the medjerda river and from aquifers for irrigation water supply this water pumping may be another causing factor of hydrological alteration and need therefore to be assessed however the official information about irrigation water withdrawal is not available yang et al 2018 showed that water consumption of different ecosystems could be estimated using different remote sensing evapotranspiration products furthermore zhao et al 2018 and fehri et al 2019 used modis et product as a surrogate for irrigation water consumption therefore in this study this product was adopted to estimate water consumption for irrigation in the medjerda sub catchment irrigated lands were identified from the land cover map cci lc 300 m irrigated lands and et fig 2 were combined in order to estimate monthly and yearly irrigation water consumption for the period 2000 2012 land cover and evapotranspiration products were resampled at a 100 m spatial resolution in order to reduce processing errors water consumption of irrigated lands in the entire basin was estimated from the product of the average water volume per pixel and the number of pixels yang et al 2018 fehri et al 2019 as follows 1 c i r r i g r s v p p n p where cirrig rs indicates water consumption of irrigated land vpp average irrigated water per pixel np the number of pixels for the calculation of water consumption the water efficiency in the medjerda catchment was considered and added to the estimated volume of evapotranspiration per month from irrigated lands the irrigation water efficiency in the study area is estimated to range from 55 to 40 with a decrease of 1 each year which signifies that 60 to 45 of irrigation water is lost in the system during the period 2000 2012 madr 2018 these losses include field seepage deep infiltration and conveyance losses in the irrigation system 3 3 trend analysis the mann kendall mk test the nonparametric mk test is applied for the detection of monotonic increasing or decreasing trends in the time series of hydroclimatic variables and possible explaining factors su et al 2018a khazaei et al 2019 the mk test has been widely used for trend analysis of hydrological time series mann 1945 kendall 1962 yue et al 2002 the slope of the trend is estimated in the time series using the non parametric method theil sen estimator developed by sen 1968 and theil 1992 the mk test was selected because of its robustness with respect for non normality the mk test has further the same power as its parametric competitors serrano et al 1999 the mk statistic s is given by 2 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i 3 s g n z 1 i f z 0 0 i f z 0 1 i f z 0 where x i and x j are the data value at times i and j n is the length of the data set under the null hypothesis that x i are independent and randomly ordered for n greater than 8 the statistic s is approximately normally distributed with zero mean and variance 4 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 n t i i i 1 2 i 5 18 where t i denotes the number of ties of extent i at the significance level 5 the existing trend is considered to be statistically signiﬁcant if p α 2 in the case of the two tailed test 3 4 convergent cross mapping ccm sugihara et al 2012 introduced the empirical convergent cross mapping ccm causal detection method to identify the causality in complex ecosystems associated with deterministic low dimensional and nonlinear dynamics the ccm method allows identifying causality between a couple of variables in a dynamical system based on nonlinear state space reconstruction takens 1981 it is based on the reciprocal prediction skills of two variables x and y ye et al 2015 extended the ccm method to involve time lagged predictions if x and y are interconnected in the same dynamical system the cross mapping between observed time series variables must converge which means that the cross mapping prediction skill improves with increasing library length chang et al 2017 this is due to the fact that more data in the library length produces the reconstructed manifold denser and the highly resolved attractor gives better accuracy of prediction on neighboring points chang et al 2017 convergence is therefore considered the main criterion to detect causal interactions wang et al 2018 based on a series of simple model experiments sugihara et al 2012 demonstrated that the ccm approach effectively detects mirage correlation and detects underlying causality a feedback connection can also be considered in ccm approach and allows thus revealing bilateral causality between time series variables sliva et al 2015 the ccm approach is therefore highly suitable for detecting bidirectional relationships between for instance streamflow and meteorological factors the ccm is based on generalized takens theorem saying that it should be possible to cross predict or cross map variables that belong to the same dynamical system consider two variables x and y that interact in a dynamical system then the univariate reconstructions based on x alone should uniquely identify the system state and thus the corresponding value of y and vice versa the ccm method was implemented by using the empirical dynamics modelling package within the r language environment redm https cran rproject org web packages redm vignettes redm tutorial html ye et al 2015 the analysis was based on monthly time series in the study area the following parameters are required to run the ccm method the dimensionality e i e the best embedding dimension needed to reconstruct the attractor the time delay τ and the number of nearest neighbor points to use for prediction n the value of e is varying from 1 or 10 a larger value of e induces more precise convergent maps the variable nearest neighbors are determined by e 1 the implementation procedure includes the following steps i standardize data sets standardizing a dataset involves rescaling the distribution of values so that the mean of observed values is 0 and the standard deviation is 1 standardization can be useful and even required in some machine learning algorithms when time series data have input values with different scales ii identify embedding dimension the best embedding dimension of the attractor is determined by evaluating the attractor s prediction skill for different embedding dimensions the prediction is done by using simplex projection using a nonlinear forecasting algorithm developed by sugihara and may 1990 the identification of the optimal embedding dimension e is computed using simplex projection technique from the redm package to individual time series in this method the ability of one variable to predict its own dynamics is estimated using different embedding dimensions values of e ranging from 1 to 10 the correlation coefficient ρ between predictions and observations represents the forecast skill and the optimal embedding dimension corresponds to the highest forecast skill selected by plotting predictability with respect to the embedding dimension in our case ccm analysis was computed using e 6 and τ 1 iii run convergent cross mapping using the ccm function let s consider two time series variables x and y and let s consider that they interact in the same dynamical system affected by a deterministic nonlinear process if a variable x is found to causally drive variable y then the signature about x should be encoded into the variable y the ccm method looks on to the time lagged affected variable y to see if it allows predicting the time lagged causal variable x using the delayed y coordinates my as lagged values of the affected variable the y attractor of the original manifold which governs the dynamics of y is reconstructed from the reconstructed shadow manifold of y if it is possible to predict the time series of x then the ccm algorithm concludes that y is indeed driven by x to test the predictability the nearest neighbor method called simplex projection is used in order to differentiate between correlation and causation a measurement of convergence is therefore used the following parameters are considered l the time series length the time series variable x x x 1 x 2 x l the time series variable y y y 1 y 2 y l mx my the shadow constructed manifolds of x y τ the time lag e the embedding dimension and ẋ t my the estimated variable x from cross mapping my the algorithm involves the following steps step 1 constructing the manifolds mx and my the shadow manifolds mx and my respectively are constructed for both variables x and y using the embedding dimension e this means that m x will be built based on x t x t 1 and x t 2 while my is constructed from y t y t 1 and y t 2 step 2 cross mapping from m x to m y x xmap y or from m y to m x y xmap x this step consists in selecting and locating for each t y t the contemporaneous lagged coordinate vector on my and identify its e 1 nearest neighbors points on the attractor subsequently the distance matrix measuring euclidean distances to the reference point is calculated if there is a one to one mapping between mx and my then the time indices t will detect the nearest neighbor points to mx and y is determined to drive x step 3 affect each of the time indices from the closest to the farthest of y t by t1 te 1 these time indices corresponding to the nearest neighbors to y t on my are used to locate points neighbors in x and to identify x t from a locally weighted mean of the e 1 x ti values step 4 if the coupled variables interact dynamically then nearby points in mx could be able to identify nearby points in my thus they are causally related and x is influencing y this whole process is conducted with different length size l of the data library step 5 finally ccm method is applied to test for causal interaction between variables and assess the extent to which the historical record of the affected variable y reliably estimates states of a causal variable x which is measured with the pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and observed x if the skill forecast of cross mapping increases with respect to the library of the time series the unidirectional causal effect of x on y can be deduced the relative level to which predictive skill converges can be interpreted as an estimator of the strength of the causal relationship convergence occurs with additional data as the underlying attractor manifold becomes denser and nearest neighbors get closer in our study the ccm method has been applied to monthly time series of p t et ndvi irri and q the causality is consequently revealed if the forecast skill ρ value converges with the length l of time series library conversely no causation is detected between the two variables when no convergence appears with increasing library size the power of influences exerted from one variable on another variable is evaluated by the value of cross map skill ρ value between estimated and observed values this skill ranges from 0 to 1 the ccm algorithm was used to explore the causal relationships of p q t q et q irr q and ndvi q respectively 4 results 4 1 trend detection analysis results of mann kendall trend analysis of streamflow q precipitation p temperature t evapotranspiration et normalized difference of vegetation index ndvi and irrigation irri are shown in fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3a a statistically significant downward trend significance level 5 is detected for the mean annual of p the trend magnitude yields 11 5 mm year across the study area and therefore a significant reduction of p has been identified it reveals that the rainfall pattern is altered over time which is consistent with current climate change projections for the region where precipitation is likely to decrease between 10 and 20 schilling et al 2012 fig 3b shows that a significant decrease trend is also observed for the annual q for the period 1981 2012 the trend magnitude assessed by means of the sen s slope yields 0 020 m3 s year we can therefore confirm that the hydrologic regime of the medjerda river has been significantly affected during the study period the consistency between the negative trends of p and q suggests further that the change in p contributes to the river flow alteration in the upstream region of the medjerda catchment fig 3c shows a statistically significant upward trend for mean annual temperature from 1981 to 2012 the trend magnitude reaches 0 056 c year this is therefore consistent with the projected rise of temperature between 2 and 3 c by 2050 as reported by chourghal et al 2016 the annual et trend reported in fig 3d also shows a statistically significant upward trend the sens s slope confirms that the et has increased by about 0 150 mm year as shown in fig 3e the mean annual ndvi in the upstream sub catchment indicates a significant upward trend from 1984 to 2012 the trend magnitude reaches 0 001 year finally as shown in fig 3f mean irri is also increasing from 2000 to 2012 in the upstream areas of medjerda the magnitude of the significant trend in irri 0 004 mm3 year the time series of irri displays significant seasonal patterns with an increase during spring and summer seasons respectively followed by decrease in autumn and winter season the highest value of water consumption in area study was reported in june 2012 7 057 mm3 4 2 ccm analysis forecast skill ρ value maps for each possible causal factor of q are shown in fig 4 the estimation forecast skill denoted by ρ value is quantified by calculating the pearson s correlation coefficient between observed and predicted values in dynamical hydrological systems the causation of p in q is well known fig 4a confirms that cross mapping q from p detects correctly that p drives q fig 4a the ccm method exhibits convergence with increasing library length demonstrating causation between the p and q ρ 0 59 hence high p in the medjerda basin is likely to cause high q the correlation coefficient for the cross map of q from p reach a high value of rho the significant statistical correlation ρ 0 59 reveals that p exerts influences on q directly as would be expected in contrast the cross mapping of p from q precipitation xmap streamflow shows little convergence and therefore the method detects that q obviously does not drive p the ccm method detects also that ndvi exerts a moderate influence on q since the cross map of q from ndvi converges to medium value ρ 0 49 the cross map ndvi from q has no significant feedback effect on q ρ 0 28 which suggest that the causation of ndvi to q is unidirectional fig 4b with respect to et fig 4c shows that et also drives q strong convergence is depicted with increasing library length ρ 0 45 the small feedback also suggests unilateral causation unilateral causation implies also that time series of q in the river holds enough information to predict et and hence that the reconstructed manifold of q contains enough information to predict et the ccm method shows further strong convergence with increasing library length between t and q indeed the correlation coefficient for the cross map of q from t reaches a high value of rho ρ 0 56 while q has no significant feedback effect on t fig 4d convergence suggests therefore that q is causally forced by t with respect to irri fig 4e shows that irri also drives q the ccm algorithm show indeed strong convergence well pronounced with increasing library length between irri and q indeed the ccm also exhibit a strong coupling between the variables within the system irri q as observed by high cross map skills correlation coefficient for the cross map of q from irri reach a high value of rho ρ 0 60 while the cross map irri from q has a weak feedback effect ρ 0 28 fig 4e generally the ccm results show that q is forced by p t et ndvi and irri and that there are little feedback effects of q on the possible driving factors 5 discussion 5 1 identification of the hydrological alteration the results show that the hydrological regime of the upstream part of the medjerda changed in the past decades the detected hydrologic alteration will affect and reduce directly the freshwater availability and increase the trend of extreme events droughts and floods ludwig et al 2011 the streamflow analysis trend using mann kendall test reveals a significant decrease of q with a magnitude of 0 020 m³ s year between 1981 and 2012 fig 3 b this change is in agreement with the findings of lespinas et al 2014 and sellami et al 2016 who also revealed significant decreases in annual streamflow over time for their studied mediterranean catchments precipitation time series show also a decreasing trend of 11 521 mm year fig 3 a and exhibit a similar dynamic pattern as the streamflow pattern the alteration of streamflow is indeed generally dominated by precipitation variability alkama et al 2011 according to dai et al 2009 precipitation decreased already over many low and mid latitude areas inducing the decrease in streamflow over the period 1948 2004 the t time series are increasing during the period 1981 2012 with 0 056 c year fig 3 c increased temperature may support plant growth and may modify the absorption of water and the interception during the growth phase which on its turn will influence the infiltration and runoff as reported by sellami et al 2016 results under climate change projections suggest that trends over mediterranean basins southern france and northeastern tunisia are likely to experience a decrease in rainfall regime and increase in air temperature our results for the studied catchment upstream of the medjerda are therefore consistent with these projections in coherence with the positive trends of t et is also following an increasing trend during the period 2000 2012 fig 3 d these changes are consistent with the results from trambaly et al 2019 who found that mediterranean basins are under an increase of t and et over time the ndvi time series were used to reflect vegetation change in the sub catchment of medjerda results obtained from landsat yield an increasing trend of 0 001 year fig 3 e during 1984 2012 in contrast to previous factors positive ndvi trends are mainly attributed to human interventions such as extension farmlands and irrigation activities which impact the ndvi directly in the studied catchment similarly irrigation water consumption is following a significant upward trend during the period 2000 2012 with a magnitude of 0 004 mm³ year fig 3 f this is mainly due to the intensive water abstraction dedicated to agriculture which is the largest economic activity in the region the irrigation water abstraction is primarily targeted from the medjerda river as the groundwater resources in the region are overexploited and therefore remain insufficient to support the local agricultural activities it is worth noting that even with robust statistics of the trend analysis of et and irri these results should be taken with caution since we are dealing with time series of 13 years which is considered as a relatively short data set for such analysis we conclude that the hydrological alteration of q is concurrent with a decreasing trend in p and an increasing trend of t et ndvi and irri over time in the study area however the relationship may induce complex dynamics for instance increasing transpiration and evaporation may also increase local p as t and p both interact in the atmosphere system gampe et al 2016 t and thus these interactions are therefore further investigated with the ccm method to identify and quantify the strength of causal relationships between q on the one hand and p t et ndvi and irri on the other hand 5 2 causal relationships analysis the assessment of the causal factors of streamflow using the ccm method show that q is forced by p t et ndvi and irri however it remains difficult to extract one main influential driving force for q despite the fact that the ccm method uses advanced non linear algorithms to assess the causality and its strengths it is not easy to discriminate between irri ndvi et p and t as major driving forcing term on q alteration it is also shown that there is feedback of q on driving factors feed back could be induced by different processes for instance when et increase local humidity can increase favoring the genesis of local rain hence feed back mechanisms between driving factors and q should not be excluded a priori yet in the studied catchment the feed back of q on possible driving force is rather low but not negligible the small feed back can partially be explained by the size of the study catchment which remains rather small as identified in fig 4 a e the ρ value increases for p et ndvi irr and t with the length of the library the convergence is pronounced indicating therefore significant causal effects of p t et irri and ndvi on q hence based on the ccm prediction procedure measuring the forecast skill of q on possible driving factors the causal strengths have been quantified and are significant for all factors yet they situate in the same order of magnitude and currently no robust test value is available to accept or reject the causality based on the strength of the prediction skill the significant forecast skill of q on p reveals obviously that p exerts a direct influence on q as would be expected the alteration in the p regime of the studied catchment can therefore produce a significant contribution to the alteration of q the strength of t causing q is in contrast to the study of su et al 2018 who reported that the increase in t has more effect on q than p it should also be noted that an increase in t may reduce the relative humidity and hence reduce the probability of rainfall genesis in the studied catchment the increased t will not necessarily lead locally to an increased p further q is projected to decrease when et increase fig 3 d mccabe and wolock 2011 et is indeed pivotal for studying the hydrological balance but the impact of et on q depends also on the balance between p and et gampe et al 2016 for instance the q alteration in areas where p is largely superior to et will be less influenced by changes in low p rates in these cases q will be more influenced by changes in high p rates that may induce flooding and increased erosion this will be different in areas where et is higher than p like in our study in such areas extreme droughts linked to increasing t could reduce q yet when p is less than et the increase or reduction in p does not necessarily improve reduce runoff directly similarly as in our study gampe et al 2016 and tramblay et al 2019 explored the impacts of evapotranspiration change on q in a mediterranean basins they found that et change was the main important driver causing a reduction in soil moisture and annual streamflow further as described by moraes et al 1998 the changes in the land use and land cover in particular irrigation can modify the hydrological regime indeed the increase in t in the studied semi arid region could induce more et from irrigated croplands substantially increasing the demand for water extracted from rivers dams reservoir and aquifers for irrigation agriculture all this logically potentially reduces q hence irri played an important role in streamflow reduction and this has also been confirmed by zhang et al 2015 who indicated that the expansion of farmland areas associated with increasing irri leads to declined streamflow the observed upward trend of irri is consistent with population growth in the area during the 2000 2012 period such population growth increase the demand for food and water on the national and regional scale schilling et al 2012 and induce a rapid expansion of irrigated lands population growth is therefore considered as a driving force in the demand for water and it has increased rapidly in many areas especially in africa contributing to the decreases in streamflow su et al 2018b the increased irrigation water abstraction affecting streamflow agree with results found with the study of gebremicael et al 2019 they reported that the hydrological alteration of streamflow is attributed to land management change converted into cultivable area in the northern part of ethiopia and due to an increase of irrigation water withdrawals the joint effect of the different individual factors is more difficult to elucidate with the ccm analysis indeed the increase of t fig 3 c and the reduction of p fig 3 a may jointly cause the observed reduction of q fig 3 b in the upstream part of the medjerda catchment this would be consistent with the findings of gampe et al 2016 who reported that q is positively correlated with the p and negatively correlated with the t also the increase of et s effect in our study cannot be easily separated from t and ndvi s effect increasing t may indeed induce a water deficit over irrigated agriculture produced by increasing et losses thus increasing plant water stress and desiccation which influences the vegetation growth through photosynthesis this would be consistent with the findings of yuan et al 2017 who stated that warming trends caused by high t could lead to the increase of potential et and finally a decrease of ndvi all of which contribute to streamflow alteration yet it still can be shown that the hydrological alteration of q can be fairly well explained by direct human activities such as changes in catchment characteristics including expansion of land cover and land use dynamics this is consistent with other studies considering that anthropogenic impacts caused by reservoir irrigation agricultural activity and channel irrigation exert important influences streamflow alteration considerably xue et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 2015 miao et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 6 conclusion in this study the hydrological alteration of streamflow and its causes was explored for the medjerda upstream sub catchment north east of algeria using mann kendall mk trend analysis and nonlinear timeseries analysis tool convergent cross mapping ccm the major conclusions are as follows 1 the streamflow q in the study area showed a significant decreasing trend during the period 1981 2012 with a magnitude of 0 020 m³ s year thus a significant hydrological alteration of the upstream part of the medjerda river was observed the trends of possible explanatory factors were also assessed similar and different trend behaviors to q were found i e a decrease of p 11 521 mm year and an increase of t et ndvi and irri with magnitudes of 0 056 c year 0 150 mm year 0 001 year and 0 004 mm³ year respectively 2 the causality analysis using ccm revealed causal links between q and p t et irri and ndvi the causal link between p and q were consistent with the decreasing trend of p and q the causality between t et and q can be related to the increasing trends of t and et furthermore a strong causal effect of ndvi and irri on q was observed which also is consistent with the statistical trend analysis 3 it is concluded that both climate change and human activities mainly agricultural development and irrigation are the dominant causal processes that altered the hydrological regime in the medjerda river this suggests the implementation of better operational integrated water resources plans in the region in order to reduce the pressure exerted on the medjerda river as an important water resource in the
