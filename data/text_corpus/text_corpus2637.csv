13185,hetero structured catalysts have recently gained considerable attention among researchers in various fields including photocatalysis in this study we evaluated the performance of zinc oxide nanowires zno nws surface decorated with palladium pd nanoparticles as a photocatalyst for sustainable water treatment pd nanoparticles were uniformly deposited on the surface of the zno nws by atomic layer deposition to maximize the number of active sites as photocatalysts in water generate active oxygen species and decompose organic matter the decomposition percentage of organic compounds was measured to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the prepared photocatalyst the pd nanoparticle decorated zno nanowires exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance when compared with the untreated zno nws the decomposition percentage of 4 chlorophenol significantly increased from 42 5 to 62 8 when the zno nws were surface decorated with pd nanoparticles graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hetero structure photocatalysis water treatment atomic layer deposition 1 introduction hetero structured materials are widely used in fields such as electronics sensing energy and environmental remediation hetero structured materials with photocatalytic properties have been actively investigated for water purification 1 4 treated water contains many harmful microorganisms and organic pollutants that can be effectively removed by an advanced oxidation process using a photocatalyst semiconducting oxides such as titanium dioxide tio2 and zinc oxide zno have wide bandgaps and can therefore generate charges under uv a light irradiation 5 7 these charges generate oxidative radicals that cause decomposition of organic matter present in water 8 various metals such as palladium pd 3 4 9 11 silver ag 1 3 11 14 gold au 10 15 copper cu 16 and nickel ni 17 have been investigated as photocatalysts semiconducting oxides metals with appropriate bandgaps and fermi levels can effectively capture the charges generated by the oxide by the moss burstein effect 18 19 these reactions can interfere with the recombination of generated holes and electrons thereby increasing the survival probability of the charges resulting in improved photocatalytic effects 10 12 20 in this study we investigated the improvement in the uv water treatment performance using a hetero structured photocatalyst composed of pd nanoparticles on the surface of zno nanowires zno nws as the ionic radius of pd pd2 0 08 nm is close to that of zn zn2 0 074 nm 25 photogenerated charge carriers can be easily trapped thereby preventing charge recombination this phenomenon can prolong the lifetime of charge carriers produced by zno and improve the photocatalytic performance to optimize the heterostructures several conditions must be met because the photocatalytic effect is a surface reaction a material should not cover the entire surface of another material additionally metals with good catalytic properties are expensive precious metals such as pd and au therefore it is important to minimize the amount of metal deposited on the surface of semiconducting oxides atomic layer deposition ald can satisfy these conditions in ald the precursor oxidation reaction results in extremely thin film which can be deposited in 1 cycle to one atomic layer or less in addition the ald process provides sufficient time and material to react on all surfaces thus ensuring uniformity in the amount of deposited material 21 it is a unique technology that is suitable for large area deposition of surface materials with atomic thicknesses 22 24 therefore ald was selected for the fabrication of pd surface catalysts the sample preparation process is illustrated in fig 1 to evaluate and compare the photocatalytic performances of the pd zno nws and untreated zno nws we estimated the release of reactive oxygen species ros and the organic pollutant degradation rate to measure the ros release and degradation rate of organic pollutants 4 chlorobenzoic acid pcba sigma aldrich furfuryl alcohol ffa sigma aldrich and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp sigma aldrich were used as probes high photocatalytic activity leads to the production of a large amount of ros this induces high oxidative stress that can oxidize organic pollutants and kill harmful microorganisms present in water the water treatment by the pd zno nw photocatalysts is illustrated in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of zno nws to fabricate the zno nws a zno seed layer was prepared for this 10 mm 10 mm silicon substrates mti korea co were cleaned by sonication in acetone methanol and deionized water di water a zno seed layer was deposited on a clean silicon substrate using a commercial thermal ald reactor atomic classic cn1 co diethylzinc dez zn c2h5 2 lpn di water and nitrogen gas were used as the precursor oxidant and purging gas respectively one ald cycle involved the following sequence dez nitrogen purging water and nitrogen purging the durations of these steps were 1 100 1 and 100 s respectively the flow rate of nitrogen was 200 sccm the zno seed layer was fabricated using 100 ald cycles performed at 150 c the nanostructure of the zno seeds was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd as shown in fig 2a and b zno nws were prepared on a zno seed layer using a hydrothermal method 24 a hydrothermal growth solution was prepared by mixing equimolar 25 mm solutions of zinc nitrate hexahydrate sigma aldrich and hexamethylenetetramine sigma aldrich and the seed layer deposited substrate was immersed in the solution at 90 5 c for 1 h after growth residues on the substrate were rinsed with di water the zno nws were approximately 1 3 1 4 μm long and 50 60 nm in diameter and grow at an angle of 75 85 to the substrate surface the results of the zno nws are presented in fig 2c and d 2 2 ald of pd a customized thermal ald reactor icot inc was used to deposit pd on the zno nws palladium ii hexafluoroacetylacetonate pd hfac 2 strem chemicals inc formalin sigma aldrich and nitrogen gas were used as the precursor oxidant and purging gas respectively one ald cycle involved the following sequence pd hfac 2 nitrogen purging formalin nitrogen purging the duration of each of these steps was 1 80 1 and 80 s respectively the flow rate of nitrogen was 3 sccm and the deposition temperature was 150 c 2 3 structural characterization of pd zno nws the structure and elemental composition of the pd zno nws were analyzed by sem s 4800 hitachi transmission electron microscopy tem jem2200fs jeol and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds jem2200fs jeol the valence band studies of the materials were performed using the thermofisher scientific nexsa g2 x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps the xps spectra were recorded using a microfocus monochromator and al kα 1486 6 ev radiation as the x ray source tem samples of pd zno nws were prepared using a focused ion beam fib system quanta2003d thermo fisher scientific crystallinity of the samples was determined using xrd analysis smartlab rigaku 2 4 photocatalysis experiment photocatalytic activity was measured by irradiating 10 mm 10 mm samples of pd zno nws and zno nws with uv a light wavelength 365 nm with an intensity of 60 w m2 the uv light intensity was measured using a broadband power energy meter 13 pem 001 melles griot the samples were placed in the wells of a 24 well plate with 2 ml of probe solutions which were 20 μm pcba 100 μm ffa and 100 μm 4 cp solutions these were used to detect oh radicals and singlet oxygen and to determine the organic degradation ability respectively the experiment lasted for 2 h and each probe solution was sampled every 30 min photocatalytic measurements were conducted using high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity 2 agilent technologies pcba was measured with a solvent comprising 60 acetonitrile j t baker hplc grade and 40 of 0 1 wt h3po4 sigma aldrich at a flow rate of 1 ml min and by monitoring the uv absorbance at 237 nm ffa was measured with a solvent comprising 70 of 0 1 wt h3po4 sigma aldrich and 30 methanol j t baker hplc grade at a flow rate of 1 ml min and by monitoring the uv absorbance at 220 nm 26 4 cp was measured with a solvent comprising 50 di water and 50 methanol j t baker hplc grade at a flow rate of 1 ml min and by monitoring the uv absorbance at 220 nm 27 3 results and discussion the length crystalline structure and particle size of the pd zno nws were investigated using sem fig 3 shows the sem images of the zno nws and pd zno nws where b 200 pd zno and c 400 pd zno nws are prepared by depositing pd by 200 and 400 cycles of ald respectively figs 2c and 3b clearly confirm the uniform distribution of pd nanoparticles along the length of the zno nws the eds profiles of fig s1 show that the amount of deposited pd increased with an increase in the number of pd ald cycles the cross sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy stem image of the pd zno nws in fig 3d shows that the zno nws are hexagonal as observed in the top view sem image in fig 2d this implies that the hydrothermally grown zno nws exhibit a wurtzite crystal structure consisting of alternating stacked planes of o2 and zn2 28 the xrd spectra of the zno nws and pd zno nws shown in fig 3e confirm the phase of the zno and ald pd corresponding to the reference crystallinity fig 4 shows the stem images of the pd zno nws fig 4a f show that the pd particulates were grown by the ald cycle in the nucleation mode on the surface of the zno nws which is consistent with the sem results interestingly the particle size increased proportionally with the number of ald cycles rather than with an increase in particle population as observed from the particle size distribution in fig s2 as determined by analyzing fig 4a f the average particle sizes of 200 pd zno nws and 400 pd zno nws were 3 75 2 41 nm and 10 5 1 95 nm respectively this implies that the atomic layer deposited pd preferentially grew onto the initial nucleated sites rather than densely covering the nw surface metals preferential growth is due to their high surface energy where the underlying oxide has a lower surface energy the nucleation characteristics observed in this study are consistent with those reported in the literature of atomic layer deposited metals 21 29 33 the particle size distribution data indicated the grain growth pattern of the atomic layer deposited metal as can be seen in fig s2a the particle size distribution of 200 pd zno nws is positively skewed that of the 400 pd zno nws is slightly closer to the normal distribution as shown in fig s2b indicating the formation of larger grains which can be attributed to coalescence and ostwald ripening during the growth of the atomic layer deposited metal respectively 33 during ald when metal particles first begin to grow the metal atoms aggregate to form small particles with an increase in the number of ald cycles the size of each particle gradually increased and the nanoparticles coalesced with adjacent nanoparticles to form larger particles with a further increase in the number of ald cycles the larger particles gradually absorb the smaller particles around them this is known as ostwald ripening because of this phenomenon the number of small grains decreased and the overall grain size distribution became slightly more even thus the particle size distribution became slightly closer to the normal distribution the atomic structure of the atomic layer deposited pd was determined from high resolution tem hrtem images as shown in fig 4g and h both the samples exhibit lattice fringes of 2 1 and 2 3 å which are consistent with the d spacings corresponding to the pd 200 and pd 111 planes 34 35 this is also consistent with the xrd spectra of zno nws and pd zno nws in fig 3e which show peaks approximately 40 and 47 corresponding to the 111 and 200 planes of atomic layer deposited pd consistent with the reference data of jcpds standard 05 068 the results indicate high crystallinity of the pd particles on the zno nw surface to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of zno nws and pd zno nws under 365 nm uv a light irradiation we measured the generation of two types of ros oh radicals and singlet oxygen and determined the 4 cp degradation capability of the samples the generation of oh radicals and singlet oxygen and organic pollutant degradation capability were measured by the degradation of the probes the data are presented as c c0 concentration at time t initial concentration values of the probe solutions fig 5 shows the differences in the degradation capabilities of the zno and pd zno nws the zno and 200 pd zno nws degraded 72 9 1 7 and 80 6 1 8 pcba respectively in 2 h however the 400 pd zno nws degraded only 57 6 pcba in 2 h exhibiting a significantly inferior performance compared with the zno nws this indicates that oh radicals were generated in the order of 200 pd zno nws zno nws 400 pd zno nws further the zno 200 pd zno and 400 pd zno nws degraded 65 1 5 8 82 3 1 7 and 42 8 ffa respectively in 2 h thus as in the case of pcba singlet oxygen was generated in the order of 200 pd zno nws zno nws 400 pd zno nws the 4 cp results had the same pattern as pcba and ffa indicating that ros production is related to organic decomposition the 4 cp degradation ability is equivalent to the amount of released oxidative stress zno 200 pd zno and 400 pd zno nws degraded 42 5 2 3 62 9 1 6 and 35 4 cp respectively in 2 h these results indicate that the pd zno nws induced higher oxidative stress than the untreated zno nws and that the excessive loading of pd reduced the photocatalytic activity to an even lower level than that of the untreated zno nws the photocatalytic activity of zno is induced by the introduction of energy higher than that of its bandgap electron hole pairs e h are generated by excitation with a certain photon energy which results in the formation of ros however as the charges lose energy the electrons in the conduction band tend to recombine with the holes in the valence band thus the separation of the electron hole pair is a key factor in determining the photocatalytic activity the greater the suppression of charge recombination the higher the photocatalytic activity the work functions of zno and pd are 4 35 and 5 12 ev respectively 36 the difference in the work functions of zno and pd leads to the formation of a schottky barrier at the interface between zno and pd because the fermi energy level of pd is higher than that of zno owing to its higher work function the electrons transfer from zno to pd when two materials are synthesized this change in photocatalysis is illustrated in fig 6a c when pd and zno nws are in contact and form a hetero nanostructure a new fermi level will be established and equilibrium is achieved as shown in fig 6c the transferred electrons accumulate at the equilibrium fermi level near the conduction floor and the energy band of zno will curve downward to establish a reduced band gap we performed valence band vb xps analysis as shown in fig 6d and confirmed that the valence band maxima vbm were changed by linear extrapolation of the leading edge of the valence band spectrum the narrower bandgap of the pd zno nws compared to that of the untreated zno nws promoted the reactivity of the photoinduced charge carriers thus the excited electrons at the conduction band transfer from zno to the interface of pd rather than the electron holes in the valence band moreover the schottky barrier prevents the electrons in pd from flowing back to zno which decreases the electron hole recombination rate and prolongs the lifetime of the charge carriers 12 25 37 38 in photocatalysts this significantly promotes the generation of ros however 400 pd zno nws generated a lower amount of ros than the zno nws due to the high amount of pd which narrowed the space charge region thus the light penetration depth significantly exceeds the thickness of the space charge layer thereby facilitating the recombination of the photogenerated electron hole pairs 39 40 the stem image of the 400 pd zno nws in fig 4d shows that the pd nanoparticles densely covered the zno nw surface resulting in a low charge separation rate 10 the reusability of photocatalysts is also important since the heterostructure catalyst synthesized in this study has a complex structure its recyclability was evaluated as well we measured the 4 cp degradation rates of three 200 pd zno nw catalyst samples five times each for 1 h and found that the 200 pd zno nws degraded approximately 33 37 4 cp as shown fig 7 these results demonstrate the good recyclability of the photocatalyst without a decrease in the generation of oxidative stress this sustainability performance was also compared to those from the references in table 1 the morphology of the ald pd was well preserved after the recyclability test as shown in the sem image in fig s3 4 conclusions pd nanoparticles were deposited onto the surface of zno nws by ald to improve the photocatalytic activity under uv a light irradiation morphological analysis revealed that pd nanoparticles with the desired crystal phases were formed and uniformly distributed along the surface of the zno nws the formation of a new fermi level of the metal zno heterostructure which is lower than the energy level of the conduction band of zno suppresses the recombination of electrons in the conduction band with electron holes in the valence band under uv a light irradiation the enhanced charge separation improved the photocatalytic activity furthermore compared with the zno nws the pd zno nws generated a higher amount of ros which improved the degradation rates of organic pollutants in water moreover the excessive loading of pd decreased the oxidative stress induced by the photocatalyst owing to a decrease in light absorption abbreviations zno nws zinc oxide nanowires ald atomic layer deposition tio2 titanium dioxide sem scanning

resulting in a low charge separation rate 10 the reusability of photocatalysts is also important since the heterostructure catalyst synthesized in this study has a complex structure its recyclability was evaluated as well we measured the 4 cp degradation rates of three 200 pd zno nw catalyst samples five times each for 1 h and found that the 200 pd zno nws degraded approximately 33 37 4 cp as shown fig 7 these results demonstrate the good recyclability of the photocatalyst without a decrease in the generation of oxidative stress this sustainability performance was also compared to those from the references in table 1 the morphology of the ald pd was well preserved after the recyclability test as shown in the sem image in fig s3 4 conclusions pd nanoparticles were deposited onto the surface of zno nws by ald to improve the photocatalytic activity under uv a light irradiation morphological analysis revealed that pd nanoparticles with the desired crystal phases were formed and uniformly distributed along the surface of the zno nws the formation of a new fermi level of the metal zno heterostructure which is lower than the energy level of the conduction band of zno suppresses the recombination of electrons in the conduction band with electron holes in the valence band under uv a light irradiation the enhanced charge separation improved the photocatalytic activity furthermore compared with the zno nws the pd zno nws generated a higher amount of ros which improved the degradation rates of organic pollutants in water moreover the excessive loading of pd decreased

13186,an electro enhanced sequencing batch reactor e sbr was constructed to treat 400 mg l aniline wastewater and realized system rapid start up the aniline degradation efficiency was almost 100 and the total nitrogen removal rate was 80 in the e sbr high throughput sequencing showed that the microbial community in e sbr changed greatly at genus level anaerolineae rhodococcus luteococcus deniratisoma and sm1a02 enriched in activated sludge thauera ellin6067 arenimonas hydrogenophaga enriched in the electrode biofilm these functional microorganisms accounted for a large proportion and played an important role in the removal of pollutants meanwhile the microorganism metabolism in the e sbr system was significantly different from that in the traditional sbr system the e sbr system had higher nitrogen metabolic and carbohydrate metabolism abundance to ensure the effective removal of aniline and nitrogen graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aniline electro enhanced nitrogen removal microbial community metabolic prediction 1 introduction as one of the hard to degrade organics aniline c6h5nh2 is widely used in dye pesticide military and rubber vulcanization industries 1 because of its mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on humans the u s environmental protection agency has classified it as one of 129 priority pollutants and its release is severely restricted 2 in previous studies different types of biological treatment technologies have been investigated to treat aniline 3 4 but the toxicity of aniline limited the effect of traditional biological treatment technology moreover due to the presence of amino nh2 on the benzene ring nh4 n will accumulate with the degradation of aniline long growth cycle and sensitivity to toxicity the activity of traditional nitrogen removal bacteria is easily inhibited by aniline 5 these problems above seriously affect the nitrogen removal process of the whole system so the problem of nitrogen removal is also worth thinking it is necessary to study an effective and sustainable technology to treat the wastewater of aniline electrochemical technology plays a more and more important role in the biological wastewater treatment area because it has the advantages of high efficiency strong independence and easy control 6 in addition appropriate external electrical stimulation could improve the metabolism of microorganisms thus accelerating the growth of microorganisms and improving the treatment efficiency 7 8 bioelectrochemical systems have been successfully applied to the treatment of chloramphenicol 9 phenol 10 2 4 dcp 11 the removal rate of these pollutants has been effectively improved besides weak current has been reported to be beneficial to the growth of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria 12 thereby enhancing wastewater treatment performance under harsh environmental conditions this undoubtedly contributes to the aniline biodegradation and nitrogen removal many previous studies on bioelectrochemical systems were carried out in continuous flow reactor but few of them combined with sbr system to study the treatment of aniline wastewater therefore this was very meaningful research to select an electro enhanced sequencing batch reactor e sbr the aims of this work were to 1 build an e sbr and evaluate the pollutions removal performance of the e sbr system in the start up phase 2 analyze the characteristics of the e sbr system from microbial diversity community types and metabolic prediction during start up 3 study on the mechanism of aniline degradation and nitrogen removal in the e sbr system the results of this work can provide new ideas for aniline treatment and also provide some theoretical guidance for practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 structure of reactor in this study two sbr reactors with the same structure were designed a control reactor with only activated sludge r1 and a reactor with 1 5 v supply voltage and activated sludge r2 previous research suggests higher voltage will have a negative impact on microorganisms besides 1 23 v is the minimum voltage for hydrogen evolution from electrolytic water after investigation it found that excessive voltage will significantly inhibit the performance of activated sludge system through a series of pre experiments we obtained a preliminary suitable voltage of 1 5 v 13 the schematic diagram of the e sbr experimental device was shown in fig 1 sbr with an effective volume of 1 l was made of plastic with a dimension of 20 cm height 10 cm diameter r2 was installed with a pair of carbon brushes which had an effective area of 108cm2 3 cm 3 cm 12 cm the pre treatment method of carbon brush is the same as previous articles 14 cathode and anode were connected with the dc regulated power supply ps 305df china according pre experiment the distance between cathode and anode was controlled by 5 cm the current in e sbr was about 10 ma compared with the metal electrode carbon brushes can effectively enrich more microorganisms 15 and only co2 and h2 would be produced during chemical reaction 16 the performance of the reactor will not be affected by the metal ions produced by electrolysis 2 2 reactor start up and operation the activated sludge inoculated in the reactor was taken from the aerobic tank of erlangmiao wastewater treatment plant in wuhan city hubei province china initial mixer liquor suspended solids mlss was about 3000 mg l the start up of the reactor was divided into three stages the first stage was 1 6 days of reactor running at this time aniline concentration was 200 mg l adding 400 mg l glucose as an additional carbon source to the reactor the second stage was 7 12 days the aniline concentration was 400 mg l adding 200 mg l glucose as an additional carbon source to the reactor the third stage was 13 30 days which only 400 mg l aniline as the sole carbon source in the previous article 17 600 mg l aniline was selected to study the aniline degrade in sbr although aniline is almost completely degraded the severe toxicity seriously affected the effect of nitrification and denitrification therefore in electro enhanced sequencing batch reactor 400 mg l aniline is selected to study microbial community and metabolic characteristics evaluation in start up stage and a higher concentration of aniline will be studied in the subsequent steady state study the other components in the simulated wastewater were the same as those in the previous laboratory 17 as follows 13 mg l nah2po4 2h2o 50 4 mg l na2hpo4 12h2o 10 2 mg l mgso4 7h2o 2 0 mg l nacl 0 67 mg l fe no3 3 9h2o 2 87 mg l znso4 7h2o each cycle in sequencing batch reactor was 12 h and the water exchange ratio of sbr was 50 the reactor operation was set through an automatic control switch in each cycle to achieve 5 min feeding 6 h aerobic reaction dissolved oxygen concentration is 4 5 0 3 mg l 4 5 h anoxic reaction dissolved oxygen concentration is 0 3 0 1 mg l 80 min setting and 5 min effluent discharge the temperature in the sbr system was maintained at 25 1 c by temperature controlled 2 3 chemical analytical methods the effluent was collected from r1 and r2 every day the influent and effluent concentrations of nh4 n no3 n no2 n tn cod and aniline were measured on a spectrophotometer uv 1600 mapada china by standard methods 18 the dehydrogenase dha activity was tested as in previous reports 19 three replicates were conducted for each sample and average values were calculated and showed in charts origin 2018 software was used for drawing figures 2 4 microbiological analytical methods five sludge samples were collected on the 1st and 30th to analyze the microbial community respectively tagged as s0 seed sludge s1 activated sludge in r1 s2 activated sludge in r2 s2a biofilm in anode s2c biofilm in cathode all sludge samples were stored at 80 c the sequencing process followed previous study 20 total genomic dna was extracted from sludge sample using a qiaamp dna stool mini kit for gene libraries construction dna from the 5 samples were amplified by pcr using primer set 338f 5 actcctacgggagg cagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the amplicons were sequenced in majorbio company shanghai china on an illumina miseq platform detailed bioinformatics were analyzed on the online platform of majorbio cloud platform for investigating the microorganism metabolic characteristics the picrust software was used to capture the pathway level 1 3 abundance and annotated information 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of aniline and nitrogen removal fig 2 shows the specific performance of r1 and r2 for aniline nh4 n no3 n no2 n cod and tn removal at the startup stage due to the activated sludge could not adapt to the new environment the systems could not degrade aniline efficiently at the early stage of start up r2 however had a relatively high aniline degradation performance on the one hand the electric field could promote the adsorption capacity of sludge 21 on the other hand it has been reported that the hydroxyl radicals oh of strong oxidants which produced by electrochemical reactions could destroy complex organic pollutants and improve their biodegradability 22 with the gradual adaptation of microorganisms r1 and r2 could achieve a nearly 100 aniline degradation rate since aniline was the only carbon source at the late stage of the reaction cod and aniline had the same degradation trend fig 2 a nh4 n is produced with the degradation of aniline and the aniline toxicity will affect nitrification and denitrification 23 initially the accumulation of nh4 n in r2 was more than that in r1 fig 2 b because at first the aniline removal rate in r2 was greater than that in r1 resulting in more nh4 n production the concentration of nh4 n in two systems peaked at 13th day at this time the concentration of nh4 n in r1 and r2 were 39 68 mg l and 30 8 mg l with the stability of the system it was found that the nh4 n concentration in r2 was lower than that in r1 it has been reported that current stimulation could improve the activity of key enzymes in the nitrification process 24 and the system resistance to toxicity 25 it was also possible that nh4 n was directly removed by the electrochemical reaction on the anode 26 the decrease of nh4 n was synchronized with the increase of no3 n which reflects the high efficiency of nitrification in the reactor the no3 n concentrations of r1 and r2 reached the peak values on the 25th and 19th day fig 2 b respectively after that no3 n concentration in the two reactors decreased gradually r2 was first stabilized and finally two reactors were lower than 2 mg l current stimulation could promote denitrification performance 27 this may also be attributed to the fact that microorganisms around the cathode may directly use electrons or indirectly use the hydrogen generated by the electrode as an electron donor to reduce nitrate 28 the no2 n concentration in r1 and r2 had small fluctuations in the initial stage after start up their concentrations were all lower than 0 1 mg l it was not found that the current stimulation had any effect on the accumulation of no2 n removal of tn mainly depends on nitrification and denitrification the total nitrogen was significantly different in two systems this phenomenon was mainly due to the difference in ammonia nitrogen concentration in the effluent finally r2 had about 80 tn removal rate while r1 had about 70 this is consistent with the phenomenon that current stimulation could promote total nitrogen removal 29 the experimental results show that the current stimulation accelerated start up of an sbr for treating aniline any effluent index all reached a stable state first in the r2 3 2 periodic variation of typical pollutants to further explore the effect of electric stimulation on the system on the 30th day aniline cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n were measured every hour to explore the regularity of aniline degradation and nitrogen removal in the cycle as shown in fig 3 by distinguishing of these two different systems the maximum aniline degradation rate in r2 23 07 mg g mlss h is higher than r1 r2 could almost completely degrade aniline in 2 h but r1 need 3 h r2 had a faster rate of aniline degradation the electrons provided by the power supply may be involved in the process of biofilm metabolism of aniline it has been proved that phenol can be degraded more efficiently under these conditions 30 for cod because aniline is the only carbon source in the reactor it has a similar degradation trend as aniline and eventually it stays around 50 mg l it could be seen that microorganisms make good use of intermediate products to maintain their own metabolism theoretically the complete degradation of 400 mg l aniline could produce 60 mg l nh4 n the highest concentration of nh4 n appeared when aniline was almost completely degraded the nh4 n concentrations in r1 and r2 was about 29 mg l perhaps aerobic nitrification occurred simultaneously during the degradation of aniline then the nh4 n concentration began to decrease and finally they were 11 34 mg l and 16 28 mg l in two systems the computed results shows that the maximum nitrification rate of r1 and r2 were 1 29 mg g mlss h and 2 20 mg g mlss h in the aerobic phase with the decrease of nh4 n concentration no3 n concentration increased to some extent but with the arrival of the anoxic phase no3 n began to decline and eventually below 2 mg l it could find out that the maximum denitrification rate was 0 79 mg g mlss h and 0 78 mg g mlss h in the r1 and r2 no2 n had no obvious accumulation during the whole cycle and the concentration was almost 0 mg l 3 3 dha of bacteria in system the above results showed that r2 could complete the stable start faster than r1 and it had better performance in aniline degradation and nitrogen removal dha is involved in the tca cycle and plays a key role in redox reaction so dha activity is directly related to the operation effect of biological treatment 31 it could also characterize the microbial activity and stability of the whole system 32 further explore the mechanism dha of system were quantitatively analyzed the change of dha activity is shown in fig 4 the dha activity in r1 and r2 showed a trend of increase then decrease and finally increase initially dha activity in r1 and r2 was low in the first stage 1 6 days with the addition of 200 mg l aniline the toxicity of low concentration did not affect the microbial system instead the microbial community could quickly adapt to the toxic environment and the use of aniline as a stable carbon source increased the activity of the microbial system in the second stage 7 12 days the dha activity in r1 and r2 was the lowest the further increase of aniline concentration increased systemic toxicity and microorganisms were difficult to resist the instantaneous impact resulting in the decrease of activity in the third stage of 15 days dha activity in r1and r2 gradually increased because with the almost complete degradation of aniline the microbial community had begun to gradually adapt to the toxic environment until the effluent indicators approached stable the reactor started stably in addition it was found that the dha activity in r2 at 25th day was already close to the dha activity in r1 at 30th day and the electrical stimulation obviously promoted the microbial activity which laterally reflected that the r2 reactor could complete the stable start up faster than the r1 reactor dha activity in r2 was higher than that in r1 at any stage this may also be related to the excessively high concentration of nh4 n in r1 than r2 fig 2 b which inhibits the metabolic reaction of microorganisms and could directly inhibit the enzyme activity of cells 33 appropriate current stimulation could change cell permeability enhance metabolism and increase the activity of the microbial system the faster degradation rate of aniline within r2 was also found in the cyclic experiments higher dha activity leads to a greater ability to biodegrade organic matter 34 3 4 microbial abundance and diversity index current and aniline obviously change the abundance of reactive microbial communities in two systems the values of ace chao and shannon in sample s0 were the highest table 1 besides the ace chao and shannon values of s2 were higher than s1 after the start up the microbial richness and diversity of two reactors all decreased the results of this study indicating that part microorganisms could not tolerate the toxicity of aniline in traditional sbr 35 but e sbr system would have higher bacterial richness and diversity under dc model corresponding to the best performance of aniline degradation and nitrogen removal high species diversity due to its rapid adaptability to environmental changes could improve the stability and the anti toxicity ability of the system and remove pollutants more effectively 36 moreover the community richness and diversity of s2a and s2c were greater than s2 some specific bacteria accumulate on biofilms by electrical stimulation the venn diagram fig 5 show that the total number of otus was 1969 and 527 otus or 26 8 of the total otus were shared by these samples and the community structure changed greatly after the start up 3 5 microbial community composition 3 5 1 activated sludge relative abundances of microbial communities with activated sludge in two systems were analyzed as shown in fig 6 a proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidota actinobacteriota dominated in these three samples at the phylum level they occupied 77 53 89 57 82 37 respectively the proportion of dominant bacteria change dramatically in the aniline wastewater system the relative abundance of proteobacteria in s1 and s2 53 50 35 35 was slightly higher than that in s0 24 35 which may be more tolerant to water environment containing aniline 37 moreover chloroflexi was observed more in the activated sludge of e sbr 18 15 than in the sbr system 11 44 suggesting that the electricity environment was suitable for the growth of chloroflexi proteobacteria and chloroflexi all have been shown to have the ability to remove aromatic contaminants and remove nitrogen 38 very interestingly compared to s0 applied voltage benefited actinobacteriota but decreased nitrospirota which may be the reason that actinobacteriota was more suitable for electrical stimulation and aniline toxicity while nitrospirota was not fig 6 c illustrated the changes of microbial communities at genus level first it could be seen that the clustering trees of s1 and s0 were closer indicating that they were more similar while s2 s2a s2c were quite different from them the percentage of rhodococcus and luteococcus in s2 4 55 5 31 was higher than that in s1 0 27 0 3 it could be clearly seen that their growth was improved under electrical stimulation rhodococcus and luteococcus have been proved to have aromatic compound s ability in previous studies 39 anaerolineae in s2 2 80 was higher than that in s1 1 01 and s0 0 93 previous studies have shown that anaerolineae was the main microorganism in the nh4 n removal process in the bioelectrochemical system 40 which also explains why the nh4 n removal rate in the r2 reactor is higher sm1a02 showed the same trend with anaerolineae its abundance in s2 2 54 was higher than that in s1 1 54 although the abundance is very low it could still have a high capacity for degrade aromatic compounds and nitrify 41 in addition denitratisoma r0 0 51 r1 0 06 r2 1 69 and haliangium r0 1 23 r1 0 35 r2 2 1 were also reported to have aerobic denitrification ability in previous studies 42 43 they could not adapt to the aniline system in r1 but play a special role of denitrification in r2 furthermore the abundance of propionicimonas 0 015 micropruina 0 020 unclassified c bacteroidia 0 15 and zoogloea 0 15 decreased during the start up period of the e sbr it might be attributed to current stimulated suppressed the metabolism of these genera 3 5 2 electrode biofilm according to the changes of phylum level in the electrode biofilms it can be seen that s2a and s2c reproduced a large number of proteobacteria 55 67 35 38 chloroflexi 14 3 29 3 and they both have good organic matter degradation and nitrogen removal performance besides many studies have demonstrated that electroactive bacteriomes were widely distributed in proteobacteria to realize electron transfer between bacteria and electrodes 44 the abundance of bacteroidota and actinobacteriota in electrode biofilms decreased obviously compared to other samples and a similar phenomenon had been found that bacteroidota and actinobacteriota were inhibited by current 44 certainly microbial communities still have a big difference between cathode and anode further analysis microbial on electrode biofilms at genus level cluster tree fig 6 c based on community phylogenetic lineages revealed that two samples of electrode biofilms were far away from s1 but similar to s2 alicycliphilus which was correlated with the degradation of refractory aromatic compounds 45 could effectively accumulate at electrode biofilm ellin6067 was relatively high abundances with 3 40 in s2a and 3 81 in s2c qiu 46 reported that ellin6067 was one of predominant nitrifying genera in sbr to treat wastewater with a low c n ratio thauera existed extensively in anode biofilm 6 51 and cathode biofilm 2 40 with the function of denitrification 47 denitratisoma had relatively high abundance in s2a 4 13 and s2c 4 44 same as the above results denitratisoma has been proved that is the key to promote the nitrogen removal efficiency in the water treatment system arenimonas was detected in s2a and s2c with 3 0 and 1 3 it has been found in bioelectrochemical systems and have the ability of hydrogen autotrophic denitrification 48 hydrogenophaga also could perform hydrogen autotrophic denitrification its appearance may be related to electrolytic hydrogen production 49 further study will be required to confirm the occurrence of hydrogen autotrophic denitrification besides norank f caldilineaceae 7 72 and norank f norank o c10 sb1a 5 67 were availably enriched in the e sbr system but until now the function of them is unknown in addition it could be observed from the figure that the proportion of some functional genera pseudomonas thermomonas and haliangium in electrode biofilms was almost non existent this phenomenon indicated that the weak current environment containing aniline was unfavorable for growth of these genera the stimulation of current will significantly change the microbial community in r1 and r2 the higher abundance of these functional genera in activated sludge and electrode biofilms could better promote aniline degradation and nitrogen removal 3 6 microorganism metabolic characteristics aniline degradation and nitrogen removal are closely related to microbial metabolic pathway the kegg pathway abundance of five samples was statistically analyzed the metabolic pathways are divided into three levels the main ways of the level 1 table 2 include cellular processes 3 48 4 21 environmental information processing 12 90 13 84 genetic information processing 16 09 16 43 human diseases 0 93 1 11 metabolism 50 18 51 84 and organismal systems 0 81 0 86 among them metabolism as an important function for microorganisms to maintain bacteria survival accounts 50 18 51 84 for the largest proportions of all metabolic pathways in the metabolic pathway of level 2 the first 10 metabolic pathways were selected to analyze the metabolic characteristics of microorganisms in aniline wastewater during the start up period fig 7 a amino acid metabolism was higher in r2 11 09 10 78 10 74 than in r1 10 68 carbohydrate metabolism was higher in r2 10 45 9 99 10 54 than in r1 9 92 and energy metabolism was higher in r2 5 94 5 76 5 94 than in r1 5 69 it is obvious that the metabolic activity of the e sbr system was higher than traditional sbr system higher metabolic abundance may be related to the enhancement of system activity induced by current stimulation the abundance of cellular processes and signaling in r2 3 32 3 66 3 32 was lower than r1 3 80 current could inhibit the signal transduction between cells 50 51 besides current increased the relative abundance of membrane transport in r2 which may be related to extracellular electron transfer some electrochemically active bacteria could produce proteins that make electron transfer easier functions in level 3 of energy metabolism are shown in fig 7 b the relative abundance of nitrogen metabolism in s0 s1 s2 s2a and s2c were 12 37 12 93 13 52 13 48 and 13 78 respectively high abundance of nitrogen metabolism explained why tn concentration in r2 is lower than r0 oxidative phosphorylation which refers to the role of atp production accompanying biological oxidation was higher in abundance in r2 28 54 28 65 28 57 than in r1 27 83 atp production is related to microbial growth and reproduction 52 among these functions only ascorbate and aldarate metabolism and pentose phosphate abundance decreased in e sbr the current promoted the microbial degradation abilities of various sugars 52 53 it is also related to the biodegradation of organic matter all these results are only predictive to explore more accurately it is necessary to further use advanced technology like metagenomics and gene technology 3 7 mechanisms of the study the e sbr could start up faster and had faster aniline degradation rate and higher total nitrogen removal rate may be due to the following reasons first current stimulation could improve the overall dha activity of the system compared with the traditional biological system the e sbr system had higher species diversity which makes the system more stable and could effectively resist toxic treatment pollutants to adapt to the new environment faster second activated sludge luteococcus and rhodococcus could use aniline as carbon sources to grow while anaerolineae and sm1a02 have the ability to oxidize nh4 n which produced by aniline degrade then denitratisoma and haliangium can participate in denitrification third electrode biofilm which mainly contained alicycliphilus ellin6067 denitratisoma thauera hydrogenophaga and arenimonas demonstrated superior performance towards aniline degradation and nitrogen removal because electrolysis produces hydrogen it is worth noting that the no3 n produced in the nitrification could be reduced further by hydrogen autotrophic denitrification hydrogenophaga arenimonas their syntrophic interactions could quick start system and improve the performance of the e sbr system 4 conclusions in this study e sbr was successfully established and realized faster startup which not only achieved almost complete degradation of aniline but also achieved a removal rate of up to 80 than traditional sbr activity and stability of microbial community were improved by electric current through the evaluation of microbial community and metabolic pathway in e sbr system it was found that the combined of suspended sludge and electrode biofilm ensured the degradation of aniline and the removal of nitrogen however we do need to acknowledge the limitations of the study we will study the treatment mechanism and working condition optimization of higher concentration aniline in the future nonetheless this study demonstrated that the e sbr system would be a promising alternative for the efficient treatment of aniline and nitrogen and it also provided some theoretical guidance for biological waste

activated sludge r2 previous research suggests higher voltage will have a negative impact on microorganisms besides 1 23 v is the minimum voltage for hydrogen evolution from electrolytic water after investigation it found that excessive voltage will significantly inhibit the performance of activated sludge system through a series of pre experiments we obtained a preliminary suitable voltage of 1 5 v 13 the schematic diagram of the e sbr experimental device was shown in fig 1 sbr with an effective volume of 1 l was made of plastic with a dimension of 20 cm height 10 cm diameter r2 was

connected with the dc regulated power supply ps 305df china according pre experiment the distance between cathode and anode was controlled by 5 cm the current in e sbr was about 10 ma compared with the metal electrode carbon brushes can effectively enrich more microorganisms 15 and only co2 and h2 would be produced during chemical reaction 16 the performance of the reactor will not be affected by the metal ions produced by electrolysis 2 2 reactor start up and operation the activated sludge inoculated in the reactor was taken from the aerobic tank of erlangmiao wastewater treatment plant in wuhan city hubei province china initial mixer liquor suspended solids mlss was about 3000 mg l the start up of the reactor was divided into three stages the first stage was 1 6 days of reactor running at this time aniline concentration was 200 mg l adding 400 mg l glucose as an additional carbon source to the reactor the second stage was 7 12 days the aniline concentration was 400 mg l adding 200 mg l glucose as an additional carbon source to the reactor the third stage was 13 30 days which only 400 mg l aniline as the sole carbon source in the previous article 17 600 mg l aniline was selected to study the aniline degrade in sbr although aniline is almost completely degraded the severe toxicity seriously affected the effect of nitrification and denitrification therefore in electro enhanced sequencing batch reactor 400 mg l aniline is selected to study microbial community and metabolic characteristics evaluation in start up stage and a higher concentration of aniline will be studied in the subsequent steady state study the other components in the simulated wastewater were the same as those in the previous laboratory 17 as follows 13 mg l nah2po4 2h2o 50 4 mg l na2hpo4 12h2o 10 2 mg l mgso4 7h2o 2 0 mg l nacl 0 67 mg l fe no3 3 9h2o 2 87 mg l znso4 7h2o each cycle in sequencing batch reactor was 12 h and the water exchange ratio of sbr was 50 the reactor operation was set through an automatic control switch in each cycle to achieve 5 min feeding 6 h aerobic reaction dissolved oxygen concentration is 4 5 0 3 mg l 4 5 h anoxic reaction dissolved oxygen concentration is 0 3 0 1 mg l 80 min setting and 5 min effluent discharge the temperature in the sbr system was maintained at 25 1 c by temperature controlled 2 3 chemical analytical methods the effluent was collected from r1 and r2 every day the influent and effluent concentrations of nh4 n no3 n no2 n tn cod and aniline were measured on a spectrophotometer uv 1600 mapada china by standard methods 18 the dehydrogenase dha activity was tested as in previous reports 19 three replicates were conducted for each sample and average values were calculated and showed in charts origin 2018 software was used for drawing figures 2 4 microbiological analytical methods five sludge samples were collected on the 1st and 30th to analyze the microbial community respectively tagged as s0 seed sludge s1 activated sludge in r1 s2 activated sludge in r2 s2a biofilm in anode s2c biofilm in cathode all sludge samples were stored at 80 c the sequencing process followed previous study 20 total genomic dna was extracted from sludge sample using a qiaamp dna stool mini kit for gene libraries construction dna from the 5 samples were amplified by pcr using primer set 338f 5 actcctacgggagg cagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the amplicons were sequenced in majorbio company shanghai china on an illumina miseq platform detailed bioinformatics were analyzed on the online platform of majorbio cloud platform for investigating the microorganism metabolic characteristics the picrust software was used to capture the pathway level 1 3 abundance and annotated information 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of aniline and nitrogen removal fig 2 shows the specific performance of r1 and r2 for aniline nh4 n no3 n no2 n cod and tn removal at the startup stage due to the activated sludge could not adapt to the new environment the systems could not degrade aniline efficiently at the early stage of start up r2 however had a relatively high aniline degradation performance on the one hand the electric field could promote the adsorption capacity of sludge 21 on the other hand it has been reported that the hydroxyl radicals oh of strong oxidants which produced by electrochemical reactions could destroy complex organic pollutants and improve their biodegradability 22 with the gradual adaptation of microorganisms r1 and r2 could achieve a nearly 100 aniline degradation rate since aniline was the only carbon source at the late stage of the reaction cod and aniline had the same degradation trend fig 2 a nh4 n is produced with the degradation of aniline and the aniline toxicity will affect nitrification and denitrification 23 initially the accumulation of nh4 n in r2 was more than that in r1 fig 2 b because at first the aniline removal rate in r2 was greater than that in r1 resulting in more nh4 n production the concentration of nh4 n in two systems peaked at 13th day at this time the concentration of nh4 n in r1 and r2 were 39 68 mg l and 30 8 mg l with the stability of the system it was found that the nh4 n concentration in r2 was lower than that in r1 it has been reported that current stimulation could improve the activity of key enzymes in the nitrification process 24 and the system resistance to toxicity 25 it was also possible that nh4 n was directly removed by the electrochemical reaction on the anode 26 the decrease of nh4 n was synchronized with the increase of no3 n which reflects the high efficiency of nitrification in the reactor the no3 n concentrations of r1 and r2 reached the peak values on the 25th and 19th day fig 2 b respectively after that no3 n concentration in the two reactors decreased gradually r2 was first stabilized and finally two reactors were lower than 2 mg l current stimulation could promote denitrification performance 27 this may also be attributed to the fact that microorganisms around the cathode may directly use electrons or indirectly use the hydrogen generated by the electrode as an electron donor to reduce nitrate 28 the no2 n concentration in r1 and r2 had small fluctuations in the initial stage after start up their concentrations were all lower than 0 1 mg l it was not found that the current stimulation had any effect on the accumulation of no2 n removal of tn mainly depends on nitrification and denitrification the total nitrogen was significantly different in two systems this phenomenon was mainly due to the difference in ammonia nitrogen concentration in the effluent finally r2 had about 80 tn removal rate while r1 had about 70 this is consistent with the phenomenon that current stimulation could promote total nitrogen removal 29 the experimental results show that the current stimulation accelerated start up of an sbr for treating aniline any effluent index all reached a stable state first in the r2 3 2 periodic variation of typical pollutants to further explore the effect of electric stimulation on the system on the 30th day aniline cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n were measured every hour to explore the regularity of aniline degradation and nitrogen removal in the cycle as shown in fig 3 by distinguishing of these two different systems the maximum aniline degradation rate in r2 23 07 mg g mlss h is higher than r1 r2 could almost completely degrade aniline in 2 h but r1 need 3 h r2 had a faster rate of aniline degradation the electrons provided by the power supply may be involved in the process of biofilm metabolism of aniline it has been proved that phenol can be degraded more efficiently under these conditions 30 for cod because aniline is the only carbon source in the reactor it has a similar degradation trend as aniline and eventually it stays around 50 mg l it could be seen that microorganisms make good use of intermediate products to maintain their own metabolism theoretically the complete degradation of 400 mg l aniline could produce 60 mg l nh4 n the highest concentration of nh4 n appeared when aniline was almost completely degraded the nh4 n concentrations in r1 and r2 was about 29 mg l perhaps aerobic nitrification occurred simultaneously during the degradation of aniline then the nh4 n concentration began to decrease and finally they were 11 34 mg l and 16 28 mg l in two systems the computed results shows that the maximum nitrification rate of r1 and r2 were 1 29 mg g mlss h and 2 20 mg g mlss h in the aerobic phase with the decrease of nh4 n concentration no3 n concentration increased to some extent but with the arrival of the anoxic phase no3 n began to decline and eventually below 2 mg l it could find out that the maximum denitrification rate was 0 79 mg g mlss h and 0 78 mg g mlss h in the r1 and r2 no2 n had no obvious accumulation during the whole cycle and the concentration was almost 0 mg l 3 3 dha of bacteria in system the above results showed that r2 could complete the stable start faster than r1 and it had better performance in aniline degradation and nitrogen removal dha is involved in the tca cycle and plays a key role in redox reaction so dha activity is directly related to the operation effect of biological treatment 31 it could also characterize the microbial activity and stability of the whole system 32 further explore the mechanism dha of system were quantitatively analyzed the change of dha activity is shown in fig 4 the dha activity in r1 and r2 showed a trend of increase then decrease and finally increase initially dha activity in r1 and r2 was low in the first stage 1 6 days with the addition of 200 mg l aniline the toxicity of low concentration did not affect the microbial system instead the microbial community could quickly adapt to the toxic environment and the use of aniline as a stable carbon source increased the activity of the microbial system in the second stage 7 12 days the dha activity in r1 and r2 was the lowest the further increase of aniline concentration increased systemic toxicity and microorganisms were difficult to resist the instantaneous impact resulting in the decrease of activity in the third stage of 15 days dha activity in r1and r2 gradually increased because with the almost complete degradation of aniline the microbial community had begun to gradually adapt to the toxic environment until the effluent indicators approached stable the reactor started stably in addition it was found that the dha activity in r2 at 25th day was already close to the dha activity in r1 at 30th day and the electrical stimulation obviously promoted the microbial activity which laterally reflected that the r2 reactor could complete the stable start up faster than the r1 reactor dha activity in r2 was higher than that in r1 at any stage this may also be related to the excessively high concentration of nh4 n in r1 than r2 fig 2 b which inhibits the metabolic reaction of microorganisms and could directly inhibit the enzyme activity of cells 33 appropriate current stimulation could change cell permeability enhance metabolism and increase the activity of the microbial system the faster degradation rate of aniline within r2 was also found in the cyclic experiments higher dha activity leads to a greater ability to biodegrade organic matter 34 3 4 microbial abundance and diversity index current and aniline obviously change the abundance of reactive microbial communities in two systems the values of ace chao and shannon in sample s0 were the highest table 1 besides the ace chao and shannon values of s2 were higher than s1 after the start up the microbial richness and diversity of two reactors all decreased the results of this study indicating that part microorganisms could not tolerate the toxicity of aniline in traditional sbr 35 but e sbr system would have higher bacterial richness and diversity under dc model corresponding to the best performance of aniline degradation and nitrogen removal high species diversity due to its rapid adaptability to environmental changes could improve the stability and the anti toxicity ability of the system and remove pollutants more effectively 36 moreover the community richness and diversity of s2a and s2c were greater than s2 some specific bacteria accumulate on biofilms by electrical stimulation the venn diagram fig 5 show that the total number of otus was 1969 and 527 otus or 26 8 of the total otus were shared by these samples and the community structure changed greatly after the start up 3 5 microbial community composition 3 5 1 activated sludge relative abundances of microbial communities with activated sludge in two systems were analyzed as shown in fig 6 a proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidota actinobacteriota dominated in these three samples at the phylum level they occupied 77 53 89 57 82 37 respectively the proportion of dominant bacteria change dramatically in the aniline wastewater system the relative abundance of proteobacteria in s1 and s2 53 50 35 35 was slightly higher than that in s0 24 35 which may be more tolerant to water environment containing aniline 37 moreover chloroflexi was observed more in the activated sludge of e sbr 18 15 than in the sbr system 11 44 suggesting that the electricity environment was suitable for the growth of chloroflexi proteobacteria and chloroflexi all have been shown to have the ability to remove aromatic contaminants and remove nitrogen 38 very interestingly compared to s0 applied voltage benefited actinobacteriota but decreased nitrospirota which may be the reason that actinobacteriota was more suitable for electrical stimulation and aniline toxicity while nitrospirota was not fig 6 c illustrated the changes of microbial communities at genus level first it could be seen that the clustering trees of s1 and s0 were closer indicating that they were more similar while s2 s2a s2c were quite different from them the percentage of rhodococcus and luteococcus in s2 4 55 5 31 was higher than that in s1 0 27 0 3 it could be clearly seen that their growth was improved under electrical stimulation rhodococcus and luteococcus have been proved to have aromatic compound s ability in previous studies 39 anaerolineae in s2 2 80 was higher than that in s1 1 01 and s0 0 93 previous studies have shown that anaerolineae was the main microorganism in the nh4 n removal process in the bioelectrochemical system 40 which also explains why the nh4 n removal rate in the r2 reactor is higher sm1a02 showed the same trend with anaerolineae its abundance in s2 2 54 was higher than that in s1 1 54 although the abundance is very low it could still have a high capacity for degrade aromatic compounds and nitrify 41 in addition denitratisoma r0 0 51 r1 0 06 r2 1 69 and haliangium r0 1 23 r1 0 35 r2 2 1 were also reported to have aerobic denitrification ability in previous studies 42 43 they could not adapt to the aniline system in r1 but play a special role of denitrification in r2 furthermore the abundance of propionicimonas 0 015 micropruina 0 020 unclassified c bacteroidia 0 15 and zoogloea 0 15 decreased during the start up period of the e sbr it might be attributed to current stimulated suppressed the metabolism of these genera 3 5 2 electrode biofilm according to the changes of phylum level in the electrode biofilms it can be seen that s2a and s2c reproduced a large number of proteobacteria 55 67 35 38 chloroflexi 14 3 29 3 and they both have good organic matter degradation and nitrogen removal performance besides many studies have demonstrated that electroactive bacteriomes were widely distributed in proteobacteria to realize electron transfer between bacteria and electrodes 44 the abundance of bacteroidota and actinobacteriota in electrode biofilms decreased obviously compared to other samples and a similar phenomenon had been found that bacteroidota and actinobacteriota were inhibited by current 44 certainly microbial communities still have a big difference between cathode and anode further analysis microbial on electrode biofilms at genus level cluster tree fig 6 c based on community phylogenetic lineages revealed that two samples of electrode biofilms were far away from s1 but similar to s2 alicycliphilus which was correlated with the degradation of refractory aromatic compounds 45 could effectively accumulate at electrode biofilm ellin6067 was relatively high abundances with 3 40 in s2a and 3 81 in s2c qiu 46 reported that ellin6067 was one of predominant nitrifying genera in sbr to treat wastewater with a low c n ratio thauera existed extensively in anode biofilm 6 51 and cathode biofilm 2 40 with the function of denitrification 47 denitratisoma had relatively high abundance in s2a 4 13 and s2c 4 44 same as the above results denitratisoma has been proved that is the key to promote the nitrogen removal efficiency in the water treatment system arenimonas was detected in s2a and s2c with 3 0 and 1 3 it has been found in bioelectrochemical systems and have the ability of hydrogen autotrophic denitrification 48 hydrogenophaga also could perform hydrogen autotrophic denitrification its appearance may be related to electrolytic hydrogen production 49 further study will be required to confirm the occurrence of hydrogen autotrophic denitrification besides norank f caldilineaceae 7 72 and norank f norank o c10 sb1a 5 67 were availably enriched in the e sbr system but until now the function of them is unknown in addition it could be observed from the figure that the proportion of some functional genera pseudomonas thermomonas and haliangium in electrode biofilms was almost non existent this phenomenon indicated that the weak current environment containing aniline was unfavorable for growth of these genera the stimulation of current will significantly change the microbial community in r1 and r2 the higher abundance of these functional genera in activated sludge and electrode biofilms could better promote aniline degradation and nitrogen removal 3 6 microorganism metabolic characteristics aniline degradation and nitrogen removal are closely related to microbial metabolic pathway the kegg pathway abundance of five samples was statistically analyzed the metabolic pathways are divided into three levels the main ways of the level 1 table 2 include cellular processes 3 48 4 21 environmental information processing 12 90 13 84 genetic information processing 16 09 16 43 human diseases 0 93 1 11 metabolism 50 18 51 84 and organismal systems 0 81 0 86 among them metabolism as an important function for microorganisms to maintain bacteria survival accounts 50 18 51 84 for the largest proportions of all metabolic pathways in the metabolic pathway of level 2 the first 10 metabolic pathways were selected to analyze the metabolic characteristics of microorganisms in aniline wastewater during the start up period fig 7 a amino acid metabolism was higher in r2 11 09 10 78 10 74 than in r1 10 68 carbohydrate metabolism was higher in r2 10 45 9 99 10 54 than in r1 9 92 and energy metabolism was higher in r2 5 94 5 76 5 94 than in r1 5 69 it is obvious that the metabolic activity of the e sbr system was higher than traditional sbr system higher metabolic abundance may be related to the enhancement of system activity induced by current stimulation the abundance of cellular processes and signaling in r2 3 32 3 66 3 32 was lower than r1 3 80 current could inhibit the signal transduction between cells 50 51 besides current increased the relative abundance of membrane transport in r2 which may be related to extracellular electron transfer some electrochemically active bacteria could produce proteins that make electron transfer easier functions in level 3 of energy metabolism are shown in fig 7 b the relative abundance of nitrogen metabolism in s0 s1 s2 s2a and s2c were 12 37 12 93 13 52 13 48 and 13 78 respectively high abundance of nitrogen metabolism explained why tn concentration in r2 is lower than r0 oxidative phosphorylation which refers to the role of atp production accompanying biological oxidation was higher in abundance in r2 28 54 28 65 28 57 than in r1 27 83 atp production is related to microbial growth and reproduction 52 among these functions only ascorbate and aldarate metabolism and pentose phosphate abundance decreased in e sbr the current promoted the microbial degradation abilities of various sugars 52 53 it is also related to the biodegradation of organic matter all these results are only predictive to explore more accurately it is necessary to further use advanced technology like metagenomics and gene technology 3 7 mechanisms of the study the e sbr could start up faster and had faster aniline degradation rate and higher total nitrogen removal rate may be due to the following reasons first current stimulation could improve the overall dha activity of the system compared with the traditional biological system the e sbr system had higher species diversity which makes the system more stable and could effectively resist toxic treatment pollutants to adapt to the new environment faster second activated sludge luteococcus and rhodococcus could use aniline as carbon sources to grow while anaerolineae and sm1a02 have the ability to oxidize nh4 n which produced by aniline degrade then denitratisoma and haliangium can participate in denitrification third electrode biofilm which mainly contained alicycliphilus ellin6067 denitratisoma thauera hydrogenophaga and arenimonas demonstrated superior performance towards aniline degradation and nitrogen removal because electrolysis produces hydrogen it is worth noting that the no3 n produced in the nitrification could be reduced further by hydrogen autotrophic denitrification hydrogenophaga arenimonas their syntrophic interactions could quick start system and improve the performance of the e sbr system 4 conclusions in this study e sbr was successfully established and realized faster startup which not only achieved almost complete degradation of aniline but also achieved a removal rate of up to 80 than traditional sbr activity and stability of microbial community were improved by electric current through the evaluation of microbial community and metabolic pathway in e sbr system it was found that the combined of suspended sludge and electrode biofilm ensured the degradation of aniline and the removal of nitrogen however we do need to acknowledge the limitations of the study we will study the treatment mechanism and working condition optimization of higher concentration aniline in the future nonetheless this study demonstrated that the e sbr system would be a promising alternative for the efficient treatment of aniline and nitrogen and it also provided some theoretical guidance for biological waste

13187,the growing threat to human health caused by cadmium pollution urges industry to conduct proper and efficient wastewater treatment for that purpose chitosan could be employed as an excellent adsorbent for the cadmium removal however requiring some modifications this present work aimed to develop chitosan beads by means of glycine grafting pegde crosslinking and magnetic fe3o4 filler embedment characterizations of the prepared fe3o4 chitosan glycine pegde fe3o4 ch g p beads were carried out using fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd thermogravimetry analysis tga differential scanning calorimetry dsc and scanning electron microscope sem batch adsorption of cd2 was optimized with parameters of contact time and solution ph the regeneration of fe3o4 ch g p was also studied batch adsorption of cd2 on fe3o4 ch g p was found optimum after 30 min contact time at initial ph 5 with removal percentage of more than 98 isotherm studies suggested the adsorption was langmuir isotherm model dependent adjusted r2 0 992 with q m 171 06 mg g further investigation using three parameters isotherm model sips revealed a better fitness with adjusted r2 0 999 the experimental data followed pseudo second order kinetic model adjusted r2 0 796 0 911 and 0 981 for initial cd2 concentrations of 20 25 and 30 mg l respectively indicated the adsorption was determined by chemisorption in conclusion the addition of pegde improved the ability of magnetic glycine grafted chitosan in cd2 removal from aqueous solution graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords amino acids cadmium chitosan fe3o4 pegde 1 introduction cadmium cd exposure to human body could induce disrupted testicular growth anemia liver maldevelopment of joints kidney damage scaly skin inhibited body growth and possibly death 1 3 recently cd is known to play a role in the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer 4 and breast cancer 5 all these serious threats are growing with the increase of anthropogenic activities involving cadmium 6 8 of which painting and electroplating during industrial processes could contribute to the release of cd into the environment 9 hence wastewater treatment should be carried out to prevent and stop cd pollution unlike organic pollutant heavy metals are non degradable resulting in limited options for the treatment 10 adsorbent in combination with other wastewater treatment method could be a powerful tool to remove cd from industrial effluents 11 13 among many adsorbent materials chitosan is considered one of the best in possessing high adsorption capacity against pollutants 14 moreover chitosan is easy to modify stem from its active amine functional groups 15 scholars are currently developing chitosan to improve its performance for heavy metal uptake and overcoming its weaknesses such as acid sensitive solubility mechanical endurance and thermal stability 14 16 18 in our previous work we used crosslinking agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 19 sulfuric acid 20 and polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether pegde 21 to improve the performance of chitosan based composite for various pollutant adsorptions pegde was revealed to significantly contribute in improving the properties of chitosan and its heavy metal removal performance associated with enriched o containing functional groups 21 based on our experience crosslinked chitosan loses its amine active site after the reaction with crosslinker resulting in decreased pollutant uptake 19 21 amine functional group nh2 has a significant role in the adsorption process especially in term of synergistic coordination between the o and n containing group 22 in this present work we preserved the amine functional group as well as added more carbonyl moieties co through polymer grafting using amino acid glycine glycine contains carboxylic moieties cooh that could form a bonding with amine or hydroxyl oh moieties in chitosan this approach has been used by several reported studies for heavy metal adsorptions 23 26 herein we prepared the adsorbent in a form of bead expected to provide more contact surface facilitating adsorbate adsorbent interaction 20 27 furthermore magnetic iron sand fe3o4 particles that was collected from local beach and prepared with ecofriendly method 28 were embedded to the adsorbent with such method the adsorbent could be easily separated from the treated wastewater by utilizing a magnet indeed there have been several reports investigating on the use of similar magnetic chitosan bead 23 29 a study even has achieved high removal of ni2 zn2 and hg2 from water medium using glycine grafted chitosan embedded with magnetic micro particles 25 however the utilization of crosslinker pegde in magnetic glycine grafted chitosan is new 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials materials used in this research were chitosan glycine polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether pegde cd no3 2 hcl hno3 naoh glacial ch3cooh and dithizone c13h12n4s except for chitosan all chemicals were analytical grade and procured from sigma aldrich selangor malaysia the chitosan acetyl degree 75 85 was procured from tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan in addition fe3o4 particles were prepared from the iron sand collected from syiah kuala beach banda aceh indonesia the preparation of fe3o4 included washing with hot water oven drying at 70 c and ball milling for 20 h at 300 rpm as detailed in our previous report 28 2 2 preparation of bead adsorbents samples in this study were prepared with phase inversion method following our published works 20 28 chitosan 0 35 g was initially dissolved in 20 ml acetic acid 2 and stirred at 250 rpm for 2 h glycine with a weight variation ranged from 0 05 to 0 25 g was added to chitosan solution whilst stirred for another 2 h with the same rotation speed before the addition of pegde 0 07 g the doping solution was then stirred continuously for another 2 h 250 rpm thereafter magnetic fe3o4 filler 0 5 g was added and stirred for 1 h the doping solution was drop wised into 250 ml naoh 3 m solution through a syringe to give a bead shape the sample was neutralized using distilled water until the ph reached 7 filtered and oven dried at 40 c samples without the magnetic filler and pegde were labelled as chitosan glycine ch g whereas those with magnetic filler and pegde were labelled as fe3o4 chitosan glycine pegde fe3o4 ch g p average yield of bead sample from this procedure ranged from 86 to 89 w w 2 3 characterization to identify the functional groups of chitosan ch g with optimum glycine concentration and fe3o4 ch g p fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy analysis was carried out using ft ir prestige 21 shimadzu kyoto japan as for the crystallinity characteristics the analysis was carried out using x ray diffractometer shimadzu xrd 700 kyoto japan at 8 min scanning speed cu kα radiation investigations of thermal gravimetry analysis tga as well as differential scanning calorimetry dsc were carried out to observe thermal behavior of the prepared samples using shimadzu dttg 60 kyoto japan and shimadzu dsc 60 kyoto japan respectively the surface morphologies of the prepared specimens were observed under scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 6510 la tokyo japan at 15 kv 2 4 batch adsorption the batch adsorption in this study was carried out in triplicate in an artificial cd2 containing aqueous solution prepared by dissolving cd no3 2 in distilled water the prepared adsorbent was firstly weighed 0 1 g and inserted into an erlenmeyer 100 ml that had been filled with 25 ml cd2 solution the erlenmeyer was then placed on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm and room temperature 25 1 c to study the optimum glycine loading the batch adsorption was carried out at ph 5 5 for 40 min with cd2 25 mg l to search the optimum condition contact time was varied from 5 to 50 min and ph from 2 to 9 with the same earlier concentration of cd2 for isotherm studies the initial concentration of cd2 was ranged between 35 and 85 mg l operated under optimum conditions after the adsorption the adsorbent was extracted from the artificial waste solution using a magnet the leftover cd2 solution was determined for its concentration by using uv vis spectroscopy hence the solution had to be priorly complexed with dithizone firstly the ph solution was increased to 12 followed by the addition of 4 ml dithizone 0 005 w v afterward the solution was dissolved using distilled water in a volumetric flask 50 ml and left for 5 min the concentration was finally measured using uv vis sepctrometer at maximum wavelength 470 nm 2 5 regeneration this study was conducted to determine how many cycles of cd2 adsorption could be carried out using fe3o4 ch g p beads without a significant drop of removal efficiency after used in an adsorption cycle the fe3o4 ch g p beads 1 g were soaked in 250 ml hno3 0 001 n for 30 min to release the adsorbed cadmium thereafter the ph of the beads was neutralized by washing repeatedly using distilled water and oven dried at 40 c for 24 h then fe3o4 ch g p beads were reused for the next cycle until the 6th cycle was reached the regeneration procedure for each cycle was carried out in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 fourier transform infrared ft ir functional group contained in fe3o4 ch g p ch g and chitosan were identified based on the ft ir spectrum ranged from wavenumber 4500 to 500 cm 1 fig 1 broad absorbance bands observed within around 3750 to 3000 cm 1 were the overlapping stretching vibrations of oh and nh that are typical in materials containing chitosan 30 31 in the ft ir spectrum generated from chitosan an absorbance peak at 1631 cm 1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of co from amide i conh meanwhile the bending vibration of nh from amide ii and stretching vibration of co from amide iii are overlapping causing a broad spectral band at 1379 cm 1 32 in contrast the amide ii and amide iii spectral profile is more defined in both fe3o4 ch g p and ch g speculated to be caused by more nh moieties in the polymeric molecule the embedment of fe3o4 is indicated by the clear presence of spectral peak at 592 cm 1 it is confirmed by the ft ir spectrum of fe3o4 where an intense vibrational peak at 586 cm 1 could be observed in fe3o4 ch g p spectrum broader absorbance band at the range of around 3750 to 3000 cm 1 along with sharper and more intense spectral peak at 848 cm 1 could be associated with the crosslinking formation between pegde and chitosan 21 33 the overall finding of this ft ir spectroscopy investigation confirms the successful preparation of fe3o4 ch g p composite o and n containing functional groups identified in the composite could improve cationic pollutant adsorption 34 36 3 2 x ray diffraction xrd to observe the crystallinity of the prepared samples x ray diffraction xrd analysis was carried out and its diffractogram has been presented fig 2 typical xrd characteristic of chitosan could be observed at 2θ of around 20 assigned to the presence of crystalline lattice in chitosan 17 19 appearing in all samples though it becomes unclear in the fe3o4 ch g p xrd peaks of ch g diffractogram at 29 95 34 35 35 09 37 83 39 74 41 41 and 46 58 are assigned to the bond formation between glycine and chitosan this is in agreement with both glycine and glycine modified chitosan diffractograms reported previously 37 embedment of fe3o4 is responsible for the appearance of crystalline peaks at 2θ of 30 23 35

the adsorption 40 41 some reports suggest the embedment of fe3o4 as filling particles could reduce the crystallinity of a polymer 16 35 42 to obtain a quantitative information from the diffractogram crystallinity index of each sample was calculated using crystalline peak noise ratio times 100 19 crystallinity indices for fe3o4 ch g p ch g and chitosan are 51 1 63 5 and 65 1 respectively it confirms that addition of fe3o4 filler along with crosslinking using pegde resulted in more amorphous material amorphousness allows higher aqueous medium diffusion promoting more adsorbate to interact with adsorbent surface thus leads to higher pollutant uptake 36 43 44 3 3 differential scanning calorimetry dsc and thermo gravimetry analysis tga in this work we investigate the thermal behavior of the prepared samples to determine the proper storage and operating temperature of the adsorbent the structure change caused by heat increment could affect the adsorption dsc and tga thermograms obtained from the analysis have been presented fig 3 the first endothermic shoulder in the dsc thermogram is assigned to the loss of water and other volatile contents the following exothermic peak is assigned to the main cleavage of chitosan backbone which cause the major degradation the peaks were recorded at 299 298 and 319 c for fe3o4 ch g p ch g and chitosan respectively a broad exothermic peak emerged within the range of 350 500 c in thermograms of either ch g or fe3o4 ch g p in line with the previous report 45 we stipulate that chitosan forming a linkage with glycine or pegde is more thermally stable resulting the degradation at later temperature the phenomenon was confirmed by the results of tga showing three steps of degradation the first sign of thermal degradation was attributed with the evaporation of water and volatile contents accounted for 18 4 11 0 and 12 6 of chitosan ch g and fe3o4 ch g p it was then followed by the major degradation started tonset at 257 237 and 230 c for fe3o4 ch g p ch g and chitosan respectively it indicates that crosslinking using pegde could prevent early initiation of the thermal degradation tga results also corroborate our foregoing stipulation by showing that more residue obtained after the addition of glycine and pegde in the case of pegde this finding is in agreement to our previous study 21 taken altogether modification using glycine and pegde could improve the thermal stability of the material 3 4 scanning electron microscopy sem the actual image of fe3o4 ch g p bead along with its micro surface observation under sem have been presented fig 4 the black colour in fe3o4 ch g p was originated from the magnetic iron sand particles the shape of the bead was not spherical with longer diameter at the centre resembling a falling water drop the shape was mostly influenced by the syringe drop wising technique used in this present furthermore the presence of particle like fillers could be seen covering the entire surface of the bead suggesting even distribution of fe3o4 however heterogenous bubbling shape at some areas of the surface could be a sign of agglomeration formation between fillers 46 47 a recent published report suggested that fe3o4 agglomeration could be induced by the low ph condition 48 higher magnification observation exhibits the roughness of the micro surface which could facilitate adsorbate diffusion 49 50 3 5 effect of glycine on cd2 removal glycine grafting onto chitosan molecule may enrich the functional group derived binding sites that contribute to higher pollutant removal it is confirmed by the increase in cd2 removal and adsorption capacity with respect to glycine loading fig 5 both removal percentage and adsorption capacity were correlated significantly against glycine loading with pearson s r of more than 0 956 the adsorbent used in this study had glycine loading variation 0 0 25 g since we wanted to observed the influence of glycine this finding is in line with previous reports 14 23 the optimum concentration of glycine loading was obtained at 0 15 g improving 16 57 of cd2 adsorption more addition of glycine resulted in lower cd2 adsorption because of the denser structure in modified chitosan stem from higher abundance of functional groups intramolecular interactions in the adsorbent are induced by the presence of functional groups resulting in a denser structure that inhibits the access of adsorbate to reach the binding sites this is the reason to use 0 15 g in the preparation of fe3o4 ch g p the effect of pegde and magnetic addition was not investigated in this presence study because their optimum loadings had been obtained from our published works 21 28 3 6 batch adsorption parameters an adsorption increases with the increase of contact time until it reaches an equilibrium state in this study the effect of contact time has been studied and presented fig 6a b during the initial contact times the adsorbent contained a lot of unoccupied active sites contributing to higher removal rate however when the removal rate was not significantly rapid the process could be dependent on the adsorbate diffusion which is physical rather than chemical in our study the equilibrium was reached after 30 min adsorption for both ch g and fe3o4 ch g p in contrast with that in fe3o4 ch g p the cd2 adsorption increment was slower in ch g hence cd2 adsorption onto ch g beads was predominantly governed by physical force the reduction of cd2 adsorption in thereafter could be caused by the agitation taken altogether it could be concluded that the optimum contact time was 30 min which was then employed for further studies it is worth noting that we had achieved shorter contact time to reach the similar cd2 adsorptive removal 83 obtained in other research 51 parameter ph is not less important than contact time when working on adsorption herein the effect of ph on cd2 adsorption onto ch g and fe3o4 ch g p beads has been presented fig 6c at low ph levels chitosan is protonated resulting in positively charged surface that contradict with the adsorbate cd2 charge thus the adsorbate with the same positive charge could be electrostatically repulsed to confirm this we measured the point of zero charge phpzc using ph drift method fig 6d as suggested by previous report 52 it revealed that the phpzc of ch g and fe3o4 ch g p are 9 27 and 6 49 respectively below these ph values the surface is positively charged in that sense fe3o4 ch g p has higher adsorption capacity because the surface is less negatively charged however in the case of either ch g or fe3o4 ch g p even though initial ph solution has exceeded the phpzc the adsorption experienced a decrease it indicates that the adsorption was not solely governed by adsorbate adsorbent electrostatic interaction in acidic condition chitosan has higher mobility that contribute to the swelling this change of chitosan structure is important to allow adsorbate accessing the binding site of the adsorbent when the ph is increased to more basic condition chitosan ability to swell is reduced leading to the inhibition of adsorbate adsorbent interaction it could be the reason as to why at higher ph the adsorption was reduced to confirm we determined the swelling degree of the chitosan at different ph level in distilled water for 1 h following previously reported method 53 the study proves that increased ph level could contribute to reduce swelling degree of the chitosan based adsorbent fig 7 hence the optimum cd2 uptake at ph 5 has been justified as it has been proven as the optimum condition for the cd2 removal ph 5 was employed for further studies 3 7 adsorption isotherms isotherm models usually used to depict the adsorbate adsorbent interaction are the two parameters langmuir and freundlich equations langmuir equation is constructed based on the assumption that the adsorption forms a monolayer adsorbate binding on the adsorbent surface with homogenous energy on contrary freundlich equation uses the assumption that the energy at each binding site is different resulting a heterogeneity and possible multilayer adsorption as for the three parameters isotherm model we used sips a combination of langmuir and freundlich models which works very well for high concentration range of adsorbate herein we used the non linear form of the isotherm model equations 54 the experimental data were fitted with that of predicted by the model which could be seen in the ce versus q e plot constructed fig 8 the agreement between the experimental and theoretical data suggests the defining adsorbate adsorbent interaction the parameters calculated based on the langmuir freundlich and sips isotherm models have been presented in table 1 in the case of two parameters isotherm model the best fitness between experimental and theoretical data was obtained in langmuir model based on the values of adjusted r2 and root mean square error rmse for ch g or fe3o4 ch g p hence cd2 adsorption onto either ch g or fe3o4 ch g p is homogenous and monolayer the predicted adsorption capacity maximum q m for cd2 adsorption onto ch g and fe3o4 ch g p are 128 208 and 171 064 mg g respectively this corroborates the fact that fe3o4 ch g p has more ability to adsorb cd2 furthermore the maximum adsorption capacities calculated from langmuir equation suggest that our adsorbent could perform better cd2 removal than that of reported table 2 however the adsorption is expected to be improved as the maximum adsorption capacity still below that obtained from charcoal chitosan edta film 19 an investigation employing three parameters isotherm model sips resulted in better agreement between the experimental and theoretical data than that of langmuir model the adjusted r2 and rmse obtained in this isotherm model are 0 999 and 0 16 respectively this finding is in agreement with that of published report using magnetic glycine modified chitosan where sips isotherm model yielded the better fitness 25 k s value obtained suggests a stronger adsorption capacity of ch g 29 458 l g than that of fe3o4 ch g p 87 126 l g when sips model applied against the adsorption data generated from high concentration range of adsorbate the model would be reduced to langmuir 54 hence the prediction in sips model generated in our study is dependent to monolayer adsorption 3 8 adsorption kinetics kinetic models used for the adsorption in this study were pseudo first order and pseudo second order where the plots have been exhibited fig 9 the evaluation of kinetics model used three different initial concentrations 20 25 and 30 mg l since using single concentration is not reliable in kinetic studies 59 the values of parameters obtained from the kinetic studies have been presented table 3 the adjusted r2 along with rmse suggest that the adsorption onto ch g follows pseudo first order kinetic model furthermore the pseudo second order constant is obtained negative indicating the unsuitability of the model hence cd2 adsorption onto ch g is dependent to physisorption on contrary pseudo second order kinetic model applied on the adsorption onto fe3o4 ch g p has higher adjusted r2 and lower rmse than that of pseudo first order moreover the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe predicted by the pseudo second order kinetic model is closer to the experimental data than that of pseudo first order hence it can be concluded that cd2 adsorption onto fe3o4 ch g p beads is governed by chemisorption this finding implies the importance of functional groups that facilitate a strong bonding interaction of adsorbate adsorbent from this point we have understood that fe3o4 ch g p contributes to higher cd2 uptake hence further investigation will be carried out solely on fe3o4 ch g p beads 3 9 adsorption mechanism our investigation has revealed the working mechanism of cd2 onto fe3o4 ch g p via electrostatic interaction the interaction is facilitated by o and n containing functional groups 34 60 to confirm this claim we had conducted an analysis using ft ir spectroscopy on the adsorbent before and after the batch adsorption fig 10 it revealed the occurrence of absorbance reduction observed at 3458 1672 1462 850 and 592 cm 1 due to the disturbance of the vibration deriving from the presence of bonded cd2 interestingly a new spectral peak appeared at 1071 cm 1 which is assigned to bending vibration of cdo it proves the complex formation between the adsorbed heavy metal with the o containing functional group as similarly reported before 19 61 3 10 regeneration an adsorbent is more economically valuable when it can be used for several cycles for that purpose we conducted the regeneration of fe3o4 ch g p for six cycles of cd2 removal fig 11 it is found that the magnetic bead composite could maintain high cd2 uptake up to the third cycle removal 80 however the removal dropped continuously along with the number of cycles in our published work 21 we found that the regeneration process reduced the number of amine moieties which acted as active sites to entrap the adsorbate there is indeed another possibility of ineffective desorption process causing lower number of the adsorbent binding sites but if the desorption efficiency is the chief reason for the cd2 removal reduction further depletion would not occur therefore the loss of amine moieties remains the main reason of the poor regeneration of our adsorbent material despite the uncertainty of the desorption mechanism this present study has achieved an improvement regarding the reusability of the adsorbent compared to our previous work 19 21 although we still perceive this as a challenge for future researches 4 conclusion glycine has been successfully grafted into chitosan along with the pegde crosslinking and magnetic fe3o4 filler embedment as confirmed by collective characterization carried out in this study the modification of chitosan enriched the functional group improved the amorphousness produced rougher surface and increased the thermal stability glycine addition resulted in higher cd2 uptake owing to its contribution in providing o and n containing functional group cd2 adsorption onto the prepared adsorbents other than functional groups was influenced by the initial ph that determine the surface charge of the materials as well as their ability to swell the isotherm and kinetics of cd2 adsorption onto ch g or fe3o4 ch g p were dependent to sips and pseudo second order models

13187,the growing threat to human health caused by cadmium pollution urges industry to conduct proper and efficient wastewater treatment for that purpose chitosan could be employed as an excellent adsorbent for the cadmium removal however requiring some modifications this present work aimed to develop chitosan beads by means of glycine grafting pegde crosslinking and magnetic fe3o4 filler embedment characterizations of the prepared fe3o4 chitosan glycine pegde fe3o4 ch g p beads were carried out using fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd thermogravimetry analysis tga differential scanning calorimetry dsc and scanning electron microscope sem batch adsorption of cd2 was optimized with parameters of contact time and solution ph the regeneration of fe3o4 ch g p was also studied batch adsorption of cd2 on fe3o4 ch g p was found optimum after 30 min contact time at initial ph 5 with removal percentage of more than 98 isotherm studies suggested the adsorption was langmuir isotherm model dependent adjusted r2 0 992 with q m 171 06 mg g further investigation using three parameters isotherm model sips revealed a better fitness with adjusted r2 0 999 the experimental data followed pseudo second order kinetic model adjusted r2 0 796 0 911 and 0 981 for initial cd2 concentrations of 20 25 and 30 mg l respectively indicated the adsorption was determined by chemisorption in conclusion the addition of pegde improved the ability of magnetic glycine grafted chitosan in cd2 removal from aqueous solution graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords amino acids cadmium chitosan fe3o4 pegde 1 introduction cadmium cd exposure to human body could induce disrupted testicular growth anemia liver maldevelopment of joints kidney damage scaly skin inhibited body growth and possibly death 1 3 recently cd is known to play a role in the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer 4 and breast cancer 5 all these serious threats are growing with the increase of anthropogenic activities involving cadmium 6 8 of which painting and electroplating during industrial processes could contribute to the release of cd into the environment 9 hence wastewater treatment should be carried out to prevent and stop cd pollution unlike organic pollutant heavy metals are non degradable resulting in limited options for the treatment 10 adsorbent in combination with other wastewater treatment method could be a powerful tool to remove cd from industrial effluents 11 13 among many adsorbent materials chitosan is considered one of the best in possessing high adsorption capacity against pollutants 14 moreover chitosan is easy to modify stem from its active amine functional groups 15 scholars are currently developing chitosan to improve its performance for heavy metal uptake and overcoming its weaknesses such as acid sensitive solubility mechanical endurance and thermal stability 14 16 18 in our previous work we used crosslinking agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 19 sulfuric acid 20 and polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether pegde 21 to improve the performance of chitosan based composite for various pollutant adsorptions pegde was revealed to significantly contribute in improving the properties of chitosan and its heavy metal removal performance associated with enriched o containing functional groups 21 based on our experience crosslinked chitosan loses its amine active site after the reaction with crosslinker resulting in decreased pollutant uptake 19 21 amine functional group nh2 has a significant role in the adsorption process especially in term of synergistic coordination between the o and n containing group 22 in this present work we preserved the amine functional group as well as added more carbonyl moieties co through polymer grafting using amino acid glycine glycine contains carboxylic moieties cooh that could form a bonding with amine or hydroxyl oh moieties in chitosan this approach has been used by several reported studies for heavy metal adsorptions 23 26 herein we prepared the adsorbent in a form of bead expected to provide more contact surface facilitating adsorbate adsorbent interaction 20 27 furthermore magnetic iron sand fe3o4 particles that was collected from local beach and prepared with ecofriendly method 28 were embedded to the adsorbent with such method the adsorbent could be easily separated from the treated wastewater by utilizing a magnet indeed there have been several reports investigating on the use of similar magnetic chitosan bead 23 29 a study even has achieved high removal of ni2 zn2 and hg2 from water medium using glycine grafted chitosan embedded with magnetic micro particles 25 however the utilization of crosslinker pegde in magnetic glycine grafted chitosan is new 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials materials used in this research were chitosan glycine polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether pegde cd no3 2 hcl hno3 naoh glacial ch3cooh and dithizone c13h12n4s except for chitosan all chemicals were analytical grade and procured from sigma aldrich selangor malaysia the chitosan acetyl degree 75 85 was procured from tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan in addition fe3o4 particles were prepared from the iron sand collected from syiah kuala beach banda aceh indonesia the preparation of fe3o4 included washing with hot water oven drying at 70 c and ball milling for 20 h at 300 rpm as detailed in our previous report 28 2 2 preparation of bead adsorbents samples in this study were prepared with phase inversion method following our published works 20 28 chitosan 0 35 g was initially dissolved in 20 ml acetic acid 2 and stirred at 250 rpm for 2 h glycine with a weight variation ranged from 0 05 to 0 25 g was added to chitosan solution whilst stirred for another 2 h with the same rotation speed before the addition of pegde 0 07 g the doping solution was then stirred continuously for another 2 h 250 rpm thereafter magnetic fe3o4 filler 0 5 g was added and stirred for 1 h the doping solution was drop wised into 250 ml naoh 3 m solution through a syringe to give a bead shape the sample was neutralized using distilled water until the ph reached 7 filtered and oven dried at 40 c samples without the magnetic filler and pegde were labelled as chitosan glycine ch g whereas those with magnetic filler and pegde were labelled as fe3o4 chitosan glycine pegde fe3o4 ch g p average yield of bead sample from this procedure ranged from 86 to 89 w w 2 3 characterization to identify the functional groups of chitosan ch g with optimum glycine concentration and fe3o4 ch g p fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy analysis was carried out using ft ir prestige 21 shimadzu kyoto japan as for the crystallinity characteristics the analysis was carried out using x ray diffractometer shimadzu xrd 700 kyoto japan at 8 min scanning speed cu kα radiation investigations of thermal gravimetry analysis tga as well as differential scanning calorimetry dsc were carried out to observe thermal behavior of the prepared samples using shimadzu dttg 60 kyoto japan and shimadzu dsc 60 kyoto japan respectively the surface morphologies of the prepared specimens were observed under scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 6510 la tokyo japan at 15 kv 2 4 batch adsorption the batch adsorption in this study was carried out in triplicate in an artificial cd2 containing aqueous solution prepared by dissolving cd no3 2 in distilled water the prepared adsorbent was firstly weighed 0 1 g and inserted into an erlenmeyer 100 ml that had been filled with 25 ml cd2 solution the erlenmeyer was then placed on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm and room temperature 25 1 c to study the optimum glycine loading the batch adsorption was carried out at ph 5 5 for 40 min with cd2 25 mg l to search the optimum condition contact time was varied from 5 to 50 min and ph from 2 to 9 with the same earlier concentration of cd2 for isotherm studies the initial concentration of cd2 was ranged between 35 and 85 mg l operated under optimum conditions after the adsorption the adsorbent was extracted from the artificial waste solution using a magnet the leftover cd2 solution was determined for its concentration by using uv vis spectroscopy hence the solution had to be priorly complexed with dithizone firstly the ph solution was increased to 12 followed by the addition of 4 ml dithizone 0 005 w v afterward the solution was dissolved using distilled water in a volumetric flask 50 ml and left for 5 min the concentration was finally measured using uv vis sepctrometer at maximum wavelength 470 nm 2 5 regeneration this study was conducted to determine how many cycles of cd2 adsorption could be carried out using fe3o4 ch g p beads without a significant drop of removal efficiency after used in an adsorption cycle the fe3o4 ch g p beads 1 g were soaked in 250 ml hno3 0 001 n for 30 min to release the adsorbed cadmium thereafter the ph of the beads was neutralized by washing repeatedly using distilled water and oven dried at 40 c for 24 h then fe3o4 ch g p beads were reused for the next cycle until the 6th cycle was reached the regeneration procedure for each cycle was carried out in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 fourier transform infrared ft ir functional group contained in fe3o4 ch g p ch g and chitosan were identified based on the ft ir spectrum ranged from wavenumber 4500 to 500 cm 1 fig 1 broad absorbance bands observed within around 3750 to 3000 cm 1 were the overlapping stretching vibrations of oh and nh that are typical in materials containing chitosan 30 31 in the ft ir spectrum generated from chitosan an absorbance peak at 1631 cm 1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of co from amide i conh meanwhile the bending vibration of nh from amide ii and stretching vibration of co from amide iii are overlapping causing a broad spectral band at 1379 cm 1 32 in contrast the amide ii and amide iii spectral profile is more defined in both fe3o4 ch g p and ch g speculated to be caused by more nh moieties in the polymeric molecule the embedment of fe3o4 is indicated by the clear presence of spectral peak at 592 cm 1 it is confirmed by the ft ir spectrum of fe3o4 where an intense vibrational peak at 586 cm 1 could be observed in fe3o4 ch g p spectrum broader absorbance band at the range of around 3750 to 3000 cm 1 along with sharper and more intense spectral peak at 848 cm 1 could be associated with the crosslinking formation between pegde and chitosan 21 33 the overall finding of this ft ir spectroscopy investigation confirms the successful preparation of fe3o4 ch g p composite o and n containing functional groups identified in the composite could improve cationic pollutant adsorption 34 36 3 2 x ray diffraction xrd to observe the crystallinity of the prepared samples x ray diffraction xrd analysis was carried out and its diffractogram has been presented fig 2 typical xrd characteristic of chitosan could be observed at 2θ of around 20 assigned to the presence of crystalline lattice in chitosan 17 19 appearing in all samples though it becomes unclear in the fe3o4 ch g p xrd peaks of ch g diffractogram at 29 95 34 35 35 09 37 83 39 74 41 41 and 46 58 are assigned to the bond formation between glycine and chitosan this is in agreement with both glycine and glycine modified chitosan diffractograms reported previously 37 embedment of fe3o4 is responsible for the appearance of crystalline peaks at 2θ of 30 23 35 82 43 43 57 32 and 62 82 the aforementioned peaks are in line with the xrd patterns of magnetic iron sand we obtained in the previously published report 27 28 lastly pegde mediated crosslinking is attributed to new crystalline peaks observed at 32 3 48 3 49 81 51 29 53 87 and 69 17 with a significant intensity reduction of the chitosan typical peak 2θ 20 c 21 crosslinking reaction in chitosan could interfere hydrogen bond in chitosan macromolecule resulting in the foregoing alteration of xrd profile 38 39 modification of a polymeric material could affect its crystallinity and consequently the adsorption 40 41 some reports suggest the embedment of fe3o4 as filling particles could reduce the crystallinity of a polymer 16 35 42 to obtain a quantitative information from the diffractogram crystallinity index of each sample was calculated using crystalline peak noise ratio times 100 19 crystallinity indices for fe3o4 ch g p ch g and chitosan are 51 1 63 5 and 65 1 respectively it confirms that addition of fe3o4 filler along with crosslinking using pegde resulted in more amorphous material amorphousness allows higher aqueous medium diffusion promoting more adsorbate to interact with adsorbent surface thus leads to higher pollutant uptake 36 43 44 3 3 differential scanning calorimetry dsc and thermo gravimetry analysis tga in this work we investigate the thermal behavior of

still below that obtained from charcoal chitosan edta film 19 an investigation employing three parameters isotherm model sips resulted in better agreement between the experimental and theoretical data than that of langmuir model the adjusted r2 and rmse obtained in this isotherm model are 0 999 and 0 16 respectively this finding is in agreement with that of published report using magnetic glycine modified chitosan where sips isotherm model yielded the better fitness 25 k s value obtained suggests a stronger adsorption capacity of ch g 29 458 l g than that of fe3o4 ch g p 87 126 l g when sips model applied against the adsorption data generated from high concentration range of adsorbate the model would be reduced to langmuir 54 hence the prediction in sips model generated in our study is dependent to monolayer adsorption 3 8 adsorption kinetics kinetic models used for the adsorption in this study were pseudo first order and pseudo second order where the plots have been exhibited fig 9 the evaluation of kinetics model used three different initial concentrations 20 25 and 30 mg l since using single concentration is not reliable in kinetic studies 59 the values of parameters obtained from the kinetic studies have been presented table 3 the adjusted r2 along with rmse suggest that the adsorption onto ch g follows pseudo first order kinetic model furthermore the pseudo second order constant is obtained negative indicating the unsuitability of the model hence cd2 adsorption onto ch g is dependent to physisorption on contrary pseudo second order kinetic model applied on the adsorption onto fe3o4 ch g p has higher adjusted r2 and lower rmse than that of pseudo first order moreover the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe predicted by the pseudo second order kinetic model is closer to the experimental data than that of pseudo first order hence it can be concluded that cd2 adsorption onto fe3o4 ch g p beads is governed by chemisorption this finding implies the importance of functional groups that facilitate a strong bonding interaction of adsorbate adsorbent from this point we have understood that fe3o4 ch g p contributes to higher cd2 uptake hence further investigation will be carried out solely on fe3o4 ch g p beads 3 9 adsorption mechanism our investigation has revealed the working mechanism of cd2 onto fe3o4 ch g p via electrostatic interaction the interaction is facilitated by o and n containing functional groups 34 60 to confirm this claim we had conducted an analysis using ft ir spectroscopy on the adsorbent before and after the batch adsorption fig 10 it revealed the occurrence of absorbance reduction observed at 3458 1672 1462 850 and 592 cm 1 due to the disturbance of the vibration deriving from the presence of bonded cd2 interestingly a new spectral peak appeared at 1071 cm 1 which is assigned to bending vibration of cdo it proves the complex formation between the adsorbed heavy metal with the o containing functional group as similarly reported before 19 61 3 10 regeneration an adsorbent is more economically valuable when it can be used for several cycles for that purpose we conducted the regeneration of fe3o4 ch g p for six cycles of cd2 removal fig 11 it is found that the magnetic bead composite could maintain high cd2 uptake up to the third cycle removal 80 however the removal dropped continuously along with the number of cycles in our published work 21 we found that the regeneration process reduced the number of amine moieties which acted as active sites to entrap the adsorbate there is indeed another possibility of ineffective desorption process causing lower number of the adsorbent binding sites but if the desorption efficiency is the chief reason for the cd2 removal reduction further depletion would not occur therefore the loss of amine moieties remains the main reason of the poor regeneration of our adsorbent material despite the uncertainty of the desorption mechanism this present study has achieved an improvement regarding the reusability of the adsorbent compared to our previous work 19 21 although we still perceive this as a challenge for future researches 4 conclusion glycine has been successfully grafted into chitosan along with the pegde crosslinking and magnetic fe3o4 filler embedment as confirmed by collective characterization carried out in this study the modification of chitosan enriched the functional group improved the amorphousness produced rougher surface and increased the thermal stability glycine addition resulted in higher cd2 uptake owing to its contribution in providing o and n containing functional group cd2 adsorption onto the prepared adsorbents other than functional groups was influenced by the initial ph that determine the surface charge of the materials as well as their ability to swell the isotherm and kinetics of cd2 adsorption onto ch g or fe3o4 ch g p were dependent to sips and pseudo second order models

13188,background owing to the requirement of additional processing steps to separate the spent adsorbents from treated water magnetic multi walled carbon nanotubes mmwcnts have recently been hailed as novel adsorbent methods in this study mwcnts doped with iron oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles n mmwcnts and mwcnts doped with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles pdda mmwcnts were synthesized via solvent free direct doping method prior to the doping process the pristine mwcnts were pre treated with nitric acid significant findings characterization results such as ftir edx xrd and zeta potential analysis confirmed the deposition of fe3o4 onto the mwcnts the stability of the synthesized mmwcnts under different ph was examined detachments of fe3o4 from n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts was found at ph 9 and 3 respectively both types of mmwcnts were applied to the removal of methylene blue mb it was found that the mb adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts was 11 higher than pdda mmwcnts due to significantly higher specific surface area of n mmwcnts n mmwcnts was found to perform better in alkaline condition in which the adsorption capacity increased about 87 from ph 3 to ph 11 the adsorption of mb on n mmwcnts was found to obey the langmuir isotherm indicating monolayer mb molecules adsorption on the n mmwcnts with the calculated maximum adsorption capacity of 20 37 mg g moreover the adsorption of mb followed the pseudo second order kinetic model graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords magnetic multi walled carbon nanotubes direct doping magnetic separation kinetic and isotherm adsorption study water remediation 1 introduction the alarming water pollution issue has been constantly posing a major threat to the human being such matter could be primarily sourced from the presence of heavy metals and dyes in water bodies 1 2 dye contaminated wastewater due to textile production dyeing and printing related industries will not only affect human health but also reduce the light penetration to the aquatic plants for photosynthesis 3 dyes are commonly removed from the polluted water via adsorption process the common adsorbents used in dyes removal include zeolite silica gel and activated carbon ac 4 however these conventional adsorbents exhibit limitations such as low adsorption capacity and efficiency 5 with relatively large surface area hollow structure and mesoporosity multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts have emerged to be potential candidate that can overcome the limitations encountered by the conventional adsorbents 6 mwcnts were capable to remove impurities and contaminants such as heavy metal dyes organic and inorganic materials from water resources efficiently 7 9 mpouras et al had demonstrated the feasibility of mwcnts in removing chromium contaminant from the ground water 10 in addition chinh et al also reported the improvement of photodegradation of methylene blue mb from the synergic effect of mwcnts coupling with tio2 11 therefore it was proven that the presence of carbon nanomaterial contributed to the improvement of adsorption properties of the composite 12 even though mwcnts were considered as the excellent adsorbent adsorption process using conventional adsorbents including mwcnts still required additional processing steps to remove the spent adsorbents from treated water 13 14 membrane separation and centrifugation were normally applied to remove the adsorbent from the aqueous solution before discharging this had increased the overall energy consumption complexity and operation cost of the adsorption process 15 16 this problem can be solved by using the magnetic mwcnts mmwcnts as adsorbent during the adsorption process due to the magnetic property of iron oxide fe3o4 encapsulating and doping of ferromagnetic structure inside mwcnts enabled the formation of mmwcnts by applying the external magnetic field mmwcnts can be separated easily and efficiently from the adsorption medium 17 fe3o4 nanoparticle is one of the metal oxide nanoparticles with attractive properties such as nano sized high surface area to volume ratio and magnetic responsive therefore its function and application in immobilization technology photocatalytic technology and adsorptive technology had been widely studied 18 it was also reported that the iron base nanoparticle performed greatly in treating both organic and inorganic contaminants 19 20 mmwcnts can be synthesized through various methods such as co precipitation solvothermal method chemical deposition 21 thermal decomposition 22 and wet chemical treatment 23 24 duman et al synthesized magnetic oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes κ carrageenan fe3o4 using dimenthylformamide pyridine and thionyl chloride this process required more than three days to achieve completion and the use of thionyl chloride led to unpleasant odour during the synthesis process 25 apart from that it was reported that the mmwcnts synthesized using co precipitation method with iron precursors of nh4fe so4 2 12h2o and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o required conditional control under inert environment and constantly maintaining the ph of the solution throughout the synthesis process 26 alvarez torrellas et al had also synthesized the magnetic adsorbent through co precipitation and encapsulated with alginate to improve the dispersion 27 the major drawbacks of these methods were high production cost owing to the high usage of chemical solvents and the processes are complicated and time consuming thus the novelty and main objective of this work is to synthesize efficient mmwcnts via solvent free direct doping method this facile method could help to overcome the limitations encountered by the conventional synthesis methods to the best of knowledge no studies have been performed to investigate the feasibility of this direct doping method in the synthesis of mmwcnts two types of mmwcnts were prepared using direct doping method mwcnts doped with uncoated fe3o4 nanoparticles denoted as n mmwcnts and mwcnts doped with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles denoted as pdda mmwcnts the stability of both types of mmwcnts in different ph was examined this was followed by the performance test of both mmwcnts in the adsorption of mb in addition the kinetic model and isotherm for the adsorption of mb was also determined to establish its fundamental adsorption mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials mwcnts diameters and lengths ranging from 40 to 60 nm and 1 to 2 μm respectively were purchased from shenzhen nanotechnologies port co fe3o4 nanoparticles purity 98 with diameter ranging from 20 to 30 nm were purchased from nanoamor houston texas usa nitric acid hno3 with purity

100 000 200 000 20 wt in h2o was purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 purification of mwcnts 1 g of pristine mwcnts was weighted and dispersed in 100 ml of concentrated hno3 under ultrasonication for 30 min after ultrasonication the mixture was refluxed at temperature of 80 c for 8 h under continuous stirring upon completion the treated mwcnts were filtered washed with excess distilled water until neutral and dried in oven at 100 c overnight the oxidized mwcnts were denoted as mwcnts cooh 28 2 3 synthesis of n mmwcnts the mass ratio of mwcnts cooh to fe3o4 was fixed at 1 5 1 first predetermined amount of mwcnts cooh and fe3o4 were weighted and dispersed separately in 15 ml of deionized di water with the aid of ultrasonication for 30 min after sonication the ph for both dispersions were adjusted to ph 4 8 next fe3o4 nanoparticles were added into the mwcnts cooh dispersion the mixture was then ultrasonicated to allow well dispersion of mwcnts cooh and fe3o4 nanoparticles the mixture was then allowed to rotate overnight using mini rotator biosan rs 24 the resulted magnetic composite was denoted as n mmwcnts next n mmwcnts were collected by applying magnetic field to the dispersion for 30 min the mwcnts without magnetic property will remain in the dispersion the solution dispersion was removed and the n mmwcnts were rinsed with di water repeatedly the n mmwcnts were then filtered and dried in oven for 12 h at 100 c 2 4 synthesis of pdda mmwcnts fe3o4 nanoparticles in concentration of 100 ppm was prepared in di water and was ultrasonicated to break the existing aggregates similarly pdda solution with concentration of 0 1667 g ml was prepared and ultrasonicated for 60 min to assist with the dissolution of the pdda the pdda solution was kept overnight in water bath at 40 c prior to be used the ph of both the fe3o4 nanoparticles suspension and the pdda solution were adjusted to ph 7 8 before the former was added drop wise into the latter solution the physisorption of pdda on nanoparticles via electrostatic attraction was allowed to occur for 24 h in the mini rotator the pdda coated fe3o4 were then separated with a permanent magnet and rinsed with di water before the final dispersion in di water 29 lastly pdda mmwcnts were synthesized with the same experimental procedures as mentioned in section 2 3 2 5 characterization of mwcnts cooh and mmwcnts n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts the increase of oxygen content in mwcnts cooh after acid purification was analysed by perkin elmer chns o series ii elemental analyzer the functional groups of mmwcnts were confirmed by ft ir analysis using a perkinelmer frontier ftir spectrometer perkinelmer waltham usa over the frequency range of 4000 400 cm 1 a mixture of mmwcnts and potassium bromide was made into a thin pellet and the ir spectrum was observed after 32 scans the chemical structure of pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh fe3o4 nanoparticles and n mmwcnts were determined by xrd 6000 x ray diffractometer shimadzu japan with cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm at a scanning rate of 0 02 s 1 from 10 to 80 2θ the surface morphology of the mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts nanocomposites were also characterized using sem edx jeol jsm 6460la japan the samples were first dispersed in ethanol and ultrasonicated for 5 min the samples were dispersed on a clean surface with double sided tape on carbon disc and coated with platinum prior to sem edx analysis furthermore the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area and pore structure analysis of pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were characterized using micromeritics 3flex physisorption the sample were subjected for degassing process at 250 c prior to be immersed into the liquid n2 at 196 c for the adsorption and desorption process thermogravimetric analysis tga ta instrument sdt q600 were also carried out to study the thermal stability of both mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts the sample powder was placed inside the alumina crucibles and heated from room temperature to 1000 c at a ramping rate of 10 c min under air atmosphere in addition the zeta potentials of mwcnts cooh fe3o4 n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were measured with zetasizer nano zs900 malvern instruments prior to the measurement 1 mm of sodium chloride nacl solution was prepared the concentration of mwcnts cooh fe3o4 n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts in the 1 mm of nacl solution was fixed at 10 ppm subsequently the mixture was dispersed to form a homogeneous solution finally the measurement of the zeta potential of each sample was carried out in triplicate and the average values were obtained 2 6 investigation of the ph stability of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts pdda mmwcnts and n mmwcnts were each dispersed in 3 bottles 20 ml of di water separately then the ph of dispersion for both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were adjusted to 3 7 and 9 the dispersions were rotated overnight using the mini rotator after that the dispersions were subjected to external magnetic field for 30 min the detachments of mwcnts from n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts after subjecting to magnetic attraction were examined using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry uv vis with the wavelength of 500 nm 2 7 adsorption of mb using n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts 45 mg of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were dispersed in 20 ml of 100 ppm mb solution separately the ph of the mixtures was then adjusted to ph 7 and shaken 3 h for adsorption process upon completion both solutions were subjected to magnetic field attraction for 30 min to remove the magnetic adsorbent the concentration of mb after adsorption was determined by using uv vis in the wavelength of 668 nm the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency for both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were calculated by using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q c 0 c e v m where q is the adsorption capacity that indicated the amount adsorbed per gram of adsorbent mg g co is the initial

and isotherm study 2 8 adsorption of mb on n mmwcnts in different ph 15 ppm of mb in different ph ph 3 ph 5 ph 7 ph 9 and ph 11 were prepared 10 mg of n mmwcnts was dispersed in 15 ml of mb with the desired ph the solution mixture was shaken for 1 h in the shaker after adsorption the solution was subjected to magnetic field for 30 min to remove the magnetic adsorbent the concentration of mb after adsorption was determined by using uv vis in the wavelength at 668 nm the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency for n mmwcnts were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 2 9 kinetic study 15 mg of n mmwcnts was added into 20 ml of 10 ppm concentration mb solution in a 20 ml scintillation bottle under 30 c temperature at ph 7 then the adsorption processes were carried out in incubator shaker under different durations 20 min 40 min 60 min 80 min and 100 min at the end of each experiment the solution was subjected to magnetic field for 30 min to separate the adsorbent n mmwcnts from the solution then uv vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentration of mb in the1supernatant solution using the as mentioned method after that the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency of mb were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively pseudo first order model eq 3 and pseudo second order model eq 4 were linearized into eqs 5 and 6 respectively and were fitted using the experimental data through linear regression pseudo first order 3 q t q e 1 e k 1 t pseudo second order 4 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t linearized model 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q

and pseudo second order respectively two graphs ln qe qt vs t and 1 q t vs t were plotted and the r 2 values for both pseudo first order and pseudo second order models respectively were obtained and compared the kinetic model with the highest r 2 was selected to better represent the adsorption process 30 in addition sum square error sse as shown in eq 7 was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the non linear kinetic models eqs 3 and 4 between the experiment data q exp and calculated data q calc 7 sse q exp q calc 2 2 10 isotherm study to determine the isotherms of the mb adsorption on n mmwcnts the following experimental works were carried out 10 mg of n mmwcnts was added into 15 ml of pre determined concentration of mb solution 10 ppm 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm and 50 ppm in a 20 ml scintillation bottle under 30 c at ph 7 the adsorption process was carried out in the incubator shaker for 1 h in each concentration at the end of each experiment the solution was subjected to magnetic field for 30 min to separate the adsorbent n mmwcnts from the solution then uv vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentration of mb in supernatant solution at the wavelength of 668 nm after that the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of mb were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were shown in eqs 8 and 9 respectively langmuir isotherm model 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e freundlich isotherm model 9 q e k f c e 1 n where kl is the langmuir constant l mg ce is the equilibrium mb concentration mg l qe is the equilibrium

was selected to describe the adsorption process in this study 31 further validation of the langmuir isotherm can be achieved by using dimensionless separation factor r l as indicates in eq 12 12 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where r l 1 indicates unfavourable adsorption 0 r l 1 indicates favourable adsorption r l 0 indicates adsorption is irreversible and r l 1 indicates a linear adsorption on the other hand the favourability of freundlich isotherm can be determined by the freundlich adsorption intensity n in which 0 1 n 1 indicates favourable and 1 n 1 indicates poor adsorption 32 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre treatment and characterization of mwcnts prior to the synthesis of mmwcnts mwcnts were required to be pre treated with concentrated hno3 the aims to reflux mwcnts under concentrated hno3 were not only to remove impurities such as amorphous carbon contained in mwcnts but also to graft the cooh group onto the surface of mwcnts 25 34 the acid treated mwcnts were then characterized by chns o element analyzer the oxygen content in mwcnts and mwcnts cooh was shown in table 1 it could be seen that the amount of oxygen had increased from 6 07 pristine mwcnts to 10 36 for mwcnts cooh the increase in the amount of oxygen content proved the effectiveness of grafting cooh group onto the surface of mwcnts using hno3 the initial oxygen content in mwcnts might be due to the presence of moisture water or the trace of oh group in mwcnts the presence of cooh co oh groups would render the synthesized mwcnts cooh to be more hydrophilic and thus dispersed well in water furthermore the electrostatic repulsion force between coo and steric effect among the nanoparticle when dispersing in water allowed mwcnts cooh to form a stable suspension 35 the nanoparticle would tend to repel each other in the solution to obtain a more stable position this would subsequently reduce the aggregation agglomeration as well as sedimentation of mwcnts cooh in the solution 36 3 2 ftir analysis of the n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts the ftir spectra of fe3o4 n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were shown in fig 1 the band observed at 560 21 633 79 cm 1 indicated the stretching vibration of feofe 37 the absorption peaks shown in fig 1 b and c proved the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts 38 meanwhile n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts would exhibit the band of oh stretching mode from hydroxyl group as indicated by the wavelength at 3467 99 cm 1 moreover fe3o4 also showed the presence of hydroxyl group this was due to the interaction of fe3o4 with the moisture in the environment as fe3o4 was very reactive with water to form amphoteric nanoparticles 39 the peak at approximately 3400 cm 1 corresponded to the oh vibration in water group which contained the pdda molecules 40 this further supported the presence of pdda in the sample in addition due to the interaction of pdda molecules with water the peak intensity of oh stretching mode of hydroxyl group in pdda mmwcnts was found to be higher than n mmwcnts as shown in fig 1 b and c the band of around 1640 cm 1 represented the co stretching and the band around 1633 cm 1 corresponded to cc stretching it was reported that the band around 1626 cm 1 was due to oh bending of water molecules 41 therefore the peak detected in fe3o4 as shown in fig 1 a might be due to the interaction of fe3o4 with water molecules 3 3 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of the pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh fe3o4 nanoparticles and n mmwcnts were shown in fig 2 it could be clearly seen that all the three mwcnts samples fig 2 a b and d possessed the same diffraction peaks at approximately 2θ 26 0 that belonged to mwcnts 42 this indicated that the mwcnts structures of the mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts were not altered by the treatment of concentrated hno3 or the loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles the peak at 2θ 25 92 also corresponded to the index of 0 0 2 indicating the hexagonal graphite structure of mwcnts on top of that the n mmwcnts fig 2 d were observed to contain six characteristic peaks 2θ 30 22 35 62 43 34 53 8 57 3 and 62 74 which were similar to the xrd patterns of fe3o4 nanoparticles fig 2 c these six characteristic peaks indicated that the fe3o4 in the n mmwcnts was in a cubic crystalline structure 43 and in the form of magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe3o4 44 this also proved that the n mmwcnts were synthesized successfully by direct doping method according to song et al these six peaks 30 22 35 62 43 34 53 8 57 3 and 62 74 corresponded to the crystal planes of 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 respectively indicating that the fe3o4 nanoparticles exhibited inverse spinel structure 45 3 4 sem edx analysis the grafting of fe3o4 nanoparticle onto pristine mwcnts was further supported by the sem edx analysis fig 3 a and b displays the surface morphology of mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts respectively the sem observation revealed the long open ended tubular shape network of mwcnts cooh fig 3 a indicating that the acid purification process did not alter the structure of mwcnts meanwhile fe3o4 with rough spherical structures were found as a cluster and dispersed on the networks of n mmwcnts as highlighted in fig 3 b table 2 shows the elemental compositions for both mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts obtained under edx analysis edx analysis indicated the absence of fe element in mwcnts cooh and the presence of 20 97 of fe element in n mmwcnts furthermore the oxygen content also increased from 7 81 in mwcnts cooh to 17 70 in n mmwcnts this indicated that fe3o4 had been successfully doped onto the mwcnts cooh the presence of other trace elements such as al zn and cu might be due to the impurities contained in mwcnts and fe3o4 3 5 bet analysis the pore structures of pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were presented in table 3 as could be seen from the table the pristine mwcnts belonged to type iv isotherm which consisted of both micropores diameter 2 nm and mesopores 2 50 nm structures the mwcnts samples with the highest total bet surface area in ascending order were pdda mmwcnts pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts after acid treatment the total bet surface area of mwcnts cooh had increased to 157 94 m2 g as compared to pristine mwcnts 123 78 m2 g the increasing bet surface area of mwcnts cooh was caused by the removal of metal impurities 46 and the repulsion force of the carboxylic groups cooh grafted onto the surface of mwcnts after acid treatment causing the de bundling of mwcnts the total bet surface area of n mmwcnts nanocomposites further increased significantly to 168 88 m2 g 36 4 increment as compared to pristine mwcnts due to the existence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the nanocomposites 47 additionally the mwcnts cooh possessed larger pore volume and average pore diameter than the pristine mwcnts as the acid and ultrasonication treatment opened the tube ends and created the sidewall defects on the surface of mwcnts 48 however the pore volume and average pore diameter of n mmwcnts were slightly lower than mwcnts cooh due to the attachment of fe3o4 nanoparticles onto the mwcnts thus covering the pores of mwcnts based on arias et al the molecular size of mb was 1 7 0 76 0 33 nm this indicated that the average pore diameter 29 66 nm of n mmwcnts obtained in this study was sufficient for the adsorption of mb 49 it was interesting to note that the pdda mmwcnts possessed the lowest bet surface area and total pore volume among all the mwcnts samples this might be due to the large particle size of pdda coated fe3o4 that blocked the pores of mwcnts and reduced the micropore and mesopore volumes the bet specific surface area of n mmwcnts synthesized through wet chemical and direct doping method in this work were compared and summarized in table 4 the results showed that the bet specific surface area of n mmwcnts synthesized by direct doping method were much higher as compared to those synthesized by wet chemical method indicating that the solvent free direct doping method was highly feasible in the synthesis of n mmwcnts 3 6 tga analysis the tga curves for mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts are shown in fig 4 it could be observed that both mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts were stable up to 400 c with negligible weight loss the slight weight loss of both mwcnts samples in the temperature range of 400 c 600 c was due to the removal of carboxyl groups crafted on the surface of mwcnts during hno3 pre treatment 50 both the mwcnts sample underwent thermal decomposition oxidation of mwcnts after 600 c in which a sharp weight loss was observed 51 as shown in fig 4 b the highest weight loss of mwcnts cooh was observed at temperature around 820 c on the other hand the highest weight loss of n mmwcnts was extended to 850 c showing that the thermal stability of n mmwcnts was increased after doping of fe3o4 nanoparticles the final weight percent of n mmwcnts was found to be 27 98 which was higher than the mwcnts cooh recorded at 16 92 this was due to the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the n mmwcnts 3 7 zeta potential analysis ph was one of the important factors that affected the surface charge of nanoparticles via the adsorption of hydrogen h and hydroxyl ions oh on the nanoparticles surface this allowed the alteration of surface charge properties of fe3o4 in order to obtain opposing charges with mwcnts cooh for electrostatic interaction 52 the mmwcnts composite was produced by the electrostatic interaction between the positively charge fe3o4 nanoparticles and pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles with the negatively charge mwcnts cooh this was proven by the zeta potential analysis shown in figs 5 and 6 point of zero charge phpzc which is also known as zeta potential of the nanoparticle is the point of ph in which the surface charge of the nanoparticle equals to zero 53 in ph lower than point of zero charge phpzc the nanoparticle will be positively charged while in ph higher than phpzc the nanoparticle will be negatively charged 54 55 the phpzc for mwcnts cooh and fe3o4 were 3 7 and 5 9 as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively therefore the synthesis of n mmwcnts fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh under ph range of 4 8 average of ph 3 7 and 5 9 ensured mwcnts cooh to be negatively charged due to the dissociation of cooh group into coo while fe3o4 nanoparticles would be positively charge creating the electrostatic interaction and eventually formed strong binding between fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh after doping with fe3o4 particle zeta potential of n mmwcnts dropped significantly from almost 30 exhibited by mwcnts cooh to zero at ph around 2 the zeta potential of n mmwcnts reduced over a wide range of ph ph 2 to 10 the decrease in the phpzc of mwcnts cooh after doping with fe3o4 nanoparticle was due to the neutralization of the cooh groups on the surface of mwcnts by fe3o4 nanoparticles which resulting in the decrease in zeta potential of n mmwcnts composite on the other hand the phpzc of pdda mmwcnts was found at 5 6 the coating of fe3o4 particle with pdda was performed at ph 7 8 because fe3o4 nanoparticle was negatively charged as shown in fig 6 while pdda still remained as positively charged under that particular ph the positively charged polyelectrolyte of pdda was then attracted and neutralized the negative hydroxyl groups in fe3o4 nanoparticle surface and the resultant pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticle would be positively charged over a wide range of ph 40 56 the highly positively charged pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles allowed the combination with negatively charged mwcnts cooh through electrostatic interaction as indicates in fig 5 the phpzc of mwcnts cooh had been shifted to higher ph from ph 3 7 to 5 6 after doping with pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles this was due to the abundance of positively charge pdda which maintain the composite pdda mmwcnts as positively charged over a wide ph range therefore it could be concluded that n mmwcnts were more suitable for the adsorption of positively charged dye solute such as mb whereas pdda mmwcnts were more flexible to be applied to the removal of negatively charged dye solute without ph tuning or positively charged solute with ph tuning 3 8 ph stability of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts pdda mmwcnts and n mmwcnts were dispersed in different ph to determine the stability of the attraction force between mwcnts cooh with fe3o4 and pdda fe3o4 it was reported that the large amount of van der waals interactions prohibited the pristine or non functionalized mwcnts to be uniformly dispersed in water or organic solvent 57 however it could be observed in fig 7 a and b that both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts dispersed well in ph ranged from 3 to 9 this was due to the presence of the hydrophilic groups resulted from the acid functionalized mwcnts and also the repulsive and steric effect between the colloids 58 after dispersing in different ph solutions for 24 h the solutions were subjected to magnetic field to collect the magnetic materials fig 8 a and b shows the immediate response of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts when subjected to the magnetic field it could be observed that under the attraction of magnetic field clearer solution was obtained for n mmwcnts that were dispersed in ph 3 and 7 as compared to ph 9 this implied that n mmwcnts showed faster response towards the magnetic field in ph range from 3 to 7 however opposite result was observed for ph 9 in which n mmwcnts showed slower response towards magnetic field this may conclude that the n mmwcnts formed a more stable and well dispersed colloid in ph 9 solution this claim was further supported by the highest negative zeta potential of n mmwcnts at ph 9 as shown in fig 3 which generated high repulsive effect among the composite particles with the oh and no3 ions on the other hand it could be observed in fig 8 b that pdda mmwcnts showed good response to the magnetic field in solution with ph of 7 and 9 however for ph 3 pdda mmwcnts showed slow response to the magnetic attraction this indicated that pdda mmwcnts formed a more stable colloid in ph 3 this could be explained that at low ph the presence of cations in the polyelectrolyte such as h and na could interact with the highly positively charged pdda mmwcnts 40 59 the repulsion effect between the cations that present in the solution h and na and the highly positively charged pdda mmwcnts would produce a more stable dispersion of pdda mmwcnts in low ph solution after 30 min of magnetic attraction both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were able to be retrieved completely by the magnet as shown in fig 9 the supernatant of the dispersions of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were tested with uv vis to examine the detachment of fe3o4 from mmwcnts by measuring the concentrations of mwcnts cooh present in the solution fig 10 indicates the detachment of fe3o4 from n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts at different ph from fig 10 the concentrations of mwcnts cooh in the supernatant solution of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts at ph 3 were 1 96 ppm and 5 78 ppm respectively this implied that the detachment of fe3o4 was observed for both mmwcnts although pdda mmwncts suffered a higher degree of detachment higher concentration of mwcnts cooh in the supernatant could be explained through the surface charge of both nanoparticles pdda fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh as shown in the zeta potential analysis fig 5 both mwcnts cooh and pdda fe3o4 were positively charged at low ph therefore the highly positively charged pdda fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh will have the tendency to repel and detach from each other consequently the electrostatic attraction would be reduced 60 the presence of other cations may also contribute to the repulsion effect 61 however n mmwcnts showed lower detachment of fe3o4 due to smaller repulsive force between mwcnts cooh and fe3o4 both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts exhibited relatively small degree of detachment of fe3o4 in neutral ph of 7 on the other hand contrasting result was observed at high ph ph 9 where the detachment of fe3o4 was higher for n mmwcnts as compared to pdda mmwcnts the concentration of mwcnts cooh present in the supernatant solution was 4 72 ppm and 2 02 ppm for n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts respectively this was due to the same reason where fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh were negatively charged at ph 9 as shown in zeta potential analysis in figs 5 and 6 which resulted in the repulsion force between fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh thus the electrostatic attraction became weaker 3 9 feasibility of mb adsorption by n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were subjected to the adsorption of mb and the adsorption capacities of both mmwcnts were compared fig 11 displays the adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts results indicated that both magnetic adsorbents were capable to remove mb from the solution which the removal efficiencies of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts on mb were 36 57 and 32 95 respectively apart from that as shown in fig 11 the adsorption capacities of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were 12 19 mg g and 10 98 mg g respectively the adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts was higher than pdda mmwcnts because of the highly positively charged pdda which may repel the cationic mb from adsorbing onto the mwcnts cooh surface this was further supported by the zeta potential analysis as shown in fig 5 in which the pdda mmwcnts exhibited positive zeta potential over a wider range of ph as compared to n mmwcnts furthermore it could be observed from fig 5 that the zeta potential value of n mmwcnts was more negative than pdda mmwcnts at ph 7 the ph during adsorption process indicating its suitability to be used in the removal of positively charged mb furthermore pdda mmwcnts possessed much lower bet surface area than n mmwcnts as shown in table 3 this further supported the observation that pdda mmwcnts achieved lower mb adsorption than n mmwcnts due to the limited active sides for adsorption to take place owing to the favourable characteristics of higher adsorption capacity negative zeta potential in wide range of ph ph 2 to 10 and low detachment of mwcnts cooh n mmwcnts was subjected for further studies which included the effect of ph on the adsorption of mb adsorption isotherm and kinetic study 3 10 effect of ph towards the adsorption of mb on n mmwcnts the ph of a solution played a crucial role in the adsorption of dyes such as mb 62 as shown in fig 12 when ph of the solution was increased from 3 to 11 the adsorption capacity increased significantly from 11 69 mg g to 21 96 mg g the removal efficiency of mb also exhibited a corresponding increment from 41 49 to 89 77 when the ph of solution was increased from 3 to 11 as shown in fig 13 as proven by the zeta potential analysis fig 5 the phpzc of n mmwcnts was around ph 2 therefore n mmwcnts remained as negative charge in the ph range of 3 to 11 47 the negatively charged n mmwcnts would attract the cationic mb ions through electrostatic interaction when ph was increased the surface charge of n mmwcnts became more negative due to higher deprotonation of oh groups on fe3o4 and coo groups on mwcnts allowing stronger electrostatic attraction to the cationic ions of mb this implied that the removal of mb by n mmwcnts was strongly ph dependent 23 44 and alkaline condition favoured the adsorption of mb results in this study had revealed the potential of n mmwcnts as an excellent material for the removal of cationic pollutants such as heavy metal pb ii cu ii fe ii co ii etc from electrical and electronic industries as well as cationic dyes crystal violet thionine janus green neutral red etc from textiles painting industries 9 14 23 47 63 3 11 adsorption isotherm since n mmwcnts possessed higher adsorption capacity exhibited negative zeta potential in wide range of ph ph 2 to 10 and low detachment of mwcnts cooh they were subjected to further adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies it was stated that the adsorptive capacity was the most important indicator in the evaluation of an effective adsorbent 64 adsorption isotherm models were used to calculate the theoretical adsorptive capacity and also to describe the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates 65 66 therefore the isotherm could provide a relationship between the amount of dye adsorbed on the solid phase and the concentration of dye in the solution when both phases had achieved equilibrium two isotherm equations langmuir and freundlich isotherms were fitted with the experimental data obtained and analysed in detailed langmuir isotherm stated that the adsorption site of adsorbent was homogeneous and the adsorption was monolayer in which most of the adsorption sites possessed equal affinities towards the adsorbates 31 meanwhile the freundlich isotherm model was fitted for heterogeneous chemisorption process in which the surface was not energetically uniform and the adsorption was multilayer 25 fig 14 a and b shows the graph of langmuir and freundlich models for the adsorption using n mmwcnts based on fig 14 a and b the langmuir and freundlich isotherms showed different patterns the parameters for langmuir and freundlich isotherm of mb on n mmwcnts are displayed in table 5 the r 2 values for both isotherms were obtained from linear regression the regression coefficient r 2 values of langmuir and freundlich models were 0 999 and 0 981 respectively indicating that the langmuir model was more accurate in describing the adsorption equilibrium of mb onto n mmwcnts in this study this was further supported by the r l value 0 0138 which fulfilled the condition of 0 r l 1 indicating a favourable type of adsorption isotherm this was in agreement with similar studies reported in the literature whereby the langmuir isotherm was the commonly reported isotherm describing the mb adsorption on adsorbents 67 in comparing their findings with this result it was understood that the mb adsorption on n mmwcnts was homogeneous and only monolayer adsorption was formed further increase in concentration of mb did not increase the adsorption since the active sites were all fully occupied 47 although the 1 n value of freundlich isotherm 0 0639 was also found to fall under the favourable range 0 1 n 1 langmuir isotherm was still the most precise isotherm to describe the adsorption process of mb by n mmwcnts based on higher r 2 value 3 12 adsorption kinetic kinetic models could be used to describe the detailed adsorption mechanisms and is critical to determine the adsorption efficiency other than that the adsorption kinetic also controls the time needed to reach the equilibrium two well studied adsorption kinetic models were applied in this study i e pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations pseudo first order model was a physical adsorption and based on the assumption that the rate of change in solute adsorption over time was directly proportional to the difference in the amount of adsorptive solid uptake and saturation concentration over time 65 on the other hand pseudo second order model was used to express chemisorption involving valency forces through the exchange or sharing of electrons between the adsorbate and adsorbent as ion exchange and covalent bond respectively 68 fig 15 a and b displays the graph of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models of adsorption of mb using n mmwcnts according to fig 15 a and b both pseudo first order and pseudo second order models showed different patterns the isotherms based on the experimental data and r 2 values for both kinetic models were obtained from the linear regression and the parameters are tabulated in table 6 the regression coefficient r 2 values of pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model were 0 9848 and 1 respectively indicating that the pseudo second order model was a better fit as compared with pseudo first order model in describing the mb adsorption kinetics on the n mmwcnts this was further supported by the sse values in table 6 in which the sse value of pseudo second order kinetic model sse 0 00362 was much lower than pseudo first order kinetic model sse 0 0419 the result obtained in this study was in line with the reported literatures in which the pseudo second order model was the commonly reported kinetic model for mb adsorption on mmwcnts as such it could be deduced that the mb adsorption on mmwcnts was a multi step process involving the adsorption on the external surface and diffusion into the interior the pores within mwcnts in this case 69 it could also be concluded that the mb adsorption rate on mmwcnts was regulated by the surface adsorption that involved chemisorption between adsorbate and adsorbent such understanding was further strengthened by the fact that the abundantly available electrons on mmwcnts could promote this chemical interaction between the mmwcnts with the mb through covalent bond and also electrostatic forces in addition it was reported that the mb molecules could interact with mmwcnts through the π π interactions between the aromatic backbone of mb and hexagonal skeleton of mwcnts and the electrostatic attractions with the functionalized carboxylate groups 27 furthermore the adsorption of mb could also be due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between mb molecules and mmwcnts 25 as such the interaction between the mmwcnts with the mb had been successfully elucidated 3 13 comparison study table 7 shows the comparison of different adsorbents on the maximum adsorption capacity towards mb it was noticeable that the maximum mb adsorption capacity of the n mmwcnts synthesized in this study was comparable to adsorbents such as naoh treated pure kaolin diatomite treated with biochar from oil palm shell ops sodium hydroxide and magnetic graphene nanosheet on the other hand the maximum mb adsorption capacity of the n mmwcnts was significantly higher than raw fly ash spent rice biomass zeolite and even activated carbon of rice husk thus the information presented in table 7 indicated that the n mmwcnts not only could be synthesized using a simpler faster and greener method but also possessed satisfactory maximum adsorption capacity for mb 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated the feasibility to synthesis mmwcnts via solvent free direct doping method comparing to other conventional synthesis methods the direct doping method is facile more cost effective and environmentally friendly furthermore mmwcnts realized the concept of magnetic separation due to their ability to be recycled under magnetic field after the adsorption process this study also concluded that both magnetic mwcnts possessed different stabilities in different ph conditions n mmwcnts were stable in ph 3 whereas pdda mmwcnts were stable in ph 9 however in the adsorption of cationic dyes such as mb the adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts was higher than pdda mmwcnts at ph 7 100 ppm of mb concentration 3 h contact time and 45 mg of adsorbent the low adsorption capacity of pdda mmwcnts towards mb was due to the strong repulsive force generated by the positively charged pdda molecules in short n mmwcnts possessed higher adsorption mb capacity as compared to pdda mmwcnts the adsorption of mb on n mmwcnts at ph 7 was found to fit almost perfectly using langmuir isotherm with r 2 value of 0 999 as such it could be concluded that the mb adsorbed onto the mmwcnts was homogeneous through monolayer adsorption where further increase in concentration of mb would not increase the adsorption after the active sites had been fully occupied the maximum adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts 20 37 mg mb g n mmwcnts was comparable to the conventional industrial used adsorbents revealing the potential of n mmwcnts to be excellent adsorbents for cationic pollutants in addition the kinetic study on the mb adsorption on n mmwcnts at ph 7 was found to obey the pseudo second order with r 2 value of 1 and lower sse value as a conclusion the application of the synthesized mmwcnts as adsorbent could represent a breakthrough technology for water remediation which warrants further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

13188,background owing to the requirement of additional processing steps to separate the spent adsorbents from treated water magnetic multi walled carbon nanotubes mmwcnts have recently been hailed as novel adsorbent methods in this study mwcnts doped with iron oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles n mmwcnts and mwcnts doped with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles pdda mmwcnts were synthesized via solvent free direct doping method prior to the doping process the pristine mwcnts were pre treated with nitric acid significant findings characterization results such as ftir edx xrd and zeta potential analysis confirmed the deposition of fe3o4 onto the mwcnts the stability of the synthesized mmwcnts under different ph was examined detachments of fe3o4 from n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts was found at ph 9 and 3 respectively both types of mmwcnts were applied to the removal of methylene blue mb it was found that the mb adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts was 11 higher than pdda mmwcnts due to significantly higher specific surface area of n mmwcnts n mmwcnts was found to perform better in alkaline condition in which the adsorption capacity increased about 87 from ph 3 to ph 11 the adsorption of mb on n mmwcnts was found to obey the langmuir isotherm indicating monolayer mb molecules adsorption on the n mmwcnts with the calculated maximum adsorption capacity of 20 37 mg g moreover the adsorption of mb followed the pseudo second order kinetic model graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords magnetic multi walled carbon nanotubes direct doping magnetic separation kinetic and isotherm adsorption study water remediation 1 introduction the alarming water pollution issue has been constantly posing a major threat to the human being such matter could be primarily sourced from the presence of heavy metals and dyes in water bodies 1 2 dye contaminated wastewater due to textile production dyeing and printing related industries will not only affect human health but also reduce the light penetration to the aquatic plants for photosynthesis 3 dyes are commonly removed from the polluted water via adsorption process the common adsorbents used in dyes removal include zeolite silica gel and activated carbon ac 4 however these conventional adsorbents exhibit limitations such as low adsorption capacity and efficiency 5 with relatively large surface area hollow structure and mesoporosity multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts have emerged to be potential candidate that can overcome the limitations encountered by the conventional adsorbents 6 mwcnts were capable to remove impurities and contaminants such as heavy metal dyes organic and inorganic materials from water resources efficiently 7 9 mpouras et al had demonstrated the feasibility of mwcnts in removing chromium contaminant from the ground water 10 in addition chinh et al also reported the improvement of photodegradation of methylene blue mb from the synergic effect of mwcnts coupling with tio2 11 therefore it was proven that the presence of carbon nanomaterial contributed to the improvement of adsorption properties of the composite 12 even though mwcnts were considered as the excellent adsorbent adsorption process using conventional adsorbents including mwcnts still required additional processing steps to remove the spent adsorbents from treated water 13 14 membrane separation and centrifugation were normally applied to remove the adsorbent from the aqueous solution before discharging this had increased the overall energy consumption complexity and operation cost of the adsorption process 15 16 this problem can be solved by using the magnetic mwcnts mmwcnts as adsorbent during the adsorption process due to the magnetic property of iron oxide fe3o4 encapsulating and doping of ferromagnetic structure inside mwcnts enabled the formation of mmwcnts by applying the external magnetic field mmwcnts can be separated easily and efficiently from the adsorption medium 17 fe3o4 nanoparticle is one of the metal oxide nanoparticles with attractive properties such as nano sized high surface area to volume ratio and magnetic responsive therefore its function and application in immobilization technology photocatalytic technology and adsorptive technology had been widely studied 18 it was also reported that the iron base nanoparticle performed greatly in treating both organic and inorganic contaminants 19 20 mmwcnts can be synthesized through various methods such as co precipitation solvothermal method chemical deposition 21 thermal decomposition 22 and wet chemical treatment 23 24 duman et al synthesized magnetic oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes κ carrageenan fe3o4 using dimenthylformamide pyridine and thionyl chloride this process required more than three days to achieve completion and the use of thionyl chloride led to unpleasant odour during the synthesis process 25 apart from that it was reported that the mmwcnts synthesized using co precipitation method with iron precursors of nh4fe so4 2 12h2o and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o required conditional control under inert environment and constantly maintaining the ph of the solution throughout the synthesis process 26 alvarez torrellas et al had also synthesized the magnetic adsorbent through co precipitation and encapsulated with alginate to improve the dispersion 27 the major drawbacks of these methods were high production cost owing to the high usage of chemical solvents and the processes are complicated and time consuming thus the novelty and main objective of this work is to synthesize efficient mmwcnts via solvent free direct doping method this facile method could help to overcome the limitations encountered by the conventional synthesis methods to the best of knowledge no studies have been performed to investigate the feasibility of this direct doping method in the synthesis of mmwcnts two types of mmwcnts were prepared using direct doping method mwcnts doped with uncoated fe3o4 nanoparticles denoted as n mmwcnts and mwcnts doped with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles denoted as pdda mmwcnts the stability of both types of mmwcnts in different ph was examined this was followed by the performance test of both mmwcnts in the adsorption of mb in addition the kinetic model and isotherm for the adsorption of mb was also determined to establish its fundamental adsorption mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials mwcnts diameters and lengths ranging from 40 to 60 nm and 1 to 2 μm respectively were purchased from shenzhen nanotechnologies port co fe3o4 nanoparticles purity 98 with diameter ranging from 20 to 30 nm were purchased from nanoamor houston texas usa nitric acid hno3 with purity of 69 70 purchased from jt baker was used to purify the pristine mwcnts mb with purity of 98 5 was purchased from hmbg chemical poly diallydimethylammonium chloride pdda average molecular weight of 100 000 200 000 20 wt in h2o was purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 purification of mwcnts 1 g of pristine mwcnts was weighted and dispersed in 100 ml of concentrated hno3 under ultrasonication for 30 min after ultrasonication the mixture was refluxed at temperature of 80 c for 8 h under continuous stirring upon completion the treated mwcnts were filtered washed with excess distilled water until neutral and dried in oven at 100 c overnight the oxidized mwcnts were denoted as mwcnts cooh 28 2 3 synthesis of n mmwcnts the mass ratio of mwcnts cooh to fe3o4 was fixed at 1 5 1 first predetermined amount of mwcnts cooh and fe3o4 were weighted and dispersed separately in 15 ml of deionized di water with the aid of ultrasonication for 30 min after sonication the ph for both dispersions were adjusted to ph 4 8 next fe3o4 nanoparticles were added into the mwcnts cooh dispersion the mixture was then ultrasonicated to allow well dispersion of mwcnts cooh and fe3o4 nanoparticles the mixture was then allowed to rotate overnight using mini rotator biosan rs 24 the resulted magnetic composite was denoted as n mmwcnts next n mmwcnts were collected by applying magnetic field to the dispersion for 30 min the mwcnts without magnetic property will remain in the dispersion the solution dispersion was removed and the n mmwcnts were rinsed with di water repeatedly the n mmwcnts were then filtered and dried in oven for 12 h at 100 c 2 4 synthesis of pdda mmwcnts fe3o4 nanoparticles in concentration of 100 ppm was prepared in di water and was ultrasonicated to break the existing aggregates similarly pdda solution with concentration of 0 1667 g ml was prepared and ultrasonicated for 60 min to assist with the dissolution of the pdda the pdda solution was kept overnight in water bath at 40 c prior to be used the ph of both the fe3o4 nanoparticles suspension and the pdda solution were adjusted to ph 7 8 before the former was added drop wise into the latter solution the physisorption of pdda on nanoparticles via electrostatic attraction was allowed to occur for 24 h in the mini rotator the pdda coated fe3o4 were then separated with a permanent magnet and rinsed with di water before the final dispersion in di water 29 lastly pdda mmwcnts were synthesized with the same experimental procedures as mentioned in section 2 3 2 5 characterization of mwcnts cooh and mmwcnts n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts the increase of oxygen content in mwcnts cooh after acid purification was analysed by perkin elmer chns o series ii elemental analyzer the functional groups of mmwcnts were confirmed by ft ir analysis using a perkinelmer frontier ftir spectrometer perkinelmer waltham usa over the frequency range of 4000 400 cm 1 a mixture of mmwcnts and potassium bromide was made into a thin pellet and the ir spectrum was observed after 32 scans the chemical structure of pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh fe3o4 nanoparticles and n mmwcnts were determined by xrd 6000 x ray diffractometer shimadzu japan with cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm at a scanning rate of 0 02 s 1 from 10 to 80 2θ the surface morphology of the mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts nanocomposites were also characterized using sem edx jeol jsm 6460la japan the samples were first dispersed in ethanol and ultrasonicated for 5 min the samples were dispersed on a clean surface with double sided tape on carbon disc and coated with platinum prior to sem edx analysis furthermore the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area and pore structure analysis of pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were characterized using micromeritics 3flex physisorption the sample were subjected for degassing process at 250 c prior to be immersed into the liquid n2 at 196 c for the adsorption and desorption process thermogravimetric analysis tga ta instrument sdt q600 were also carried out to study the thermal stability of both mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts the sample powder was placed inside the alumina crucibles and heated from room temperature to 1000 c at a ramping rate of 10 c min under air atmosphere in addition the zeta potentials of mwcnts cooh fe3o4 n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were measured with zetasizer nano zs900 malvern instruments prior to the measurement 1 mm of sodium chloride nacl solution was prepared the concentration of mwcnts cooh fe3o4 n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts in the 1 mm of nacl solution was fixed at 10 ppm subsequently the mixture was dispersed to form a homogeneous solution finally the measurement of the zeta potential of each sample was carried out in triplicate and the average values were obtained 2 6 investigation of the ph stability of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts pdda mmwcnts and n mmwcnts were each dispersed in 3 bottles 20 ml of di water separately then the ph of dispersion for both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were adjusted to 3 7 and 9 the dispersions were rotated overnight using the mini rotator after that the dispersions were subjected to external magnetic field for 30 min the detachments of mwcnts from n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts after subjecting to magnetic attraction were examined using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry uv vis with the wavelength of 500 nm 2 7 adsorption of mb using n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts 45 mg of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were dispersed in 20 ml of 100 ppm mb solution separately the ph of the mixtures was then adjusted to ph 7 and shaken 3 h for adsorption process upon completion both solutions were subjected to magnetic field attraction for 30 min to remove the magnetic adsorbent the concentration of mb after adsorption was determined by using uv vis in the wavelength of 668 nm the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency for both n mmwcnts and pdda

desired ph the solution mixture was shaken for 1 h in the shaker after adsorption the solution was subjected to magnetic field for 30 min to remove the magnetic adsorbent the concentration of mb after adsorption was determined by using uv vis in the wavelength at 668 nm the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency for n mmwcnts were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 2 9 kinetic study 15 mg of n mmwcnts was added into 20 ml of 10 ppm concentration mb solution in a 20 ml scintillation bottle under 30 c temperature at ph 7 then the adsorption processes were carried out in incubator shaker under different durations 20 min 40 min 60 min 80 min and 100 min at the end of each experiment the solution was subjected to magnetic field for 30 min to separate the adsorbent n mmwcnts from the solution then uv vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentration of mb in the1supernatant solution using the as mentioned method after that the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency of mb were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively pseudo first order model eq 3 and pseudo second order model eq 4 were linearized into eqs 5 and 6 respectively and were fitted using the

f 1 n ln c e two graphs c e q e vs c e and lnqe vs ln ce were plotted and the r 2 values for both langmuir and freundlich isotherms were obtained and compared the isotherm model with the highest r2 was selected to describe the adsorption process in this study 31 further validation of the langmuir isotherm can be achieved by using dimensionless separation factor r l as indicates in eq 12 12 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where r l 1 indicates unfavourable adsorption 0 r l 1 indicates favourable adsorption r l 0 indicates adsorption is irreversible and r l 1 indicates a linear adsorption on the other hand the favourability of freundlich isotherm can be determined by the freundlich adsorption intensity n in which 0 1 n 1 indicates favourable and 1 n 1 indicates poor adsorption 32 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre treatment and characterization of mwcnts prior to the synthesis of mmwcnts mwcnts were required to be pre treated with concentrated hno3 the aims to reflux mwcnts under concentrated hno3 were not only to remove impurities such as amorphous carbon contained in mwcnts but also to graft the cooh group onto the surface of mwcnts 25 34 the acid treated mwcnts were then characterized by chns o element analyzer the oxygen content in mwcnts and mwcnts cooh was shown in table 1 it could be seen that the amount of oxygen had increased from 6 07 pristine mwcnts to 10 36 for mwcnts cooh the increase in the amount of oxygen content proved the effectiveness of grafting cooh group onto the surface of mwcnts using hno3 the initial oxygen content in mwcnts might be due to the presence of moisture water or the trace of oh group in mwcnts the presence of cooh co oh groups would render the synthesized mwcnts cooh to be more hydrophilic and thus dispersed well in water furthermore the electrostatic repulsion force between coo and steric effect among the nanoparticle when dispersing in water allowed mwcnts cooh to form a stable suspension 35 the nanoparticle would tend to repel each other in the solution to obtain a more stable position this would subsequently reduce the aggregation agglomeration as well as sedimentation of mwcnts cooh in the solution 36 3 2 ftir analysis of the n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts the ftir spectra of fe3o4 n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were shown in fig 1 the band observed at 560 21 633 79 cm 1 indicated the stretching vibration of feofe 37 the absorption peaks shown in fig 1 b and c proved the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts 38 meanwhile n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts would exhibit the band of oh stretching mode from hydroxyl group as indicated by the wavelength at 3467 99 cm 1 moreover fe3o4 also showed the presence of hydroxyl group this was due to the interaction of fe3o4 with the moisture in the environment as fe3o4 was very reactive with water to form amphoteric nanoparticles 39 the peak at approximately 3400 cm 1 corresponded to the oh vibration in water group which contained the pdda molecules 40 this further supported the presence of pdda in the sample in addition due to the interaction of pdda molecules with water the peak intensity of oh stretching mode of hydroxyl group in pdda mmwcnts was found to be higher than n mmwcnts as shown in fig 1 b and c the band of around 1640 cm 1 represented the co stretching and the band around 1633 cm 1 corresponded to cc stretching it was reported that the band around 1626 cm 1 was due to oh bending of water molecules 41 therefore the peak detected in fe3o4 as shown in fig 1 a might be due to the interaction of fe3o4 with water molecules 3 3 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of the pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh fe3o4 nanoparticles and n mmwcnts were shown in fig 2 it could be clearly seen that all the three mwcnts samples fig 2 a b and d possessed the same diffraction peaks at approximately 2θ 26 0 that belonged to mwcnts 42 this indicated that the mwcnts structures of the mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts were not altered by the treatment of concentrated hno3 or the loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles the peak at 2θ 25 92 also corresponded to the index of 0 0 2 indicating the hexagonal graphite structure of mwcnts on top of that the n mmwcnts fig 2 d were observed to contain six characteristic peaks 2θ 30 22 35 62 43 34 53 8 57 3 and 62 74 which were similar to the xrd patterns of fe3o4 nanoparticles fig 2 c these six characteristic peaks indicated that the fe3o4 in the n mmwcnts was in a cubic crystalline structure 43 and in the form of magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe3o4 44 this also proved that the n mmwcnts were synthesized successfully by direct doping method according to song et al these six peaks 30 22 35 62 43 34 53 8 57 3 and 62 74 corresponded to the crystal planes of 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 respectively indicating that the fe3o4 nanoparticles exhibited inverse spinel structure 45 3 4 sem edx analysis the grafting of fe3o4 nanoparticle onto pristine mwcnts was further supported by the sem edx analysis fig 3 a and b displays the surface morphology of mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts respectively the sem observation revealed the long open ended tubular shape network of mwcnts cooh fig 3 a indicating that the acid purification process did not alter the structure of mwcnts meanwhile fe3o4 with rough spherical structures were found as a cluster and dispersed on the networks of n mmwcnts as highlighted in fig 3 b table 2 shows the elemental compositions for both mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts obtained under edx analysis edx analysis indicated the absence of fe element in mwcnts cooh and the presence of 20 97 of fe element in n mmwcnts furthermore the oxygen content also increased from 7 81 in mwcnts cooh to 17 70 in n mmwcnts this indicated that fe3o4 had been successfully doped onto the mwcnts cooh the presence of other trace elements such as al zn and cu might be due to the impurities contained in mwcnts and fe3o4 3 5 bet analysis the pore structures of pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were presented in table 3 as could be seen from the table the pristine mwcnts belonged to type iv isotherm which consisted of both micropores diameter 2 nm and mesopores 2 50 nm structures the mwcnts samples with the highest total bet surface area in ascending order were pdda mmwcnts pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts after acid treatment the total bet surface area of mwcnts cooh had increased to 157 94 m2 g as compared to pristine mwcnts 123 78 m2 g the increasing bet surface area of mwcnts cooh was caused by the removal of metal impurities 46 and the repulsion force of the carboxylic groups cooh grafted onto the surface of mwcnts after acid treatment causing the de bundling of mwcnts the total bet surface area of n mmwcnts nanocomposites further increased significantly to 168 88 m2 g 36 4 increment as compared to pristine mwcnts due to the existence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the nanocomposites 47 additionally the mwcnts cooh possessed larger pore volume and average pore diameter than the pristine mwcnts as the acid and ultrasonication treatment opened the tube ends and created the sidewall defects on the surface of mwcnts 48 however the pore volume and average pore diameter of n mmwcnts were slightly lower than mwcnts cooh due to the attachment of fe3o4 nanoparticles onto the mwcnts thus covering the pores of mwcnts based on arias et al the molecular size of mb was 1 7 0 76 0 33 nm this indicated that the average pore diameter 29 66 nm of n mmwcnts obtained in this study was sufficient for the adsorption of mb 49 it was interesting to note that the pdda mmwcnts possessed the lowest bet surface area and total pore volume among all the mwcnts samples this might be due to the large particle size of pdda coated fe3o4 that blocked the pores of mwcnts and reduced the micropore and mesopore volumes the bet specific surface area of n mmwcnts synthesized through wet chemical and direct doping method in this work were compared and summarized in table 4 the results showed that the bet specific surface area of n mmwcnts synthesized by direct doping method were much higher as compared to those synthesized by wet chemical method indicating that the solvent free direct doping method was highly feasible in the synthesis of n mmwcnts 3 6 tga analysis the tga curves for mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts are shown in fig 4 it could be observed that both mwcnts cooh and n mmwcnts were stable up to 400 c with negligible weight loss the slight weight loss of both mwcnts samples in the temperature range of 400 c 600 c was due to the removal of carboxyl groups crafted on the surface of mwcnts during hno3 pre treatment 50 both the mwcnts sample underwent thermal decomposition oxidation of mwcnts after 600 c in which a sharp weight loss was observed 51 as shown in fig 4 b the highest weight loss of mwcnts cooh was observed at temperature around 820 c on the other hand the highest weight loss of n mmwcnts was extended to 850 c showing that the thermal stability of n mmwcnts was increased after doping of fe3o4 nanoparticles the final weight percent of n mmwcnts was found to be 27 98 which was higher than the mwcnts cooh recorded at 16 92 this was due to the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the n mmwcnts 3 7 zeta potential analysis ph was one of the important factors that affected the surface charge of nanoparticles via the adsorption of hydrogen h and hydroxyl ions oh on the nanoparticles surface this allowed the alteration of surface charge properties of fe3o4 in order to obtain opposing charges with mwcnts cooh for electrostatic interaction 52 the mmwcnts composite was produced by the electrostatic interaction between the positively charge fe3o4 nanoparticles and pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles with the negatively charge mwcnts cooh this was proven by the zeta potential analysis shown in figs 5 and 6 point of zero charge phpzc which is also known as zeta potential of the nanoparticle is the point of ph in which the surface charge of the nanoparticle equals to zero 53 in ph lower than point of zero charge phpzc the nanoparticle will be positively charged while in ph higher than phpzc the nanoparticle will be negatively charged 54 55 the phpzc for mwcnts cooh and fe3o4 were 3 7 and 5 9 as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively therefore the synthesis of n mmwcnts fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh under ph range of 4 8 average of ph 3 7 and 5 9 ensured mwcnts cooh to be negatively charged due to the dissociation of cooh group into coo while fe3o4 nanoparticles would be positively charge creating the electrostatic interaction and eventually formed strong binding between fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh after doping with fe3o4 particle zeta potential of n mmwcnts dropped significantly from almost 30 exhibited by mwcnts cooh to zero at ph around 2 the zeta potential of n mmwcnts reduced over a wide range of ph ph 2 to 10 the decrease in the phpzc of mwcnts cooh after doping with fe3o4 nanoparticle was due to the neutralization of the cooh groups on the surface of mwcnts by fe3o4 nanoparticles which resulting in the decrease in zeta potential of n mmwcnts composite on the other hand the phpzc of pdda mmwcnts was found at 5 6 the coating of fe3o4 particle with pdda was performed at ph 7 8 because fe3o4 nanoparticle was negatively charged as shown in fig 6 while pdda still remained as positively charged under that particular ph the positively charged polyelectrolyte of pdda was then attracted and neutralized the negative hydroxyl groups in fe3o4 nanoparticle surface and the resultant pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticle would be positively charged over a wide range of ph 40 56 the highly positively charged pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles allowed the combination with negatively charged mwcnts cooh through electrostatic interaction as indicates in fig 5 the phpzc of mwcnts cooh had been shifted to higher ph from ph 3 7 to 5 6 after doping with pdda coated fe3o4 nanoparticles this was due to the abundance of positively charge pdda which maintain the composite pdda mmwcnts as positively charged over a wide ph range therefore it could be concluded that n mmwcnts were more suitable for the adsorption of positively charged dye solute such as mb whereas pdda mmwcnts were more flexible to be applied to the removal of negatively charged dye solute without ph tuning or positively charged solute with ph tuning 3 8 ph stability of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts pdda mmwcnts and n mmwcnts were dispersed in different ph to determine the stability of the attraction force between mwcnts cooh with fe3o4 and pdda fe3o4 it was reported that the large amount of van der waals interactions prohibited the pristine or non functionalized mwcnts to be uniformly dispersed in water or organic solvent 57 however it could be observed in fig 7 a and b that both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts dispersed well in ph ranged from 3 to 9 this was due to the presence of the hydrophilic groups resulted from the acid functionalized mwcnts and also the repulsive and steric effect between the colloids 58 after dispersing in different ph solutions for 24 h the solutions were subjected to magnetic field to collect the magnetic materials fig 8 a and b shows the immediate response of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts when subjected to the magnetic field it could be observed that under the attraction of magnetic field clearer solution was obtained for n mmwcnts that were dispersed in ph 3 and 7 as compared to ph 9 this implied that n mmwcnts showed faster response towards the magnetic field in ph range from 3 to 7 however opposite result was observed for ph 9 in which n mmwcnts showed slower response towards magnetic field this may conclude that the n mmwcnts formed a more stable and well dispersed colloid in ph 9 solution this claim was further supported by the highest negative zeta potential of n mmwcnts at ph 9 as shown in fig 3 which generated high repulsive effect among the composite particles with the oh and no3 ions on the other hand it could be observed in fig 8 b that pdda mmwcnts showed good response to the magnetic field in solution with ph of 7 and 9 however for ph 3 pdda mmwcnts showed slow response to the magnetic attraction this indicated that pdda mmwcnts formed a more stable colloid in ph 3 this could be explained that at low ph the presence of cations in the polyelectrolyte such as h and na could interact with the highly positively charged pdda mmwcnts 40 59 the repulsion effect between the cations that present in the solution h and na and the highly positively charged pdda mmwcnts would produce a more stable dispersion of pdda mmwcnts in low ph solution after 30 min of magnetic attraction both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were able to be retrieved completely by the magnet as shown in fig 9 the supernatant of the dispersions of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were tested with uv vis to examine the detachment of fe3o4 from mmwcnts by measuring the concentrations of mwcnts cooh present in the solution fig 10 indicates the detachment of fe3o4 from n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts at different ph from fig 10 the concentrations of mwcnts cooh in the supernatant solution of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts at ph 3 were 1 96 ppm and 5 78 ppm respectively this implied that the detachment of fe3o4 was observed for both mmwcnts although pdda mmwncts suffered a higher degree of detachment higher concentration of mwcnts cooh in the supernatant could be explained through the surface charge of both nanoparticles pdda fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh as shown in the zeta potential analysis fig 5 both mwcnts cooh and pdda fe3o4 were positively charged at low ph therefore the highly positively charged pdda fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh will have the tendency to repel and detach from each other consequently the electrostatic attraction would be reduced 60 the presence of other cations may also contribute to the repulsion effect 61 however n mmwcnts showed lower detachment of fe3o4 due to smaller repulsive force between mwcnts cooh and fe3o4 both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts exhibited relatively small degree of detachment of fe3o4 in neutral ph of 7 on the other hand contrasting result was observed at high ph ph 9 where the detachment of fe3o4 was higher for n mmwcnts as compared to pdda mmwcnts the concentration of mwcnts cooh present in the supernatant solution was 4 72 ppm and 2 02 ppm for n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts respectively this was due to the same reason where fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh were negatively charged at ph 9 as shown in zeta potential analysis in figs 5 and 6 which resulted in the repulsion force between fe3o4 and mwcnts cooh thus the electrostatic attraction became weaker 3 9 feasibility of mb adsorption by n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts both n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were subjected to the adsorption of mb and the adsorption capacities of both mmwcnts were compared fig 11 displays the adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts results indicated that both magnetic adsorbents were capable to remove mb from the solution which the removal efficiencies of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts on mb were 36 57 and 32 95 respectively apart from that as shown in fig 11 the adsorption capacities of n mmwcnts and pdda mmwcnts were 12 19 mg g and 10 98 mg g respectively the adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts was higher than pdda mmwcnts because of the highly positively charged pdda which may repel the cationic mb from adsorbing onto the mwcnts cooh surface this was further supported by the zeta potential analysis as shown in fig 5 in which the pdda mmwcnts exhibited positive zeta potential over a wider range of ph as compared to n mmwcnts furthermore it could be observed from fig 5 that the zeta potential value of n mmwcnts was more negative than pdda mmwcnts at ph 7 the ph during adsorption process indicating its suitability to be used in the removal of positively charged mb furthermore pdda mmwcnts possessed much lower bet surface area than n mmwcnts as shown in table 3 this further supported the observation that pdda mmwcnts achieved lower mb adsorption than n mmwcnts due to the limited active sides for adsorption to take place owing to the favourable characteristics of higher adsorption capacity negative zeta potential in wide range of ph ph 2 to 10 and low detachment of mwcnts cooh n mmwcnts was subjected for further studies which included the effect of ph on the adsorption of mb adsorption isotherm and kinetic study 3 10 effect of ph towards the adsorption of mb on n mmwcnts the ph of a solution played a crucial role in the adsorption of dyes such as mb 62 as shown in fig 12 when ph of the solution was increased from 3 to 11 the adsorption capacity increased significantly from 11 69 mg g to 21 96 mg g the removal efficiency of mb also exhibited a corresponding increment from 41 49 to 89 77 when the ph of solution was increased from 3 to 11 as shown in fig 13 as proven by the zeta potential analysis fig 5 the phpzc of n mmwcnts was around ph 2 therefore n mmwcnts remained as negative charge in the ph range of 3 to 11 47 the negatively charged n mmwcnts would attract the cationic mb ions through electrostatic interaction when ph was increased the surface charge of n mmwcnts became more negative due to higher deprotonation of oh groups on fe3o4 and coo groups on mwcnts allowing stronger electrostatic attraction to the cationic ions of mb this implied that the removal of mb by n mmwcnts was strongly ph dependent 23 44 and alkaline condition favoured the adsorption of mb results in this study had revealed the potential of n mmwcnts as an excellent material for the removal of cationic pollutants such as heavy metal pb ii cu ii fe ii co ii etc from electrical and electronic industries as well as cationic dyes crystal violet thionine janus green neutral red etc from textiles painting industries 9 14 23 47 63 3 11 adsorption isotherm since n mmwcnts possessed higher adsorption capacity exhibited negative zeta potential in wide range of ph ph 2 to 10 and low detachment of mwcnts cooh they were subjected to further adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies it was stated that the adsorptive capacity was the most important indicator in the evaluation of an effective adsorbent 64 adsorption isotherm models were used to calculate the theoretical adsorptive capacity and also to describe the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates 65 66 therefore the isotherm could provide a relationship between the amount of dye adsorbed on the solid phase and the concentration of dye in the solution when both phases had achieved equilibrium two isotherm equations langmuir and freundlich isotherms were fitted with the experimental data obtained and analysed in detailed langmuir isotherm stated that the adsorption site of adsorbent was homogeneous and the adsorption was monolayer in which most of the adsorption sites possessed equal affinities towards the adsorbates 31 meanwhile the freundlich isotherm model was fitted for heterogeneous chemisorption process in which the surface was not energetically uniform and the adsorption was multilayer 25 fig 14 a and b shows the graph of langmuir and freundlich models for the adsorption using n mmwcnts based on fig 14 a and b the langmuir and freundlich isotherms showed different patterns the parameters for langmuir and freundlich isotherm of mb on n mmwcnts are displayed in table 5 the r 2 values for both isotherms were obtained from linear regression the regression coefficient r 2 values of langmuir and freundlich models were 0 999 and 0 981 respectively indicating that the langmuir model was more accurate in describing the adsorption equilibrium of mb onto n mmwcnts in this study this was further supported by the r l value 0 0138 which fulfilled the condition of 0 r l 1 indicating a favourable type of adsorption isotherm this was in agreement with similar studies reported in the literature whereby the langmuir isotherm was the commonly reported isotherm describing the mb adsorption on adsorbents 67 in comparing their findings with this result it was understood that the mb adsorption on n mmwcnts was homogeneous and only monolayer adsorption was formed further increase in concentration of mb did not increase the adsorption since the active sites were all fully occupied 47 although the 1 n value of freundlich isotherm 0 0639 was also found to fall under the favourable range 0 1 n 1 langmuir isotherm was still the most precise isotherm to describe the adsorption process of mb by n mmwcnts based on higher r 2 value 3 12 adsorption kinetic kinetic models could be used to describe the detailed adsorption mechanisms and is critical to determine the adsorption efficiency other than that the adsorption kinetic also controls the time needed to reach the equilibrium two well studied adsorption kinetic models were applied in this study i e pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations pseudo first order model was a physical adsorption and based on the assumption that the rate of change in solute adsorption over time was directly proportional to the difference in the amount of adsorptive solid uptake and saturation concentration over time 65 on the other hand pseudo second order model was used to express chemisorption involving valency forces through the exchange or sharing of electrons between the adsorbate and adsorbent as ion exchange and covalent bond respectively 68 fig 15 a and b displays the graph of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models of adsorption of mb using n mmwcnts according to fig 15 a and b both pseudo first order and pseudo second order models showed different patterns the isotherms based on the experimental data and r 2 values for both kinetic models were obtained from the linear regression and the parameters are tabulated in table 6 the regression coefficient r 2 values of pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model were 0 9848 and 1 respectively indicating that the pseudo second order model was a better fit as compared with pseudo first order model in describing the mb adsorption kinetics on the n mmwcnts this was further supported by the sse values in table 6 in which the sse value of pseudo second order kinetic model sse 0 00362 was much lower than pseudo first order kinetic model sse 0 0419 the result obtained in this study was in line with the reported literatures in which the pseudo second order model was the commonly reported kinetic model for mb adsorption on mmwcnts as such it could be deduced that the mb adsorption on mmwcnts was a multi step process involving the adsorption on the external surface and diffusion into the interior the pores within mwcnts in this case 69 it could also be concluded that the mb adsorption rate on mmwcnts was regulated by the surface adsorption that involved chemisorption between adsorbate and adsorbent such understanding was further strengthened by the fact that the abundantly available electrons on mmwcnts could promote this chemical interaction between the mmwcnts with the mb through covalent bond and also electrostatic forces in addition it was reported that the mb molecules could interact with mmwcnts through the π π interactions between the aromatic backbone of mb and hexagonal skeleton of mwcnts and the electrostatic attractions with the functionalized carboxylate groups 27 furthermore the adsorption of mb could also be due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between mb molecules and mmwcnts 25 as such the interaction between the mmwcnts with the mb had been successfully elucidated 3 13 comparison study table 7 shows the comparison of different adsorbents on the maximum adsorption capacity towards mb it was noticeable that the maximum mb adsorption capacity of the n mmwcnts synthesized in this study was comparable to adsorbents such as naoh treated pure kaolin diatomite treated with biochar from oil palm shell ops sodium hydroxide and magnetic graphene nanosheet on the other hand the maximum mb adsorption capacity of the n mmwcnts was significantly higher than raw fly ash spent rice biomass zeolite and even activated carbon of rice husk thus the information presented in table 7 indicated that the n mmwcnts not only could be synthesized using a simpler faster and greener method but also possessed satisfactory maximum adsorption capacity for mb 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated the feasibility to synthesis mmwcnts via solvent free direct doping method comparing to other conventional synthesis methods the direct doping method is facile more cost effective and environmentally friendly furthermore mmwcnts realized the concept of magnetic separation due to their ability to be recycled under magnetic field after the adsorption process this study also concluded that both magnetic mwcnts possessed different stabilities in different ph conditions n mmwcnts were stable in ph 3 whereas pdda mmwcnts were stable in ph 9 however in the adsorption of cationic dyes such as mb the adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts was higher than pdda mmwcnts at ph 7 100 ppm of mb concentration 3 h contact time and 45 mg of adsorbent the low adsorption capacity of pdda mmwcnts towards mb was due to the strong repulsive force generated by the positively charged pdda molecules in short n mmwcnts possessed higher adsorption mb capacity as compared to pdda mmwcnts the adsorption of mb on n mmwcnts at ph 7 was found to fit almost perfectly using langmuir isotherm with r 2 value of 0 999 as such it could be concluded that the mb adsorbed onto the mmwcnts was homogeneous through monolayer adsorption where further increase in concentration of mb would not increase the adsorption after the active sites had been fully occupied the maximum adsorption capacity of n mmwcnts 20 37 mg mb g n mmwcnts was comparable to the conventional industrial used adsorbents revealing the potential of n mmwcnts to be excellent adsorbents for cationic pollutants in addition the kinetic study on the mb adsorption on n mmwcnts at ph 7 was found to obey the pseudo second order with r 2 value of 1 and lower sse value as a conclusion the application of the synthesized mmwcnts as adsorbent could represent a breakthrough technology for water remediation which warrants further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

13189,in order to treat the typical waste acidic wastewater from the production process of titanium dioxide a collaborative utilization process of wastewater and pyrolusite was studied which recovered both ti fe from the wastewater and saved the amount of sulfuric acid used in the leaching process of pyrolusite acidic titanium dioxide wastewater was used to react with phosphoric acid to prepare titanium phosphate and the recovery of titanium reached 95 after the extraction of titanium a portion of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate was separated using the freezing crystallization method then the pyrolusite was leached with a leaching efficiency of 93 for manganese finally the ph was neutralized to 4 using manganese carbonate fe2 was oxidized to fe3 and separated by precipitation compared with the neutralization and concentration methods although the process is longer it has higher resource utilization less pollution simple operation and wide application prospect graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acidic titanium dioxide wastewater titanium phosphate ferrous sulfate heptahydrate pyrolusite synergy 1 introduction at present more than 90 of the world s titanium ore is used to make titanium dioxide titanium dioxide is considered to be the best performing white pigment because of its superior density dielectric constant and refractive index it has a wide application prospect in cosmetics rubber coatings and other fields 1 3 in the process of producing titanium dioxide by sulfuric acid method each ton product produced 8 10 tons of acidic wastewater 4 which contains 20 25 sulfuric acid 5 3 5 fe and 0 3 0 6 ti the treatment process of acidic wastewater is based primarily on the lime neutralization method 6 every ton of acidic wastewater is neutralized to produce about 4 tons of red gypsum whose main component is calcium sulfate it s difficult to reuse so that its stockpiling leads to serious land occupation problems 7 there are many exploratory studies on the reuse of acidic wastewater mainly focusing on evaporation 8 11 extraction 12 15 membrane separation 16 21 and other methods pang et al proposed a treatment method that combined coupling reactions and multistage evaporation 8 the solution was partially dehydrated by using ferric sulfate monohydrate as a dehydrating agent and then preparing ferrous sulfate heptahydrate according to the phase diagram subsequently the residual water was further removed by multi effect evaporation to produce highly concentrated sulfuric acid for the extraction technology a process for purifying waste sulfuric acid by solvent extraction is proposed 12 the organic phase is trioctylamine in kerosene compared with traditional methods sulfuric acid and ferrous sulfate can be recovered by this method without adding a neutralizer or precipitant j lopez studied utilized neosepta afx to treat wastewater from a copper smelter 18 under optimal operating conditions neosepta afx allowed the delivery of h2so4 and effectively removed metallic impurities on the whole the industrial application of the new method of acidic wastewater is still a long way to go due to the complexity of the process high costs and other reasons manganese is an industrial material widely used in steel metallurgy batteries and other fields 22 manganese sulfate is the most productive industrial product among manganese compounds from the economic point of view the leaching of manganese ore to produce manganese sulfate is a very important production method 23 but it also leads to the rapid consumption of this resources as a result a great deal of attention has been focused on improving the reductive leaching of manganese ore and slag the leaching of manganese ores using sulfuric acid is a commonly used method different reducing agents are used for comparison with sulfuric acid such as wood chips bacteria lignin corn cobs and melanoidins etc 24 28 the advantage of direct leaching over other reduction processes is that reduction and leaching can be accomplished in one step the process avoids high temperature roasting and is clean and energy efficient in order to make the reduction of manganese as economical as possible cheap reagents and efficient technology are essential therefore acidic titanium dioxide wastewater and its by products are considered as a superior raw material for the leaching of manganese based on the acidity of titanium dioxide wastewater and the large amount of valuable metal elements contained in it a new process of recovering titanium iron and manganese by synergistic treating acid wastewater and pyrolusite was proposed in this paper the optimal process conditions and the relevant models were studied the prepared titanium phosphate could be used for the adsorption of rare earth elements 29 ferrous sulfate heptahydrate could be used as an industrial flocculant and subsequently a manganese sulfate solution was obtained this process achieved the full utilization of resources reduced the acidity of wastewater reduced the use of new sulfuric acid in the leaching process and obtained valuable products 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials acidic titanium dioxide wastewater and pyrolusite were respectively provided by xing zhong titanium industry co ltd in panzhihua china and a manganese mining company in guangxi all reagents such as concentrated phosphoric acid and manganese carbonate are analytically pure the raw materials were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy perkinelmer avio 500 usa x ray fluorescence spectroscopy panalytical b v axios max netherlands and x ray diffractometer rigaku smartlab japan the chemical composition of acidic titanium dioxide wastewater and pyrolusite are shown in tables 1 and 2 it can be seen from table 1 that the main components in acidic wastewater are ti measured as tio2 and fe accounting for 0 61 and 5 respectively and contain a small amount of mg mn and v etc the main metallic elements in pyrolusite are mn 18 31 and fe2o3 10 49 xrd shows that the manganese is mainly in the form of mno2 fig 1 2 2 experimental methods fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the collaborative recovery of ti fe and mn using acidic titanium dioxide wastewater and pyrolusite titanium phosphate was prepared by reaction of phosphoric acid with tioso4 then the product of ferric sulfate heptahydrate was obtained by cooling crystallization finally the pure acidic wastewater was used to leach pyrolusite and neutralized sulfuric acid with manganese carbonate to treat the wastewater and produce manganese sulfate 2 2 1 preparation of titanium phosphate first 50 ml acidic wastewater was put into a conical flask heated on a constant magnetic stirrer and then concentrated phosphoric acid was added to prepare titanium phosphate the optimum preparation conditions were determined by changing reaction time 25 125 min reaction temperature 60 100 c and molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 1 1 4 1 4 and orthogonal optimization was carried out titanium phosphate was filtered washed dried and weighed to determine the conversion of titanium and purity 2 2 2 precipitation of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate by analyzing the purity and morphology of the prepared ferrous sulfate heptahydrate the waste acid after titanium extraction was used for freezing crystallization experiment subsequently 100 ml of acidic wastewater was taken into the frozen crystallizer for the experiment the removal efficiency and mass concentration of iron were measured and calculated at different acidity 16 25 and temperature 8 8 c 1 removal c 0 c a c 0 100 where c0 and ca are the initial concentration and the concentration after freezing g l 2 2 3 leaching of manganese the pyrolusite samples were crushed ground and sieved the samples were washed in a beaker using deionized water to remove any soluble material leaching experiments were performed in conical flasks with titanium dioxide acidic wastewater and pyrolusite together to explore the effects of temperature time stirring rate and molar ratio the leaching residue was filtered and washed to measure the content of manganese 3 results and discussions 3 1 recovery of titanium form acidic wastewater 3 1 1 effect of acidity of acidic wastewater on recovery of tio2 when the acidity of the acidic wastewater was 10 12 14 16 20 and 25 respectively the concentrated phosphoric acid was added with the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 of 1 2 heated to 80 c and reacted for 1 h the results are shown in fig 3 a there was no phenomenon when the acidity was less than 15 with the increase of acidity the reaction occurred rapidly and produced an obvious white precipitate we could argue that the concentration of sulfuric acid played an important role in the preparation of titanium phosphate the acidity of acidic wastewater is 15 25 which is favorable for the preparation of titanium phosphate 3 1 2 effect of molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 on recovery of titanium the theoretical molar ratio of tioso4 to h3po4 is 1 2 when the molar ratio was 1 1 4 1 1 7 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 6 and 1 4 the recovery of titanium was determined separately fig 3 b the recovery of titanium increases with the increase of phosphoric acid dosage and when the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 reaches 1 2 3 the recovery of titanium tends to equilibrium and reaches 95 5 on the contrary it is inevitable that the utilization of h3po4 decreases with the increase of phosphoric acid addition when the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 is 1 4 the utilization efficiency of phosphoric acid is only about 60 generally speaking the mole ratio of tio2 to h3po4 of 1 2 2 3 is more appropriate 3 1 3 effect of reaction temperature on recovery of tio2 temperature has a significant effect on the reaction system as shown in fig 3 c the reaction was more difficult due to the low energy of the reactant molecules in low temperature in addition the particle size of the titanium phosphate generated at low temperature was smaller and in a colloidal state which was difficult to filter and of poor quality with the temperature increased the effective collisions between activated molecules increased sharply so the conversion efficiency of tio2 increased after the temperature reached 80 c the reaction basically reached equilibrium so the optimal reaction temperature range is 80 90 c 3 1 4 effect of reaction time on recovery of tio2 the reaction between acidic wastewater and phosphoric acid was very fast and the reaction phenomenon was obvious the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 and temperature were fixed at 1 2 3 and 80 c and the results are shown in fig 3 d when the acidity of acidic wastewater was different the recovery of titanium had little difference in the same reaction time and as time lengthens it showed a trend of rising first and then stable after 60 min the conversion efficiency of tio2 was stable at about 95 therefore the reaction time is set at 60 min 3 1 5 establishment of regression model for recovery of tio2 the orthogonal experiment was designed with the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 reaction time and temperature as independent variables and the conversion efficiency of tio2 as evaluation index the coding of factors and levels are shown in table 3 based on the data samples the multiple binomial regression model of the conversion efficiency of tio2 was obtained through design expert 12 software eq 1 the variance analysis of the regression model showed that the regression model was highly significant and the relationship between the parameters in the reaction of preparing titanium phosphate from acidic wastewater had a high degree of fit it could be seen from the p values of mole ratio time and temperature that they all had a significant influence on the conversion efficiency of tio2 with the descending order of the influence being molar ratio time and temperature response surface analysis rsm is shown in fig 4 2 y 95 12 1 94 a 0 8325 b 1 09 c 0 27 5ab 0 2425 ac 0 17 bc 1 19 a 2 0 8523 b 2 0 8797 c 2 a is the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 b is the temperature c is the time in order to verify the accuracy of the model three groups of experiments were conducted under different conditions the comparison between the experimental values of the conversion efficiency of tio2 and the calculated values by multiple regression model are shown in table 4 these results suggest the deviation between the experimental values and the calculated values is less than 0 5 under different conditions therefore this model can truly reflect the influence of various factors on the conversion efficiency of tio2 in acidic wastewater 3 1 6 characteristics analysis of titanium phosphate the prepared titanium phosphate and titanium pyrophosphate were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf and scanning electron microscope sem and the results are shown in figs 5 a and 6 we can see that titanium phosphate has no characteristic peaks and can be considered as amorphous state titanium pyrophosphate could be produced by roasting the titanium phosphate at 750 c the xrd of titanium pyrophosphate shows a clear characteristic peak which is also consistent with the theory that the crystalline state appears at high temperatures the analysis results show that the main composition of titanium phosphate was ti5o4 po4 4 and there were no phosphates other than titanium phosphate excess phosphoric acid was difficult to react with metals such as fe ca mg and was stable in solution sem analysis showed that the surface of titanium phosphate had obvious pore structure in the microscopic figure the surface was scattered like petals and the shape of holes was irregular polygon the bet isotherms in fig 6 b were consistent with type iv 30 which indicated that the material had a good pore structure the specific surface area was 159 44 m2 g and the pore diameter was centered at 28 30 nm eds results showed that the main element in the surface layer of titanium phosphate are ti p o and a small amount of fe was also present xrf result showed that the contents of ti o and p were 39 87 45 46 12 75 respectively 3 2 recovery of iron in acidic wastewater after extracting titanium the ph of the acidic wastewater didn t change significantly after extracting titanium a large amount of iron in the acidic wastewater existed stably in the form of ferrous sulfate ferrous sulfate heptahydrate was recovered from acidic wastewater before and after titanium extraction the content of titanium iron and free acid in each component was analyzed and the eds and xrd analysis of ferrous sulfate are shown in figs 7 and 5 b the experimental phenomenon showed that the speed of crystallization of acidic wastewater without extracting titanium was significantly slowed down this is mainly due to the adsorption of titanium ions on the surface of ferrous sulfate which affected the growth of solutes into the crystal face and increased the energy level of crystallized products compared with the absence of titanium ions crystallization required greater driving force the width of the crystalline metastable zone increased and the crystallization time was prolonged it can be seen that due to the large amount of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and its excellent flocculation and precipitation titanium and free acid were inevitably entrained when a ferrous sulfate heptahydrate was precipitated in the first step the free acid entrained by it was about 5 4 and the loss of titanium was 4 1 in contrast the first step of extracting titanium reduced the loss of titanium while the entrainment of free acid was slightly reduced the results of the eds analysis also validated this finding the relatively high content of titanium on the surface of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate prepared before titanium extraction caused the loss of titanium the xrd results show that the main diffraction peaks are ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and only a small amount of the diffraction peaks of ferrous sulfate tetrahydrate were observed with a good degree of crystallization as can be seen from fig 7 a and b the concentration of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate varies with the temperature and sulfuric acid content of acidic wastewater the concentration of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate increases with the increase of temperature when the content of sulfuric acid is constant when the temperature is constant the concentration of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate decreases with the increase of sulfuric acid content in addition the curves of removal efficiency show that both of them have a single trend the above phenomenon is mainly due to the decrease of the solubility of ferrous sulfate with the decrease of temperature and the common ion effect 31 3 3 co treatment of acidic wastewater and manganese the acidic wastewater still contains 7 5 10 ferrous sulfate after extracting titanium and iron and the ph is maintained at about 0 so it provides an excellent leaching environment for pyrolusite in this paper mno2 in pyrolusite was used to oxidize fe2 to complete the co recovery of iron and manganese and the ph of the solution system was increased at the same time 3 3 1 effect of the molar ratio of feso4 to mno2 on the leaching of manganese fig 8 a shows that ferrous sulfate was essential in the leaching process of manganese when ferrous sulfate was used as a reducing agent mn4 was reduced to mn2 which was dissolved in sulfuric acid solution meanwhile as the amount of pyrolusite increases the conversion efficiency of fe2 gradually increases when the molar ratio of feso4 to mno2 exceeds 2 1 2 the reduction rate of manganese reaches saturation fe2 is almost completely converted to fe3 fig 8 b and the reaction tends to balance 3 3 2 effect of stirring speed on the leaching of manganese the effect of stirring speed on the recovery of manganese was studied by adjusting the stirring speed in the range of 100 500 rpm the results are shown in fig 9 a the experimental results showed that the leaching efficiency of manganese increased with the increase of the stirring speed because the higher stirring speed reduces the effect of slurry viscosity and increases the collision probability of reactants thus increasing the probability of reaction occurring when the stirring speed exceeds 300 rpm the reaction reaches equilibrium the recovery of manganese reaches 93 and fe2 is almost completely converted so the stirring speed is set to 300 rpm 3 3 3 leaching kinetics analysis the particle size of pyrolusite was 0 15 mm 100 meshes the molar ratio of feso4 to mno2 was 2 1 2 and the stirring speed was 300 rpm the effect of different leaching temperatures on the leaching efficiency of manganese was investigated and the results are shown in fig 9 a as can be seen from fig 9 b the leaching process of manganese is endothermic and temperature naturally influences the course of the leaching reaction at the same temperature the reaction rate is proportional to the time and the leaching rate increases rapidly within 0 75 min after 75 120 min of reaction the leaching efficiency tends to gently when the leaching time is extended to 75 min and the temperature is increased from 25 c to 90 c the leaching efficiency of manganese increases by 23 with the increase of leaching time the unreacted minerals and reducing agents decrease the probability of intermolecular collision decreases so the reaction is close to the end in order to fully understand the leaching process kinetic fitting of test data is essential if the particles are assumed to be a uniform spherical solid then the leaching efficiency of manganese can be analyzed using the solid film diffusion control model and chemical reaction control model eqs 2 and 3 32 33 3 1 2 3x 1 x 2 3 k c t 4 1 1 x 1 3 k c t within 25 75 c two control models were linearly fitted to the time and the results are shown in fig 10 we can see from fig 10 a and c that the slope of the line is the reaction rate constant then the apparent activation energies of the leaching process are calculated 11 026 kj mol and 12 387 kj mol by arrhenius equation which are plotted by lnk against 1 t because the apparent activation energy is less than 15 kj mol the chemical reaction is more likely to be controlled by solid film diffusion 34 in addition to mn2 the leaching solution also contains a large amount of fe3 and the ph of the solution is about 0 5 in order to ensure the effective recovery of iron manganese carbonate was used to reduce the concentration of hydrogen ions in the leachate to 1 10 4 mol l so fe3 was hydrolyzed to produce fe oh 3 and the solid phase products containing iron were filtered and recovered subsequently the filtrate could be used to produce manganese sulfate monohydrate through removing impurities and evaporation crystallization in summary titanium and most of iron were recovered by preparing titanium phosphate and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate the solid phase products containing remaining iron were recovered by the co treatment of pyrolusite and acidic wastewater and the neutralization of manganese carbonate the concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic wastewater decreased from 3 7 mol l to 1 10 4 mol l 4 conclusion 1 the prepared titanium phosphate is amorphous porous with high specific surface area and high purity the preparation conditions are as follows the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 was 1 2 3 the reaction temperature was 80 c and the reaction time was 1 h the recovery of titanium was 95 2 the acidic wastewater after titanium extraction was frozen to recover ferrous sulfate heptahydrate the morphology of the product was better and the loss of titanium was reduced 3 leaching of pyrolusite using solutions containing sulfuric acid and some ferrous sulfate the leaching efficiency of manganese reached 93 at the molar ratio of feso4 to mno2 of 2 1 2 the temperature of 80 c the stirring speed of 300 rpm and the reaction time of 75 min the leaching process accorded with the solid film diffusion model 4 compared to traditional method for treating acid wastewater and pyrolusite this process achieves the recovery of valuable metals and the utilization of sulfuric acid at the same time the concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic wastewater decreased from 3 7 mol l to 1 10 4 mol l declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13189,in order to treat the typical waste acidic wastewater from the production process of titanium dioxide a collaborative utilization process of wastewater and pyrolusite was studied which recovered both ti fe from the wastewater and saved the amount of sulfuric acid used in the leaching process of pyrolusite acidic titanium dioxide wastewater was used to react with phosphoric acid to prepare titanium phosphate and the recovery of titanium reached 95 after the extraction of titanium a portion of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate was separated using the freezing crystallization method then the pyrolusite was leached with a leaching efficiency of 93 for manganese finally the ph was neutralized to 4 using manganese carbonate fe2 was oxidized to fe3 and separated by precipitation compared with the neutralization and concentration methods although the process is longer it has higher resource utilization less pollution simple operation and wide application prospect graphical abstract

prospect in cosmetics rubber coatings and other fields 1 3 in the process of producing titanium dioxide by sulfuric acid method each ton product produced 8 10 tons of acidic wastewater 4 which contains 20 25 sulfuric acid 5 3 5 fe and 0 3 0 6 ti the treatment process of acidic wastewater is based primarily on the lime neutralization method 6 every ton of acidic wastewater is neutralized to produce about 4 tons of red gypsum whose main component is calcium sulfate it s difficult to reuse so that its stockpiling leads to serious land occupation problems 7 there are many exploratory studies on the reuse of acidic wastewater mainly focusing on evaporation 8 11 extraction 12 15 membrane separation 16 21 and other methods pang et al proposed a treatment method that combined coupling reactions and multistage evaporation 8 the solution was partially dehydrated by using ferric sulfate monohydrate as a dehydrating agent and then preparing ferrous sulfate heptahydrate according to the phase diagram subsequently the residual water was further removed by multi effect evaporation to produce highly concentrated sulfuric acid for the extraction technology a process for purifying waste sulfuric acid by solvent extraction is proposed 12 the organic phase is trioctylamine in kerosene compared with traditional methods sulfuric acid and ferrous sulfate can be recovered by this method without adding a neutralizer or precipitant j lopez studied utilized neosepta afx to treat wastewater from a copper smelter 18 under optimal operating conditions neosepta afx allowed the delivery of h2so4 and effectively removed metallic impurities on the whole the industrial application of the new method of acidic wastewater is still a long way to go due to the complexity of the process high costs and other reasons manganese is an industrial material widely used in steel metallurgy batteries and other fields 22 manganese sulfate is the most productive industrial product among manganese compounds from the economic point of view the leaching of manganese ore to produce manganese sulfate is a very important production method 23 but it also leads to the rapid consumption of this resources as a result a great deal of attention has been focused on improving the reductive leaching of manganese ore and slag the leaching of manganese ores using sulfuric acid is a commonly used method different reducing agents are used for comparison with sulfuric acid such as wood chips bacteria lignin corn cobs and melanoidins etc 24 28 the advantage of direct leaching over other reduction processes is that reduction and leaching can be accomplished in one step the process avoids high temperature roasting and is clean and energy efficient in order to make the reduction of manganese as economical as possible cheap reagents and efficient technology are essential therefore acidic titanium dioxide wastewater and its by products are considered as a superior raw material for the leaching of manganese based on the acidity of titanium dioxide wastewater and the large amount of valuable metal elements contained in it a new process of recovering titanium iron and manganese by synergistic treating acid wastewater and pyrolusite was proposed in this paper the optimal process conditions and the relevant models were studied the prepared titanium phosphate could be used for the adsorption of rare earth elements 29 ferrous sulfate heptahydrate could be used as an industrial flocculant and subsequently a manganese sulfate solution was obtained this process achieved the full utilization of resources reduced the acidity of wastewater reduced the use of new sulfuric acid in the leaching process and obtained valuable products 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials acidic titanium dioxide wastewater and pyrolusite were respectively provided by xing zhong titanium industry co ltd in panzhihua china and a manganese mining company in guangxi all reagents such as concentrated phosphoric acid and manganese carbonate are analytically pure the raw materials were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy perkinelmer avio 500 usa x ray fluorescence spectroscopy panalytical b v axios max netherlands and x ray diffractometer rigaku smartlab japan the chemical composition of acidic titanium dioxide wastewater and pyrolusite are shown in tables 1 and 2 it can be seen from table 1 that the main components in acidic wastewater are ti measured as tio2 and fe accounting for 0 61 and 5 respectively and contain a small amount of mg mn and v etc the main metallic elements in pyrolusite are mn 18 31 and fe2o3 10 49 xrd shows that the manganese is mainly in the form of mno2 fig 1 2 2 experimental methods fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the collaborative recovery of ti fe and mn using acidic titanium dioxide wastewater and pyrolusite titanium phosphate was prepared by reaction of phosphoric acid with tioso4 then the product of ferric sulfate heptahydrate was obtained by cooling crystallization finally the pure acidic wastewater was used to leach pyrolusite and neutralized sulfuric acid with manganese carbonate to treat the wastewater and produce manganese sulfate 2 2 1 preparation of titanium phosphate first 50 ml acidic wastewater was put into a conical flask heated on a constant magnetic stirrer and then concentrated phosphoric acid was added to prepare titanium phosphate the optimum preparation conditions were determined by changing reaction time 25 125 min reaction temperature 60 100 c and molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 1 1 4 1 4 and orthogonal optimization was carried out titanium phosphate was filtered washed dried and weighed to determine the conversion of titanium and purity 2 2 2

the pyrolusite samples were crushed ground and sieved the samples were washed in a beaker using deionized water to remove any soluble material leaching experiments were performed in conical flasks with titanium dioxide acidic wastewater and pyrolusite together to explore the effects of temperature time stirring rate and molar ratio the leaching residue was filtered and washed to measure the content of manganese 3 results and discussions 3 1 recovery of titanium form acidic wastewater 3 1 1 effect of acidity of acidic wastewater on recovery of tio2 when the acidity of the acidic wastewater was 10 12 14 16 20 and 25 respectively the concentrated phosphoric acid was added with the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 of 1 2 heated to 80 c and reacted for 1 h the results are shown in fig 3 a there was no phenomenon when the acidity was less than 15 with the increase of acidity the reaction occurred rapidly and produced an obvious white precipitate we could argue that the concentration of sulfuric acid played an important role in the preparation of titanium phosphate the acidity of acidic wastewater is 15 25 which is favorable for the preparation of titanium phosphate 3 1 2 effect of molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 on recovery of titanium the theoretical molar ratio of tioso4 to h3po4 is 1 2 when the molar ratio was 1 1 4 1 1 7 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 6 and 1 4 the recovery of titanium was determined separately fig 3 b the recovery of titanium increases with the increase of phosphoric acid dosage and when the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 reaches 1 2 3 the recovery of titanium tends to equilibrium and reaches 95 5 on the contrary it is inevitable that the utilization of h3po4 decreases with the increase of phosphoric acid addition when the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 is 1 4 the utilization efficiency of phosphoric acid is only about 60 generally speaking the mole ratio of tio2 to h3po4 of 1 2 2 3 is more appropriate 3 1 3 effect of reaction temperature on recovery of tio2 temperature has a significant effect on the reaction system as shown in fig 3 c the reaction was more difficult due to the low energy of the reactant molecules in low temperature in addition the particle size of the titanium phosphate generated at low temperature was smaller and in a colloidal state which was difficult to filter and of poor quality with the temperature increased the effective collisions between activated molecules increased sharply so the conversion efficiency of tio2 increased after the temperature reached 80 c the reaction basically reached equilibrium so the optimal reaction temperature range is 80 90 c 3 1 4 effect of reaction time on recovery of tio2 the reaction between acidic wastewater and phosphoric acid was very fast and the reaction phenomenon was obvious the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 and temperature were fixed at 1 2 3 and 80 c and the results are shown in fig 3 d when the acidity of acidic wastewater was different the recovery of titanium had little difference in the same reaction time and as time lengthens it showed a trend of rising first and then stable after 60 min the conversion efficiency of tio2 was stable at about 95 therefore the reaction time is set at 60 min 3 1 5 establishment of regression model for recovery of tio2 the orthogonal experiment was designed with the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 reaction time and temperature as independent variables and the conversion efficiency of tio2 as evaluation index the coding of factors and levels are shown in table 3 based on the data samples the multiple binomial regression model of the conversion efficiency of tio2 was obtained through design expert 12 software eq 1 the variance analysis of the regression model showed that the regression model was highly significant and the relationship between the parameters in the reaction of preparing titanium phosphate from acidic wastewater had a high degree of fit it could be seen from the p values of mole ratio time and temperature that they all had a significant influence on the conversion efficiency of tio2 with the descending order of the influence being molar ratio time and temperature response surface

order to verify the accuracy of the model three groups of experiments were conducted under different conditions the comparison between the experimental values of the conversion efficiency of tio2 and the calculated values by multiple regression model are shown in table 4 these results suggest the deviation between the experimental values and the calculated values is less than 0 5 under different conditions therefore this model can truly reflect the influence of various factors on the conversion efficiency of tio2 in acidic wastewater 3 1 6 characteristics analysis of titanium phosphate the prepared titanium phosphate and titanium pyrophosphate were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf and scanning electron microscope sem and the results are shown in figs 5 a and 6 we can see that titanium phosphate has no characteristic peaks and can be considered as amorphous state titanium pyrophosphate could be produced by roasting the titanium phosphate at 750 c the xrd of titanium pyrophosphate shows a clear characteristic peak which is also consistent with the theory that the crystalline state appears at high temperatures the analysis results show that the main composition of titanium phosphate was ti5o4 po4 4 and there were no phosphates other than titanium phosphate excess phosphoric acid was difficult to react with metals such as fe ca mg and was stable in solution sem analysis showed that the surface of titanium phosphate had obvious pore structure in the microscopic figure the surface was scattered like petals and the shape of holes was irregular polygon the bet isotherms in fig 6 b were consistent with type iv 30 which indicated that the material had a good pore structure the specific surface area was 159 44 m2 g and the pore diameter was centered at 28 30 nm eds results showed that the main element in the surface layer of titanium phosphate are ti p o and a small amount of fe was also present xrf result showed that the contents of ti o and p were 39 87 45 46 12 75 respectively 3 2 recovery of iron in acidic wastewater after extracting titanium the ph of the acidic wastewater didn t change significantly after extracting titanium a large amount of iron in the acidic wastewater existed stably in the form of ferrous sulfate ferrous sulfate heptahydrate was recovered from acidic wastewater before and after titanium extraction the content of titanium iron and free acid in each component was analyzed and the eds and xrd analysis of ferrous sulfate are shown in figs 7 and 5 b the experimental phenomenon showed that the speed of crystallization of acidic wastewater without extracting titanium was significantly slowed down this is mainly due to the adsorption of titanium ions on the surface of ferrous sulfate which affected the growth of solutes into the crystal face and increased the energy level of crystallized products compared with the absence of titanium ions crystallization required greater driving force the width of the crystalline metastable zone increased and the crystallization time was prolonged it can be seen that due to the large amount of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and its excellent flocculation and precipitation titanium and free acid were inevitably entrained when a ferrous sulfate heptahydrate was precipitated in the first step the free acid entrained by it was about 5 4 and the loss of titanium was 4 1 in contrast the first step of extracting titanium reduced the loss of titanium while the entrainment of free acid was slightly reduced the results of the eds analysis also validated this finding the relatively high content of titanium on the surface of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate prepared before titanium extraction caused the loss of titanium the xrd results show that the main diffraction peaks are ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and only a small amount of the diffraction peaks of ferrous sulfate tetrahydrate were observed with a good degree of crystallization as can be seen from fig 7 a and b the concentration of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate varies with the temperature and sulfuric acid content of acidic wastewater the concentration of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate increases with the increase of temperature when the content of sulfuric acid is constant when the temperature is constant the concentration of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate decreases with the increase of sulfuric acid content in addition the curves of removal efficiency show that both of them have a single trend the above phenomenon is mainly due to the decrease of the solubility of ferrous sulfate with the decrease of temperature and the common ion effect 31 3 3 co treatment of acidic wastewater and manganese the acidic wastewater still contains 7 5 10 ferrous sulfate after extracting titanium and iron and the ph is maintained at about 0 so it provides an excellent leaching environment for pyrolusite in this paper mno2 in pyrolusite was used to oxidize fe2 to complete the co recovery of iron and manganese and the ph of the solution system was increased at the same time 3 3 1 effect of the molar ratio of feso4 to mno2 on the leaching of manganese fig 8 a shows that ferrous sulfate was essential in the leaching process of manganese when ferrous sulfate was used as a reducing agent mn4 was reduced to mn2 which was dissolved in sulfuric acid solution meanwhile as the amount of pyrolusite increases the conversion efficiency of fe2 gradually increases when the molar ratio of feso4 to mno2 exceeds 2 1 2 the reduction rate of manganese reaches saturation fe2 is almost completely converted to fe3 fig 8 b and the reaction tends to balance 3 3 2 effect of stirring speed on the leaching of manganese the effect of stirring speed on the recovery of manganese was studied by adjusting the stirring speed in the range of 100 500 rpm the results are shown in fig 9 a the experimental results showed that the leaching efficiency of manganese increased with the increase of the stirring speed because the higher stirring speed reduces the effect of slurry viscosity and increases the collision probability of reactants thus increasing the probability of reaction occurring when the stirring speed exceeds 300 rpm the reaction reaches equilibrium the recovery of manganese reaches 93 and fe2 is almost completely converted so the stirring speed is set to 300 rpm 3 3 3 leaching kinetics analysis the particle size of pyrolusite was 0 15 mm 100 meshes the molar ratio of feso4 to mno2 was 2 1 2 and the stirring speed was 300 rpm the effect of different leaching temperatures on the leaching efficiency of manganese was investigated and the results are shown in fig 9 a as can be seen from fig 9 b the leaching process of manganese is endothermic and temperature naturally influences the course of the leaching reaction at the same temperature the reaction rate is proportional to the time and the leaching rate increases rapidly within 0 75 min after 75 120 min of reaction the leaching efficiency tends to gently when the leaching time is extended to 75 min and the temperature is increased from 25 c to 90 c the leaching efficiency of manganese increases by 23 with the increase of leaching time the unreacted minerals and reducing agents decrease the probability of intermolecular collision decreases so the reaction is close to the end in order to fully understand the leaching process kinetic fitting of test data is essential if the particles are assumed to be a uniform spherical solid then the leaching efficiency of manganese can be analyzed using the solid film diffusion control model and chemical reaction control model eqs 2 and 3 32 33 3 1 2 3x 1 x 2 3 k c t 4 1 1 x 1 3 k c t within 25 75 c two control models were linearly fitted to the time and the results are shown in fig 10 we can see from fig 10 a and c that the slope of the line is the reaction rate constant then the apparent activation energies of the leaching process are calculated 11 026 kj mol and 12 387 kj mol by arrhenius equation which are plotted by lnk against 1 t because the apparent activation energy is less than 15 kj mol the chemical reaction is more likely to be controlled by solid film diffusion 34 in addition to mn2 the leaching solution also contains a large amount of fe3 and the ph of the solution is about 0 5 in order to ensure the effective recovery of iron manganese carbonate was used to reduce the concentration of hydrogen ions in the leachate to 1 10 4 mol l so fe3 was hydrolyzed to produce fe oh 3 and the solid phase products containing iron were filtered and recovered subsequently the filtrate could be used to produce manganese sulfate monohydrate through removing impurities and evaporation crystallization in summary titanium and most of iron were recovered by preparing titanium phosphate and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate the solid phase products containing remaining iron were recovered by the co treatment of pyrolusite and acidic wastewater and the neutralization of manganese carbonate the concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic wastewater decreased from 3 7 mol l to 1 10 4 mol l 4 conclusion 1 the prepared titanium phosphate is amorphous porous with high specific surface area and high purity the preparation conditions are as follows the molar ratio of tio2 to h3po4 was 1 2 3 the reaction temperature was 80 c and the reaction time was 1 h the recovery of titanium was 95 2 the acidic wastewater after titanium extraction was frozen to recover ferrous sulfate heptahydrate the morphology of the product was better and the loss of titanium was reduced 3 leaching of pyrolusite using solutions containing sulfuric acid and some ferrous sulfate the leaching efficiency of manganese reached 93 at the molar ratio of feso4 to mno2 of 2 1 2 the temperature of 80 c the stirring speed of 300 rpm and the reaction time of 75 min the leaching process accorded with the solid film diffusion model 4 compared to traditional method for treating acid wastewater and pyrolusite this process achieves the recovery of valuable metals and the utilization of sulfuric acid at the same time the concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic wastewater decreased from 3 7 mol l to 1 10 4 mol l declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
