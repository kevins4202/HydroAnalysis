2865,one of the major advantages of satellite precipitation estimates is that they can provide a complete picture of precipitation systems a difficult task to achieve using sparsely distributed rain gauges this advantage greatly enhances our understanding of natural precipitation also for this reason it is difficult to know satellite derived precipitation system performance using a direct object to object method involving ground truth reference data to solve this issue we develop a broadly applicable method namely a pixel to object method which regards discrete gauges as sampling gridboxes to evaluate a satellite precipitation product from the precipitation system perspective approximately 46 000 awss recorded hourly data in china are used to evaluate the imerg precipitation product the results show that the smaller the precipitation systems are the higher the false alarm proportion the lower the miss proportion and the more underestimated the precipitation rates are the miss and false alarm proportions near the precipitation system boundaries are much larger than those far away from the boundaries while the precipitation rate bias presents a negative positive negative bias pattern from the boundaries to the centers of precipitation systems these results indicate the strong influences of the precipitation system scale and position in the systems on satellite product biases a universal overestimation of precipitation system sizes is revealed which is more severe for small systems than for large systems and in the afternoon than in the morning the different data sources in the imerg product throughout a day evidently influence the delineation accuracy of precipitation system size in a day keywords precipitation imerg evaluation precipitation system pixel to

ecological applications and so on barnett et al 2005 huntingford et al 2014 musselman et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in addition to the traditional rain gauges satellite based remote sensing technology

resolutions and global or quasi global coverages this advantage makes them have great potential for extensive hydrological and climate applications brunetti et al 2018 nguyen et al 2018 sheffield et al 2012 skofronick jackson et al 2017 one of the essential advantages of the multisatellite merged precipitation estimates compared with gauges is that they can derive spatially complete areal precipitation field such spatial integrity is especially important for precipitation since it actually occurs as an object in space with a particular spatial extent and organizational structure jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 liu and zipser 2015 white et al 2017 thus only by knowing the overall shape size and intensity distribution of the precipitation systems can we have a comprehensive knowledge of precipitation regularities ground based weather radars also have such a strength and even superior to satellites in accuracy and real time usage lengfeld et al 2020 so they have been applied in some precipitation system investigations del moral et al 2018 moseley et al 2013 peleg and morin 2012 however they are still primarily limited to developed countries kidd et al 2017 usually not freely available or sometimes even hard to access due to the policy restriction kidd et al 2021 in addition with limitations like beam blockage and range effects the radars are difficult to accurately capture the complete large scale precipitation systems zhang et al 2016 in contrast the high resolution satellite precipitation products have their advantages in easy accessibility and large and consistent coverage thus being even more widely applied to study precipitation systems chen and gao 2018 li et al 2020 quinn and neelin 2017 skok et al 2009 however as an indirect way to estimate ground precipitation rates from space satellite derived products are prone to biases smith et al 2006 tapiador et al 2012 therefore prior knowledge of the product accuracy in terms of precipitation system characteristics is required before their applications especially past studies have revealed that different characteristics of precipitation systems e g the location shape and size can lead to significant differences in hydrological processes e g runoff and infiltration gao and fang 2019 nunes et al 2006 ten veldhuis et al 2018 which further emphasizes the importance of accurate precipitation system depictions in satellite products used in hydrological applications nevertheless the existing evaluations for satellite precipitation products are mostly conducted in each independent pixel asong et al 2017 beck et al 2019 beck et al 2017 huang et al 2016 tang et al 2016 but focus less on precipitation system characteristics ayat et al 2021a ayat et al 2021b cui et al 2020 laverde barajas et al 2020 li et al 2020 one of the important reasons is still that the areal ground reference data are not easy to access therefore the key issue of the few past precipitation system related studies lay in overcome such a deficiency to conduct the intuitive object to object comparisons demaria et al 2011 li et al 2015 li et al 2016 for example demaria et al 2011 tried to derive areal gauge analyses by interpolation and extracting precipitation systems for the subsequent evaluation however the interpolated fields were known to have significant uncertainties in places lacking any gauges due to the nonlinearity of precipitation gbambie et al 2017 hofstra et al 2008 which might substantially impact precipitation system properties like the spatial extent liu and zipser 2014 and adhikari et al 2019 tried to use space borne pr data as the reference data to assess the pmw derived precipitation systems but the pr data were not strictly actual ground truth data and contained inherent biases petracca et al 2018 speirs et al 2017 more appropriately studies such as li et al 2015 and li et al 2016 used ground based radar data for evaluations however as mentioned ground based radars also have its deficiency in availability and detection ranges so all these studies have only been conducted in the u s ayat et al 2021a ayat et al 2021b cui et al 2020 laverde barajas et al 2020 li et al 2020 in summary although efforts have been made the limitations of ground truth data in reflecting real precipitation systems to allow a direct object to object evaluation of satellite precipitation products are still not easy to solve the evaluation seems in a dilemma in regions with sufficient ground based radars the areal precipitation of satellite products is relatively easy to assess but less important while in regions without radars the satellite derived areal precipitation information is more important but very difficult to verify in addition even with reliable areal ground truth data object to object methods might still have specific issues for example the corresponding objects in satellite and ground truth data are matched mainly from the geometric point of view e g using the overlapping areas or centroid distances of the two systems as criteria without any underlying physical mechanism li et al 2015 therefore the matching accuracy are highly sensitive to the criteria threshold values and cannot entirely eliminate subjectivity leading to the existence of mismatched system pairs gilleland et al 2009 mittermaier and roberts 2010 additionally an object to object comparison naturally place more emphasis on the overall system features e g the displacement areal coverage and total volume demaria et al 2011 li et al 2015 but focus less on the potentially varied performances in different positions within the precipitation systems however these variations could be further linked with the dynamic structures of the systems and provide insightful guidance for reducing errors in satellite data ai et al 2016 tu et al 2021 to solve these issues we develop another method namely a pixel to object method to handle the issues associated with evaluating the precipitation system related performance of a satellite product using gauge data this method has an easier realizability and a more objective geometric relationship compared to the existing object to object methods the purposes of this study are 1 to conduct a pixel to object evaluation of the accuracy of satellite products in delineating precipitation systems and 2 to quantify the relationship between satellite errors and precipitation system properties because the imerg product has been suggested to be one of the most advanced high resolution multisatellite merged precipitation estimates at present beck et al 2019 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 tang et al 2020 this dataset is used as the satellite precipitation product of interest in our analysis 2 data and methods 2 1 data and preprocessing 2 1 1 satellite based precipitation estimates in this study the level 3 multisatellite gridded precipitation product of the gpm project developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc namely imerg is used the version used herein is the imerg v06b final run this product has global coverage a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and a 0 5 hour temporal resolution huffman et al 2019 based on the gpm core observatory the product integrates the data recorded by multiple pmw sensors in the gpm constellation fills the temporal gaps with the interpolated pmw data called morph data and geostationary ir derived data and is finally calibrated using the monthly global precipitation climatology centre gpcc gauge analysis data huffman et al 2019 according to the pmw availability four kinds of data sources are included in the imerg product including direct pmw observations morph estimates interpolated by their adjacent available pmw data a mixture of morph and ir estimates when the available pmw data are located far from the gaps and ir only estimates on snowy or icy surfaces where the pmw estimates are thought to be even worse than the ir estimates tan et al 2016 regarding the pmw sources there are also two instrument types namely cross track sounders and conical scanning imagers conical scanning imagers generally produce higher quality data than cross track sounders and are thus prioritized in the imerg product huffman et al 2019 due to the existence of the first spaceborne dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and the advanced multifrequency polarization gpm microwave imager gmi onboard the gpm core observatory the gpm satellite retrieves more accurate estimates than the trmm satellite hou et al 2014 since the estimates derived from other sensors in the imerg product are uniformly calibrated by retrievals from the gpm core observatory their data quality is also greatly improved in addition imerg draws on the advantages of many previous mature algorithms i e the cmorph kalman filter lagrangian time interpolation algorithm joyce and xie 2011 the persiann cloud classification system hong et al 2004 and the tmpa satellite gauge combination procedure huffman et al 2007 all these advances have made imerg a good satellite precipitation product which has indeed been revealed in many previous works asong et al 2017 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 tang et al 2020 2 1 2 gauge based precipitation observations to reflect instantaneous precipitation system structures more closely in this work comparisons are made on an hourly scale accordingly an hourly gauge based dataset constructed from measurements recorded at 55 879 automatic weather stations awss belonging to the china meteorological administration cma http www cma gov cn is employed before its application a series of rigorous quality control procedures are made following the process outlined by ren et al 2010 to remove any unreliable observations these procedures include an expected maximum check a temporal consistency check and a spatial consistency check stations with outliers more than 1 of the total data are eliminated directly after this procedure 46 443 good quality stations are reserved whose spatial distribution is shown in fig 1 compared to many previous studies conducted in china chen and gao 2018 fang et al 2019 huang et al 2016 the gauge station density used herein is evidently much higher 2 1 3 matching the gauge observations with the satellite estimates to facilitate comparisons under consistent conditions preprocessing procedures are first conducted to match the gauge and satellite data in both time and space first the point gauge observations are converted into gridded data by averaging the values obtained from all gauges in each imerg gridbox fig 1c li et al 2018 zhou and wang 2017 naturally the gridded gauge and imerg data are compared only in the valid gridboxes defined as those gridboxes containing as least one gauge next the half hourly imerg product is accumulated to the hourly scale considering the minimum precipitation value measurable by chinese awss is 0 1 mm h this value is also used as the threshold of judging a precipitation occurrence in the upscaled hourly imerg data and the gridded gauge data considering that imerg in gpm era june 2014 present is corrected by the advanced gmi and dpr which represents the state of the art high resolution satellite precipitation product hou et al 2014 and the china s awss were gradually established during the last two decades ren et al 2010 we conduct the evaluation in gpm era meanwhile in view of the unreliability of cold season aws data caused by freezing weather shen et al 2010 our study period is set from may to september 2014 2018 except may 2014 2 2 methods 2 2 1 identifying precipitation systems from the imerg product for each hourly imerg image precipitation systems are identified as continuous rainy area objects 8 connected in space zhang and wang 2021 fig 2 a1 a2 shows the imerg image in a typical hour and the diagram of precipitation system identification this definition of precipitation system is also the core determination step in most precipitation system identification approaches applied in related research involving satellite data ground radar data or model data berg et al 2013 davis et al 2006 ebert and mcbride 2000 liu et al 2008 moseley et al 2016 prein et al 2017 skok et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 for various specific purposes additional steps may be applied when defining precipitation system in some studies for example to emphasize mesoscale precipitation areas smoothing processes can be added to filter the data spatially and remove small scale variations davis et al 2006 to focus only on the regions with high precipitation rates a higher precipitation threshold can be applied i e 5 mm h to mask lower precipitation fields prein et al 2017 however because we are attempting to generally evaluate precipitation systems of different sizes and discuss the findings under the conditions of varying precipitation rates no additional geometric or physical restrictions e g convective or frontal are added in our definition process 2 2 2 precipitation system related factors the core idea of the pixel to object method is to take the scattered gridded gauge data as the sampling pixels to evaluate the imerg derived precipitation objects by taking advantage of their pixel to object geometric relationship this relationship can mainly be described by two factors namely the size of the precipitation systems a where the sampling gridboxes are located and the sampling gridboxes position relative to the precipitation systems d although the gauge locations are fixed precipitation systems can be generated at different positions relative to the gauges and also move in different directions therefore the sampling gridboxes can cover different positions of the precipitation systems of different sizes in addition given the relatively dense gauge network containing 46 443 gauges and 28 537 valid gridboxes after gridding the comparatively short interval of each imerg image hourly and the reasonably adequate number of hourly imerg images 17 616 the total sampling number at hourly scale could reach 502 707 792 therefore we consider this sampling number can be reasonably sufficient under the conditions of different a and d here d is defined as the distance from a target valid gridbox to precipitation system boundaries which are set as the outermost gridbox of the analyzed precipitation systems the distance used here is the great circle distance calculated via the haversine formula which is a common method in spatial analysis to calculate the shortest distance between two points on a sphere wei et al 2021 with the system boundaries as the reference the misses outside the precipitation systems and the false alarms inside the systems could be discussed symmetrically the diagram of the calculation of d is shown in fig 2b s1 4 are all the precipitation systems at a certain time g1 2 are the sampling gridboxes d1 is the distance of the inside gridbox g1 when the sampling gridbox is outside the systems g2 we first calculate its distances to the boundaries of each system d 2 1 4 then the system with the minimum distance to g2 s4 is viewed as its associated system accordingly d for g2 equals to d 2 4 2 2 3 detectability of precipitation occurrence two metrics are defined here i e the false alarm proportion pf and miss proportion pm these metrics can be expressed as follows 1 p f a d n f a d n i a d 100 and 2 p m a d n m a d n o a d 100 where n i a d and n o a d represent the total numbers of sampling gridboxes inside and outside precipitation systems respectively under the condition of specific a and d values n f a d and n m a d indicate the numbers of false alarm and miss cases among these samples respectively from another point of view p f a d reveals the misjudgments in different positions within the imerg derived precipitation systems and p m a d indicates the precipitation occurrences around the imerg derived precipitation systems that actually belong to real precipitation systems but are ignored by the satellites fig 2c1 c2 shows the precipitation systems identified in fig 2a1 not outlined here for clarity and the valid gridboxes recognized as misses hits false alarms and correct negatives in the figures p f a d is intuitively expressed as n g r e e n a d n g r e e n a d n p u r p l e a d and p m a d is expressed as n r e d a d n r e d a d n y e l l o w a d under the condition of specific a and d values where n represents the number of valid gridboxes of different colors next the contribution of the error cases in each system position to the total number of error cases is further examined using the cumulative distribution function c d f accumulated from the boundaries to the target locations this function is calculated as follows 3 c d f f a d i d 0 d n f a i n f a 100 4 c d f m a d i d d 0 n m a i n m a 100 where n f a and n m a are the total false alarm and miss cases both inside and outside the precipitation system respectively and n f a i and n m a i are the numbers of false alarm and miss cases within a distance of i respectively d 0 is set to 0 km in 3 and 0 10 km in 4 as discussed above 2 2 4 indicator of the area bias of precipitation systems if we regard a gridbox as a unit then the p f a d and p m a d values also equal the expected values of the contribution of a unit gridbox to the overestimation or underestimation of the precipitation system size e g if there are 6 missing gridbox out of 10 gridboxes i e p m a d 0 6 then we could say that each gridbox equivalently contributes 0 6 missing gridbox for a specific imerg derived precipitation system a false alarm and a miss in symmetric positions relative to the system boundaries are likely to exist at the same time leading to both overestimating and underestimating tendency of the precipitation system size in this case the difference in the expected values d p could indicate the average net area bias which can be expressed as the difference between p f a d 1 and p m a d 2 5 d p a d 1 d 2 p f a d 1 p m a d 2 where d 1 and d 2 are the corresponding pairs of distances inside and outside the precipitation systems respectively 2 2 5 precipitation rate bias here the mean precipitation rate bias d r h is calculated as the difference between the average gauge precipitation rates r i h and imerg precipitation rates r g h obtained when simultaneously detecting precipitation occurrences 6 r i h a d i 1 n h a d r i h a d i n h a d 7 r g h a d i 1 n h a d r g h a d i n h a d 8 d r h a d r i h a d r g h a d where n h a d is the total number of hits and r i h a d i and r g h a d i are the imerg and gauge precipitation rates for the i th hit case respectively the mean precipitation rates of the precipitation falsely detected by imerg r i f and the gauge measured precipitation missed by imerg r g m are also presented as references tian et al 2009 9 r i f a d i 1 n f a d r i f a d i n f a d 10 r g m a d i 1 n m a d r g m a d i n m a d where n f a d and n m a d are the total number of false alarm and miss cases respectively and r i f a d i and r g m a d i are the false alarm and miss precipitation rate for the ith case respectively the miss precipitation false alarm precipitation and hit precipitation events together compose the error decomposition scheme proposed by tian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 detectability of precipitation occurrence fig 3 first depicts the overall false alarm proportion within each valid gridbox and the false alarm proportion when the valid gridboxes are located within precipitation systems of different sizes identified from imerg from the graphs the overall false alarm proportions in most valid gridboxes can be seen to be between 40 and 60 fig 3a such a finding indicates that relatively large uncertainties exist in the hourly satellite retrieved precipitation data though the inherent bias between the averaged point observations and gridded estimates may also influence the results tang et al 2018 when separately investigating the bias conditions associated with different precipitation systems the proportions are found to differ widely fig 3b f the smaller the scale of a precipitation system is the higher the false alarm proportion inside the precipitation system is the median values of the false alarm proportions of all the valid gridboxes are equal to 0 46 for precipitation systems larger than 106 km2 and 0 89 for precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 highlighting the large uncertainties in the small scale precipitation systems depicted by imerg one of the important reasons might be the integral displacement of satellite precipitation system that is because if there is a displacement the proportion of the displaced gridbox number to the total gridbox number of a system could be much larger for a small system than for a large system which results in the higher false alarm proportion for small systems some possible reasons for the displacement might be the incident angle of satellite sensors and the time for hydrometeors falling from clouds to the ground that result in the mismatching of satellite derived systems and the real systems guilloteau et al 2018 for precipitation systems of the same size the false alarm proportions still vary among different regimes for example for 103 104 km2 precipitation systems larger misjudgments exist on the north china plain in northeast china and in the northern part of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river while these misjudgments are lower in southwest and south china fig 3c however this spatial pattern also differs among different classes of precipitation systems for instance the misjudgments remain at a relatively low level in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river compared to other regions when considering 105 106 km2 precipitation systems fig 3e but this is opposite to the pattern observed in fig 3c in addition the false alarm proportion in south china is evidently higher than that in the surrounding regions as shown in fig 3e but this pattern is not clearly shown in fig 3c quantitatively the correlation coefficient pattern derived between the false alarm proportion for 103 104 km2 precipitation systems and 104 105 km2 systems is 0 77 in comparison this value is much weaker between precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 and larger than 106 km2 0 44 indicating that the discrepant performances between small and large precipitation systems are also influenced by their geographical locations fig 4 shows the miss proportion of precipitation outside precipitation systems here we limit the statistical range to 100 km because the valid gridboxes located too far from precipitation systems are less likely to be associated with the systems compared to the false alarm proportion the miss proportion near the precipitation systems identified by imerg is much lower and the proportion inversely increases as the considered area increases for example the median values of the miss proportions in all valid gridboxes over china are equal to 0 04 and 0 15 for the precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 and larger than 106 km2 respectively undoubtedly one of the important reasons is the inherent performance differences of satellites in detecting precipitation systems of different scales but there is also another possibility that a larger system also has a larger area near its boundaries that is easy to be missed in addition it can be clearly seen from the figure that the probability of a missed judgment outside a precipitation system is also related to the local terrain most obviously the miss proportion around the sichuan basin is obviously greater than that inside it fig 4d f apparent differences in the spatial patterns of miss proportions are also found the correlation coefficient is equal to only 0 37 between precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 and larger than 106 km2 further confirming the influence of geographical factors on precipitation system related errors next we take the other factor namely the position relative to the precipitation system into consideration to jointly investigate the imerg s detectability related to the precipitation systems fig 5 shows the function curves of the false alarm proportion and miss proportion corresponding to different precipitation systems calculated from all valid gridboxes in the study area as a function of the distance from the system boundaries especially for the miss proportion we extend the distance to more than 100 km from the boundaries compared with fig 4 therefore we could not only examine the missed precipitation associated with the imerg derived systems but could also display if there are isolated real systems that are far away from the existing imerg derived systems and entirely missed by imerg as well from the graphs both the false alarm and miss proportions can be seen to present decreasing trends as the distance from the boundaries increases and the proportions obtained between the gridboxes located nearby and far from the boundaries differ greatly for example the false alarm proportion calculated directly on the boundaries of 105 106 km2 precipitation systems is 0 71 while those calculated deep inside the precipitation systems could be as low as 0 08 in addition the miss proportion within 10 km from the boundaries of precipitation systems larger than 106 km2 is 0 27 while this value can be close to zero 400 km away from the boundaries one possible reason for the relatively high error probabilities around the precipitation system boundaries might be that a horizonal shift occurs between the satellite derived precipitation systems and real precipitation systems due to the widely existing incident angles of satellite sensors guilloteau et al 2018 in sum these results reveal substantial quality differences in the precipitation system estimates derived from satellite sensors in various positions relative to the precipitation systems and highlight the critical task of solving these hourly occurrence errors especially around the boundaries of precipitation systems when looking at the satellite detectability with regards to precipitation systems of different sizes fig 5 similar phenomena are revealed as those elucidated in figs 2 and 3 however varying regularities are still obtained after considering the distance factor the false alarm proportion generally decreases as the precipitation system size increases near the system boundaries fig 5a but inversely increases when the distance is longer than 60 km if there are available values in these positions this finding indicates the sharper satellite detectability contrasts among different positions in larger systems compared to smaller systems in contrast the miss proportion is higher for relatively large precipitation systems at all distances fig 5b this result is in accordance with fig 4 further corroborating the dependence of the miss probability of imerg on the precipitation system size at a distance of 100 km from the boundaries of a precipitation system the miss proportion for systems larger than 106 km2 can be three times higher than that for 104 105 km2 systems figure s1 reexamine the relationships among false alarm proportions and the sizes of precipitation and the position in the systems after controlling the intensity the still evident relationships exclude the possibility that the bias variations observed under different system related conditions are only the result of intensity differences and suggest their robustness the above analyses provide the probability of satellite errors in each position of the systems however considering that the total numbers of gridboxes at different positions may also vary a lot it is necessary to further know the contribution of the total error cases number at each location to all the error cases related to the precipitation systems thus we could understand the error distribution more comprehensively from fig 6 for example for the false alarm contribution calculated from all derived precipitation systems over 40 of misjudgments occur directly on precipitation system boundaries over 50 of misjudgments occur within 10 km of the boundaries and over 90 of misjudgments occur within 60 km of the boundaries fig 6a similarly the miss rate contribution derived for all the precipitation systems surpasses 50 within 30 km of the system boundaries outside the systems and over 75 within 70 km of the outer system boundaries fig 6b gradually reaching 90 at 140 km when checking in the same position of the systems the false alarm contribution descends but the miss contribution ascends with the larger precipitation system this finding is in accordance with the probability order revealed in fig 5 these results further highlight the importance of quantifying occurrence errors near precipitation system boundaries and emphasize the discrepant features that exist among precipitation systems of different sizes however an important feature that differs from the false alarm and miss proportions revealed in fig 5 and the contributions shown in fig 6 is that a certain false alarm proportion exists near the center of the precipitation systems but the contribution is actually meager on the contrary the miss proportion remains at a very low level at far distances outside the systems but the cumulative proportion cannot be ignored for example for the statistics derived for all precipitation systems the false alarm proportion remains at 30 at locations 100 km from the boundaries inside a precipitation system but the contribution of all the false alarm cases at distances over 100 km within systems is below 5 figs 5 and 7 similarly for all precipitation systems the miss proportion at any location farther than 110 km outside the precipitation system is below 2 4 but the cumulative contribution is still above 16 combining these two results we can have a more comprehensive understanding of the position dependent satellite errors on the one hand for end users who want to examine the storm center features by the satellite product they should be aware that there is a certain chance for precipitation in these positions to be false alarms actually i e neglecting the hole inside the real precipitation systems but for developers who aim at solving as many error cases as possible the total cases near the system center in turn take a very small proportion thus having relatively small importance on the other hand when end users check a dry region far from the imerg derived precipitation systems they could be highly confident that there is no precipitation here in reality as well i e unlikely to have any isolated storm missed however inversely the developers should pay enough attention that the total number of isolated storms in the whole analyzed domain could account for a large proportion which serves as a critical task to be solved in the future 3 2 indicator of the precipitation system area bias in the above analyses we investigated the false alarms and misses inside and outside the precipitation systems separately when further considering these two metrics together a higher false alarm proportion but a lower miss proportion near system boundaries for example could indicate a tendency to overestimate the precipitation system sizes based on this knowledge we treat the difference between the inside false alarm proportion and outside miss proportions in corresponding positions relative to the precipitation system boundaries namely d p as an indicator of the system area bias fig 7 the meaning of this indicator as mentioned above is the expected value of the overestimated or underestimated area of a unit gridbox located in a specific position from the graph fig 7 universally positive differences are revealed indicating a general overestimation of the size of precipitation systems by imerg one possible reason for this result is that satellites observe upper atmosphere clouds from top to bottom while some precipitation especially light precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground this phenomenon is more likely to occur at the edges of precipitation systems thus leading to smaller precipitation ranges in reality than those estimated by satellite sensors ayat et al 2021b cui et al 2020 for the first class relative to the boundaries i e 0 km and 10 0 km from the system boundaries this difference is 0 78 for precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 but 0 44 for systems larger than 106 km2 a similar situation is found for the other positions located near the boundaries of these two precipitation system classes where we believe this indicator is generally more relevant because the rainy situations in locations places are more likely to be related to the precipitation systems these results indicate that the areal overestimation is much more severe for smaller systems than for larger systems notably this indicator only implies the expected areal bias of a single gridbox related to systems and we need to consider the number of peripheral gridboxes of different systems to further calculate the absolute area bias however since the large precipitation systems might naturally have more miss or false gridboxes than the small systems our indicator provides a more comparable way to evaluate the areal bias severities associated with different precipitation systems therefore we further apply this metric to examine the diurnal variation of the precipitation system areal bias fig 8 displays the diurnal cycle of d p for the distance class nearest to the precipitation system boundaries as an example as well as the original false alarm proportion and miss proportion in the corresponding locations from the graph evident diurnal cycles can be seen both for the inside false alarm proportion and outside miss proportion fig 8a and b these cycles mutually lead to an apparent variation in the magnitude precipitation system size overestimations throughout the course of a day fig 8c however each hour the false alarm and miss proportions as well as their differences among precipitation systems of different sizes still maintain similar orders as those shown in figs 4 and 7 indicating the stability of this regularity throughout the day the most obvious finding is the overestimation of precipitation systems in the afternoon compared to other times this result may explain the precipitation frequency overestimations corresponding to this time derived in a previous diurnal variation study li et al 2018 and this contrast is even more evident for relatively large systems another conspicuous phenomenon observed in all three subgraphs is that abrupt drops and increases occur in several specific hours of the day e g drops at 09 00 and 20 00 21 00 local solar time increases at 10 00 11 00 and 22 00 00 00 fig 8c referring to previous studies on diurnal cycles in imerg data freitas et al 2020 li et al 2018 tan et al 2019 these abrupt changes are very likely to be induced by the inhomogeneous data sourced from different sensors onboard the gpm constellation satellites at each hour of the day as a result the diurnal variation signal of the areal bias factor can be decomposed into a consistently positive daily mean value resulting from the systematic overestimation tendency of imerg throughout the day the smooth fluctuations caused by different dominant precipitation systems in different time periods of a day that satellites generally have varying responses and high frequency oscillations at some specific hours resulting from the uneven pmw source proportions and qualities during the day li et al 2018 to examine the influence of the areal bias variations on the precipitation system area itself throughout the course of a day we further display the diurnal cycle of the median precipitation system size where the sampling gridboxes are located in a 50 and compare it with the diurnal cycle of d p for the distance class nearest to the boundaries of precipitation systems of all sizes after the two variables are normalized fig 9 a ideally the diurnal variation in the imerg derived precipitation system size should result from the diurnal variation in the real precipitation system size plus the precipitation system size bias so it is reasonable that the shapes of the two variation curves are not the same however these two curves still show very coincident high frequency oscillations corresponding to the abrupt changes mentioned above this phenomenon suggests that the precipitation system size bias oscillations could significantly affect the shape of the diurnal variation curve itself similarly leading to irregular oscillations in the precipitation system sizes in contrast the difference in the areal bias between the morning and afternoon seems to have less influence on the shape of the area curve because the precipitation system characteristics in the morning and afternoon originally have climatological differences notably we also test d p at varying distances from the system boundaries and obtain very similar curves fig 9b displays the average percentages of the different data sources constituting the imerg product throughout the diurnal cycle compared to fig 9a fig 9b corroborates our judgment of the influence of the data sources on the depiction of the precipitation system area specifically notably small percentages of high quality pmw sources occur from 10 00 11 00 and from 22 00 00 00 with morph or morph ir sources filling their gaps the morph scheme tends to enlarge the precipitation system size as a result of interpolation rajagopal et al 2021 while ir sensors are likely to misjudge the nonprecipitating anvil around the real precipitation systems as rainy areas liu et al 2007 on the other hand the higher percentages of cross track sensor sources at 09 00 and 20 00 21 00 might be related to the drops at these times li et al 2018 these sensors should be less accurate than the conical scanning sensors but serve to offset the systematic overestimations throughout the day ayat et al 2021a huffman et al 2019 these results indicate that substantial influence of data source inhomogeneity on the accuracy of precipitation system sizes throughout the day conversely the consistent oscillations between the imerg derived precipitation system sizes and our bias indicator also denote the reliability of the utilized metric 3 3 precipitation rate bias after investigating the precipitation occurrence biases the precipitation rate bias related to the precipitation system properties is further investigated like figs 4 and 5 fig 10 displays the mean precipitation rate bias determined within the precipitation systems of different sizes when the satellites and gauges simultaneously detect a precipitation occurrence i e hit fig 10a first displays the hit biases for all systems from this graph a region specific bias is revealed and slightly more underestimated valid gridboxes than overestimated valid gridboxes are observed however by categorizing different precipitation systems a widely negative bias is observed for precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 and 103 104 km2 with negative value percentages above 92 and 93 respectively such a situation can still be observed for 104 105 km2 systems but this bias is less severe the overestimated and underestimated valid gridboxes become comparable for systems larger than 105 km2 this result shows that the precipitation rate bias is also strongly related to the attributes of precipitation systems next the positions relative to the precipitation systems are further considered the mean precipitation rate curves derived from the gauges and imerg are presented as functions of the distance from the system boundaries fig 11 following the error decomposition scheme designed by tian et al 2009 the two remaining parts of precipitation namely the precipitation falsely detected by imerg and gauge measured precipitation missed by imerg are also displayed for analysis regarding the hit precipitation the gauge data generally present a monotonic increase as the distance from the system increases accompanied by an uneven growth rate except near the centers of the precipitation systems 380 km in contrast the relationship between the imerg hit precipitation rate and distance is nonmonotonic the precipitation rate derived from imerg is far lower than that provided by the gauge data near the system boundaries but rapidly rises with increasing distance and ultimately exceeds the gauge derived rate then the imerg precipitation rate peaks at a distance of approximately 100 km and then begins to decline gradually falling to values lower than those indicated by the gauges the imerg precipitation rate rebounds at approximately 300 km but the follow up values never exceed the gauge indicated rate thereafter such varying distributions further lead to the dependence of the precipitation rate error characteristics on the position within the analyzed precipitation system this nonlinear relationship is likely to be related to the complex atmospheric structures inside the precipitation systems e g the presence of different precipitation types i e convective versus stratiform in different positions of a same precipitation system houze 1997 regarding the precipitation systems of different sizes although their maximum distances from the system boundaries may differ they also exhibit similar distributions in their existing positions figs 11b f this feature leads to a negative average bias everywhere in small scale precipitation systems 103 km2 and 103 104 km2 negative biases near the boundaries but positive biases near the centers of medium sized precipitation systems 104 105 km2 the negative average biases both near the centers and boundaries and positive biases in the regions between the centers and boundaries of large precipitation systems 105 106 km2 and 106 km2 this regularity also corresponds to the general underestimation of small precipitation systems shown in fig 10 and the comparative overestimation and underestimation of other precipitation systems discussed throughout the study in addition the curve of the precipitation rates falsely detected by imerg also shows a similar shape as the hit rate but with generally lower rates fig 11 these two parts together depict the essentially nonmonotonic intensity distribution in imerg derived precipitation systems in contrast the miss precipitation rates in the gauge data basically maintain a low level but are still higher than the falsely detected and hit precipitation rates in the imerg product at the system boundaries with a rate above 1 mm h such a moderate precipitation rate for the gauge data near the imerg system boundaries further indicates the boundaries of the real systems might not accord with the boundaries of the imerg systems when looking at the missing and hit proportions of the gauge data near the boundaries together they even show a relatively smooth increasing curve figs 11a e such phenomenon could also be understood as the intensity distribution curve of the real precipitation systems whose boundaries do not coincide with the imerg derived precipitation systems further elucidating the mismatch between the precipitation systems described by these two datasets similar to s1 we also control for the intensity to examine the robustness of precipitation rate bias and the precipitation system related factors figure s2 although a strong intensity dependent bias is revealed the relationships between the precipitation rate bias and the position in a precipitation system still keep robust among different intensity grades 4 discussion because precipitation occurs as discrete events with high spatiotemporal variability evaluating satellite derived precipitation products by treating each pixel independently could largely conceal the important spatial correlation information and obtain limited knowledge on their overall performances beck et al 2019 beck et al 2017 tang et al 2016 therefore an evaluation combining the precipitation system information herein could serve as a useful supplement to previous works for example in our study a general overestimation of precipitation system sizes by satellites is revealed fig 7 indicating an exaggeration of the influence range of the precipitation process by the satellite data compared to a previous related study in which an evident overestimation of the precipitation frequency was found on an hourly scale li et al 2018 our work further explains this phenomenon and can also provide an explanation for the previously confirmed precipitation event duration overestimations li et al 2021 besides since previous studies suggested that hydrological processes in a basin are highly influenced by the scale of the precipitation system gao and fang 2019 nunes et al 2006 ten veldhuis et al 2018 the satellite errors in this aspect remind users to pay attention when using it as hydrological model inputs to our knowledge the few existing evaluations on satellite based precipitation systems all adopted the object to object method ayat et al 2021a ayat et al 2021b cui et al 2020 demaria et al 2011 laverde barajas et al 2020 li et al 2015 li et al 2016 li et al 2020 compared to these methods our new pixel to object method is free from the uncertainties caused by interpolated gauge fields and limited ground radar data ranges and only takes advantage of original gauge data this method is much easier to implement than previously used methods and could be applied to many other regions in the world moreover without a threshold sensitive procedure through which the accordant systems from satellites and reference data are matched li et al 2015 li et al 2016 the geometric relationship between the gauge data and two dimensional object data is evidently stabilized in addition the previously utilized object to object methods naturally focused on the system wide characteristic differences such as the shapes and sizes of precipitation systems li et al 2015 li et al 2016 however our method first verifies the satellite product performance in different positions in the precipitation systems these newly derived error features could then be further linked with the dynamics structures in the analyzed systems to find out the essential error ai et al 2016 tu et al 2021 for example the nonmonotonic and nonlinear relationship derived between the precipitation rate bias and the position in the precipitation systems may correspond to the complex internal structures of precipitation systems specifically for instance precipitation systems in mesoscale convective systems and tropical cyclones usually feature convective precipitation near their centers stratiform precipitation near their boundaries and nonprecipitating clouds e g anvil clouds in the regions surrounding the systems ai et al 2016 tu et al 2021 these different dynamics may have notably different abilities to respond to satellite signals kidd and levizzani 2011 in addition the asymmetry of precipitation system structures may also cause nonmonotonic and nonlinear relationships observed in this work pei and jiang 2018 zhang and xu 2021 therefore the novel findings obtained in this study could further deepen our understanding of satellite based precipitation errors notably while the method outlined herein provides a universal way to evaluate satellite derived precipitation systems by simply applying scattered gauge data without the need for full coverage ground radar data a lack of full areal information is still to some extent unavoidable and places limitations on our method with regards to investigating some other system related characteristics e g dislocation and deformation besides although widely applicable this method should draw more reliable and stable conclusions when a reasonably dense gauge network is available that is because a dense gauge network could not only ensure sufficient sampling gridboxes at different positions of different precipitation systems but also ensure the sampling gridboxes are aggregated by enough individual gauges to achieve a reasonable level of representativeness for comparison with the areal satellite estimates some new findings obtained in this study could provide useful implications for algorithm improvements for example the imerg merging algorithm linearly interpolates two adjacent observed precipitation fields to reconstruct the field at times when direct pmw observations are unavailable i e the morphing procedure huffman et al 2019 in this case if an ongoing precipitation system is morphed with a nonprecipitating area in which precipitation has ceased for a given amount of time the linear interpolation process would easily fill the gaps between the two instances with precipitation system occurrences even if no precipitation or very small precipitation actually occurred at this time thus resulting in an areal overestimation therefore in future algorithms efforts should be made to apply a nonlinear interpolation scheme e g simulating the precipitation intensity evolution curves to fill the gaps instead of simple linear average to mitigate such artificial influences on the resulting precipitation system sizes in addition one reason for the relatively high error probability derived around the system boundaries in this work might be the incident angle of pmw sensors resulting in a parallax shift between the precipitation area detected in the sky by the satellite and the real precipitation system footprint on the ground thus leading to mismatches guilloteau et al 2018 according to this geometric relationship the higher a precipitating cloud is the larger the horizontal shift is therefore compared to large scale precipitation system this factor more obviously impacts small scale convective precipitation systems with deeper vertical development thus contributing to the higher errors an extra geometric correction procedure should be added to precipitation retrieval algorithms in the future although many technical issues need to be overcome to realize it guilloteau et al 2018 besides precipitation from the deep convective systems take longer time to fall from clouds to the ground than the large scale system which may also be a reason for the higher false alarm proportion of small systems 5 conclusions one of the great advantages of satellite precipitation estimates is that they can provide a complete picture of precipitation systems but such precipitation system information is difficult to be validated due to the dispersion of gauges and limited availability of ground radar to solve this issue here we develop a more general method namely the pixel to object method in which discrete gridded gauges are regarded as sampling pixels to evaluate the precipitation system performance of imerg an hourly precipitation dataset constructed from 55 879 awss in china is used to investigate the performance of the imerg precipitation product the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the smaller a satellite derived precipitation system is the higher the false alarm proportion inside the system and the lower the miss proportion outside the system are the median value of false alarm proportion over china can even reach 89 for small precipitation systems 103 km2 the miss and false alarm proportions near precipitation system boundaries are much larger than those far away from the boundaries more than half of the total false alarm cases occurring within 10 km of system boundaries and miss cases occurring within 30 km of system boundaries at the centers of precipitation systems of all sizes false alarms have an occurrence probability above 30 but contribute to 5 of the total false alarm cases far away from the boundaries outside precipitation systems the occurrence probability of a miss is below 2 4 but these misses contribute to over 16 of the total cases all these results confirm the existence of a distinct relationship between the precipitation detection ability of satellites and the attributes of precipitation systems 2 an indicator of the precipitation system areal bias is established as the difference between the false alarm proportion and the miss proportion in corresponding positions near the precipitation system boundaries the indicator denotes that imerg commonly overestimates the size of precipitation systems and these overestimations are more severe for smaller systems than for larger systems for in the afternoon than for in the morning precipitation system areal bias shows sharp increases and decreases in certain hours e g a decrease at 09 00 and an increase at 22 00 00 00 and these variations are consistent with the incorrect diurnal oscillations of the imerg derived precipitation system area itself such phenomenon is likely caused by different data sources in different hours during the day 3 precipitation rates in small scale systems 103 km2 and 103 104 km2 are generally underestimated nationwide while the numbers of underestimated and overestimated valid gridboxes are similar in medium and large precipitation systems 104 km2 small scale systems 103 km2 and 103 104 km2 suffer from negative average biases in all system regions while the biases are negative only near the boundaries and positive near the centers of the medium precipitation systems 104 105 km2 for large precipitation systems 105 106 km2 and 106 km2 the positions near both the system boundaries and centers possess negative biases while the biases in the regions between the centers and boundaries are positive such results indicate the obvious nonmonotonic and nonlinear dependency of the precipitation rate bias on the position within the precipitation system with could be further connected with the complex dynamic structure in the systems the new pixel to object method for the precipitation system performance of satellite products is free from ground radar data therefore it could be further applied in most regions of the world and many other satellite precipitation products even in the model data the dependencies of satellite errors on precipitation system characteristics revealed in this study also suggest the need of adding system related information in the future algorithms for their improvement in follow up works more experiments should be designed with satellite radar data and reanalysis data to investigate the causes of error dependencies on precipitation system features satellite errors could be further investigated by connecting with more geometric features of precipitation systems e g shape orientation and ellipse rate and even spatiotemporal characteristics movement direction and speed moreover in this study we purely categorize precipitation systems by their sizes future works could further differentiate precipitation systems with underlying physics e g convective frontal and tropical cyclones

2865,one of the major advantages of satellite precipitation estimates is that they can provide a complete picture of precipitation systems a difficult task to achieve using sparsely distributed rain gauges this advantage greatly enhances our understanding of natural precipitation also for this reason it is difficult to know satellite derived precipitation system performance using a direct object to object method involving ground truth reference data to solve this issue we develop a broadly applicable method namely a pixel to object method which regards discrete gauges as sampling gridboxes to evaluate a satellite precipitation product from the precipitation system perspective approximately 46 000 awss recorded hourly data in china are used to evaluate the imerg precipitation product the results show that the smaller the precipitation systems are the higher the false alarm proportion the lower the miss proportion and the more underestimated the precipitation rates are the miss and false alarm proportions near the precipitation system boundaries are much larger than those far away from the boundaries while the precipitation rate bias presents a negative positive negative bias pattern from the boundaries to the centers of precipitation systems these results indicate the strong influences of the precipitation system scale and position in the systems on satellite product biases a universal overestimation of precipitation system sizes is revealed which is more severe for small systems than for large systems and in the afternoon than in the morning the different data sources in the imerg product throughout a day evidently influence the delineation accuracy of precipitation system size in a day keywords precipitation imerg evaluation precipitation system pixel to object data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction accurate precipitation measurements are crucial in hydrological predictions water management climate research ecological applications and so on barnett et al 2005 huntingford et al 2014 musselman et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in addition to the traditional rain gauges satellite based remote sensing technology has grown rapidly and become another effective method for estimating ground precipitation kidd and levizzani 2011 mccabe et al 2017 by taking advantage of multiple infrared ir sensors passive microwave pmw sensors and precipitation radar pr satellite precipitation products especially the multisatellite merged precipitation estimates e g tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa climate prediction center cpc morphing cmorph precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann and integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg ashouri et al 2015 huffman et al 2007 huffman et al 2019 joyce and xie 2011 could possess fine spatiotemporal resolutions and global or quasi global coverages this advantage makes them have great potential for extensive hydrological and climate applications brunetti et al 2018 nguyen et al 2018 sheffield et al 2012 skofronick jackson et al 2017 one of the essential advantages of the multisatellite merged precipitation estimates compared with gauges is that they can derive spatially complete areal precipitation field such spatial integrity is especially important for precipitation since it actually occurs as an object in space with a particular spatial extent and organizational structure jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 liu and zipser 2015 white et al 2017 thus only by knowing the overall shape size and intensity distribution of the precipitation systems can we have a comprehensive knowledge of precipitation regularities ground based weather radars also have such a strength and even superior to satellites in accuracy and real time usage lengfeld et al 2020 so they have been applied in some precipitation system investigations del moral et al 2018 moseley et al 2013 peleg and morin 2012 however they are still primarily limited to developed countries kidd et al 2017 usually not freely available or sometimes even hard to access due to the policy restriction kidd et al 2021 in addition with limitations like beam blockage and range effects the radars are difficult to accurately capture the complete large scale precipitation systems zhang et al 2016 in contrast the high resolution satellite precipitation products have their advantages in easy accessibility and large and consistent coverage thus being even more widely applied to study precipitation systems chen and gao 2018 li et al 2020 quinn and neelin 2017 skok et al 2009 however as an indirect way to estimate ground precipitation rates from space satellite derived products are prone to biases smith et al 2006 tapiador et al 2012 therefore prior knowledge of the product accuracy in terms of precipitation system characteristics is required before their applications especially past studies have revealed that different characteristics of precipitation systems e g the location shape and size can lead to significant differences in hydrological processes e g runoff and infiltration gao and fang 2019 nunes et al 2006 ten veldhuis et al 2018 which further emphasizes the importance of accurate precipitation system depictions in satellite products used in hydrological applications nevertheless the existing evaluations for satellite precipitation products are mostly conducted in each independent pixel asong et al 2017 beck et al 2019 beck et al 2017 huang et al 2016 tang et al 2016 but focus less on precipitation system characteristics ayat et al 2021a ayat et al 2021b cui et al 2020 laverde barajas et al 2020 li et al 2020 one of the important reasons is still that the areal ground reference data are not easy to access therefore the key issue of the few past precipitation system related studies lay in overcome such a deficiency to conduct the intuitive object to object comparisons demaria et al 2011 li et al 2015 li et al 2016 for example demaria et al 2011 tried to derive areal gauge analyses by interpolation and extracting precipitation systems for the subsequent evaluation however the interpolated fields were known to have significant uncertainties in places lacking any gauges due to the nonlinearity of precipitation gbambie et al 2017 hofstra et al 2008 which might substantially impact precipitation system properties like the spatial extent liu and zipser 2014 and adhikari et al 2019 tried to use space borne pr data as the reference data to assess the pmw derived precipitation systems but the pr data were not strictly actual ground truth data and contained inherent biases petracca et al 2018 speirs et al 2017 more appropriately studies such as li et al 2015 and li et al 2016 used ground based radar data for evaluations however as mentioned ground based radars also have its deficiency in availability and detection ranges so all these studies have only been conducted in the u s ayat et al 2021a ayat et al 2021b cui et al 2020 laverde barajas et al 2020 li et al 2020 in summary although efforts have been made the limitations of ground truth data in reflecting real precipitation systems to allow a direct object to object evaluation of satellite precipitation products are still not easy to solve the evaluation seems in a dilemma in regions with sufficient ground based radars the areal precipitation of satellite products is relatively easy to assess but less important while in regions without radars the satellite derived areal precipitation information is more important but very difficult to verify in addition even with reliable areal ground truth data object to object methods might still have specific issues for example the corresponding objects in satellite and ground truth data are matched mainly from the geometric point of view e g using the overlapping areas or centroid distances of the two systems as criteria without any underlying physical mechanism li et al 2015 therefore the matching accuracy are highly sensitive to the criteria threshold values and cannot entirely eliminate subjectivity leading to the existence of mismatched system pairs gilleland et al 2009 mittermaier and roberts 2010 additionally an object to object comparison naturally place more emphasis on the overall system features e g the displacement areal coverage and total volume demaria et al 2011 li et al 2015 but focus less on the potentially varied performances in different positions within the precipitation systems however these variations could be further linked with the dynamic structures of the systems and provide insightful guidance for reducing errors in satellite data ai et al 2016 tu et al 2021 to solve these issues we develop another method namely a pixel to object method to handle the issues associated with evaluating the precipitation system related performance of a satellite product using gauge data this method has an easier realizability and a more objective geometric relationship compared to the existing object to object methods the purposes of this study are 1 to conduct a pixel to object evaluation of the accuracy of satellite products in delineating precipitation systems and 2 to quantify the relationship between satellite errors and precipitation system properties because the imerg product has been suggested to be one of the most advanced high resolution multisatellite merged precipitation estimates at present beck et al 2019 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 tang et al 2020 this dataset is used as the satellite precipitation product of interest in our analysis 2 data and methods 2 1 data and preprocessing 2 1 1 satellite based precipitation estimates in this study the level 3 multisatellite gridded precipitation product of the gpm project developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc namely imerg is used the version used herein is the imerg v06b final run this product has global coverage a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and a 0 5 hour temporal resolution huffman et al 2019 based on the gpm core observatory the product integrates the data recorded by multiple pmw sensors in the gpm constellation fills the temporal gaps with the interpolated pmw data called morph data and geostationary ir derived data and is finally calibrated using the monthly global precipitation climatology centre gpcc gauge analysis data huffman et al 2019 according to the pmw availability four kinds of data sources are included in the imerg product including direct pmw observations morph estimates interpolated by their adjacent available pmw data a mixture of morph and ir estimates when the available pmw data are located far from the gaps and ir only estimates on snowy or icy surfaces where the pmw estimates are thought to be even worse than the ir estimates tan et al 2016 regarding the pmw sources there are also two instrument types namely cross track sounders and conical scanning imagers conical scanning imagers generally produce higher quality data than cross track sounders and are thus prioritized in the imerg product huffman et al 2019 due to the existence of the first spaceborne dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and the advanced multifrequency polarization gpm microwave imager gmi onboard the gpm core observatory the gpm satellite retrieves more accurate estimates than the trmm satellite hou et al 2014 since the estimates derived from other sensors in the imerg product are uniformly calibrated by retrievals from the gpm core observatory their data quality is also greatly improved in addition imerg draws on the advantages of many previous mature algorithms i e the cmorph kalman filter lagrangian time interpolation algorithm joyce and xie 2011 the persiann cloud classification system hong et al 2004 and the tmpa satellite gauge combination procedure huffman et al 2007 all these advances have made imerg a good satellite precipitation product which has indeed been revealed in many previous works asong et al 2017 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 tang et al 2020 2 1 2 gauge based precipitation observations to reflect instantaneous precipitation system structures more closely in this work comparisons are made on an hourly scale accordingly an hourly gauge based dataset constructed from measurements recorded at 55 879 automatic weather stations awss belonging to the china meteorological administration cma http www cma gov cn is employed before its application a series of rigorous quality control procedures are made following the process outlined by ren et al 2010 to remove any unreliable observations these procedures include an expected maximum check a temporal consistency check and a spatial consistency check stations with outliers more than 1 of the total data are eliminated directly after this procedure 46 443 good quality stations are reserved whose spatial distribution is shown in fig 1 compared to many previous studies conducted in china chen and gao 2018 fang et al 2019 huang et al 2016 the gauge station density used herein is evidently much higher 2 1 3 matching the gauge observations with the satellite estimates to facilitate comparisons under consistent conditions preprocessing procedures are first conducted to match the gauge and satellite data in both time and space first the point gauge observations are converted into gridded data by averaging the values obtained from all gauges in each imerg gridbox fig 1c li et al 2018 zhou and wang 2017 naturally the gridded gauge and imerg data are compared only in the valid gridboxes defined as those gridboxes containing as least one gauge next the half hourly imerg product is accumulated to the hourly scale considering the minimum precipitation value measurable by chinese awss is 0 1 mm h this value is also used as the threshold of judging a precipitation occurrence in the upscaled hourly imerg data and the gridded gauge data considering that imerg in gpm era june 2014 present is corrected by the advanced gmi and dpr which represents the state of the art high resolution satellite precipitation product hou et al 2014 and the china s awss were gradually established during the last two decades ren et al 2010 we conduct the evaluation in gpm era meanwhile in view of the unreliability of cold season aws data caused by freezing weather shen et al 2010 our study period is set from may to september 2014 2018 except may 2014 2 2 methods 2 2 1 identifying precipitation systems from the imerg product for each hourly imerg image precipitation systems are identified as continuous rainy area objects 8 connected in space zhang and wang 2021 fig 2 a1 a2 shows the imerg image in a typical hour and the diagram of precipitation system identification this definition of precipitation system is also the core determination step in most precipitation system identification approaches applied in related research involving satellite data ground radar data or model data berg et al 2013 davis et al 2006 ebert and mcbride 2000 liu et al 2008 moseley et al 2016 prein et al 2017 skok et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 for various specific purposes additional steps may be applied when defining precipitation system in some studies for example to emphasize mesoscale precipitation areas smoothing processes can be added to filter the data spatially and remove small scale variations davis et al 2006 to focus only on the regions with high precipitation rates a higher precipitation threshold can be applied i e 5 mm h to mask lower precipitation fields prein et al 2017 however because we are attempting to generally evaluate precipitation systems of different sizes and discuss the findings under the conditions of varying precipitation rates no additional geometric or physical restrictions e g convective or frontal are added in our definition process 2 2 2 precipitation system related factors the core idea of the pixel to object method is to take the scattered gridded gauge data as the sampling pixels to evaluate the imerg derived precipitation objects by taking advantage of their pixel to object geometric relationship this relationship can mainly be described by two factors namely the size of the precipitation systems a where the sampling gridboxes are located and the sampling gridboxes position relative to the precipitation systems d although the gauge locations are fixed precipitation systems can be generated at different positions relative to the gauges and also move in different directions therefore the sampling gridboxes can cover different positions of the precipitation systems of different sizes in addition given the relatively dense gauge network containing 46 443 gauges and 28 537 valid gridboxes after gridding the comparatively short interval of each imerg image hourly and the reasonably adequate number of hourly imerg images 17 616 the total sampling number at hourly scale could reach 502 707 792 therefore we consider this sampling number can be reasonably sufficient under the conditions of different a and d here d is defined as the distance from a target valid gridbox to precipitation system boundaries which are set as the outermost gridbox of the analyzed precipitation systems the distance used here is the great circle distance calculated via the haversine formula which is a common method in spatial analysis to calculate the shortest distance between two points on a sphere wei et al 2021 with the system boundaries as the reference the misses outside the precipitation systems and the false alarms inside the systems could be discussed symmetrically the diagram of the calculation of d is shown in fig 2b s1 4 are all the precipitation systems at a certain time g1 2 are the sampling gridboxes d1 is the distance of the inside gridbox g1 when the sampling gridbox is outside the systems g2 we first calculate its distances to the boundaries of each system d 2 1 4 then the system with the minimum distance to g2 s4 is viewed as its associated system accordingly d for g2 equals to d 2 4 2 2 3 detectability of precipitation occurrence two metrics are defined here i e the false alarm proportion pf and miss proportion pm these metrics can be expressed as follows 1 p f a d n f a d n i a d 100 and 2 p m a d n m a d n o a d 100 where n i a d and n o a d represent the total numbers of sampling gridboxes inside and outside precipitation systems respectively under the condition of specific a and d values n f a d and n m a d indicate the numbers of false alarm and miss cases among these samples respectively from another point of view p f a d reveals the misjudgments in different positions within the imerg derived precipitation systems and p m a d indicates the precipitation occurrences around the imerg derived precipitation systems that actually belong to real precipitation systems but are ignored by the satellites fig 2c1 c2 shows the precipitation systems identified in fig 2a1 not outlined here for clarity and the valid gridboxes recognized as misses hits false alarms and correct negatives in the figures p f a d is intuitively expressed as n g r e e n a d n g r e e n a d n p u r p l e a d and p m a d is expressed as n r e d a d n r e d a d n y e l l o w a d under the condition of specific a and d values where n represents the number of valid gridboxes of different colors next the contribution of the error cases in each system position to the total number of error cases is further examined using the cumulative distribution function c d f accumulated from the boundaries to the target locations this function is calculated as follows 3 c d f f a d i d 0 d n f a i n f a 100 4 c d f m a d i d d 0 n m a i n m a 100 where n f a and n m a are the total false alarm and miss cases both inside and outside the precipitation system respectively and n f a i and n m a i are the numbers of false alarm and miss cases within a distance of i respectively d 0 is set to 0 km in 3 and 0 10 km in 4 as discussed above 2 2 4 indicator of the area bias of precipitation systems if we regard a gridbox as a unit then the p f a d and p m a d values also equal the expected values of the contribution of a unit gridbox to the overestimation or underestimation of the precipitation system size e g if there are 6 missing gridbox out of 10 gridboxes i e p m a d 0 6 then we could say that each gridbox equivalently contributes 0 6 missing gridbox for a specific imerg derived precipitation system a false alarm and a miss in symmetric positions relative to the system boundaries are likely to exist at the same time leading to both overestimating and underestimating tendency of the precipitation system size in this case the difference in the expected values d p could indicate the average net area bias which can be expressed as the difference between p f a d 1 and p m a d 2 5 d p a d 1 d 2 p f a d 1 p m a d 2 where d 1 and d 2 are the corresponding pairs of distances inside and outside the precipitation systems respectively 2 2 5 precipitation rate bias here the mean precipitation rate bias d r h is calculated as the difference between the average gauge precipitation rates r i h and imerg precipitation rates r g h obtained when simultaneously detecting precipitation occurrences 6 r i h a d i 1 n h a d r i h a d i n h a d 7 r g h a d i 1 n h a d r g h a d i n h a d 8 d r h a d r i h a d r g h a d where n h a d is the total number of hits and r i h a d i and r g h a d i are the imerg and gauge precipitation rates for the i th hit case respectively the mean precipitation rates of the precipitation falsely detected by imerg r i f and the gauge measured precipitation missed by imerg r g m are also presented as references tian et al 2009 9 r i f a d i 1 n f a d r i f a d i n f a d 10 r g m a d i 1 n m a d r g m a d i n m a d where n f a d and n m a d are the total number of false alarm and miss cases respectively and r i f a d i and r g m a d i are the false alarm and miss precipitation rate for the ith case respectively the miss precipitation false alarm precipitation and hit precipitation events together compose the error decomposition scheme proposed by tian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 detectability of precipitation occurrence fig 3 first depicts the overall false alarm proportion within each valid gridbox and the false alarm proportion when the valid gridboxes are located within precipitation systems of different sizes identified from imerg from the graphs the overall false alarm proportions in most valid gridboxes can be seen to be between 40 and 60 fig 3a such a finding indicates that relatively large uncertainties exist in the hourly satellite retrieved precipitation data though the inherent bias between the averaged point observations and gridded estimates may also influence the results tang et al 2018 when separately investigating the bias conditions associated with different precipitation systems the proportions are found to differ widely fig 3b f the smaller the scale of a precipitation system is the higher the false alarm proportion inside the precipitation system is the median values of the false alarm proportions of all the valid gridboxes are equal to 0 46 for precipitation systems larger than 106 km2 and 0 89 for precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 highlighting the large uncertainties in the small scale precipitation systems depicted by imerg one of the important reasons might be the integral displacement of satellite precipitation system that is because if there is a displacement the proportion of the displaced gridbox number to the total gridbox number of a system could be much larger for a small system than for a large system which results in the higher false alarm proportion for small systems some possible reasons for the displacement might be the incident angle of satellite sensors and the time for hydrometeors falling from clouds to the ground that result in the mismatching of satellite derived systems and the real systems guilloteau et al 2018 for precipitation systems of the same size the false alarm proportions still vary among different regimes for example for 103 104 km2 precipitation systems larger misjudgments exist on the north china plain in northeast china and in the northern part of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river while these misjudgments are lower in southwest and south china fig 3c however this spatial pattern also differs among different classes of precipitation systems for instance the misjudgments remain at a relatively low level in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river compared to other regions when considering 105 106 km2 precipitation systems fig 3e but this is opposite to the pattern observed in fig 3c in addition the false alarm proportion in south china is evidently higher than that in the surrounding regions as shown in fig 3e but this pattern is not clearly shown in fig 3c quantitatively the correlation coefficient pattern derived between the false alarm proportion for 103 104 km2 precipitation systems and 104 105 km2 systems is 0 77 in comparison this value is much weaker between precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 and larger than 106 km2 0 44 indicating that the discrepant performances between small and large precipitation systems are also influenced by their geographical locations fig 4 shows the miss proportion of precipitation outside precipitation systems here we limit the statistical range to 100 km because the valid gridboxes located too far from precipitation systems are less likely to be associated with the systems compared to the false alarm proportion the miss proportion near the precipitation systems identified by imerg is much lower and the proportion inversely increases as the considered area increases for example the median values of the miss proportions in all valid gridboxes over china are equal to 0 04 and 0 15 for the precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 and larger than 106 km2 respectively undoubtedly one of the important reasons is the inherent performance differences of satellites in detecting precipitation systems of different scales but there is also another possibility that a larger system also has a larger area near its boundaries that is easy to be missed in addition it can be clearly seen from the figure that the probability of a missed judgment outside a precipitation system is also related to the local terrain most obviously the miss proportion around the sichuan basin is obviously greater than that inside it fig 4d f apparent differences in the spatial patterns of miss proportions are also found the correlation coefficient is equal to only 0 37 between precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 and larger than 106 km2 further confirming the influence of geographical factors on precipitation system related errors next we take the other factor namely the position relative to the precipitation system into consideration to jointly investigate the imerg s detectability related to the precipitation systems fig 5 shows the function curves of the false alarm proportion and miss proportion corresponding to different precipitation systems calculated from all valid gridboxes in the study area as a function of the distance from the system boundaries especially for the miss proportion we extend the distance to more than 100 km from the boundaries compared with fig 4 therefore we could not only examine the missed precipitation associated with the imerg derived systems but could also display if there are isolated real systems that are far away from the existing imerg derived systems and entirely missed by imerg as well from the graphs both the false alarm and miss proportions can be seen to present decreasing trends as the distance from the boundaries increases and the proportions obtained between the gridboxes located nearby and far from the boundaries differ greatly for example the false alarm proportion calculated directly on the boundaries of 105 106 km2 precipitation systems is 0 71 while those calculated deep inside the precipitation systems could be as low as 0 08 in addition the miss proportion within 10 km from the boundaries of precipitation systems larger than 106 km2 is 0 27 while this value can be close to zero 400 km away from the boundaries one possible reason for the relatively high error probabilities around the precipitation system boundaries might be that a horizonal shift occurs between the satellite derived precipitation systems and real precipitation systems due to the widely existing incident angles of satellite sensors guilloteau et al 2018 in sum these results reveal substantial quality differences in the precipitation system estimates derived from satellite sensors in various positions relative to the precipitation systems and highlight the critical task of solving these hourly occurrence errors especially around the boundaries of precipitation systems when looking at the satellite detectability with regards to precipitation systems of different sizes fig 5 similar phenomena are revealed as those elucidated in figs 2 and 3 however varying regularities are still obtained after considering the distance factor the false alarm proportion generally decreases as the precipitation system size increases near the system boundaries fig 5a but inversely increases when the distance is longer than 60 km if there are available values in these positions this finding indicates the sharper satellite detectability contrasts among different positions in larger systems compared to smaller systems in contrast the miss proportion is higher for relatively large precipitation systems at all distances fig 5b this result is in accordance with fig 4 further corroborating the dependence of the miss probability of imerg on the precipitation system size at a distance of 100 km from the boundaries of a precipitation system the miss proportion for systems larger than 106 km2 can be three times higher than that for 104 105 km2 systems figure s1 reexamine the relationships among false alarm proportions and the sizes of precipitation and the position in the systems after controlling the intensity the still evident relationships exclude the possibility that the bias variations observed under different system related conditions are only the result of intensity differences and suggest their robustness the above analyses provide the probability of satellite errors in each position of the systems however considering that the total numbers of gridboxes at different positions may also vary a lot it is necessary to further know the contribution of the total error cases number at each location to all the error cases related to the precipitation systems thus we could understand the error distribution more comprehensively from fig 6 for example for the false alarm contribution calculated from all derived precipitation systems over 40 of misjudgments occur directly on precipitation system boundaries over 50 of misjudgments occur within 10 km of the boundaries and over 90 of misjudgments occur within 60 km of the boundaries fig 6a similarly the miss rate contribution derived for all the precipitation systems surpasses 50 within 30 km of the system boundaries outside the systems and over 75 within 70 km of the outer system boundaries fig 6b gradually reaching 90 at 140 km when checking in the same position of the systems the false alarm contribution descends but the miss contribution ascends with the larger precipitation system this finding is in accordance with the probability order revealed in fig 5 these results further highlight the importance of quantifying occurrence errors near precipitation system boundaries and emphasize the discrepant features that exist among precipitation systems of different sizes however an important feature that differs from the false alarm and miss proportions revealed in fig 5 and the contributions shown in fig 6 is that a certain false alarm proportion exists near the center of the precipitation systems but the contribution is actually meager on the contrary the miss proportion remains at a very low level at far distances outside the systems but the cumulative proportion cannot be ignored for example for the statistics derived for all precipitation systems the false alarm proportion remains at 30 at locations 100 km from the boundaries inside a precipitation system but the contribution of all the false alarm cases at distances over 100 km within systems is below 5 figs 5 and 7 similarly for all precipitation systems the miss proportion at any location farther than 110 km outside the precipitation system is below 2 4 but the cumulative contribution is still above 16 combining these two results we can have a more comprehensive understanding of the position dependent satellite errors on the one hand for end users who want to examine the storm center features by the satellite product they should be aware that there is a certain chance for precipitation in these positions to be false alarms actually i e neglecting the hole inside the real precipitation systems but for developers who aim at solving as many error cases as possible the total cases near the system center in turn take a very small proportion thus having relatively small importance on the other hand when end users check a dry region far from the imerg derived precipitation systems they could be highly confident that there is no precipitation here in reality as well i e unlikely to have any isolated storm missed however inversely the developers should pay enough attention that the total number of isolated storms in the whole analyzed domain could account for a large proportion which serves as a critical task to be solved in the future 3 2 indicator of the precipitation system area bias in the above analyses we investigated the false alarms and misses inside and outside the precipitation systems separately when further considering these two metrics together a higher false alarm proportion but a lower miss proportion near system boundaries for example could indicate a tendency to overestimate the precipitation system sizes based on this knowledge we treat the difference between the inside false alarm proportion and outside miss proportions in corresponding positions relative to the precipitation system boundaries namely d p as an indicator of the system area bias fig 7 the meaning of this indicator as mentioned above is the expected value of the overestimated or underestimated area of a unit gridbox located in a specific position from the graph fig 7 universally positive differences are revealed indicating a general overestimation of the size of precipitation systems by imerg one possible reason for this result is that satellites observe upper atmosphere clouds from top to bottom while some precipitation especially light precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground this phenomenon is more likely to occur at the edges of precipitation systems thus leading to smaller precipitation ranges in reality than those estimated by satellite sensors ayat et al 2021b cui et al 2020 for the first class relative to the boundaries i e 0 km and 10 0 km from the system boundaries this difference is 0 78 for precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 but 0 44 for systems larger than 106 km2 a similar situation is found for the other positions located near the boundaries of these two precipitation system classes where we believe this indicator is generally more relevant because the rainy situations in locations places are more likely to be related to the precipitation systems these results indicate that the areal overestimation is much more severe for smaller systems than for larger systems notably this indicator only implies the expected areal bias of a single gridbox related to systems and we need to consider the number of peripheral gridboxes of different systems to further calculate the absolute area bias however since the large precipitation systems might naturally have more miss or false gridboxes than the small systems our indicator provides a more comparable way to evaluate the areal bias severities associated with different precipitation systems therefore we further apply this metric to examine the diurnal variation of the precipitation system areal bias fig 8 displays the diurnal cycle of d p for the distance class nearest to the precipitation system boundaries as an example as well as the original false alarm proportion and miss proportion in the corresponding locations from the graph evident diurnal cycles can be seen both for the inside false alarm proportion and outside miss proportion fig 8a and b these cycles mutually lead to an apparent variation in the magnitude precipitation system size overestimations throughout the course of a day fig 8c however each hour the false alarm and miss proportions as well as their differences among precipitation systems of different sizes still maintain similar orders as those shown in figs 4 and 7 indicating the stability of this regularity throughout the day the most obvious finding is the overestimation of precipitation systems in the afternoon compared to other times this result may explain the precipitation frequency overestimations corresponding to this time derived in a previous diurnal variation study li et al 2018 and this contrast is even more evident for relatively large systems another conspicuous phenomenon observed in all three subgraphs is that abrupt drops and increases occur in several specific hours of the day e g drops at 09 00 and 20 00 21 00 local solar time increases at 10 00 11 00 and 22 00 00 00 fig 8c referring to previous studies on diurnal cycles in imerg data freitas et al 2020 li et al 2018 tan et al 2019 these abrupt changes are very likely to be induced by the inhomogeneous data sourced from different sensors onboard the gpm constellation satellites at each hour of the day as a result the diurnal variation signal of the areal bias factor can be decomposed into a consistently positive daily mean value resulting from the systematic overestimation tendency of imerg throughout the day the smooth fluctuations caused by different dominant precipitation systems in different time periods of a day that satellites generally have varying responses and high frequency oscillations at some specific hours resulting from the uneven pmw source proportions and qualities during the day li et al 2018 to examine the influence of the areal bias variations on the precipitation system area itself throughout the course of a day we further display the diurnal cycle of the median precipitation system size where the sampling gridboxes are located in a 50 and compare it with the diurnal cycle of d p for the distance class nearest to the boundaries of precipitation systems of all sizes after the two variables are normalized fig 9 a ideally the diurnal variation in the imerg derived precipitation system size should result from the diurnal variation in the real precipitation system size plus the precipitation system size bias so it is reasonable that the shapes of the two variation curves are not the same however these two curves still show very coincident high frequency oscillations corresponding to the abrupt changes mentioned above this phenomenon suggests that the precipitation system size bias oscillations could significantly affect the shape of the diurnal variation curve itself similarly leading to irregular oscillations in the precipitation system sizes in contrast the difference in the areal bias between the morning and afternoon seems to have less influence on the shape of the area curve because the precipitation system characteristics in the morning and afternoon originally have climatological differences notably we also test d p at varying distances from the system boundaries and obtain very similar curves fig 9b displays the average percentages of the different data sources constituting the imerg product throughout the diurnal cycle compared to fig 9a fig 9b corroborates our judgment of the influence of the data sources on the depiction of the precipitation system area specifically notably small percentages of high quality pmw sources occur from 10 00 11 00 and from 22 00 00 00 with morph or morph ir sources filling their gaps the morph scheme tends to enlarge the precipitation system size as a result of interpolation rajagopal et al 2021 while ir sensors are likely to misjudge the nonprecipitating anvil around the real precipitation systems as rainy areas liu et al 2007 on the other hand the higher percentages of cross track sensor sources at 09 00 and 20 00 21 00 might be related to the drops at these times li et al 2018 these sensors should be less accurate than the conical scanning sensors but serve to offset the systematic overestimations throughout the day ayat et al 2021a huffman et al 2019 these results indicate that substantial influence of data source inhomogeneity on the accuracy of precipitation system sizes throughout the day conversely the consistent oscillations between the imerg derived precipitation system sizes and our bias indicator also denote the reliability of the utilized metric 3 3 precipitation rate bias after investigating the precipitation occurrence biases the precipitation rate bias related to the precipitation system properties is further investigated like figs 4 and 5 fig 10 displays the mean precipitation rate bias determined within the precipitation systems of different sizes when the satellites and gauges simultaneously detect a precipitation occurrence i e hit fig 10a first displays the hit biases for all systems from this graph a region specific bias is revealed and slightly more underestimated valid gridboxes than overestimated valid gridboxes are observed however by categorizing different precipitation systems a widely negative bias is observed for precipitation systems smaller than 103 km2 and 103 104 km2 with negative value percentages above 92 and 93 respectively such a situation can still be observed for 104 105 km2 systems but this bias is less severe the overestimated and underestimated valid gridboxes become comparable for systems larger than 105 km2 this result shows that the precipitation rate bias is also strongly related to the attributes of precipitation systems next the positions relative to the precipitation systems are further considered the mean precipitation rate curves derived from the gauges and imerg are presented as functions of the distance from the system boundaries fig 11 following the error decomposition scheme designed by tian et al 2009 the two remaining parts of precipitation namely the precipitation falsely detected by imerg and gauge measured precipitation missed by imerg are also displayed for analysis regarding the hit precipitation the gauge data generally present a monotonic increase as the distance from the system increases accompanied by an uneven growth rate except near the centers of the precipitation systems 380 km in contrast the relationship between the imerg hit precipitation rate and distance is nonmonotonic the precipitation rate derived from imerg is far lower than that provided by the gauge data near the system boundaries but rapidly rises with increasing distance and ultimately exceeds the gauge derived rate then the imerg precipitation rate peaks at a distance of approximately 100 km and then begins to decline gradually falling to values lower than those indicated by the gauges the imerg precipitation rate rebounds at approximately 300 km but the follow up values never exceed the gauge indicated rate thereafter such varying distributions further lead to the dependence of the precipitation rate error characteristics on the position within the analyzed precipitation system this nonlinear relationship is likely to be related to the complex atmospheric structures inside the precipitation systems e g the presence of different precipitation types i e convective versus stratiform in different positions of a same precipitation system houze 1997 regarding the precipitation systems of different sizes although their maximum distances from the system boundaries may differ they also exhibit similar distributions in their existing positions figs 11b f this feature leads to a negative average bias everywhere in small scale precipitation systems 103 km2 and 103 104 km2 negative biases near the boundaries but positive biases near the centers of medium sized precipitation systems 104 105 km2 the negative average biases both near the centers and boundaries and positive biases in the regions between the centers and boundaries of large precipitation systems 105 106 km2 and 106 km2 this regularity also corresponds to the general underestimation of small precipitation systems shown in fig 10 and the comparative overestimation and underestimation of other precipitation systems discussed throughout the study in addition the curve of the precipitation rates falsely detected by imerg also shows a similar shape as the hit rate but with generally lower rates fig 11 these two parts together depict the essentially nonmonotonic intensity distribution in imerg derived precipitation systems in contrast the miss precipitation rates in the gauge data basically maintain a low level but are still higher than the falsely detected and hit precipitation rates in the imerg product at the system boundaries with a rate above 1 mm h such a moderate precipitation rate for the gauge data near the imerg system boundaries further indicates the boundaries of the real systems might not accord with the boundaries of the imerg systems when looking at the missing and hit proportions of the gauge data near the boundaries together they even show a relatively smooth increasing curve figs 11a e such phenomenon could also be understood as the intensity distribution curve of the real precipitation systems whose boundaries do not coincide with the imerg derived precipitation systems further elucidating the mismatch between the precipitation systems described by these two datasets similar to s1 we also control for the intensity to examine the robustness of precipitation rate bias and the precipitation system related factors figure s2 although a strong intensity dependent bias is revealed the relationships between the precipitation rate bias and the position in a precipitation system still keep robust among different intensity grades 4 discussion because precipitation occurs as discrete events with high spatiotemporal variability evaluating satellite derived precipitation products by treating each pixel independently could largely conceal the important spatial correlation information and obtain limited knowledge on their overall performances beck et al 2019 beck et al 2017 tang et al 2016 therefore an evaluation combining the precipitation system information herein could serve as a useful supplement to previous works for example in our study a general overestimation of precipitation system sizes by satellites is revealed fig 7 indicating an exaggeration of the influence range of the precipitation process by the satellite data compared to a previous related study in which an evident overestimation of the precipitation frequency was found on an hourly scale li et al 2018 our work further explains this phenomenon and can also provide an explanation for the previously confirmed precipitation event duration overestimations li et al 2021 besides since previous studies suggested that hydrological processes in a basin are highly influenced by the scale of the precipitation system gao and fang 2019 nunes et al 2006 ten veldhuis et al 2018 the satellite errors in this aspect remind users to pay attention when using it as hydrological model inputs to our knowledge the few existing evaluations on satellite based precipitation systems all adopted the object to object method ayat et al 2021a ayat et al 2021b cui et al 2020 demaria et al 2011 laverde barajas et al 2020 li et al 2015 li et al 2016 li et al 2020 compared to these methods our new pixel to object method is free from the uncertainties caused by interpolated gauge fields and limited ground radar data ranges and only takes advantage of original gauge data this method is much easier to implement than previously used methods and could be applied to many other regions in the world moreover without a threshold sensitive procedure through which the accordant systems from satellites and reference data are matched li et al 2015 li et al 2016 the geometric relationship between the gauge data and two dimensional object data is evidently stabilized in addition the previously utilized object to object methods naturally focused on the system wide characteristic differences such as the shapes and sizes of precipitation systems li et al 2015 li et al 2016 however our method first verifies the satellite product performance in different positions in the precipitation systems these newly derived error features could then be further linked with the dynamics structures in the analyzed systems to find out the essential error ai et al 2016 tu et al 2021 for example the nonmonotonic and nonlinear relationship derived between the precipitation rate bias and the position in the precipitation systems may correspond to the complex internal structures of precipitation systems specifically for instance precipitation systems in mesoscale convective systems and tropical cyclones usually feature convective precipitation near their centers stratiform precipitation near their boundaries and nonprecipitating clouds e g anvil clouds in the regions surrounding the systems ai et al 2016 tu et al 2021 these different dynamics may have notably different abilities to respond to satellite signals kidd and levizzani 2011 in addition the asymmetry of precipitation system structures may also cause nonmonotonic and nonlinear relationships observed in this work pei and jiang 2018 zhang and xu 2021 therefore the novel findings obtained in this study could further deepen our understanding of satellite based precipitation errors notably while the method outlined herein provides a universal way to evaluate satellite derived precipitation systems by simply applying scattered gauge data without the need for full coverage ground radar data a lack of full areal information is still to some extent unavoidable and places limitations on our method with regards to investigating some other system related characteristics e g dislocation and deformation besides although widely applicable this method should draw more reliable and stable conclusions when a reasonably dense gauge network is available that is because a dense gauge network could not only ensure sufficient sampling gridboxes at different positions of different precipitation systems but also ensure the sampling gridboxes are aggregated by enough individual gauges to achieve a reasonable level of representativeness for comparison with the areal satellite estimates some new findings obtained in this study could provide useful implications for algorithm improvements for example the imerg merging algorithm linearly interpolates two adjacent observed precipitation fields to reconstruct the field at times when direct pmw observations are unavailable i e the morphing procedure huffman et al 2019 in this case if an ongoing precipitation system is morphed with a nonprecipitating area in which precipitation has ceased for a given amount of time the linear interpolation process would easily fill the gaps between the two instances with precipitation system occurrences even if no precipitation or very small precipitation actually occurred at this time thus resulting in an areal overestimation therefore in future algorithms efforts should be made to apply a nonlinear interpolation scheme e g simulating the precipitation intensity evolution curves to fill the gaps instead of simple linear average to mitigate such artificial influences on the resulting precipitation system sizes in addition one reason for the relatively high error probability derived around the system boundaries in this work might be the incident angle of pmw sensors resulting in a parallax shift between the precipitation area detected in the sky by the satellite and the real precipitation system footprint on the ground thus leading to mismatches guilloteau et al 2018 according to this geometric relationship the higher a precipitating cloud is the larger the horizontal shift is therefore compared to large scale precipitation system this factor more obviously impacts small scale convective precipitation systems with deeper vertical development thus contributing to the higher errors an extra geometric correction procedure should be added to precipitation retrieval algorithms in the future although many technical issues need to be overcome to realize it guilloteau et al 2018 besides precipitation from the deep convective systems take longer time to fall from clouds to the ground than the large scale system which may also be a reason for the higher false alarm proportion of small systems 5 conclusions one of the great advantages of satellite precipitation estimates is that they can provide a complete picture of precipitation systems but such precipitation system information is difficult to be validated due to the dispersion of gauges and limited availability of ground radar to solve this issue here we develop a more general method namely the pixel to object method in which discrete gridded gauges are regarded as sampling pixels to evaluate the precipitation system performance of imerg an hourly precipitation dataset constructed from 55 879 awss in china is used to investigate the performance of the imerg precipitation product the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the smaller a satellite derived precipitation system is the higher the false alarm proportion inside the system and the lower the miss proportion outside the system are the median value of false alarm proportion over china can even reach 89 for small precipitation systems 103 km2 the miss and false alarm proportions near precipitation system boundaries are much larger than those far away from the boundaries more than half of the total false alarm cases occurring within 10 km of system boundaries and miss cases occurring within 30 km of system boundaries at the centers of precipitation systems of all sizes false alarms have an occurrence probability above 30 but contribute to 5 of the total false alarm cases far away from the boundaries outside precipitation systems the occurrence probability of a miss is below 2 4 but these misses contribute to over 16 of the total cases all these results confirm the existence of a distinct relationship between the precipitation detection ability of satellites and the attributes of precipitation systems 2 an indicator of the precipitation system areal bias is established as the difference between the false alarm proportion and the miss proportion in corresponding positions near the precipitation system boundaries the indicator denotes that imerg commonly overestimates the size of precipitation systems and these overestimations are more severe for smaller systems than for larger systems for in the afternoon than for in the morning precipitation system areal bias shows sharp increases and decreases in certain hours e g a decrease at 09 00 and an increase at 22 00 00 00 and these variations are consistent with the incorrect diurnal oscillations of the imerg derived precipitation system area itself such phenomenon is likely caused by different data sources in different hours during the day 3 precipitation rates in small scale systems 103 km2 and 103 104 km2 are generally underestimated nationwide while the numbers of underestimated and overestimated valid gridboxes are similar in medium and large precipitation systems 104 km2 small scale systems 103 km2 and 103 104 km2 suffer from negative average biases in all system regions while the biases are negative only near the boundaries and positive near the centers of the medium precipitation systems 104 105 km2 for large precipitation systems 105 106 km2 and 106 km2 the positions near both the system boundaries and centers possess negative biases while the biases in the regions between the centers and boundaries are positive such results indicate the obvious nonmonotonic and nonlinear dependency of the precipitation rate bias on the position within the precipitation system with could be further connected with the complex dynamic structure in the systems the new pixel to object method for the precipitation system performance of satellite products is free from ground radar data therefore it could be further applied in most regions of the world and many other satellite precipitation products even in the model data the dependencies of satellite errors on precipitation system characteristics revealed in this study also suggest the need of adding system related information in the future algorithms for their improvement in follow up works more experiments should be designed with satellite radar data and reanalysis data to investigate the causes of error dependencies on precipitation system features satellite errors could be further investigated by connecting with more geometric features of precipitation systems e g shape orientation and ellipse rate and even spatiotemporal characteristics movement direction and speed moreover in this study we purely categorize precipitation systems by their sizes future works could further differentiate precipitation systems with underlying physics e g convective frontal and tropical cyclones

2866,the validation of satellite soil moisture sm products is challenged by the large scale difference between in situ satellite based measurements in order to tackle the significant spatial scale mismatch this study conducted a multi scale validation of three typical sm products i e smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm over qinghai tibet plateau first a 25 km better performing sm dataset was produced by combining three sm products with the extended triple collocation etc and arithmetic mean method second a 500 m sm dataset was derived from the 25 km sm dataset with a random forest based downscaling model and the high resolution datasets of other variables third the 500 m sm was evaluated using in situ sm measurements which was then aggregated to a coarse pixel scale for the assessment of coarse resolution satellite sm products finally potential factors influencing the accuracy of satellite sm products were investigated the results indicated that the 25 km merged sm product integrated the characteristics of these three sm products during the downscaling process terrain factors ndvi and day and night temperature difference were identified as the key variables to derive high resolution sm which agreed well with in situ measurements over most monitoring networks the multi scale validation results indicate that smap l3 and amsr2 lprm performs best regarding the median values of the correlation and deviation from the pixel scale reference in the spatial domain respectively and smos ic is always the worst however when the pixel based evaluation results were focused amsr2 lprm performs best in most cases followed by smap l3 and smos ic the accuracy of satellite sm products shows more dependence on slope than elevation land cover types and land surface temperature keywords soil moisture satellite products spatial scale mismatch multiscale validation downscaling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture sm involves in the hydrological cycle and energy change akinremi et al 1996 making it a key parameter in climate change research seneviratne et al 2010 agricultural yield estimation holzman et al 2014 and water resources management deng et al 2019 therefore generating globally and spatially continuous distributed sm datasets with high temporal spatial resolutions and high accuracy is imminent in situ measurements can provide accurate soil moisture information but are limited to small areas remote sensing technology has developed rapidly and provided efficient means for mapping soil moisture regionally and globally particularly microwave remote sensing has gradually become one of the essential techniques to estimate global soil moisture due to the advantage of all weather capability coverage and strong penetrability xie et al 2021 the microwave satellite sm products such as smos soil moisture and ocean salinity kerr et al 2012 amsr e advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system njoku et al 2003 amsr2 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 parinussa et al 2015 smap soil moisture active passive entekhabi et al 2010a fy 3b fengyun 3b parinussa et al 2014 ascat advanced scatterometer wagner et al 2013 and esa cci european space agency climate change initiative dorigo et al 2017 play an important role in the study of the global water cycle and its impact on climate change nevertheless due to the limitations of satellite observations and retrieval algorithms sm products are inevitably suffering from errors which hinder their further quantitative application wu et al 2019 therefore it is much needed to comprehensively assess the accuracy of sm products in order to improve their quantity application justice et al 2000 wu et al 2015 in fact there have been many studies on the evaluation of coarse scale satellite sm products through direct comparison with in situ measurements zeng et al 2015 ma et al 2019 al yaari et al 2019 xing et al 2021 xie et al 2021 nevertheless the evaluation results are not consistent both zeng et al 2015 and xing et al 2021 evaluated the performance of amsr2 smos and ascat products the former indicated that amsr2 and smos products usually underestimated and smos suffered from great noise and bias but the latter demonstrated that all ssm products overestimated ground measurements another example is the evaluation of smap ascat and esa cci xing et al 2021 found that esa cci performed best while ali et al 2019 and xie et al 2021 indicated that smap performed best the evaluation of smap smos and esa cci by ma et al 2019 and al yaari et al 2019 showed once again the discrepancy since the former proved the advantage of esa cci while the latter confirmed the advantage of smap and smos products these discrepancies are mainly attributed to the spatial representativeness errors of in situ sites since they usually represent only a small range due to the widely distributed spatial heterogeneity of the earth surface increasing the number of in situ sites within a coarse pixel is expected an effective way to increase the spatial representativeness of in situ measurements yang et al 2013 however installing and managing dense networks are costly and labor intensive which is impractical for validation over large areas a more reasonable way is to introduce high resolution data as a scaling bridge between in situ and coarsepixel satellite observations namely multi scale validation zhang et al 2010b peng et al 2015 specifically the high resolution satellite datas were first evaluated or calibrated using in situ observations then they were aggregated to the moderate low resolution as the reference to validate the target products the multi scale validation can compensate for the great discrepancy caused by spatial scale mismatch between in situ and satellite measurements and has been widely employed for the validation of coarse pixel satellite products over heterogeneous surfaces wu et al 2015 peng et al 2015 and lin et al 2018 have assessed satellite albedo products based on high resolution dataset within the multiscale validation strategy nevertheless this multi scale validation strategy has not been widely employed in sm satellite products due to the difficulties in accessing high resolution sm dataset in order to tackle the spatial scale mismatch between in situ and satellite measurements this study conducts a multi scale validation of sm products over qinghai tibet plateau by generating a high resolution sm dataset to bridge the gap between in situ and satellite observations within the multi scale validation framework three coarse resolution satellite sm products were assessed in terms of their spatial and temporal consistency with the referenced sm at the corresponding pixel scale furthermore based on the pixel by pixel validation results the main factors affecting satellite sm products accuracy were identified the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study areas and experimental datasets the methodology namely the generation and evaluation of high resolution sm dataset and the assessment of satellite sm products is presented in section 3 section 4 provides a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy of sm products and their control factors finally a brief conclusion is given in section 5 2 study area and experimental datasets 2 1 study area the qinghai tibet plateau qtp known as the roof of the world is the largest plateau in the world with an average altitude of more than 4000 m and the most complex terrain it covers the region bounded by 26 n 39 78 n and 73 32 e 101 2 e owing to the complicated and changeable topography the climate over the area varies significantly with different regions which in turn leads to the non uniformly distributed land cover types the dominant land cover type in the south is grassland while the north and northwest qtp are featured by bare soil chen and zhou 2005 the spatial distribution of soil moisture in qtp shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest and there is a strong spatial heterogeneity of sm due to the influence of various external factors such as soil type and vegetation type the strong spatial heterogeneity poses great challenges in the retrieval of satellite sm due to the suitability of model parameters and assumptions therefore it is urgent to comprehensively evaluate satellite sm in order to understand their accuracy over such a special region for more effective application in climate change research as shown in fig 1 multiple soil moisture monitoring networks have been deployed in qtp providing important data sources for the validation of satellite sm products 2 2 experimental data 2 2 1 in situ site observation in situ based soil moisture data were collected from six sm monitoring networks table 1 specifically ali and shiquanhe networks are located in the western part of qtp where the climate type is characterized as cold arid and the elevation varies from 4200 to 4700 m two sites from ali network and six sites from shiquanhe network were used in this study considering the data availability and integrity maqu network is located on the north eastern edge of qtp this region is featured by grassland land cover a cold humid climate and an elevation higher than 3400 m four sites from maqu network were used in this study naqu network is located in the central tibetan plateau with a grassy land cover a cold semiarid climate type and an elevation of about 4500 m two sites from naqu network were employed it is noteworthy that the measured depth from different networks is inconsistent the in situ measurements of the first four monitoring networks provide the values at the depth of 5 cm below the surface by the time step of 15 min these data were downloaded from tibet obs 2009 2019 zhang et al 2021a su et al 2011 zhang et al 2021b covering a 10 year period heihe network is located in the north eastern corner of qtp it consists of 40 observation stations jin et al 2014 kang et al 2017 ge et al 2015 jin and kang 2021 each node provides soil moisture at the depth of 4 cm and 20 cm by the time step of 1 h and some nodes also offer soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm for consistency with the measured depth of other networks the measurements at the depth of 4 cm were selected from ten sites with the consideration of data availability and integrity additionally two sites of the active layer observation stations network zhao et al 2021 were also employed this network is established over the permafrost area of qtp with the aim of providing systematic monitoring of permafrost ground temperature active layer water heat and meteorological factors soil moisture was measured at the depth of 10 cm by the time step of 30 min daily in situ based sm was estimated by averaging these measurements arithmetically 2 2 2 satellite soil moisture products in this study three typical sm products namely smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm were employed due to their wide recognization they were first merged to generate the coarse pixel scale sm dataset which is assumed to represent the real state of sm at the 25 km pixel scale and is independent of any one of these three sm satellite products smos is an esa satellite mission that was specifically designed to provide global observations of soil moisture and ocean salinity it helps to deepen the understanding of the water cycle process between the atmosphere ocean and land and contributes to better weather and extreme climate events forecasting kerr et al 2010 the miras microwave imaging radiometer using aperture synthesis sensor on smos provides multi angular observations at l band 1 4 ghz and the retrieved sm represents the soil moisture value at the depth of 0 3 cm fernandez moran et al 2017 besides smos provides two sm observations at 6 00 ascending and 18 00 descending local solar time in this study the recently released smos ic v2 product was selected since it has been improved in several aspects compared to the previous version such as smos ic v105 the pixels which are flagged as sf 1 were excluded since they were either influenced by strong topography or frozen and contaminated additionally the pixels with tb rmse lower than or equal to 8 k were screened out to remove strong radio frequency interference rfi impacts wigneron et al 2021 in order to generate sm on the daily scale the ascending and descending smos ic sm were averaged as suggested by peng et al 2021 the smap mission was launched in january 2015 to provide global maps of sm it aims to better comprehend how water energy and carbon fluxes maintain the climate and environment entekhabi et al 2010a the smap offers l band 1 41 ghz observations at 18 00 ascending and 6 00 descending local solar times in this study smap l3 v6 product which provides daily soil moisture estimates with the spatial resolution of 36 km was used the condition of retrieval qual flag 0 8 was used to screen out the pixels with steeply sloped topography urban feature permanent snow or ice and dense vegetation o neill et al 2020 the ascending and descending data were also averaged to obtain daily smap l3 sm additionally in order to match the spatial resolution of smos ic sm the smap l3 dataset was resampled into 25 km using the nearest neighbor interpolation the amsr2 instrument aboard the global change observation mission 1st water gcom w1 satellite was launched in may 2012 it offers global precipitation soil moisture water vapor sea ice concentration and ocean wind speed information the amsr2 offers observations at 13 30 ascending and 1 30 descending local solar time here the amsr2 lprm l3 product which was retrieved from x band based on land parameter retrieval model lprm was adopted since the data from x band is usually less affected by rfi njoku et al 2005 in order to ensure the quality of the sm dataset the pixels with temperatures below 273 15 k were screened out the daily amsr2 lprm sm dataset was generated by averaging the ascending and descending data it is noteworthy that the unit of the amsr2 product is different from that of smos and smap the former denotes the degree of saturation of soil moisture while the latter is presented in the volumetric unit m3 m3 teng et al 2018 in order to make them comparable amsr2 lprm sm product was converted to volumetric soil moisture by multiplying the soil porosity the information of soil porosity was acquired from the land data assimilation system dataset reynolds et al 2000 https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas soils in order to avoid the impact of soil frozen or freezing or thawing on soil dielectric constant the thawed period from july to august between 2016 and 2018 was focused on in this study zhang et al 2010a xing et al 2021 2 2 3 auxiliary data the auxiliary data are used to generate the high resolution sm dataset based on the coarse pixel scale sm dataset and on the other hand used for detecting the main control factors affecting the accuracy of satellite sm products the topographic factors zhu and lin 2011 land surface temperature lst wang et al 2007 land surface cover conditions wang et al 2012 albedo and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were introduced since they were believed to be related to sm dem was obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm digital elevation dataset which provides high quality dem data at a nearly global scope with a spatial resolution of 90 m based on the dem information the topographic factors such as slope and aspect were also calculated land cover information was extracted from mcd12q1 with a spatial resolution of 500 m the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp was employed in this study due to its high accuracy and widespread acceptance lst information was acquired from mod11a1 which provides daily daytime lst lst day and nighttime lst lst night with a spatial resolution of 1 km the difference lst difference between the daytime lst and nighttime lst was also calculated to serve as an additional explanatory variable of sm the albedo information was obtained from mcd43a3 v6 which provides daily black sky albedo and white sky albedo with a spatial resolution of 500 m this product is the most widely used and shows a reasonable accuracy wu et al 2018 ndvi data was acquired from mod09ga 006 ndvi through the google earth engine platform the ndvi data was calculated based on the near infrared band and red band of the mod09ga surface reflectance product with a spatial resolution of 500 m these auxiliary data were resampled into 25 km and 500 m respectively the former is used to establish the relationship between the auxiliary variables and the 25 km sm dataset and to explore the potential factors influencing the accuracy of satellite sm products the latter was used to generate a 500 m sm dataset based on this relationship specifically the elevation slope and aspect data were resampled from 90 m to 500 m and 25 km with the mean aggregation method the land cover data was resampled from 500 m to 25 km using the majority resampling method the lst data were resampled from 1 km to 500 m with the nearest neighbor resampling method and upscaled to 25 km with the mean aggregation method the 500 m albedo and ndvi data were upscaled to 25 km using the mean aggregation method although the auxiliary datasets inevitably suffer from errors due to the original satellite observation errors or the limitations of the retrieval algorithms the effect of such errors can be reduced in the resampling process because the errors in fine pixel scales are balanced out when they are aggregated into a coarse resolution bradley et al 2007 hence the relationship between the target variable and auxiliary variables can be accurately simulated and is not dependent on the absolute accuracy of the auxiliary data 3 methodology this study aims to comprehensively assess coarse scale sm products pixel by pixel within a multiscale validation framework in order to achieve this goal there are three key steps as shown in fig 2 1 a better performing coarse pixel scale sm dataset was generated by merging the smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm with etc and the arithmetic mean method 2 the coarse resolution sm dataset was downscaled to 500 m based on the auxiliary datasets as well as the random forest algorithm in this way the high resolution sm dataset was generated 3 the high resolution sm dataset was compared to in situ measurements and was then aggregated to the coarse pixel for the validation of three original satellite sm products furthermore the main influence factors of the accuracy of sm satellite products were explored 3 1 the generation of coarse resolution sm datasets satellite provides a practical way to monitor sm at a large pixel scale nevertheless satellite products may underestimate or overestimate sm to a certain degree due to the limitations of satellite observations and retrieval algorithms in order to make the best of the information provided by different satellite products from a mutual compensation perspective the daily smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products were merged to generate a better performing coarse pixel sm dataset given the fact that these three products are based on different satellite sensors and retrieval algorithms they suffer from different degrees of errors and can be assumed to be independent during the merging process what needs to be thought about is how to evaluate the uncertainty of each dataset and assign different weight coefficients to them based on the calculated random error for each dataset since the absolute truth at the coarse pixel scale is unattainable zhang et al 2010b the triple collocation tc method can be introduced to estimate the errors of satellite products stoffelen 1998 the recently developed extended triple collocation etc technique is mathematically equivalent to tc but overcomes the deficiency of merely estimating rmse in using tc mccoll et al 2014 hence it was employed to merge the three sm datasets following the ideas of yilmaz et al 2012 etc technique assumes that there is a linear relationship between observed values and truth the error model can be expressed as eq 1 x i a i b i t ε i i 1 2 3 where x i and t represent the satellite sm product and the corresponding truth respectively a i and b i denote the regression coefficients between the i th sm product and the corresponding truth and ε i is the corresponding random error by assuming that the mathematic expectation of ε i is 0 the variance of ε i is constant and the covariance between ε i and ε j is equal to 0 when i j the random error of the three sm products can be calculated using eq 2 2 ε i c 11 c 12 c 13 c 23 c 22 c 12 c 23 c 13 c 33 c 13 c 23 c 12 where c ij denotes the covariance between the sm products x i and x j eq 3 3 c ij c o v x i x j e x i x j e x i e x j where cov indicates the covariance between two different products and e represents the mathematical expectation then the weight coefficient w i for each satellite product can be calculated from the random error obtained from etc gruber et al 2017 4 w i t c 1 i 1 i t c 1 where w is the weight coefficient vector w 1 w 2 w 3 t i is the unit vector 1 1 1 t and c represents the error covariance matrix 5 c ε 1 2 0 0 0 ε 2 2 0 0 0 ε 3 2 finally the three products were combined linealy to generate the merged product using the weight coefficiens 6 x new w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w 3 x 3 where x new means the merged coarse resolution product it is noteworthy that in the process of data fusion with the etc method the sample size may be too small to meet the assumptions of etc or the assumption premise of etc cannot be satisfied resulting in negative ε i 2 to reduce such an impact the arithmetic mean method will be used to fuse the three products since the average values may be closer to the true value of sm ma and liang 2022 additionally when only two products are available the arithmetic mean method will also be utilized to merge them although this treatment may bring some uncertainty to the final result when both of them are overestimated or underestimated this is the best tradeoff between the spatial coverage of the merged product and its quality peng et al 2021 particularly if only one product is available the fusion value is set as the corresponding product value it is noteworthy that although the merged sm dataset is believed to be more accurate than each of the three satellite sm products it cannot be directly used as the reference value on the coarse pixel scale because its accuracy cannot be evaluated against in situ measurements due to the large spatial scale mismatch between them a reasonable way is to downscale it into a relatively high spatial resolution to narrow the gap of their spatial scale 3 2 the generation of high resolution sm through downscaling the high resolution sm dataset functions as the bridge between in situ and satellite based measurements in this study the high resolution sm dataset was derived from the merged sm product using the machine learning based model and ancillary datasets the random forest rf algorithm was selected since it had been widely used in remote sensing domains and proved to be efficient and robust ke et al 2016 im et al 2016 it is an ensemble of large sets of carts classification and regression trees breiman 2001 each tree is established using a random subset of training data selected by the bootstrap sampling method and the averaging of outputs from all trees was used in order to smooth the fluctuations between different trees and yield more accurate prediction results moreover rf also calculates the out of bag oob error of each input variable based on the data samples that are not selected in the training dataset in this way the relative importance of the ancillary variables can be identified eq 7 7 mse oob i 1 n e 2 i e 1 i n where mse oob indicates the importance of the variable e 1 i means the oob error of the model on the i th tree e 2 i represents the oob error of the model on the i th tree after randomly adding noise to the sample n is the number of the total trees in the model larger mse oob means greater importance of the variable in the prediction of the target parameter zhang et al 2018 the rf model was implemented in r program software with the randomforest package the two key parameters i e mtry the number of random features and ntree the number of trees need to be tuned during the model training process in order to achieve better prediction the basic idea of the downscaling methodology is modeling the relationship between the merged sm product and the auxiliary variables including elevation slope aspect ndvi lst day lst night lst difference land cover albedo wsa and albedo bsa at the spatial resolution of 25 km using rf then the trained model was applied to the 500 m auxiliary dataset to generate the high resolution sm dataset this process is described in detail as follows 1 the auxiliary variables were presented in a numerical manner and the numerical ranges of different variables were quite different considering the impact of different magnitude of surface variables on the sample distribution a standardization was implemented the z score normalization method was adopted to normalize the data in this study eq 8 zhang et al 2014 it uses the mean and standard deviation of the original data to rescale their data ranges 8 x x μ σ where x is the normalized data x is the original data μ is the averaged value and σ is the standard deviation of the original data 2 in the process of model training the auxiliary variables function as independent variables and the merged sm functions as the dependent variable the processed dataset was divided into a training dataset and a test dataset 70 and 30 of the data respectively the rf based model was built with the training dataset on the 25 km scale and the accuracy of the training model was assessed with the test dataset 3 once the model was determined the 500 m auxiliary datasets were inputted to the established model to generate a high resolution sm product it is important to note that we have made a common assumption that the trained model has applicability across different spatial scales during this process which has been proved to be reasonable by wang et al 2022 3 3 the multi scale validation of coarse scale soil moisture in order to enhance the reliability of validation results the high resolution sm dataset was assessed through the comparison with in situ sm measurements it is important to note that the merged sm product represents the sm at the sampling depth of 0 5 cm while the sampling depths of in situ stations are either 4 cm 5 cm or 10 cm here unbiased rmse ubrmse was used as the accuracy indicator because it is less affected by depth mismatch between in situ and satellite estimates than bias xing et al 2021 and is not impacted by deviations of in situ data from the absolute truth entekhabi et al 2010b other indicators such as slope correlation coefficient r and mean bias bias were also introduced to check the performance of satellite products from a different perspective 9 s l o p e i 1 n p i p r i r i 1 n p i p 2 10 r p i p r i r i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n r i r 2 11 b i a s i 1 n p i r i n 12 r m s e i 1 n p i r i 2 n 13 u b r m s e r m s e 2 b i a s 2 where p i and r i denote the products needed to be evaluated and the reference data respectively and p and r are their averaged value respectively n is the number of the total samples since the high resolution sm dataset has been evaluated using in situ measurements it was aggregated to the 25 km pixel scale to conduct the multiscale validation of daily smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products the validation was conducted from two aspects first all pixels over qtp were combined together for validation on the daily basis resulting in accuracy indicators for each day during the study period second the sm time series of the satellite and the reference were compared resulting in accuracy indicators for each pixel in this way the main influence factors i e land surface temperature land cover type elevation and slope of the accuracy of satellite sm can be identified by checking the variation of ubrmse with these factors 4 results and discussion 4 1 downscaled soil moisture fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of sm indicated by the smos ic smap l3 amsr2 lprm coarse resolution merged dataset and downscaled high resolution sm products over qtp respectively from fig 3 a c it can be seen that the three satellite products almost present a similar spatial distribution pattern of sm which is relatively higher in the south of qtp and lower in the north of qtp the zonal distribution characteristic of sm is obvious tending to decrease with the increase of latitude however these three satellite products present different features regarding the distribution of empty pixels smos ic suffers from the largest degree of missing data followed by smap l3 and amsr2 lprm compared to smos ic and amsr2 lprm smap l3 is generally lower in the northeast of qtp after the fusion of the three products the spatial coverage of the merged dataset is significantly improved fig 4 d the distribution of non null pixels of this dataset is similar to that of amsr2 lprm this is reasonable since amsr2 lprm owns the largest data coverage by comparing the merged product with smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm fig 3 a c it was found that the merged sm product integrates the characteristics of the three original products but it is most similar to the spatial distribution pattern and dynamic range of amsr2 lprm revealing wetter soil in the south than north the high resolution sm data derived with the rf based downscaling model and independent variables over qtp covered a limited area of qtp as shown in fig 3 e this is because the auxiliary data such as lst and ndvi do not completely cover qtp after data quality control but it can be seen that the downscaled results show consistency with the coarse resolution merged dataset regarding the spatial distribution with values less than 0 3 m3 m3 in the north of qtp the performance of the rf based downscaling model has been assessed using the test dataset and results show that the established downscaling model is reliable to obtain qualified high resolution data with the high r of 0 86 and small ubrmse of 0 039 m3 m3 to further explore the role of independent variables in predicting sm the increase in mse mean square error provided by rf is used as the indicator of the relative importance of each variable among the ten input parameters slope aspect elevation and ndvi were proved to be more important than the others fig 4 the terrain factors predominate sm prediction this is reasonable since the topography of qtp exhibits large spatial variations therefore the complex terrain of qtp plays a key role during the model training process ndvi is also a critical element for sm estimation this can be explained by the fact that most areas of qtp are featured with vegetation fig 1 besides the research period is summer when vegetation is dense which has a significant impact on soil moisture the land surface temperature is also a key control factor of sm from fig 4 it can be seen that sm shows different sensitivities to lst day lst night and lst difference with the largest sensitivity to lst difference and smallest sensitivity to lst day one possible reason is that the change of sm can be reflected by ati apparent thermal inertia which is significantly correlated with lst difference song et al 2021 by contrast the sensitivity of sm to lst day is lower than lst night it can be explained that the lst product mod11a1 used in this study represents the lst at 10 30 am and 10 30 pm respectively and lst at 10 30 am is usually in a period of rapid rise while the variation of lst at night is usually more stable and the coarse resolution merged sm dataset represents the variation of sm within one day so sm shows a stronger relationship with the lst night rather than lst day the influence of albedo and land cover type on sm is not as large as terrain factors and ndvi this may be attributed to the significant influence of the complex terrain of qtp 4 2 the accuracy of high resolution soil moisture the in situ sm measurements from the six monitoring networks were utilized to evaluate the downscaled sm dataset fig 5 the downscaled sm shows the largest consistency with in situ measurements at ali with the highest r of 0 831 the activelayer naqu and heihe follow with r of 0 603 0 640 and 0 492 respectively the worst consistency occurs at maqu and shiquanhe with the lowest r of 0 489 and 0 441 respectively nevertheless when it comes to the discrepancy between the downscaled sm and in situ measurements the best result still occurs at ali with an ubrmse value of 0 01 m3 m3 followed by naqu and shiquanhe with the ubrmse of 0 029 m3 m3 and 0 043 m3 m3 respectively the poorest performance was presented at heihe activelyaer and maqu with ubrmse values of 0 056 m3 m3 0 060 m3 m3 and 0 074 m3 m3 respectively in general the accuracy of the downscaled sm varies from site to site and its performance does not meet the accuracy requirement over some sites for example the variations of sm indicated by in situ measurements cannot be captured by downscaled sm at shiquanhe and maqu as shown in fig 5 this phenomenon can be explained from four aspects 1 the random forest algorithm averages the results of all regression trees to obtain the final prediction value which may limit the dynamic range of the target variable 2 soil moisture is affected by various factors such as temperature vegetation and soil texture chen et al 2012 wu et al 2020 resulting in strong spatial heterogeneity of sm consequently in situ sm measurements can only represent the limited area around the station which is much smaller than the 500 m downscaled sm 3 the penetration depths of in situ measurements and downscaled sm are inconsistent sm measured by ali naqu shiquanhe and maqu represents the value at 5 cm below the land surface heihe observation network measures sm at the depth of 4 cm the activelayer network measures sm at the depth of 10 cm while the downscaled sm is an averaged value of sm ranging from 0 cm to 5 cm 4 the downscaled sm suffers from uncertainty because of the errors in the merged coarse pixel sm dataset auxiliary satellite products and the downscaling model itself it is important to note that although the errors in high resolution sm are not small enough to be ignored these errors can be further reduced when the high resolution sm is aggregated to the coarse resolution 4 3 pixel based evaluation results of coarse pixel sm products the high resolution of downscaled sm can reveal the spatial variation characteristics within the 25 km pixel scale and bridge the gap between in situ and coarse pixel satellite sm observations although the errors of downscaled sm cannot be ignored at some sites they can be reduced in the aggregation process to the 25 km pixel scale therefore the downscaled sm is more appropriate to be used as the reference to assess the accuracy of coarse pixel satellite sm products than the single point in situ measurements fig 6 illustrates the assessment results of the three satellite sm products over qtp in order to make a comparison with previous validation study based on in situ measurements xing et al 2021 the median values of r ubrmse bias and slope are first used to indicate the accuracy of smos ic amsr2 lprm and smap l3 from fig 6 a it can be seen that smap l3 shows a better consistency with the coarse pixel scale reference than smos ic and amsr2 lprm with the highest r of 0 656 followed by the amsr2 lprm and smos ic with the r of 0 555 and 0 492 respectively when it comes to ubrmse amsr2 lprm presents the best accuracy with the smallest value of 0 047 m3 m3 fig 6 b smap l3 shows a slightly higher ubrmse of 0 053 m3 m3 and smos ic shows the worst accuracy with the largest ubrmse of 0 065 m3 m3 the slope indicates the ability of three sm products to capture the temporal dynamic characteristics of sm fig 6 d it shows that smos ic presents the best performance with slope of 1 027 the smap l3 follows with a slightly larger slope of 1 171 and amsr2 lprm ranks last with the smallest slope of 0 715 fig 6 c shows that smap l3 overestimates sm with the bias of 0 013 m3 m3 while smos ic and amsr2 lprm underestimate sm with the bias of 0 016 m3 m3 and 0 030 m3 m3 respectively in general smap l3 performed best in terms of consistency with pixel scale reference over qtp amsr2 lprm presents the best result in terms of deviation from relative truth and smos ic always presents the worst performance regarding the consistency and accuracy nevertheless it should be pointed out that fig 6 only presents the median values of these four statistical indicators therefore the results may not represent the overall accuracy of these three sm products compared to the previous validation study over qtp by xing et al 2021 there was a considerable discrepancy between the two validation results first xing et al 2021 concluded that smos ic performed best followed by smap l3 and amsr2 lprm which is opposite to our results second the standard deviations of the median values of these four indicators were more concentrated than that of xing et al 2021 the discrepancies can be explained from the following aspects first the validation results by xing et al 2021 are based on the direct comparison between in situ and coarse pixel satellite observations where the results inevitably suffer from great representativeness errors caused by the large spatial scale mismatch between them and wide spatial heterogeneity our results however are based on the aggregated high resolution sm although the high resolution sm also contains a certain degree of uncertainty caused by the errors of high resolution dataset as well as the geo location mismatch between coarse pixel satellite products and aggregated high resolution datasets this multiscale validation eases the severity of the scale problem over heterogeneous surfaces and has been widely adopted in the validation of coarse pixel satellite products especially over heterogeneous surfaces second the result of xing et al 2021 was derived from limited soil moisture monitoring stations while our results were based on all pixels within the whole study area to strengthen the representativeness and universality of them moreover inconsistent results were also presented through the comparison with liu et al 2019 which concluded that smap l3 performed the best amsr2 lprm overestimated sm and smos ic underestimated sm these discrepancies can be attributed to the fact that although the in situ measurements from network observations were averaged to compare with the satellite products in liu et al 2019 the scale mismatch issue may be not thoroughly solved unless these in situ sites can fully capture the spatiotemporal variations of sm within the 25 km pixel which will introduce uncertainty to the validation results in order to explore the performance of satellite sm products in high detail for a wide range of conditions their accuracies were assessed on a pixel basis fig 7 here we only present the results of ubrmse for conciseness since it is less affected by depth mismatch of sm it can be seen that the ubrmses of these three sm products are mainly ranging from 0 m3 m3 to 0 1 m3 m3 smos ic presents larger ubrmse than that of the other two products moreover the spatial distribution of its ubrmse is heterogeneous with larger ubrmse 0 06 m3 m3 0 1 m3 m3 in the east of qtp similarly smap l3 also shows relatively larger ubrmse over the eastern area fig 7 b but the ubrmse in other regions is basically smaller than 0 05 m3 m3 when it comes to the ubrmse of amsr2 lprm obvious regional characteristics can be observed as shown in fig 7 c larger ubrmse occurs in the east southeast and northwest marginal areas of qtp with values of about 0 08 m3 m3 but most areas of qtp show relatively small ubrmse of less than 0 04 m3 m3 given the strong spatial heterogeneity of ubrmse it is necessary to discover the influence factors on the accuracy of satellite sm products fig 8 presents the variation of ubrmse with elevation slope land cover types lst day lst night and lst difference in order to explore their influence on the accuracy of satellite sm products as shown in fig 8 a the ubrmse of smos ic and smap l3 first increases with elevation and reaches the peak within the region of 3000 4000 m with the further increase of elevation ubrmse shows a slight downward trend amsr2 lprm presents a similar variation trend with an exception within the region of 2000 3000 m where the ubrmse is smaller than that of 0 2000 m the lowest accuracy of satellite sm products occurs in the area of 3000 4000 m where there is a drastic elevation variation bai et al 2015 which is not conducive to sm retrieval with the further increase of elevation 4000 m the ubrmse of satellite products decreases this can be explained by the small value of slope in the middle and southwest of qtp bai et al 2015 where the terrain is relatively flat which is conducive to the retrieval of sm from fig 8 a it can be found that amsr2 lprm always performed the best followed by the smap l3 and smos ic regardless of the elevation zone over lower and medium height regions 0 2000 m the overall error of the three products is relatively low and concentrated which is mainly distributed below 0 025 m3 m3 over the elevation region of 2000 3000 m there is a significant decrease in the accuracy of smos ic and smap l3 with most ubrmses distributed between 0 025 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 by contrast there is an increase of the accuracy in amsr2 lprm this indicates that the accuracy of satellite sm products is not merely influenced by elevation as the elevation increases to 3000 4000 m the ubrmse of more than half of the pixels exceeds 0 025 m3 m3 for these three sm products particularly the maximum ubrmse for smos ic exceeds 0 125 m3 m3 it is obvious that the spatial distribution of the errors of these three sm products is more heterogeneous in this region given the larger height of the boxplots with the further increase in elevation the ubrmse of all the three products shows a slight decrease and is mainly distributed between 0 025 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 in the range of 4000 5000 m and 5000 6000 m except for amsr2 lprm for which the ubrmse is mainly lower than 0 025 m3 m3 in the range of 5000 6000 m regarding the effect of slope fig 8 b the accuracy of these three satellite sm products presents different responses to slope the ubrmses of smos ic and amsr2 lprm show strong positive responses to slope their ubrmses are mainly distributed below 0 05 m3 m3 within the slope range of 0 5 and 5 15 a slight increase can be observed in the slope range of 15 25 and 25 35 with the values distributed between 0 025 m3 m3 0 075 m3 m3 with the further steepness of the terrain with slope larger than 35 their ubrmse increases significantly with most values exceeding 0 075 m3 m3 for amsr2 lprm this phenomenon is understandable since complex terrain makes it difficult to predict high precision sm by contrast the accuracy of smap l3 does not monotonically increase with slope instead the accuracy variation trend of smap l3 with slope is consistent with that of the elevation specifically the ubrmses increase with the increase of slope at first and reach the peak in the slope range of 15 25 and then show a slight downward trend with the further increase of slope but most of the ubrmses are stable and distributed below 0 05 m3 m3 regardless of the slope range indicating that slope is not the primary control factor of the accuracy of smap l3 the effect of land cover types on the accuracy of the three sm products is clearly shown in fig 8 c it can be seen that the accuracy of satellite sm fluctuates greatly with the land cover types in terms of smos ic the best accuracy occurs in bar with most of the values smaller than 0 05 m3 m3 and the worst accuracy appears in w sav indicated by the discrete distribution and large value of ubrmses which exceed 0 05 m3 m3 in most cases similarly the accuracy of amsr2 lprm is also higher at bar indicated by the small ubrmse less than0 025 m3 m3 and is poor in mf and w sav indicated by the large ubrmse 0 075 m3 m3 compared to smos ic and amsr2 lprm the accuracy of smap l3 presents a smaller extent of fluctuations with land cover types which is mainly distributed between 0 025 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 similar to smos ic the performance of smap l3 is also the best in bar but the worst in urb the best performance over bar for the three sm products can be attributed to the relatively smaller surface heterogeneity of the barren than other land cover types moreover the barren area is mainly distributed in the north and northwest of qtp where the slope value is low the poor performance over w sav for smos ic and amsr2 lprm may be caused by the strong surface heterogeneity since w sav is a mixed land type of herbaceous understory systems and forest canopy it should be noted that over the grasslands which are relatively homogeneous the accuracy of the three sm products does not fulfill the expectations it is especially true for smos ic this can be explained by the fact that the grasslands in the east and southeast regions are accompanied by steep terrain and that the impact of topography on the accuracy of satellite sm products is greater than that of land cover types this agrees well with the results in fig 4 which indicates that terrain factors play a dominant role in soil moisture retrieval therefore it can be concluded that the performance of the sm products over different land cover types is related to slope and surface heterogeneity as shown in fig 8 d smos ic always presents the largest ubrmse in different lst day levels indicating again its worst performance in different daily temperatures an exception can be found in the level of 270 280 k where there are so few pixels that the results may be not representative by contrast the amsr2 lprm shows the smallest ubrmse in different levels of lst day demonstrating that it performs the best in different daily temperatures the accuracy of smap l3 is somewhere in between regarding the stability of the accuracy of satellite sm products in different daily temperatures amsr2 lprm shows the most stable behavior given the centralized distribution of its boxplots followed by smap l3 and smos ic ranks last when it comes to the effect of daily temperatures on the accuracy of satellite sm higher ubrmse tends to occur when daily temperatures are less than 300 k and smaller ubrmse tends to appear when daily temperatures are larger than 310 k the higher accuracy of satellite sm products in the areas with relatively high temperature can be explained by the fact that these areas are located in the north and northern edge of qtp where the topography is flat resulting in the improvement of product accuracy the influence of night temperature on the accuracy of satellite sm seems to be different from that of daily temperature given the fact that the larger ubrmse of smos ic and smap l3 appears in the region with 270 280 k or larger than 290 k fig 8 e moreover the stability of their accuracy is not good in these regions given the wide distribution of their boxplots by contrast the accuracy of amsr2 lprm tends to increase with the night temperature the different responses of the accuracy of satellite sm products to nigh temperature can be explained by the fact that the accuracy of satellite sm products is jointly affected by many factors it is noteworthy that the smap l3 presents a smaller ubrmse than amsr2 lprm in the region of 260 270 k which is different from the results in other regions in general smos ic shows the worst accuracy in different night temperatures followed by smap l3 and amsr2 lprm performs best the accuracy of satellite sm products shows a strong dependence on the lst difference fig 8 f given that the ubrmse decrease monotonically with the increase of lst difference in particular the ubrmse of smos ic smap l3 is around 0 025 m3 m3 and the ubrmse of amsr2 lprm is basically smaller than 0 025 m3 m3 when the temperature difference is greater than 30 k from the results above it can be concluded that the accuracy of smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products over qtp is closely related to elevation slope land cover types and land surface temperature in general the accuracies decrease with the increase of slope and the negative influence of terrain is more significant than other factors especially over areas with complicated topography moreover based on the results of fig 6 it can be seen that smap l3 and amsr2 lprm perform best regarding the correlation and deviation from the pixel scale reference in the spatial domain and smos ic is always the worst while the pixel based validation results indicate that amsr2 lprm performs best followed by smap l3 and smos ic ranks last the slight discrepancy between the two validation results is understandable since the evaluation methods are focused on different perspectives one is from the temporal domain while the other is from the spatial domain it should be pointed out that the results based on the median error metrics may not represent the overall accuracy of these three sm products because the extreme values of the statistical indicators are ignored by contrast the pixel based assessment result is more comprehensive and in depth since it considers different conditions over the whole qtp 5 conclusions to enable the effective application of satellite sm products in investigating the land atmosphere interactions it is urgent to comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of sm products although lots of studies had been conducted to assess the performance of various satellite sm products most of them merely conduct the direct in situ satellite comparison due to the lack of high resolution sm datasets consequently the evaluation results suffer from large uncertainties due to the large scale mismatch between in situ and satellite measurements in response to this challenge we take the scale difference between in situ measurements and satellite sm products into full consideration and generate the high resolution sm data as the scaling bridge between in situ and satellite measurements in order to assess coarse pixel sm products specifically we first obtain theoretically better performing sm estimates on the coarse pixel scale by integrating the daily smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products with etc and the arithmetic mean method then the high resolution sm datasets were generated by downscaling the merged sm dataset with the random forest based model and were then evaluated with in situ sm measurements and aggregated into a coarse pixel scale as the reference for evaluation at last three widely used satellite products including smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products were evaluated from two different perspectives furthermore the influence factors on the accuracy of satellite sm products were explored the coarse resolution merged sm dataset has integrated the characteristics of the daily smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products it reveals that the sm of qtp presents a distinct zonal distribution feature decreasing with the increase of latitude the high resolution sm dataset based on rf based downscaling model reveals more elaborate spatial variation information of sm through the comparison with in situ sm measurements from six sm monitoring networks it has been proved that the accuracy of the high resolution dataset is reasonable to be used as the scaling bridge between in situ measurements and satellite products therefore the machine learning algorithm based downscaling method provides an efficient way to generate high resolution sm dataset over heterogeneous surfaces nevertheless it should be noted that the performance of this method is affected by the quality of the coarse resolution merged sm dataset the inclusion of key variables related to sm as well as the quality of their datasets and the amount of training data the terrain factors ndvi and lst difference have been identified as the more important variables in predicting sm over qtp regarding the accuracy of the three sm products the results in the spatial domain indicate that smap l3 and amsr2 lprm perform best regarding the correlation and deviation from the pixel scale reference with the highest r of 0 656 and the smallest ubrmse of 0 047 m3 m3 respectively while the smos ic is always the worst with the largest ubrmse of 0 065 m3 m3 and the smallest r of 0 492 when it comes to the pixel by pixel validation the ubrmses of these three sm products range from 0 m3 m3 to 0 1 m3 m3 smos ic presents larger ubrmse than smap l3 and amsr2 lprm besides the spatial distribution of ubrmse of these three sm products is different smos ic presents the largest spatial heterogeneity by contrast smap l3 shows relatively larger ubrmse over eastern qtp and amsr2 lprm shows lower accuracy over the east southeast and northwest marginal areas of qtp it is noteworthy that our validation results disagree with the conclusion by xing et al 2021 which concludes that smos ic performs best followed by smap l3 and amsr2 lprm the discrepancy between these studies indicates that dealing with the spatial scale mismatch between in situ measurements and coarse resolution satellite sm products is urgently required in the validation over such a heterogeneous surface furthermore an appropriate evaluation approach is also important to fully understand the performance of coarse resolution satellite sm products the accuracy of satellite sm products is closely related to elevation slope land cover types and land surface temperature and the influence of terrain is more significant than other factors specifically the lowest accuracy of the three sm products occurs in the region 3000 4000 m where elevation variation is drastic slope also plays a dominant role in the accuracy of smos ic and amsr2 lprm which monotonically decreases with the increase of slope but this is not the case with smap l3 the best accuracy of these three sm products occurs at bar in fact the effect of land cover type on the accuracy of satellite sm products is related to slope and surface heterogeneity when it comes to the effect of temperature the lst difference has a decisive influence on the accuracy of satellite sm products since their ubrmse decreases monotonically with the increase of lst difference this study presents the first assessment of three coarse scale sm products within the multi scale validation framework over qtp the comprehensive validation results on the pixel basis not only enable a full understanding of the performance of the three sm products but also support the clarification of the influence factors on the accuracy of satellite sm products nevertheless although the utilization of high resolution datasets can solve the spatial scale problem over heterogeneous surfaces uncertainties are also introduced because of the complicated process such as the generation of coarse pixel sm datasets and high resolution sm datasets as well as the geometric mismatching between them further efforts should be made to evaluate the reliability of this method as more data become available credit authorship contribution statement jingping wang software data curation writing original draft xiaodan wu conceptualization methodology

2866,the validation of satellite soil moisture sm products is challenged by the large scale difference between in situ satellite based measurements in order to tackle the significant spatial scale mismatch this study conducted a multi scale validation of three typical sm products i e smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm over qinghai tibet plateau first a 25 km better performing sm dataset was produced by combining three sm products with the extended triple collocation etc and arithmetic mean method second a 500 m sm dataset was derived from the 25 km sm dataset with a random forest based downscaling model and the high resolution datasets of other variables third the 500 m sm was evaluated using in situ sm measurements which was then aggregated to a coarse pixel scale for the assessment of coarse resolution satellite sm products finally potential factors influencing the accuracy of satellite sm products were investigated the results indicated that the 25 km merged sm product integrated the characteristics of these three sm products during the downscaling process terrain factors ndvi and day and night temperature difference were identified as the key variables to derive high resolution sm which agreed well with in situ measurements over most monitoring networks the multi scale validation results indicate that smap l3 and amsr2 lprm performs best regarding the median values of the correlation and deviation from the pixel scale reference in the spatial domain respectively and smos ic is always the worst however when the pixel based evaluation results were focused amsr2 lprm performs best in most cases followed by smap l3 and smos ic the accuracy of satellite sm products shows more dependence on slope than elevation land cover types and land surface temperature keywords soil moisture satellite products spatial scale mismatch multiscale validation downscaling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture sm involves in the hydrological cycle and energy change akinremi et al 1996 making it a key parameter in climate change research seneviratne et al 2010 agricultural yield estimation holzman et al 2014 and water resources management deng et al 2019 therefore generating globally and spatially continuous distributed sm datasets with high temporal spatial resolutions and high accuracy is imminent in situ measurements can provide accurate soil moisture information but are limited to small areas remote sensing technology has developed rapidly and provided efficient means for mapping soil moisture regionally and globally particularly microwave remote sensing has gradually become one of the essential techniques to estimate global soil moisture due to the advantage of all weather capability coverage and strong penetrability xie et al 2021 the microwave satellite sm products such as smos soil moisture and ocean salinity kerr et al 2012 amsr e advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system njoku et al 2003 amsr2 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 parinussa et al 2015 smap soil moisture active passive entekhabi et al 2010a fy 3b fengyun 3b parinussa et al 2014 ascat advanced scatterometer wagner et al 2013 and esa cci european space agency climate change initiative dorigo et al 2017 play an important role in the study of the global water cycle and its impact on climate change nevertheless due to the limitations of satellite observations and retrieval algorithms sm products are inevitably suffering from errors which hinder their further quantitative application wu et al 2019 therefore it is much needed to comprehensively assess the accuracy of sm products in order to improve their quantity application justice et al 2000 wu et al 2015 in fact there have been many studies on the evaluation of coarse scale satellite sm products through direct comparison with in situ measurements zeng et al 2015 ma et al 2019 al yaari et al 2019 xing et al 2021 xie et al 2021 nevertheless the evaluation results are not consistent both zeng et al 2015 and xing et al 2021 evaluated the performance of amsr2 smos and ascat products the former indicated that amsr2 and smos products usually underestimated and smos suffered from great noise and bias but the latter demonstrated that all ssm products overestimated ground measurements another example is the evaluation of smap ascat and esa cci xing et al 2021 found that esa cci performed best while ali et al 2019 and xie et al 2021 indicated that smap performed best the evaluation of smap smos and esa cci by ma et al 2019 and al yaari et al 2019 showed once again the discrepancy since the former proved the advantage of esa cci while the latter confirmed the advantage of smap and smos products these discrepancies are mainly attributed to the spatial representativeness errors of in situ sites since they usually represent only a small range due to the widely distributed spatial heterogeneity of the earth surface increasing the number of in situ sites within a coarse pixel is expected an effective way to increase the spatial representativeness of in situ measurements yang et al 2013 however installing and managing dense networks are costly and labor intensive which is impractical for validation over large areas a more reasonable way is to introduce high resolution data as a scaling bridge between in situ and coarsepixel satellite observations namely multi scale validation zhang et al 2010b peng et al 2015 specifically the high resolution satellite datas were first evaluated or calibrated using in situ observations then they were aggregated to the moderate low resolution as the reference to validate the target products the multi scale validation can compensate for the great discrepancy caused by spatial scale mismatch between in situ and satellite measurements and has been widely employed for the validation of coarse pixel satellite products over heterogeneous surfaces wu et al 2015 peng et al 2015 and lin et al 2018 have assessed satellite albedo products based on high resolution dataset within the multiscale validation strategy nevertheless this multi scale validation strategy has not been widely employed in sm satellite products due to the difficulties in accessing high resolution sm dataset in order to tackle the spatial scale mismatch between in situ and satellite measurements this study conducts a multi scale validation of sm products over qinghai tibet plateau by generating a high resolution sm dataset to bridge the gap between in situ and satellite observations within the multi scale validation framework three coarse resolution satellite sm products were assessed in terms of their spatial and temporal consistency with the referenced sm at the corresponding pixel scale furthermore based on the pixel by pixel validation results the main factors affecting satellite sm products accuracy were identified the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study areas and experimental datasets the methodology namely the generation and evaluation of high resolution sm dataset and the assessment of satellite sm products is presented in section 3 section 4 provides a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy of sm products and their control factors finally a brief conclusion is given in section 5 2 study area and experimental datasets 2 1 study area the qinghai tibet plateau qtp known as the roof of the world is the largest plateau in the world with an average altitude of more than 4000 m and the most complex terrain it covers the region bounded by 26 n 39 78 n and 73 32 e 101 2 e owing to the complicated and changeable topography the climate over the area varies significantly with different regions which in turn leads to the non uniformly distributed land cover types the dominant land cover type in the south is grassland while the north and northwest qtp are featured by bare soil chen and zhou 2005 the spatial distribution of soil moisture in qtp shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest and there is a strong spatial heterogeneity of sm due to the influence of various external factors such as soil type and vegetation type the strong spatial heterogeneity poses great challenges in the retrieval of satellite sm due to the suitability of model parameters and assumptions therefore it is urgent to comprehensively evaluate satellite sm in order to understand their accuracy over such a special region for more effective application in climate change research as shown in fig 1 multiple soil moisture monitoring networks have been deployed in qtp providing important data sources for the validation of satellite sm products 2 2 experimental data 2 2 1 in situ site observation in situ based soil moisture data were collected from six sm monitoring networks table 1 specifically ali and shiquanhe networks are located in the western part of qtp where the climate type is characterized as cold arid and the elevation varies from 4200 to 4700 m two sites from ali network and six sites from shiquanhe network were used in this study considering the data availability and integrity maqu network is located on the north eastern edge of qtp this region is featured by grassland land cover a cold humid climate and an elevation higher than 3400 m four sites from maqu network were used in this study naqu network is located in the central tibetan plateau with a grassy land cover a cold semiarid climate type and an elevation of about 4500 m two sites from naqu network were employed it is noteworthy that the measured depth from different networks is inconsistent the in situ measurements of the first four monitoring networks provide the values at the depth of 5 cm below the surface by the time step of 15 min these data were downloaded from tibet obs 2009 2019 zhang et al 2021a su et al 2011 zhang et al 2021b covering a 10 year period heihe network is located in the north eastern corner of qtp it consists of 40 observation stations jin et al 2014 kang et al 2017 ge et al 2015 jin and kang 2021 each node provides soil moisture at the depth of 4 cm and 20 cm by the time step of 1 h and some nodes also offer soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm for consistency with the measured depth of other networks the measurements at the depth of 4 cm were selected from ten sites with the consideration of data availability and integrity additionally two sites of the active layer observation stations network zhao et al 2021 were also employed this network is established over the permafrost area of qtp with the aim of providing systematic monitoring of permafrost ground temperature active layer water heat and meteorological factors soil moisture was measured at the depth of 10 cm by the time step of 30 min daily in situ based sm was estimated by averaging these measurements arithmetically 2 2 2 satellite soil moisture products in this study three typical sm products namely smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm were employed due to their wide recognization they were first merged to generate the coarse pixel scale sm dataset which is assumed to represent the real state of sm at the 25 km pixel scale and is independent of any one of these three sm satellite products smos is an esa satellite mission that was specifically designed to provide global observations of soil moisture and ocean salinity it helps to deepen the understanding of the water cycle process between the atmosphere ocean and land and contributes to better weather and extreme climate events forecasting kerr et al 2010 the miras microwave imaging radiometer using aperture synthesis sensor on smos provides multi angular observations at l band 1 4 ghz and the retrieved sm represents the soil moisture value at the depth of 0 3 cm fernandez moran et al 2017 besides smos provides two sm observations at 6 00 ascending and 18 00 descending local solar time in this study the recently released smos ic v2 product was selected since it has been improved in several aspects compared to the previous version such as smos ic v105 the pixels which are flagged as sf 1 were excluded since they were either influenced by strong topography or frozen and contaminated additionally the pixels with tb rmse lower than or equal to 8 k were screened out to remove strong radio frequency interference rfi impacts wigneron et al 2021 in order to generate sm on the daily scale the ascending and descending smos ic sm were averaged as suggested by peng et al 2021 the smap mission was launched in january 2015 to provide global maps of sm it aims to better comprehend how water energy and carbon fluxes maintain the climate and environment entekhabi et al 2010a the smap offers l band 1 41 ghz observations at 18 00 ascending and 6 00 descending local solar times in this study smap l3 v6 product which provides daily soil moisture estimates with the spatial resolution of 36 km was used the condition of retrieval qual flag 0 8 was used to screen out the pixels with steeply sloped topography urban feature permanent snow or ice and dense vegetation o neill et al 2020 the ascending and descending data were also averaged to obtain daily smap l3 sm additionally in order to match the spatial resolution of smos ic sm the smap l3 dataset was resampled into 25 km using the nearest neighbor interpolation the amsr2 instrument aboard the global change observation mission 1st water gcom w1 satellite was launched in may 2012 it offers global precipitation soil moisture water vapor sea ice concentration and ocean wind speed information the amsr2 offers observations at 13 30 ascending and 1 30 descending local solar time here the amsr2 lprm l3 product which was retrieved from x band based on land parameter retrieval model lprm was adopted since the data from x band is usually less affected by rfi njoku et al 2005 in order to ensure the quality of the sm dataset the pixels with temperatures below 273 15 k were screened out the daily amsr2 lprm sm dataset was generated by averaging the ascending and descending data it is noteworthy that the unit of the amsr2 product is different from that of smos and smap the former denotes the degree of saturation of soil moisture while the latter is presented in the volumetric unit m3 m3 teng et al 2018 in order to make them comparable amsr2 lprm sm product was converted to volumetric soil moisture by multiplying the soil porosity the information of soil porosity was acquired from the land data assimilation system dataset reynolds et al 2000 https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas soils in order to avoid the impact of soil frozen or freezing or thawing on soil dielectric constant the thawed period from july to august between 2016 and 2018 was focused on in this study zhang et al 2010a xing et al 2021 2 2 3 auxiliary data the auxiliary data are used to generate the high resolution sm dataset based on the coarse pixel scale sm dataset and on the other hand used for detecting the main control factors affecting the accuracy of satellite sm products the topographic factors zhu and lin 2011 land surface temperature lst wang et al 2007 land surface cover conditions wang et al 2012 albedo and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were introduced since they were believed to be related to sm dem was obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm digital elevation dataset which provides high quality dem data at a nearly global scope with a spatial resolution of 90 m based on the dem information the topographic factors such as slope and aspect were also calculated land cover information was extracted from mcd12q1 with a spatial resolution of 500 m the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp was employed in this study due to its high accuracy and widespread acceptance lst information was acquired from mod11a1 which provides daily daytime lst lst day and nighttime lst lst night with a spatial resolution of 1 km the difference lst difference between the daytime lst and nighttime lst was also calculated to serve as an additional explanatory variable of sm the albedo information was obtained from mcd43a3 v6 which provides daily black sky albedo and white sky albedo with a spatial resolution of 500 m this product is the most widely used and shows a reasonable accuracy wu et al 2018 ndvi data was acquired from mod09ga 006 ndvi through the google earth engine platform the ndvi data was calculated based on the near infrared band and red band of the mod09ga surface reflectance product with a spatial resolution of 500 m these auxiliary data were resampled into 25 km and 500 m respectively the former is used to establish the relationship between the auxiliary variables and the 25 km sm dataset and to explore the potential factors influencing the accuracy of satellite sm products the latter was used to generate a 500 m sm dataset based on this relationship specifically the elevation slope and aspect data were resampled from 90 m to 500 m and 25 km with the mean aggregation method the land cover data was resampled from 500 m to 25 km using the majority resampling method the lst data were resampled from 1 km to 500 m with the nearest neighbor resampling method and upscaled to 25 km with the mean aggregation method the 500 m albedo and ndvi data were upscaled to 25 km using the mean aggregation method although the auxiliary datasets inevitably suffer from errors due to the original satellite observation errors or the limitations of the retrieval algorithms the effect of such errors can be reduced in the resampling process because the errors in fine pixel scales are balanced out when they are aggregated into a coarse resolution bradley et al 2007 hence the relationship between the target variable and auxiliary variables can be accurately simulated and is not dependent on the absolute accuracy of the auxiliary data 3 methodology this study aims to comprehensively assess coarse scale sm products pixel by pixel within a multiscale validation framework in order to achieve this goal there are three key steps as shown in fig 2 1 a better performing coarse pixel scale sm dataset was generated by merging the smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm with etc and the arithmetic mean method 2 the coarse resolution sm dataset was downscaled to 500 m based on the auxiliary datasets as well as the random forest algorithm in this way the high resolution sm dataset was generated 3 the high resolution sm dataset was compared to in situ measurements and was then aggregated to the coarse pixel for the validation of three original satellite sm products furthermore the main influence factors of the accuracy of sm satellite products were explored 3 1 the generation of coarse resolution sm datasets satellite provides a practical way to monitor sm at a large pixel scale nevertheless satellite products may underestimate or overestimate sm to a certain degree due to the limitations of satellite observations and retrieval algorithms in order to make the best of the information provided by different satellite products from a mutual compensation perspective the daily smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products were merged to generate a better performing coarse pixel sm dataset given the fact that these three products are based on different satellite sensors and retrieval algorithms they suffer from different degrees of errors and can be assumed to be independent during the merging process what needs to be thought about is how to evaluate the uncertainty of each dataset and assign different weight coefficients to them based on the calculated random error for each dataset since the absolute truth at the coarse pixel scale is unattainable zhang et al 2010b the triple collocation tc method can be introduced to estimate the errors of satellite products stoffelen 1998 the recently developed extended triple collocation etc technique is mathematically equivalent to tc but overcomes the deficiency of merely estimating rmse in using tc mccoll et al 2014 hence it was employed to merge the three sm datasets following the ideas of yilmaz et al 2012 etc technique assumes that there is a linear relationship between observed values and truth the error model can be expressed as eq 1 x i a i b i t ε i i 1 2 3 where x i and t represent the satellite sm product and the corresponding truth respectively a i and b i denote the regression coefficients between the i th sm product and the corresponding truth and ε i is the corresponding random error by assuming that the mathematic expectation of ε i is 0 the variance of ε i is constant and the covariance between ε i and ε j is equal to 0 when i j the random error of the three sm products can be calculated using eq 2 2 ε i c 11 c 12 c 13 c 23 c 22 c 12 c 23 c 13 c 33 c 13 c 23 c 12 where c ij denotes the covariance between the sm products x i and x j eq 3 3 c ij c o v x i x j e x i x j e x i e x j where cov indicates the covariance between two different products and e represents the mathematical expectation then the weight coefficient w i for each satellite product can be calculated from the random error obtained from etc gruber et al 2017 4 w i t c 1 i 1 i t c 1 where w is the weight coefficient vector w 1 w 2 w 3 t i is the unit vector 1 1 1 t and c represents the error covariance matrix 5 c ε 1 2 0 0 0 ε 2 2 0 0 0 ε 3 2 finally the three products were combined linealy to generate the merged product using the weight coefficiens 6 x new w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w 3 x 3 where x new means the merged coarse resolution product it is noteworthy that in the process of data fusion with the etc method the sample size may be too small to meet the assumptions of etc or the assumption premise of etc cannot be satisfied resulting in negative ε i 2 to reduce such an impact the arithmetic mean method will be used to fuse the three products since the average values may be closer to the true value of sm ma and liang 2022 additionally when only two products are available the arithmetic mean method will also be utilized to merge them although this treatment may bring some uncertainty to the final result when both of them are overestimated or underestimated this is the best tradeoff between the spatial coverage of the merged product and its quality peng et al 2021 particularly if only one product is available the fusion value is set as the corresponding product value it is noteworthy that although the merged sm dataset is believed to be more accurate than each of the three satellite sm products it cannot be directly used as the reference value on the coarse pixel scale because its accuracy cannot be evaluated against in situ measurements due to the large spatial scale mismatch between them a reasonable way is to downscale it into a relatively high spatial resolution to narrow the gap of their spatial scale 3 2 the generation of high resolution sm through downscaling the high resolution sm dataset functions as the bridge between in situ and satellite based measurements in this study the high resolution sm dataset was derived from the merged sm product using the machine learning based model and ancillary datasets the random forest rf algorithm was selected since it had been widely used in remote sensing domains and proved to be efficient and robust ke et al 2016 im et al 2016 it is an ensemble of large sets of carts classification and regression trees breiman 2001 each tree is established using a random subset of training data selected by the bootstrap sampling method and the averaging of outputs from all trees was used in order to smooth the fluctuations between different trees and yield more accurate prediction results moreover rf also calculates the out of bag oob error of each input variable based on the data samples that are not selected in the training dataset in this way the relative importance of the ancillary variables can be identified eq 7 7 mse oob i 1 n e 2 i e 1 i n where mse oob indicates the importance of the variable e 1 i means the oob error of the model on the i th tree e 2 i represents the oob error of the model on the i th tree after randomly adding noise to the sample n is the number of the total trees in the model larger mse oob means greater importance of the variable in the prediction of the target parameter zhang et al 2018 the rf model was implemented in r program software with the randomforest package the two key parameters i e mtry the number of random features and ntree the number of trees need to be tuned during the model training process in order to achieve better prediction the basic idea of the downscaling methodology is modeling the relationship between the merged sm product and the auxiliary variables including elevation slope aspect ndvi lst day lst night lst difference land cover albedo wsa and albedo bsa at the spatial resolution of 25 km using rf then the trained model was applied to the 500 m auxiliary dataset to generate the high resolution sm dataset this process is described in detail as follows 1 the auxiliary variables were presented in a numerical manner and the numerical ranges of different variables were quite different considering the impact of different magnitude of surface variables on the sample distribution a standardization was implemented the z score normalization method was adopted to normalize the data in this study eq 8 zhang et al 2014 it uses the mean and standard deviation of the original data to rescale their data ranges 8 x x μ σ where x is the normalized data x is the original data μ is the averaged value and σ is the standard deviation of the original data 2 in the process of model training the auxiliary variables function as independent variables and the merged sm functions as the dependent variable the processed dataset was divided into a training dataset and a test dataset 70 and 30 of the data respectively the rf based model was built with the training dataset on the 25 km scale and the accuracy of the training model was assessed with the test dataset 3 once the model was determined the 500 m auxiliary datasets were inputted to the established model to generate a high resolution sm product it is important to note that we have made a common assumption that the trained model has applicability across different spatial scales during this process which has been proved to be reasonable by wang et al 2022 3 3 the multi scale validation of coarse scale soil moisture in order to enhance the reliability of validation results the high resolution sm dataset was assessed through the comparison with in situ sm measurements it is important to note that the merged sm product represents the sm at the sampling depth of 0 5 cm while the sampling depths of in situ stations are either 4 cm 5 cm or 10 cm here unbiased rmse ubrmse was used as the accuracy indicator because it is less affected by depth mismatch between in situ and satellite estimates than bias xing et al 2021 and is not impacted by deviations of in situ data from the absolute truth entekhabi et al 2010b other indicators such as slope correlation coefficient r and mean bias bias were also introduced to check the performance of satellite products from a different perspective 9 s l o p e i 1 n p i p r i r i 1 n p i p 2 10 r p i p r i r i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n r i r 2 11 b i a s i 1 n p i r i n 12 r m s e i 1 n p i r i 2 n 13 u b r m s e r m s e 2 b i a s 2 where p i and r i denote the products needed to be evaluated and the reference data respectively and p and r are their averaged value respectively n is the number of the total samples since the high resolution sm dataset has been evaluated using in situ measurements it was aggregated to the 25 km pixel scale to conduct the multiscale validation of daily smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products the validation was conducted from two aspects first all pixels over qtp were combined together for validation on the daily basis resulting in accuracy indicators for each day during the study period second the sm time series of the satellite and the reference were compared resulting in accuracy indicators for each pixel in this way the main influence factors i e land surface temperature land cover type elevation and slope of the accuracy of satellite sm can be identified by checking the variation of ubrmse with these factors 4 results and discussion 4 1 downscaled soil moisture fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of sm indicated by the smos ic smap l3 amsr2 lprm coarse resolution merged dataset and downscaled high resolution sm products over qtp respectively from fig 3 a c it can be seen that the three satellite products almost present a similar spatial distribution pattern of sm which is relatively higher in the south of qtp and lower in the north of qtp the zonal distribution characteristic of sm is obvious tending to decrease with the increase of latitude however these three satellite products present different features regarding the distribution of empty pixels smos ic suffers from the largest degree of missing data followed by smap l3 and amsr2 lprm compared to smos ic and amsr2 lprm smap l3 is generally lower in the northeast of qtp after the fusion of the three products the spatial coverage of the merged dataset is significantly improved fig 4 d the distribution of non null pixels of this dataset is similar to that of amsr2 lprm this is reasonable since amsr2 lprm owns the largest data coverage by comparing the merged product with smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm fig 3 a c it was found that the merged sm product integrates the characteristics of the three original products but it is most similar to the spatial distribution pattern and dynamic range of amsr2 lprm revealing wetter soil in the south than north the high resolution sm data derived with the rf based downscaling model and independent variables over qtp covered a limited area of qtp as shown in fig 3 e this is because the auxiliary data such as lst and ndvi do not completely cover qtp after data quality control but it can be seen that the downscaled results show consistency with the coarse resolution merged dataset regarding the spatial distribution with values less than 0 3 m3 m3 in the north of qtp the performance of the rf based downscaling model has been assessed using the test dataset and results show that the established downscaling model is reliable to obtain qualified high resolution data with the high r of 0 86 and small ubrmse of 0 039 m3 m3 to further explore the role of independent variables in predicting sm the increase in mse mean square error provided by rf is used as the indicator of the relative importance of each variable among the ten input parameters slope aspect elevation and ndvi were proved to be more important than the others fig 4 the terrain factors predominate sm prediction this is reasonable since the topography of qtp exhibits large spatial variations therefore the complex terrain of qtp plays a key role during the model training process ndvi is also a critical element for sm estimation this can be explained by the fact that most areas of qtp are featured with vegetation fig 1 besides the research period is summer when vegetation is dense which has a significant impact on soil moisture the land surface temperature is also a key control factor of sm from fig 4 it can be seen that sm shows different sensitivities to lst day lst night and lst difference with the largest sensitivity to lst difference and smallest sensitivity to lst day one possible reason is that the change of sm can be reflected by ati apparent thermal inertia which is significantly correlated with lst difference song et al 2021 by contrast the sensitivity of sm to lst day is lower than lst night it can be explained that the lst product mod11a1 used in this study represents the lst at 10 30 am and 10 30 pm respectively and lst at 10 30 am is usually in a period of rapid rise while the variation of lst at night is usually more stable and the coarse resolution merged sm dataset represents the variation of sm within one day so sm shows a stronger relationship with the lst night rather than lst day the influence of albedo and land cover type on sm is not as large as terrain factors and ndvi this may be attributed to the significant influence of the complex terrain of qtp 4 2 the accuracy of high resolution soil moisture the in situ sm measurements from the six monitoring networks were utilized to evaluate the downscaled sm dataset fig 5 the downscaled sm shows the largest consistency with in situ measurements at ali with the highest r of 0 831 the activelayer naqu and heihe follow with r of 0 603 0 640 and 0 492 respectively the worst consistency occurs at maqu and shiquanhe with the lowest r of 0 489 and 0 441 respectively nevertheless when it comes to the discrepancy between the downscaled sm and in situ measurements the best result still occurs at ali with an ubrmse value of 0 01 m3 m3 followed by naqu and shiquanhe with the ubrmse of 0 029 m3 m3 and 0 043 m3 m3 respectively the poorest performance was presented at heihe activelyaer and maqu with ubrmse values of 0 056 m3 m3 0 060 m3 m3 and 0 074 m3 m3 respectively in general the accuracy of the downscaled sm varies from site to site and its performance does not meet the accuracy requirement over some sites for example the variations of sm indicated by in situ measurements cannot be captured by downscaled sm at shiquanhe and maqu as shown in fig 5 this phenomenon can be explained from four aspects 1 the random forest algorithm averages the results of all regression trees to obtain the final prediction value which may limit the dynamic range of the target variable 2 soil moisture is affected by various factors such as temperature vegetation and soil texture chen et al 2012 wu et al 2020 resulting in strong spatial heterogeneity of sm consequently in situ sm measurements can only represent the limited area around the station which is much smaller than the 500 m downscaled sm 3 the penetration depths of in situ measurements and downscaled sm are inconsistent sm measured by ali naqu shiquanhe and maqu represents the value at 5 cm below the land surface heihe observation network measures sm at the depth of 4 cm the activelayer network measures sm at the depth of 10 cm while the downscaled sm is an averaged value of sm ranging from 0 cm to 5 cm 4 the downscaled sm suffers from uncertainty because of the errors in the merged coarse pixel sm dataset auxiliary satellite products and the downscaling model itself it is important to note that although the errors in high resolution sm are not small enough to be ignored these errors can be further reduced when the high resolution sm is aggregated to the coarse resolution 4 3 pixel based evaluation results of coarse pixel sm products the high resolution of downscaled sm can reveal the spatial variation characteristics within the 25 km pixel scale and bridge the gap between in situ and coarse pixel satellite sm observations although the errors of downscaled sm cannot be ignored at some sites they can be reduced in the aggregation process to the 25 km pixel scale therefore the downscaled sm is more appropriate to be used as the reference to assess the accuracy of coarse pixel satellite sm products than the single point in situ measurements fig 6 illustrates the assessment results of the three satellite sm products over qtp in order to make a comparison with previous validation study based on in situ measurements xing et al 2021 the median values of r ubrmse bias and slope are first used to indicate the accuracy of smos ic amsr2 lprm and smap l3 from fig 6 a it can be seen that smap l3 shows a better consistency with the coarse pixel scale reference than smos ic and amsr2 lprm with the highest r of 0 656 followed by the amsr2 lprm and smos ic with the r of 0 555 and 0 492 respectively when it comes to ubrmse amsr2 lprm presents the best accuracy with the smallest value of 0 047 m3 m3 fig 6 b smap l3 shows a slightly higher ubrmse of 0 053 m3 m3 and smos ic shows the worst accuracy with the largest ubrmse of 0 065 m3 m3 the slope indicates the ability of three sm products to capture the temporal dynamic characteristics of sm fig 6 d it shows that smos ic presents the best performance with slope of 1 027 the smap l3 follows with a slightly larger slope of 1 171 and amsr2 lprm ranks last with the smallest slope of 0 715 fig 6 c shows that smap l3 overestimates sm with the bias of 0 013 m3 m3 while smos ic and amsr2 lprm underestimate sm with the bias of 0 016 m3 m3 and 0 030 m3 m3 respectively in general smap l3 performed best in terms of consistency with pixel scale reference over qtp amsr2 lprm presents the best result in terms of deviation from relative truth and smos ic always presents the worst performance regarding the consistency and accuracy nevertheless it should be pointed out that fig 6 only presents the median values of these four statistical indicators therefore the results may not represent the overall accuracy of these three sm products compared to the previous validation study over qtp by xing et al 2021 there was a considerable discrepancy between the two validation results first xing et al 2021 concluded that smos ic performed best followed by smap l3 and amsr2 lprm which is opposite to our results second the standard deviations of the median values of these four indicators were more concentrated than that of xing et al 2021 the discrepancies can be explained from the following aspects first the validation results by xing et al 2021 are based on the direct comparison between in situ and coarse pixel satellite observations where the results inevitably suffer from great representativeness errors caused by the large spatial scale mismatch between them and wide spatial heterogeneity our results however are based on the aggregated high resolution sm although the high resolution sm also contains a certain degree of uncertainty caused by the errors of high resolution dataset as well as the geo location mismatch between coarse pixel satellite products and aggregated high resolution datasets this multiscale validation eases the severity of the scale problem over heterogeneous surfaces and has been widely adopted in the validation of coarse pixel satellite products especially over heterogeneous surfaces second the result of xing et al 2021 was derived from limited soil moisture monitoring stations while our results were based on all pixels within the whole study area to strengthen the representativeness and universality of them moreover inconsistent results were also presented through the comparison with liu et al 2019 which concluded that smap l3 performed the best amsr2 lprm overestimated sm and smos ic underestimated sm these discrepancies can be attributed to the fact that although the in situ measurements from network observations were averaged to compare with the satellite products in liu et al 2019 the scale mismatch issue may be not thoroughly solved unless these in situ sites can fully capture the spatiotemporal variations of sm within the 25 km pixel which will introduce uncertainty to the validation results in order to explore the performance of satellite sm products in high detail for a wide range of conditions their accuracies were assessed on a pixel basis fig 7 here we only present the results of ubrmse for conciseness since it is less affected by depth mismatch of sm it can be seen that the ubrmses of these three sm products are mainly ranging from 0 m3 m3 to 0 1 m3 m3 smos ic presents larger ubrmse than that of the other two products moreover the spatial distribution of its ubrmse is heterogeneous with larger ubrmse 0 06 m3 m3 0 1 m3 m3 in the east of qtp similarly smap l3 also shows relatively larger ubrmse over the eastern area fig 7 b but the ubrmse in other regions is basically smaller than 0 05 m3 m3 when it comes to the ubrmse of amsr2 lprm obvious regional characteristics can be observed as shown in fig 7 c larger ubrmse occurs in the east southeast and northwest marginal areas of qtp with values of about 0 08 m3 m3 but most areas of qtp show relatively small ubrmse of less than 0 04 m3 m3 given the strong spatial heterogeneity of ubrmse it is necessary to discover the influence factors on the accuracy of satellite sm products fig 8 presents the variation of ubrmse with elevation slope land cover types lst day lst night and lst difference in order to explore their influence on the accuracy of satellite sm products as shown in fig 8 a the ubrmse of smos ic and smap l3 first increases with elevation and reaches the peak within the region of 3000 4000 m with the further increase of elevation ubrmse shows a slight downward trend amsr2 lprm presents a similar variation trend with an exception within the region of 2000 3000 m where the ubrmse is smaller than that of 0 2000 m the lowest accuracy of satellite sm products occurs in the area of 3000 4000 m where there is a drastic elevation variation bai et al 2015 which is not conducive to sm retrieval with the further increase of elevation 4000 m the ubrmse of satellite products decreases this can be explained by the small value of slope in the middle and southwest of qtp bai et al 2015 where the terrain is relatively flat which is conducive to the retrieval of sm from fig 8 a it can be found that amsr2 lprm always performed the best followed by the smap l3 and smos ic regardless of the elevation zone over lower and medium height regions 0 2000 m the overall error of the three products is relatively low and concentrated which is mainly distributed below 0 025 m3 m3 over the elevation region of 2000 3000 m there is a significant decrease in the accuracy of smos ic and smap l3 with most ubrmses distributed between 0 025 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 by contrast there is an increase of the accuracy in amsr2 lprm this indicates that the accuracy of satellite sm products is not merely influenced by elevation as the elevation increases to 3000 4000 m the ubrmse of more than half of the pixels exceeds 0 025 m3 m3 for these three sm products particularly the maximum ubrmse for smos ic exceeds 0 125 m3 m3 it is obvious that the spatial distribution of the errors of these three sm products is more heterogeneous in this region given the larger height of the boxplots with the further increase in elevation the ubrmse of all the three products shows a slight decrease and is mainly distributed between 0 025 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 in the range of 4000 5000 m and 5000 6000 m except for amsr2 lprm for which the ubrmse is mainly lower than 0 025 m3 m3 in the range of 5000 6000 m regarding the effect of slope fig 8 b the accuracy of these three satellite sm products presents different responses to slope the ubrmses of smos ic and amsr2 lprm show strong positive responses to slope their ubrmses are mainly distributed below 0 05 m3 m3 within the slope range of 0 5 and 5 15 a slight increase can be observed in the slope range of 15 25 and 25 35 with the values distributed between 0 025 m3 m3 0 075 m3 m3 with the further steepness of the terrain with slope larger than 35 their ubrmse increases significantly with most values exceeding 0 075 m3 m3 for amsr2 lprm this phenomenon is understandable since complex terrain makes it difficult to predict high precision sm by contrast the accuracy of smap l3 does not monotonically increase with slope instead the accuracy variation trend of smap l3 with slope is consistent with that of the elevation specifically the ubrmses increase with the increase of slope at first and reach the peak in the slope range of 15 25 and then show a slight downward trend with the further increase of slope but most of the ubrmses are stable and distributed below 0 05 m3 m3 regardless of the slope range indicating that slope is not the primary control factor of the accuracy of smap l3 the effect of land cover types on the accuracy of the three sm products is clearly shown in fig 8 c it can be seen that the accuracy of satellite sm fluctuates greatly with the land cover types in terms of smos ic the best accuracy occurs in bar with most of the values smaller than 0 05 m3 m3 and the worst accuracy appears in w sav indicated by the discrete distribution and large value of ubrmses which exceed 0 05 m3 m3 in most cases similarly the accuracy of amsr2 lprm is also higher at bar indicated by the small ubrmse less than0 025 m3 m3 and is poor in mf and w sav indicated by the large ubrmse 0 075 m3 m3 compared to smos ic and amsr2 lprm the accuracy of smap l3 presents a smaller extent of fluctuations with land cover types which is mainly distributed between 0 025 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 similar to smos ic the performance of smap l3 is also the best in bar but the worst in urb the best performance over bar for the three sm products can be attributed to the relatively smaller surface heterogeneity of the barren than other land cover types moreover the barren area is mainly distributed in the north and northwest of qtp where the slope value is low the poor performance over w sav for smos ic and amsr2 lprm may be caused by the strong surface heterogeneity since w sav is a mixed land type of herbaceous understory systems and forest canopy it should be noted that over the grasslands which are relatively homogeneous the accuracy of the three sm products does not fulfill the expectations it is especially true for smos ic this can be explained by the fact that the grasslands in the east and southeast regions are accompanied by steep terrain and that the impact of topography on the accuracy of satellite sm products is greater than that of land cover types this agrees well with the results in fig 4 which indicates that terrain factors play a dominant role in soil moisture retrieval therefore it can be concluded that the performance of the sm products over different land cover types is related to slope and surface heterogeneity as shown in fig 8 d smos ic always presents the largest ubrmse in different lst day levels indicating again its worst performance in different daily temperatures an exception can be found in the level of 270 280 k where there are so few pixels that the results may be not representative by contrast the amsr2 lprm shows the smallest ubrmse in different levels of lst day demonstrating that it performs the best in different daily temperatures the accuracy of smap l3 is somewhere in between regarding the stability of the accuracy of satellite sm products in different daily temperatures amsr2 lprm shows the most stable behavior given the centralized distribution of its boxplots followed by smap l3 and smos ic ranks last when it comes to the effect of daily temperatures on the accuracy of satellite sm higher ubrmse tends to occur when daily temperatures are less than 300 k and smaller ubrmse tends to appear when daily temperatures are larger than 310 k the higher accuracy of satellite sm products in the areas with relatively high temperature can be explained by the fact that these areas are located in the north and northern edge of qtp where the topography is flat resulting in the improvement of product accuracy the influence of night temperature on the accuracy of satellite sm seems to be different from that of daily temperature given the fact that the larger ubrmse of smos ic and smap l3 appears in the region with 270 280 k or larger than 290 k fig 8 e moreover the stability of their accuracy is not good in these regions given the wide distribution of their boxplots by contrast the accuracy of amsr2 lprm tends to increase with the night temperature the different responses of the accuracy of satellite sm products to nigh temperature can be explained by the fact that the accuracy of satellite sm products is jointly affected by many factors it is noteworthy that the smap l3 presents a smaller ubrmse than amsr2 lprm in the region of 260 270 k which is different from the results in other regions in general smos ic shows the worst accuracy in different night temperatures followed by smap l3 and amsr2 lprm performs best the accuracy of satellite sm products shows a strong dependence on the lst difference fig 8 f given that the ubrmse decrease monotonically with the increase of lst difference in particular the ubrmse of smos ic smap l3 is around 0 025 m3 m3 and the ubrmse of amsr2 lprm is basically smaller than 0 025 m3 m3 when the temperature difference is greater than 30 k from the results above it can be concluded that the accuracy of smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products over qtp is closely related to elevation slope land cover types and land surface temperature in general the accuracies decrease with the increase of slope and the negative influence of terrain is more significant than other factors especially over areas with complicated topography moreover based on the results of fig 6 it can be seen that smap l3 and amsr2 lprm perform best regarding the correlation and deviation from the pixel scale reference in the spatial domain and smos ic is always the worst while the pixel based validation results indicate that amsr2 lprm performs best followed by smap l3 and smos ic ranks last the slight discrepancy between the two validation results is understandable since the evaluation methods are focused on different perspectives one is from the temporal domain while the other is from the spatial domain it should be pointed out that the results based on the median error metrics may not represent the overall accuracy of these three sm products because the extreme values of the statistical indicators are ignored by contrast the pixel based assessment result is more comprehensive and in depth since it considers different conditions over the whole qtp 5 conclusions to enable the effective application of satellite sm products in investigating the land atmosphere interactions it is urgent to comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of sm products although lots of studies had been conducted to assess the performance of various satellite sm products most of them merely conduct the direct in situ satellite comparison due to the lack of high resolution sm datasets consequently the evaluation results suffer from large uncertainties due to the large scale mismatch between in situ and satellite measurements in response to this challenge we take the scale difference between in situ measurements and satellite sm products into full consideration and generate the high resolution sm data as the scaling bridge between in situ and satellite measurements in order to assess coarse pixel sm products specifically we first obtain theoretically better performing sm estimates on the coarse pixel scale by integrating the daily smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products with etc and the arithmetic mean method then the high resolution sm datasets were generated by downscaling the merged sm dataset with the random forest based model and were then evaluated with in situ sm measurements and aggregated into a coarse pixel scale as the reference for evaluation at last three widely used satellite products including smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products were evaluated from two different perspectives furthermore the influence factors on the accuracy of satellite sm products were explored the coarse resolution merged sm dataset has integrated the characteristics of the daily smos ic smap l3 and amsr2 lprm sm products it reveals that the sm of qtp presents a distinct zonal distribution feature decreasing with the increase of latitude the high resolution sm dataset based on rf based downscaling model reveals more elaborate spatial variation information of sm through the comparison with in situ sm measurements from six sm monitoring networks it has been proved that the accuracy of the high resolution dataset is reasonable to be used as the scaling bridge between in situ measurements and satellite products therefore the machine learning algorithm based downscaling method provides an efficient way to generate high resolution sm dataset over heterogeneous surfaces nevertheless it should be noted that the performance of this method is affected by the quality of the coarse resolution merged sm dataset the inclusion of key variables related to sm as well as the quality of their datasets and the amount of training data the terrain factors ndvi and lst difference have been identified as the more important variables in predicting sm over qtp regarding the accuracy of the three sm products the results in the spatial domain indicate that smap l3 and amsr2 lprm perform best regarding the correlation and deviation from the pixel scale reference with the highest r of 0 656 and the smallest ubrmse of 0 047 m3 m3 respectively while the smos ic is always the worst with the largest ubrmse of 0 065 m3 m3 and the smallest r of 0 492 when it comes to the pixel by pixel validation the ubrmses of these three sm products range from 0 m3 m3 to 0 1 m3 m3 smos ic presents larger ubrmse than smap l3 and amsr2 lprm besides the spatial distribution of ubrmse of these three sm products is different smos ic presents the largest spatial heterogeneity by contrast smap l3 shows relatively larger ubrmse over eastern qtp and amsr2 lprm shows lower accuracy over the east southeast and northwest marginal areas of qtp it is noteworthy that our validation results disagree with the conclusion by xing et al 2021 which concludes that smos ic performs best followed by smap l3 and amsr2 lprm the discrepancy between these studies indicates that dealing with the spatial scale mismatch between in situ measurements and coarse resolution satellite sm products is urgently required in the validation over such a heterogeneous surface furthermore an appropriate evaluation approach is also important to fully understand the performance of coarse resolution satellite sm products the accuracy of satellite sm products is closely related to elevation slope land cover types and land surface temperature and the influence of terrain is more significant than other factors specifically the lowest accuracy of the three sm products occurs in the region 3000 4000 m where elevation variation is drastic slope also plays a dominant role in the accuracy of smos ic and amsr2 lprm which monotonically decreases with the increase of slope but this is not the case with smap l3 the best accuracy of these three sm products occurs at bar in fact the effect of land cover type on the accuracy of satellite sm products is related to slope and surface heterogeneity when it comes to the effect of temperature the lst difference has a decisive influence on the accuracy of satellite sm products since their ubrmse decreases monotonically with the increase of lst difference this study presents the first assessment of three coarse scale sm products within the multi scale validation framework over qtp the comprehensive validation results on the pixel basis not only enable a full understanding of the performance of the three sm products but also support the clarification of the influence factors on the accuracy of

2867,the east asian summer monsoon easm and indian summer monsoon ism are two interactive climate systems dominating the moisture variability of monsoon asia however ism easm interactions and their effects on regional moisture dynamics remain unclear this study investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of monsoon related hydroclimate variability by establishing a new tree ring oxygen isotope ratio δ18otree network of eight δ18otree records covering the last 150 years in southern china which differs from previous studies that used data from individual sites the δ18otree chronologies were found to be sensitive to regional hydroclimatic changes during the monsoon season the δ18otree network indicated an east west clustering pattern in the ism easm transitional zone which demonstrates an asynchrony in δ18otree variability in the west and east of this region regional variability of the west and east δ18otree modes reflected the different moisture signals as indicated by their significant correlations with modern observations and paleo δ18o records in disparate upstream regions of moisture transport the indochina peninsula and southeast china this finding was confirmed by the east west distinct pattern of spatial isotopic depletion of monsoon rainfall that originates from coastal areas of tropical oceans bay of bengal and south china sea to the study area as well as the consistent present day pattern of atmospheric vapor transport during the monsoon season in addition the west and east modes exhibited stronger associations with ism variability whereas the east west δ18otree gradient captured the easm related hydroclimatic signal suggesting that summer moisture variability in the ism easm transitional zone was regulated more by ism than by easm during the last 150 years the relationships between δ18otree and large scale ocean atmosphere interaction modes revealed that the el niño southern oscillation enso dominantly modulates δ18otree variability across southern china keywords tree rings oxygen isotope moisture signals atmospheric circulation hydroclimate variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the asian summer monsoon asm exerts a considerable and long lasting influence on asian ecosystems and cultural development cai et al 2019 kumar et al 2006 pausata et al 2011 yang et al 2021 which affects billions of people living in many developing countries chen et al 2022 wang et al 2017 asm consists of two systems that profoundly affect the climate dynamics of mainland asia namely the indian summer monsoon ism and east asian summer monsoon easm wang et al 2003 wang and lin 2002 wang et al 2017 ism and easm drive water vapor originating from the indian and pacific oceans to meet at their broad transitional zone 100 110 e 10 30 n which roughly covers the indochina peninsula and yunnan guizhou plateau ygp wang et al 2003 wang and lin 2002 however the dominant monsoon system and relative contributions of water vapor from the two oceanic sources to a given location in the ism easm transitional zone remains unclear midhun et al 2021 wang et al 2003 therefore the relationships between vapor transportation atmospheric processes and regional hydroclimatic characteristics between ism and easm regions need to be urgently determined pausata et al 2011 wang and lin 2002 xu et al 2021 modern meteorological observations are limited by insufficient temporal coverage therefore previous studies on the ism easm transitional zone have used various paleoclimatic proxy archives including stalagmites li et al 2017 tree rings fan et al 2020 wang et al 2022b and lake sediments lin et al 2021 to derive highly resolved and long term data of hydroclimatic changes thereinto stable oxygen isotope ratios in tree ring cellulose δ18otree are considered an indispensable paleoclimatic proxy that can consecutively encode natural variability of regional hydroclimate with precise dating seasonal to annual resolution and long time span beyond the instrumental period fan et al 2020 liu et al 2017 muangsong et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the year to year fluctuation in cellulose δ18o is dominantly determined by the isotopic signatures in the source water climate related fractionation and tree physiological processes helliker and richter 2008 roden et al 2000 making it sensitive to regional hydroclimate and large scale circulations fan et al 2020 muangsong et al 2020 xu et al 2021 however potential application of the spatiotemporal pattern of a δ18otree network to large scale hydroclimatic exploration is limited by the insufficient quantity of existing δ18otree records current studies of isotopic dendroclimatology over the ism easm transitional zone have paid specific attention to the identification of climatic factors and climate reconstruction from individual sites or a single tree species muangsong et al 2020 xu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 this leads to inter site diversity in primary controllers of δ18otree variability such as rainy season precipitation xu et al 2019 local humidity zhao et al 2019 source water δ18o fan et al 2020 muangsong et al 2020 and circulation processes fan et al 2021 impeding the large scale climatic interpretation of the tree ring δ18o proxy recently xu et al 2021 extracted the first principal component pc1 series from 24 δ18otree chronologies and emphasized that large scale circulation regulates coherent δ18otree variability in monsoon asia however inter regional differences in moisture signals encoded in tree ring δ18o records from the ism and easm regions have not been identified cai et al 2015 xu et al 2021 furthermore previous studies reported a disparity in climatic forcing between δ18o variability precipitation δ18o and chinese stalagmites δ18o from southwestern china and eastern china li et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 however there lacks further attempts in distinguishing moisture transport process in these two regions because of insufficient continuity and resolution of existing records in this case a tree ring δ18o network covering the ism easm transitional zone is required to synthetically identify its hydroclimatic characteristics and relationships with paleo proxy records in the ism and easm regions this study presents a precisely dated and annually resolved tree ring network consisting of eight δ18otree records across the ygp for investigating their spatiotemporal variability and climatic forcing we found an east west clustering pattern of the δ18otree network and hypothesized that it is caused by hydroclimate variability related to the different regional moisture transport processes the relationships between the two δ18otree modes and both observational and paleo δ18o records in the ism and easm regions were explored accordingly 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region ygp lies in the intersectional area of ism and easm fig 1 it is dominated by a monsoon climate characterized by warm and wet summers with water vapor mainly propagated from the south china sea scs and the indian ocean via ism and easm according to observational data from eight local meteorological stations near the study sites annual precipitation varies between 909 5 mm and 1416 1 mm with 60 88 of precipitation occurring in the rainy season mjjaso fig s1 annual mean temperature ranges from 10 7 to 18 7 and relative humidity rh varies between 71 5 and 84 2 fig s1 furthermore the landscape consists of rolling hills gorges and karst topography with elevation decreasing from the west to the east fig 1 the trees sampled from the study area grow at an altitudinal range from 700 m to more than 2 800 m a s l table s1 2 2 tree ring sampling and dating at each site two cores per tree were taken at a breast height of approximately 1 3 m above the ground using a 5 mm diameter increment corer a total of 382 cores were collected from 193 trees covering seven tree species table s1 the samples were prepared and processed following the standard dendrochronological techniques in the laboratory holmes 1983 stokes and smiley 1968 after crossdating the ring widths were measured using a velmex measuring system with an accuracy of 0 001 mm the quality of the crossdating result was validated using the cofecha software presented by holmes 1983 2 3 isotope measurement four precisely dated cores with legible ring boundaries and little false or missing rings from four different trees at every study site were determined for oxygen isotopic analyses pure α cellulose in every ring of the 32 increment cores 4 cores 8 sites was chemically extracted individually using the plate based extraction method modified by kagawa et al 2015 for each sample 100 250 μg of cellulose were weighted and wrapped in silver capsules subsequently oxygen isotope ratios 18o 16o were determined using a pyrolysis high temperature conversion elemental analyzer tc ea thermo scientific combined with a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms delta v advantage thermo scientific germany at the graduate school of environmental studies nagoya university japan a laboratory cellulose standard merck cellulose with known δ18o value was introduced between every eight sample measurements to monitor the precision and accuracy of the analytical process the analytical precision for the cellulose standards was lower than 0 2 as determined through repeated measurements the δ18o values of all tree ring samples are given in per mil units relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard conforming to the formula 1 δ 18 o t r e e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r is the 18o 16o ratio specifically a total of 4 498 cellulose samples from eight sites were isotopically measured in this study 2 4 development of the tree ring δ18o network to assess the inter tree consistency and representativeness of the sampled population the mean inter tree correlation rbar and expressed population signal eps were calculated for individual δ18otree series for each study site wigley et al 1984 finally eight δ18otree chronologies were obtained using averaged time series of four single cellulose δ18o sequences at the same location among them the four chronologies of western ygp are presented for the first time here whereas the remaining four wxt lsc lgs and shs in table s1 corresponding to the east have previously been reported fan et al 2021 fan et al 2020 furthermore to identify the spatial characteristics of the δ18otree network a rotated principal component analysis rpca that maximizes the spread of individual loadings was applied for all site level chronologies consequently the first several principal components rpcs of the isotope network are regarded as the regional scale δ18otree chronologies based on the highest loadings of site chronologies on the separate components in this regard these regional chronologies are mutually independent facilitating the identification of more reliable climatic signals in δ18otree records 2 5 climate data and analysis tools δ18otree climate relationships were identified using pearson s correlation analysis between δ18otree chronologies and local climate observed at meteorological stations fig s1 precipitation seasonality that is the seasonal distribution of precipitation throughout a year was calculated using the ratio of precipitation amount in the asm season may to september against that in the non asm season october to april based on instrumental data in eight stations worldwide climate fields of multiple climatic variables from the climatic research unit timeseries cru ts 4 04 dataset were utilized to represent large scale climate variability harris et al 2014 the cru ts dataset is a widely used climate dataset that possesses a high gridded resolution 0 5 0 5 over all land domains of the world except antarctica it has been developed through the interpolation of monthly climate from extensive networks of weather station observations harris et al 2014 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a climatic drought index combining multi scalar characteristics for drought assessment vicente serrano et al 2010 was employed to represent the regional moisture condition these climate fields were subsequently applied for spatial correlation analyses with regional scale δ18otree chronologies using knmi explorer https climexp knmi nl the effect of precipitation δ18o δ18op on the cellulose δ18o network was examined by comparing cellulose δ18o with amount weighted δ18op measurements from 24 observational stations from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip table s2 over southeastern and eastern asia the seasonal average δ18op during the summer season at each gnip station was firstly calculated as follows 2 δ 18 o p i n δ 18 o i p i i n p i where δ18o i and p i represent the precipitation δ18o and precipitation amount measured in the i th month respectively we averaged summer δ18op values in the years for which observational δ18op data from each gnip station were available subsequently the kriging interpolation method also known as the space self variance best interpolation method was used to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of summer δ18op this interpolation method is widely used in geological grid statistics including the determination of spatial pattern and prediction of precipitation δ18o juan et al 2020 liu et al 2013 we employed the south asian summer monsoon index sasmi 1948 2014 and east asian summer monsoon index easmi 1948 2014 to represent the strength of ism and easm respectively li and zeng 2002 the normalized all india monsoon rainfall index ismr was used as a relatively longer archive of ism intensity parthasarathy et al 1991 the variability of the el niño southern oscillation enso was represented by the niño3 4 index in which enso is defined as the mean of sea surface temperature sst anomaly in the niño 3 4 region huang et al 2017 3 results 3 1 site level characteristics of δ18otree records and climate signals high eps values over a threshold value of 0 85 and high rbar values over 0 6 support strong common signal among trees and thus robust chronology quality fig 2 b and s2 wigley et al 1984 the tree ring chronologies exhibited significant p 0 001 positive correlations during their common period fig 2a and table s3 nonetheless mean values of δ18otree measurements showed significant differences p 0 05 fig s3 among most of the eight sites and reached 4 7 with the lowest value recorded at southwestern ygp site met in fig 1 21 5 and the highest value at southeastern ygp site lsc in fig 1 26 2 although correlations between δ18otree chronologies and local climatic variables are different among study sites concurrent significant correlations p 0 05 between all of the eight chronologies and summer rh may to august were observed with coefficients varying from 0 31 to 0 53 fig s4 compared with temperature moisture related variables precipitation rh cloud cover and spei showed stronger correlations with δ18otree on the whole δ18otree in the study area is primarily controlled by hydroclimatic changes during the summer monsoon season 3 2 spatial characteristics of δ18otree network and regional chronologies the first two principal components explained 65 4 of the total variance 33 7 for rpc1 and 31 7 for rpc2 loadings on the first two rpcs indicated that annual variations of the four δ18otree records from western ygp vary asynchronously with the other four from eastern ygp fig 3 the mutually independent time series of rpc1 and rpc2 are regarded as the two regional scale δ18otree chronologies with respect to the high loadings of site chronologies fig 3a and table s4 specifically rpc1 rpc2 time series showed strongly significant correlation r 0 94 p 0 001 with regionally averaged δ18otree chronology in western eastern ygp fig s5 in other words the rpc1 series hereafter the western regional chronology and rpc2 series hereafter the eastern regional chronology represent interannual δ18otree variability over western and eastern ygp respectively moreover the western regional chronology exhibited a remarkable increasing trend over time p 0 001 but the eastern regional chronology did not show any such trend fig 3b therefore the western and eastern δ18otree changes are not consistent in terms of their annual to decadal variations and long term trends 3 3 relationships with regional climate and other δ18otree records we examined the relationships between regional δ18otree chronologies and large scale climate fields fig 4 the western regional chronology displayed significant negative correlations p 0 05 with precipitation cloud cover and spei in western ygp and the northern indochina peninsula fig 4 a prominent positive correlation was observed between the western chronology and temperature across western ygp the indochina peninsula and the indian subcontinent fig 4b furthermore significant correlations p 0 05 between the eastern regional chronology and the four climatic factors exhibited similar spatial distributions with a zonal pattern extending southwestward from eastern ygp to the northern indochina peninsula and extending eastward to southeast china fig 4e h the spatial difference in δ18otree climate relationships reveals the disparity in climatic controls and moisture source signals for trees growing in the west and east of ygp we then tested the relationships between our two regional δ18otree chronologies rpc1 rpc2 and two composite δ18otree records from the indochina peninsula and southeast china to verify moisture signals preserved in our δ18otree records the eastern regional chronology exhibited much higher correlation with the δ18otree series from southeast china r 0 51 p 0 001 than with that from the indochina peninsula r 0 23 p 0 09 while the relationships were reversed for the western regional chronology fig s6 this suggests that in western eastern ygp and the indochina peninsula southeast china the formation of tree ring cellulose share a common moisture source 3 4 spatial patterns of rh monsoon rainfall δ18o and precipitation seasonality as tree ring δ18o is controlled by rainfall δ18o and rh the spatial characteristics of summer rh and δ18op were investigated after rpca processing the time series of rh from eight observational stations near the study sites were clustered into two groups fig s7a west and east which resembles the clustering pattern of δ18otree records from the eight sites in ygp fig 3a the western eastern regional rh series was significantly correlated with regional δ18otree chronology in western eastern ygp p 0 001 fig s7 therefore in these two separate regions summer humidity also changes under different modes and has close linkage with regional δ18otree variations mean values of summer rainfall δ18o over southeastern asia reflected a geographically depleted trend from coastal to inner areas with the most negative δ18op occurring in the tibetan plateau fig 5 specifically δ18op dramatically decreased northeastward with increasing distances from the eastern coast of the bay of bengal and reached the minimum at western ygp δ18op also isotopically decreased northwestward from the northern coast of the south china sea and reached the lowest value at ygp in addition summer δ18op showed relatively low values in the lower yangtze river compared with that in adjoining areas fig 5 after controlling the altitude effect conforming to the lapse rate of δ18op in south china as delineated by liu et al 2010 ygp is still located at the transitional region of the isotopically depleting spatial trends originating from the bay of bengal and south china sea respectively fig s8 this implies disparate water vapor sources contributing to summer rainfall in different areas of ygp furthermore we examined precipitation seasonality i e asm nsm precipitation ratios and its relationship with δ18otree precipitation seasonality considerably differed between western and eastern ygp with much higher asm nsm ratios in the west mean value 3 88 than in the east mean value 1 97 during the observation period fig s9 furthermore asm nsm ratios showed a significant correlation p 0 01 fig s9d with the regional δ18otree chronology in eastern ygp but not in the west fig s9c the different behaviors of precipitation seasonality indicate the diverse monsoon related moisture controls on the seasonal distribution of precipitation amount in the two regions 3 5 relationship with large scale atmospheric circulation we correlated our isotope data with monsoon indices to determine their relationships with monsoon dynamics the two regional δ18otree chronologies rpc1 rpc2 were found to be significantly and negatively correlated with ism variability sasmi p 0 01 but no significant correlation was observed with easm intensity easmi fig 6 furthermore multidecadal variations in ism shift concurrently with both the western and eastern regionally averaged chronologies fig s10 therefore ism variability is the main driver of δ18otree variations across ygp the relationships between δ18otree and enso revealed strong correlations between the western r 0 59 p 0 001 and eastern r 0 46 p 0 001 regional chronologies and the enso index fig 6 meanwhile the results of spatial correlation analyses showed that the two regional chronologies are strongly correlated with sst anomalies in the equatorial central to eastern pacific ocean fig s11 a key region of enso modes 4 discussion 4 1 hydroclimatic signals recorded in δ18otree variability precipitation δ18o and rh are crucial regional factors regulating annual variations in tree ring δ18o brunello et al 2019 li et al 2022 mccarroll and loader 2004 zeng et al 2016 strong correlations with summer rh were found not only in all site δ18otree chronologies fig s4 but also between regional scale chronologies rpc1 rpc2 and rh series fig s7 the west east divide in regional rh indicates that moisture conditions in the monsoon season of separate regions are not completely spatially homogeneous rh reflecting atmospheric moisture availability affects the isotopic composition of leaf water through its influence on stomatal conductance helliker and richter 2008 roden et al 2000 this effect can be recorded in cellulose δ18o associated with carbohydrate synthesis and manifests as the resulting remarkable δ18otree rh relationships however this relationship was weakened after the removal of regional scale common signals from each site chronology fig s7d implying that large scale hydroclimate signatures are encoded in individual δ18otree chronologies along with local humidity similarly δ18otree records across monsoon asia have been recognized as a combination of local and large scale hydroclimatic influences xu et al 2021 annual δ18o variations in tree rings are predominated by isotopic components of source water precipitation δ18o incorporated into trees during the process of cellulose synthesis mccarroll and loader 2004 roden et al 2000 song et al 2022 many recent studies have found evident relationships between tree ring δ18o and precipitation δ18o in upstream regions of moisture transport fan et al 2020 muangsong et al 2020 shi et al 2020 the highly significant correlations of our regional scale chronologies rpc1 rpc2 with climate in the upstream regions of moisture transport the northern indochina peninsula and southeast china fig 4 are actually a reflection of the effect of regional climate on isotopic fractionation of upstream atmospheric vapor transported from the tropical oceans midhun et al 2021 wei et al 2018 this change in water vapor δ18o influences downstream rainfall δ18o and is subsequently recorded in cellulose δ18o large scale atmospheric circulation controls regional hydroclimate dynamics that modulate the isotopic fractionation process of source water and moisture availability for trees in monsoon asia muangsong et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the δ18otree records in our study region are primarily controlled by ism fig 6 and s10 the persistently rising δ18otree values reaching an unprecedented level after the late 1960 s fig s10 may be linked to the concurrence of the secular ism weakening sinha et al 2015 this finding is in good agreement with previous studies reported in the ism easm transitional zone fan et al 2021 fan et al 2020 wang et al 2022b xu et al 2019 specifically there are two potential mechanisms with respect to the ism effect on cellulose δ18o on the one hand ism regulates tree ring δ18o by changing the amount of rainout between the tropical sources and tree ring sites xu et al 2013 yuan et al 2004 the intensification of ism activity induces more abundant rainfall along moisture transportation pathways kumar et al 2006 pausata et al 2011 which promotes isotopic depletion in atmospheric vapor upstream pausata et al 2011 wang et al 2017 this can result in more negative precipitation δ18o in downstream regions and consequently the depletion of cellulose δ18o on the other hand ism variability largely affects the amount of monsoon rainfall which alters the proportion of monsoon rainfall to annual total rainfall cai et al 2015 cheng et al 2009 different precipitation seasonality leads to distinct contributions of δ18o specific water sources the pacific indian ocean and local sources to local precipitation cheng et al 2009 wang et al 2001 wei et al 2018 however according to the results of this study the former appears to be the main mechanism modulating δ18otree variability across the ism easm transitional zone fig 4 whereas the latter mechanism modulates δ18otree variability in the eastern part of the study area as indicated by the significant correlation p 0 01 between asm nsm ratios and the regional δ18otree chronology in eastern ygp fig s9d in addition the significant relationships between regional δ18o chronologies and enso variability imply the control of enso on δ18otree which agrees with the strong enso effect on tree ring δ18o records across monsoon asia liu et al 2017 xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 4 2 distinct moisture transport processes reflected by regional hydroclimatic records regions where the climate strongly influences downstream tree ring δ18o can be regarded as the transport pathway through which water vapor is transported from tropical oceans to tree ring sites fan et al 2021 in this case the indochina peninsula and southeast china should be the paths along which moisture is transported from the bay of bengal and south china sea to ygp fig 4 meanwhile the spatial correlations between regional δ18otree chronologies rpc1 rpc2 and upstream climate show that water vapor contributing to western eastern ygp mainly originates from the bay of bengal bay of bengal and south china sea the common moisture signal for western eastern ygp and the indochina peninsula southeast china is confirmed by an inter regional synchrony in δ18otree records from these two regions fig s6 furthermore the inland isotopically declining trend in monsoon rainfall from the two oceans fig 5 bay of bengal and south china sea to ygp also suggests that the directions of air mass movement conform to the continental effect dansgaard 1964 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2022a these findings elucidate the distinct moisture sources and transport trajectories in the west and east of the ism easm transitional zone in fact the map of the present day pattern of atmospheric vapor flux vectors based on ncep ncar reanalysis data can also support this result kalnay et al 1996 fig s12 the western regions of the boundary line of 105 e receive major water vapor transported from the indian ocean and through the northern reaches of the bay of bengal fig s12 in contrast summer rainfall in eastern ygp and east areas principally comprises atmospheric vapor transported northeastward from the indian ocean via the southern bay of bengal and indochina peninsula as well as moisture transported northward from the south china sea fig s12 recently cai et al 2015 observed a disparity in climatic signatures of stalagmite δ18o records from southwest and eastern china and attributed it to the differing changes in atmospheric circulation and regional moisture trajectories using oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of seasonal precipitation li et al 2017 identified different moisture sources and advection paths to the ism and easm regions which are divided by a zonal boundary area extending northwestward from hong kong to northeastern ygp these results are coincident with our δ18otree based finding of different moisture transport processes in western and eastern parts of the ism easm transitional zone studies based on modern instrumental and paleo proxy records have emphasized the central role of ism in regulating multi scale monsoon season hydroclimate in both the ism and easm regions nevertheless easm signals are relatively weak pausata et al 2011 sinha et al 2015 xu et al 2013 in this study we identified the stronger correlations between the west east δ18otree variability and isotopic records in the indochina peninsula southeast china fig s6 and an east west clustering pattern in summer rh fig s7 revealing that monsoon related hydroclimate in different parts of the ism easm transitional zone was controlled by different moisture regimes although our tree ring δ18o records uniformly reflected ism variability fig 6 the east west δ18otree difference rpc2 minus rpc1 well captured hydroclimate variability in southeast china especially in the lower valley of yangtze river fig s13 p 0 05 monsoon season climate in this area is mainly modulated by easm variability liu et al 2022 wang and lin 2002 these findings suggest that summer moisture variability in the ism easm transitional zone is primarily regulated by ism with a relatively weak influence of easm enhanced relationships between the east west δ18otree gradient and hydroclimatic variables in southeast china actually reflect the easm effect on moisture condition in eastern ygp wang et al 2003 which is intensified after the removal of ism signal interestingly chinese speleothem δ18o records from both monsoon regions have been found to reflect ism variability liu et al 2015 pausata et al 2011 however li et al 2019 extracted the moisture signal of the pacific ocean after subtracting the normalized indian stalagmite δ18o series from the speleothem δ18o record from central china these results imply that the lack of easm signals in paleoclimatic proxy records obtained from the easm region and the ism easm transitional zone may be a consequence of obscuration by the stronger indian ocean moisture signal ism signal in fact water vapor transport from the pacific ocean is almost constant between the strong and weak ism years liu et al 2015 in this case the changes in water vapor flux in the easm region are mainly derived from the indian ocean liu et al 2015 pausata et al 2011 nevertheless our findings suggest that easm signals encoded in high resolution paleo proxy records from easm region can be obtained by removing the ism signal and strengthening the pacific ocean moisture signal 5 conclusions in this study we developed a new tree ring δ18o network 1870 2014 consisting of chronologies from the eight study sites in ygp we found that the eight site level chronologies mainly responded to local hydroclimatic variability in the monsoon season the tree ring δ18o network indicated an east west clustering pattern indicating δ18otree variability varied asynchronously in the west and east of ygp the first two rpcs of the δ18otree network accounted for 65 4 of the total variance and they were used to represent the regional scale δ18otree chronologies of western and eastern ygp respectively regional δ18otree variations were strongly linked to hydroclimate dynamics in upstream regions of moisture transport between tropical oceans and tree ring sites as revealed by spatial field correlations δ18otree records from western eastern ygp and the indochina peninsula southeast china showed inter regional coherency suggesting a joint moisture signal preserved in 18otree records over the two areas these findings suggest that the east west clustering pattern of δ18otree records from the ism easm transitional zone is driven by different moisture sources and transport pathways to respective regions this idea was confirmed by the distinct spatial pattern of gradual isotopic depletion of monsoon rainfall that originates from coastal areas of tropical oceans bay of bengal and south china sea to the study area and agreed with the present day pattern of atmospheric vapor transport during the monsoon season moreover the relationships between regional chronologies and atmospheric circulation demonstrated that annual variations in δ18otree records across the study area are dominantly regulated by ism and enso variability whereas the east west δ18otree gradient corresponded to easm related hydroclimatic signal this study revealed the spatial temporal characteristics of cellulose δ18o records across the ism easm transitional zone and their driving factors which will facilitate a convincing hydroclimatic interpretation of large scale paleo δ18o records and promote an integrated understanding of monsoon hydrological cycles in monsoon asia meanwhile the findings of this study also provide a paleo isotopic insight into moisture sources and monsoon related moisture transport over southeast asia which will benefit further development of isotope based hydroclimatic models on a larger spatiotemporal scale credit authorship contribution statement haowen fan conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft xiaohua gou supervision

2867,the east asian summer monsoon easm and indian summer monsoon ism are two interactive climate systems dominating the moisture variability of monsoon asia however ism easm interactions and their effects on regional moisture dynamics remain unclear this study investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of monsoon related hydroclimate variability by establishing a new tree ring oxygen isotope ratio δ18otree network of eight δ18otree records covering the last 150 years in southern china which differs from previous studies that used data from individual sites the δ18otree chronologies were found to be sensitive to regional hydroclimatic changes during the monsoon season the δ18otree network indicated an east west clustering pattern in the ism easm transitional zone which demonstrates an asynchrony in δ18otree variability in the west and east of this region regional variability of the west and east δ18otree modes reflected the different moisture signals as indicated by their significant correlations with modern observations and paleo δ18o records in disparate upstream regions of moisture transport the indochina peninsula and southeast china this finding was confirmed by the east west distinct pattern of spatial isotopic depletion of monsoon rainfall that originates from coastal areas of tropical oceans bay of bengal and south china sea to the study area as well as the consistent present day pattern of atmospheric vapor transport during the monsoon season in addition the west and east modes exhibited stronger associations with ism variability whereas the east west δ18otree gradient captured the easm related hydroclimatic signal suggesting that summer moisture variability in the ism easm transitional zone was regulated more by ism than by easm during the last 150 years the relationships between δ18otree and large scale ocean atmosphere interaction modes revealed that the el niño southern oscillation enso dominantly modulates δ18otree variability across southern china keywords tree rings oxygen isotope moisture signals atmospheric circulation hydroclimate variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the asian summer monsoon asm exerts a considerable and long lasting influence on asian ecosystems and cultural development cai et al 2019 kumar et al 2006 pausata et al 2011 yang et al 2021 which affects billions of people living in many developing countries chen et al 2022 wang et al 2017 asm consists of two systems that profoundly affect the climate dynamics of mainland asia namely the indian summer monsoon ism and east asian summer monsoon easm wang et al 2003 wang and lin 2002 wang et al 2017 ism and easm drive water vapor originating from the indian and pacific oceans to meet at their broad transitional zone 100 110 e 10 30 n which roughly covers the indochina peninsula and yunnan guizhou plateau ygp wang et al 2003 wang and lin 2002 however the dominant monsoon system and relative contributions of water vapor from the two oceanic sources to a given location in the ism easm transitional zone remains unclear midhun et al 2021 wang et al 2003 therefore the relationships between vapor transportation atmospheric processes and regional hydroclimatic characteristics between ism and easm regions need to be urgently determined pausata et al 2011 wang and lin 2002 xu et al 2021 modern meteorological observations are limited by insufficient temporal coverage therefore previous studies on the ism easm transitional zone have used various paleoclimatic proxy archives including stalagmites li et al 2017 tree rings fan et al 2020 wang et al 2022b and lake sediments lin et al 2021 to derive highly resolved and long term data of hydroclimatic changes thereinto stable oxygen isotope ratios in tree ring cellulose δ18otree are considered an indispensable paleoclimatic proxy that can consecutively encode natural variability of regional hydroclimate with precise dating seasonal to annual resolution and long time span beyond the instrumental period fan et al 2020 liu et al 2017 muangsong et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the year to year fluctuation in cellulose δ18o is dominantly determined by the isotopic signatures in the source water climate related fractionation and tree physiological processes helliker and richter 2008 roden et al 2000 making it sensitive to regional hydroclimate and large scale circulations fan et al 2020 muangsong et al 2020 xu et al 2021 however potential application of the spatiotemporal pattern of a δ18otree network to large scale hydroclimatic exploration is limited by the insufficient quantity of existing δ18otree records current studies of isotopic dendroclimatology over the ism easm transitional zone have paid specific attention to the identification of climatic factors and climate reconstruction from individual sites or a single tree species muangsong et al 2020 xu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 this leads to inter site diversity in primary controllers of δ18otree variability such as rainy season precipitation xu et al 2019 local humidity zhao et al 2019 source water δ18o fan et al 2020 muangsong et al 2020 and circulation processes fan et al 2021 impeding the large scale climatic interpretation of the tree ring δ18o proxy recently xu et al 2021 extracted the first principal component pc1 series from 24 δ18otree chronologies and emphasized that large scale circulation regulates coherent δ18otree variability in monsoon asia however inter regional differences in moisture signals encoded in tree ring δ18o records from the ism and easm regions have not been identified cai et al 2015 xu et al 2021 furthermore previous studies reported a disparity in climatic forcing between δ18o variability precipitation δ18o and chinese stalagmites δ18o from southwestern china and eastern china li et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 however there lacks further attempts in distinguishing moisture transport process in these two regions because of insufficient continuity and resolution of existing records in this case a tree ring δ18o network covering the ism easm transitional zone is required to synthetically identify its hydroclimatic characteristics and relationships with paleo proxy records in the ism and easm regions this study presents a precisely dated and annually resolved tree ring network consisting of eight δ18otree records across the ygp for investigating their spatiotemporal variability and climatic forcing we found an east west clustering pattern of the δ18otree network and hypothesized that it is caused by hydroclimate variability related to the different regional moisture transport processes the relationships between the two δ18otree modes and both observational and paleo δ18o records in the ism and easm regions were explored accordingly 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region ygp lies in the intersectional area of ism and easm fig 1 it is dominated by a monsoon climate characterized by warm and wet summers with water vapor mainly propagated from the south china sea scs and the indian ocean via ism and easm according to observational data from eight local meteorological stations near the study sites annual precipitation varies between 909 5 mm and 1416 1 mm with 60 88 of precipitation occurring in the rainy season mjjaso fig s1 annual mean temperature ranges from 10 7 to 18 7 and relative humidity rh varies between 71 5 and 84 2 fig s1 furthermore the landscape consists of rolling hills gorges and karst topography with elevation decreasing from the west to the east fig 1 the trees sampled from the study area grow at an altitudinal range from 700 m to more than 2 800 m a s l table s1 2 2 tree ring sampling and dating at each site two cores per tree were taken at a breast height of approximately 1 3 m above the ground using a 5 mm diameter increment corer a total of 382 cores were collected from 193 trees covering seven tree species table s1 the samples were prepared and processed following the standard dendrochronological techniques in the laboratory holmes 1983 stokes and smiley 1968 after crossdating the ring widths were measured using a velmex measuring system with an accuracy of 0 001 mm the quality of the crossdating result was validated using the cofecha software presented by holmes 1983 2 3 isotope measurement four precisely dated cores with legible ring boundaries and little false or missing rings from four different trees at every study site were determined for oxygen isotopic analyses pure α cellulose in every ring of the 32 increment cores 4 cores 8 sites was chemically extracted individually using the plate based extraction method modified by kagawa et al 2015 for each sample 100 250 μg of cellulose were weighted and wrapped in silver capsules subsequently oxygen isotope ratios 18o 16o were determined using a pyrolysis high temperature conversion elemental analyzer tc ea thermo scientific combined with a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms delta v advantage thermo scientific germany at the graduate school of environmental studies nagoya university japan a laboratory cellulose standard merck cellulose with known δ18o value was introduced between every eight sample measurements to monitor the precision and accuracy of the analytical process the analytical precision for the cellulose standards was lower than 0 2 as determined through repeated measurements the δ18o values of all tree ring samples are given in per mil units relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard conforming to the formula 1 δ 18 o t r e e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r is the 18o 16o ratio specifically a total of 4 498 cellulose samples from eight sites were isotopically measured in this study 2 4 development of the tree ring δ18o network to assess the inter tree consistency and representativeness of the sampled population the mean inter tree correlation rbar and expressed population signal eps were calculated for individual δ18otree series for each study site wigley et al 1984 finally eight δ18otree chronologies were obtained using averaged time series of four single cellulose δ18o sequences at the same location among them the four chronologies of western ygp are presented for the first time here whereas the remaining four wxt lsc lgs and shs in table s1 corresponding to the east have previously been reported fan et al 2021 fan et al 2020 furthermore to identify the spatial characteristics of the δ18otree network a rotated principal component analysis rpca that maximizes the spread of individual loadings was applied for all site level chronologies consequently the first several principal components rpcs of the isotope network are regarded as the regional scale δ18otree chronologies based on the highest loadings of site chronologies on the separate components in this regard these regional chronologies are mutually independent facilitating the identification of more reliable climatic signals in δ18otree records 2 5 climate data and analysis tools δ18otree climate relationships were identified using pearson s correlation analysis between δ18otree chronologies and local climate observed at meteorological stations fig s1 precipitation seasonality that is the seasonal distribution of precipitation throughout a year was calculated using the ratio of precipitation amount in the asm season may to september against that in the non asm season october to april based on instrumental data in eight stations worldwide climate fields of multiple climatic variables from the climatic research unit timeseries cru ts 4 04 dataset were utilized to represent large scale climate variability harris et al 2014 the cru ts dataset is a widely used climate dataset that possesses a high gridded resolution 0 5 0 5 over all land domains of the world except antarctica it has been developed through the interpolation of monthly climate from extensive networks of weather station observations harris et al 2014 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a climatic drought index combining multi scalar characteristics for drought assessment vicente serrano et al 2010 was employed to represent the regional moisture condition these climate fields were subsequently applied for spatial correlation analyses with regional scale δ18otree chronologies using knmi explorer https climexp knmi nl the effect of precipitation δ18o δ18op on the cellulose δ18o network was examined by comparing cellulose δ18o with amount weighted δ18op measurements from 24 observational stations from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip table s2 over southeastern and eastern asia the seasonal average δ18op during the summer season at each gnip station was firstly calculated as follows 2 δ 18 o p i n δ 18 o i p i i n p i where δ18o i and p i represent the precipitation δ18o and precipitation amount measured in the i th month respectively we averaged summer δ18op values in the years for which observational δ18op data from each gnip station were available subsequently the kriging interpolation method also known as the space self variance best interpolation method was used to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of summer δ18op this interpolation method is widely used in geological grid statistics including the determination of spatial pattern and prediction of precipitation δ18o juan et al 2020 liu et al 2013 we employed the south asian summer monsoon index sasmi 1948 2014 and east asian summer monsoon index easmi 1948 2014 to represent the strength of ism and easm respectively li and zeng 2002 the normalized all india monsoon rainfall index ismr was used as a relatively longer archive of ism intensity parthasarathy et al 1991 the variability of the el niño southern oscillation enso was represented by the niño3 4 index in which enso is defined as the mean of sea surface temperature sst anomaly in the niño 3 4 region huang et al 2017 3 results 3 1 site level characteristics of δ18otree records and climate signals high eps values over a threshold value of 0 85 and high rbar values over 0 6 support strong common signal among trees and thus robust chronology quality fig 2 b and s2 wigley et al 1984 the tree ring chronologies exhibited significant p 0 001 positive correlations during their common period fig 2a and table s3 nonetheless mean values of δ18otree measurements showed significant differences p 0 05 fig s3 among most of the eight sites and reached 4 7 with the lowest value recorded at southwestern ygp site met in fig 1 21 5 and the highest value at southeastern ygp site lsc in fig 1 26 2 although correlations between δ18otree chronologies and local climatic variables are different among study sites concurrent significant correlations p 0 05 between all of the eight chronologies and summer rh may to august were observed with coefficients varying from 0 31 to 0 53 fig s4 compared with temperature moisture related variables precipitation rh cloud cover and spei showed stronger correlations with δ18otree on the whole δ18otree in the study area is primarily controlled by hydroclimatic changes during the summer monsoon season 3 2 spatial characteristics of δ18otree network and regional chronologies the first two principal components explained 65 4 of the total variance 33 7 for rpc1 and 31 7 for rpc2 loadings on the first two rpcs indicated that annual variations of the four δ18otree records from western ygp vary asynchronously with the other four from eastern ygp fig 3 the mutually independent time series of rpc1 and rpc2 are regarded as the two regional scale δ18otree chronologies with respect to the high loadings of site chronologies fig 3a and table s4 specifically rpc1 rpc2 time series showed strongly significant correlation r 0 94 p 0 001 with regionally averaged δ18otree chronology in western eastern ygp fig s5 in other words the rpc1 series hereafter the western regional chronology and rpc2 series hereafter the eastern regional chronology represent interannual δ18otree variability over western and eastern ygp respectively moreover the western regional chronology exhibited a remarkable increasing trend over time p 0 001 but the eastern regional chronology did not show any such trend fig 3b therefore the western and eastern δ18otree changes are not consistent in terms of their annual to decadal variations and long term trends 3 3 relationships with regional climate and other δ18otree records we examined the relationships between regional δ18otree chronologies and large scale climate fields fig 4 the western regional chronology displayed significant negative correlations p 0 05 with precipitation cloud cover and spei in western ygp and the northern indochina peninsula fig 4 a prominent positive correlation was observed between the western chronology and temperature across western ygp the indochina peninsula and the indian subcontinent fig 4b furthermore significant correlations p 0 05 between the eastern regional chronology and the four climatic factors exhibited similar spatial distributions with a zonal pattern extending southwestward from eastern ygp to the northern indochina peninsula and extending eastward to southeast china fig 4e h the spatial difference in δ18otree climate relationships reveals the disparity in climatic controls and moisture source signals for trees growing in the west and east of ygp we then tested the relationships between our two regional δ18otree chronologies rpc1 rpc2 and two composite δ18otree records from the indochina peninsula and southeast china to verify moisture signals preserved in our δ18otree records the eastern regional chronology exhibited much higher correlation with the δ18otree series from southeast china r 0 51 p 0 001 than with that from the indochina peninsula r 0 23 p 0 09 while the relationships were reversed for the western regional chronology fig s6 this suggests that in western eastern ygp and the indochina peninsula southeast china the formation of tree ring cellulose share a common moisture source 3 4 spatial patterns of rh monsoon rainfall δ18o and precipitation seasonality as tree ring δ18o is controlled by rainfall δ18o and rh the spatial characteristics of summer rh and δ18op were investigated after rpca processing the time series of rh from eight observational stations near the study sites were clustered into two groups fig s7a west and east which resembles the clustering pattern of δ18otree records from the eight sites in ygp fig 3a the western eastern regional rh series was significantly correlated with regional δ18otree chronology in western eastern ygp p 0 001 fig s7 therefore in these two separate regions summer humidity also changes under different modes and has close linkage with regional δ18otree variations mean values of summer rainfall δ18o over southeastern asia reflected a geographically depleted trend from coastal to inner areas with the most negative δ18op occurring in the tibetan plateau fig 5 specifically δ18op dramatically decreased northeastward with increasing distances from the eastern coast of the bay of bengal and reached the minimum at western ygp δ18op also isotopically decreased northwestward from the northern coast of the south china sea and reached the lowest value at ygp in addition summer δ18op showed relatively low values in the lower yangtze river compared with that in adjoining areas fig 5 after controlling the altitude effect conforming to the lapse rate of δ18op in south china as delineated by liu et al 2010 ygp is still located at the transitional region of the isotopically depleting spatial trends originating from the bay of bengal and south china sea respectively fig s8 this implies disparate water vapor sources contributing to summer rainfall in different areas of ygp furthermore we examined precipitation seasonality i e asm nsm precipitation ratios and its relationship with δ18otree precipitation seasonality considerably differed between western and eastern ygp with much higher asm nsm ratios in the west mean value 3 88 than in the east mean value 1 97 during the observation period fig s9 furthermore asm nsm ratios showed a significant correlation p 0 01 fig s9d with the regional δ18otree chronology in eastern ygp but not in the west fig s9c the different behaviors of precipitation seasonality indicate the diverse monsoon related moisture controls on the seasonal distribution of precipitation amount in the two regions 3 5 relationship with large scale atmospheric circulation we correlated our isotope data with monsoon indices to determine their relationships with monsoon dynamics the two regional δ18otree chronologies rpc1 rpc2 were found to be significantly and negatively correlated with ism variability sasmi p 0 01 but no significant correlation was observed with easm intensity easmi fig 6 furthermore multidecadal variations in ism shift concurrently with both the western and eastern regionally averaged chronologies fig s10 therefore ism variability is the main driver of δ18otree variations across ygp the relationships between δ18otree and enso revealed strong correlations between the western r 0 59 p 0 001 and eastern r 0 46 p 0 001 regional chronologies and the enso index fig 6 meanwhile the results of spatial correlation analyses showed that the two regional chronologies are strongly correlated with sst anomalies in the equatorial central to eastern pacific ocean fig s11 a key region of enso modes 4 discussion 4 1 hydroclimatic signals recorded in δ18otree variability precipitation δ18o and rh are crucial regional factors regulating annual variations in tree ring δ18o brunello et al 2019 li et al 2022 mccarroll and loader 2004 zeng et al 2016 strong correlations with summer rh were found not only in all site δ18otree chronologies fig s4 but also between regional scale chronologies rpc1 rpc2 and rh series fig s7 the west east divide in regional rh indicates that moisture conditions in the monsoon season of separate regions are not completely spatially homogeneous rh reflecting atmospheric moisture availability affects the isotopic composition of leaf water through its influence on stomatal conductance helliker and richter 2008 roden et al 2000 this effect can be recorded in cellulose δ18o associated with carbohydrate synthesis and manifests as the resulting remarkable δ18otree rh relationships however this relationship was weakened after the removal of regional scale common signals from each site chronology fig s7d implying that large scale hydroclimate signatures are encoded in individual δ18otree chronologies along with local humidity similarly δ18otree records across monsoon asia have been recognized as a combination of local and large scale hydroclimatic influences xu et al 2021 annual δ18o variations in tree rings are predominated by isotopic components of source water precipitation δ18o incorporated into trees during the process of cellulose synthesis mccarroll and loader 2004 roden et al 2000 song et al 2022 many recent studies have found evident relationships between tree ring δ18o and precipitation δ18o in upstream regions of moisture transport fan et al 2020 muangsong et al 2020 shi et al 2020 the highly significant correlations of our regional scale chronologies rpc1 rpc2 with climate in the upstream regions of moisture transport the northern indochina peninsula and southeast china fig 4 are actually a reflection of the effect of regional climate on isotopic fractionation of upstream atmospheric vapor transported from the tropical oceans midhun et al 2021 wei et al 2018 this change in water vapor δ18o influences downstream rainfall δ18o and is subsequently recorded in cellulose δ18o large scale atmospheric circulation controls regional hydroclimate dynamics that modulate the isotopic fractionation process of source water and moisture availability for trees in monsoon asia muangsong et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the δ18otree records in our study region are primarily controlled by ism fig 6 and s10 the persistently rising δ18otree values reaching an unprecedented level after the late 1960 s fig s10 may be linked to the concurrence of the secular ism weakening sinha et al 2015 this finding is in good agreement with previous studies reported in the ism easm transitional zone fan et al 2021 fan et al 2020 wang et al 2022b xu et al 2019 specifically there are two potential mechanisms with respect to the ism effect on cellulose δ18o on the one hand ism regulates tree ring δ18o by changing the amount of rainout between the tropical sources and tree ring sites xu et al 2013 yuan et al 2004 the intensification of ism activity induces more abundant rainfall along moisture transportation pathways kumar et al 2006 pausata et al 2011 which promotes isotopic depletion in atmospheric vapor upstream pausata et al 2011 wang et al 2017 this can result in more negative precipitation δ18o in downstream regions and consequently the depletion of cellulose δ18o on the other hand ism variability largely affects the amount of monsoon rainfall which alters the proportion of monsoon rainfall to annual total rainfall cai et al 2015 cheng et al 2009 different precipitation seasonality leads to distinct contributions of δ18o specific water sources the pacific indian ocean and local sources to local precipitation cheng et al 2009 wang et al 2001 wei et al 2018 however according to the results of this study the former appears to be the main mechanism modulating δ18otree variability across the ism easm transitional zone fig 4 whereas the latter mechanism modulates δ18otree variability in the eastern part of the study area as indicated by the significant correlation p 0 01 between asm nsm ratios and the regional δ18otree chronology in eastern ygp fig s9d in addition the significant relationships between regional δ18o chronologies and enso variability imply the control of enso on δ18otree which agrees with the strong enso effect on tree ring δ18o records across monsoon asia liu et al 2017 xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 4 2 distinct moisture transport processes reflected by regional hydroclimatic records regions where the climate strongly influences downstream tree ring δ18o can be regarded as the transport pathway through which water vapor is transported from tropical oceans to tree ring sites fan et al 2021 in this case the indochina peninsula and southeast china should be the paths along which moisture is transported from the bay of bengal and south china sea to ygp fig 4 meanwhile the spatial correlations between regional δ18otree chronologies rpc1 rpc2 and upstream climate show that water vapor contributing to western eastern ygp mainly originates from the bay of bengal bay of bengal and south china sea the common moisture signal for western eastern ygp and the indochina peninsula southeast china is confirmed by an inter regional synchrony in δ18otree records from these two regions fig s6 furthermore the inland isotopically declining trend in monsoon rainfall from the two oceans fig 5 bay of bengal and south china sea to ygp also suggests that the directions of air mass movement conform to the continental effect dansgaard 1964 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2022a these findings elucidate the distinct moisture sources and transport trajectories in the west and east of the ism easm transitional zone in fact the map of the present day pattern of atmospheric vapor flux vectors based on ncep ncar reanalysis data can also support this result kalnay et al 1996 fig s12 the western regions of the boundary line of 105 e receive major water vapor transported from the indian ocean and through the northern reaches of the bay of bengal fig s12 in contrast summer rainfall in eastern ygp and east areas principally comprises atmospheric vapor transported northeastward from the indian ocean via the southern bay of bengal and indochina peninsula as well as moisture transported northward from the south china sea fig s12 recently cai et al 2015 observed a disparity in climatic signatures of stalagmite δ18o records from southwest and eastern china and attributed it to the differing changes in atmospheric circulation and regional moisture trajectories using oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of seasonal precipitation li et al 2017 identified different moisture sources and advection paths to the ism and easm regions which are divided by a zonal boundary area extending northwestward from hong kong to northeastern ygp these results are coincident with our δ18otree based finding of different moisture transport processes in western and eastern parts of the ism easm transitional zone studies based on modern instrumental and paleo proxy records have emphasized the central role of ism in regulating multi scale monsoon season hydroclimate in both the ism and easm regions nevertheless easm signals are relatively weak pausata et al 2011 sinha et al 2015 xu et al 2013 in this study we identified the stronger correlations between the west east δ18otree variability and isotopic records in the indochina peninsula southeast china fig s6 and an east west clustering pattern in summer rh fig s7 revealing that monsoon related hydroclimate in different parts of the ism easm transitional zone was controlled by different moisture regimes although our tree ring δ18o records uniformly reflected ism variability fig 6 the east west δ18otree difference rpc2 minus rpc1 well captured hydroclimate variability in southeast china especially in the lower valley of yangtze river fig s13 p 0 05 monsoon season climate in this area is mainly modulated by easm variability liu et al 2022 wang and lin 2002 these findings suggest that summer moisture variability in the ism easm transitional zone is primarily regulated by ism with a relatively weak influence of easm enhanced relationships between the east west δ18otree gradient and hydroclimatic variables in southeast china actually reflect the easm effect on moisture condition in eastern ygp wang et al 2003 which is intensified after the removal of ism signal interestingly chinese speleothem δ18o records from both monsoon regions have been found to reflect ism variability liu et al 2015 pausata et al 2011 however li et al 2019 extracted the moisture signal of the pacific ocean after subtracting the normalized indian stalagmite δ18o series from the speleothem δ18o record from central china these results imply that the lack of easm signals in paleoclimatic proxy records obtained from the easm region and the ism easm transitional zone may be a consequence of obscuration by the stronger indian ocean moisture signal ism signal in fact water vapor transport from the pacific ocean is almost constant between the strong and weak ism years liu et al 2015 in this case the changes in water vapor flux in the easm region are mainly derived from the indian ocean liu et al 2015 pausata et al 2011 nevertheless our findings suggest that easm signals encoded in high resolution paleo proxy records from easm region can be obtained by removing the ism signal and strengthening the pacific ocean moisture signal 5 conclusions in this study we developed a new tree ring δ18o network 1870 2014 consisting of chronologies from the eight study sites in ygp we found that the eight site level chronologies mainly responded to local hydroclimatic variability in the monsoon season the tree ring δ18o network indicated an east west clustering pattern indicating δ18otree variability varied asynchronously in the west and east of ygp the first two rpcs of the δ18otree network accounted for 65 4 of the total variance and they were used to represent the regional scale δ18otree chronologies of western and eastern ygp respectively regional δ18otree variations were strongly linked to hydroclimate dynamics in upstream regions of moisture transport between tropical oceans and tree ring sites as revealed by spatial field correlations δ18otree records from western eastern ygp and the indochina peninsula southeast china showed inter regional coherency suggesting a joint moisture signal preserved in 18otree records over the two areas these findings suggest that the east west clustering pattern of δ18otree records from the ism easm transitional zone is driven by different moisture sources and transport pathways to respective regions this idea was confirmed by the distinct spatial pattern of gradual isotopic depletion of monsoon rainfall that originates from coastal areas of tropical oceans bay of bengal and south china sea to the study area and agreed with the present day pattern of atmospheric vapor transport during the monsoon season moreover the relationships between regional chronologies and atmospheric circulation demonstrated that annual variations in δ18otree records across the study area are dominantly regulated by ism and enso variability whereas the east west δ18otree gradient corresponded to easm related hydroclimatic signal this study revealed the spatial temporal characteristics of cellulose δ18o records across the ism easm transitional zone and their driving factors which will facilitate a convincing hydroclimatic interpretation of large scale paleo δ18o records and promote an integrated understanding of monsoon hydrological cycles in monsoon asia meanwhile the findings of this study also provide a paleo isotopic insight into moisture sources and monsoon related moisture transport over southeast asia which will benefit further development of isotope based hydroclimatic models on a larger spatiotemporal scale credit authorship contribution statement haowen fan conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft xiaohua gou supervision

2868,this study evaluates the effect of cloud seeding on the increase of runoff or securing of additional water resources unlike previous studies this study concentrates more on the change of various components of the hydrologic processes both the event based analysis and the annual analysis are conducted to evaluate the change of these components the boryeong dam basin in korea is considered as a study basin the wrf weather research and forecasting model is used in the cloud seeding simulation while the prms precipitation runoff modeling system model is used in the rainfall runoff analysis the target years of this study are 2018 and 2019 as results the event based analysis shows that the infiltration effective rainfall interflow and direct runoff are increased relatively more among the eight rainfall runoff components considered in this study in particular the increase of interflow is noticeable more than 60 of the increased rainfall is found to contribute to the runoff increase in the annual analysis this ratio is found to become even higher the ratio is estimated to be more than 90 which is mostly due to the contribution of baseflow as important factors controlling the effectiveness of cloud seeding the effects of antecedent soil moisture and threshold daily rainfall depth on the increase of total runoff are also evaluated the results show that wet soil condition is more favorable to the successful cloud seeding experiment to secure additional water resources also it is confirmed that the cloud seeding experiment can be more effective when the daily rainfall is more than 20 mm finally the results of this study imply the efficiency of cloud seeding and its economic values are potentially high keywords cloud seeding additional water resources hydrologic

situation is the same in korea where more severe droughts have occurred since 2000 kim and park 2015 various counter measures have been explored to overcome the drought problem in some regions like

alternative but is also susceptible to pollution luoma and okkonen 2014 seeboonruang 2016 seawater desalination plants have some merits but their construction and maintenance expenses are high with large electric power demand krila 2015 rainmaking or cloud seeding is also being tried in many countries ben zvi and fanar 1997 levin et al 2010 acharya et al 2011 nims 2020 pokharel et al 2021 cloud seeding is a method of artificially increasing the rainfall in general seeding materials such as cacl2 are released to enhance the freezing of water vapor into rain drops zhu et al 2016 kulkarni et al 2019 neyman and scott 2021 as a result additional rainfall and the resultant additional water resources are expected cloud seeding as a tool for securing additional water resources was tried in israel and thailand in the 1950s and 1960s levi and rosenfeld 1996 levin et al 2010 and also in the us and australia in the 1990s king 1982 woodley et al 1994 ryan and king 1997 acharya et al 2011 pokharel et al 2021 some countries in southeastern asia like indonesia also conducted cloud seeding experiments to prepare for the hot and dry season significant increase of annual rainfall was reported as a result of those experiments silverman and sukarnjanaset 2000 maryadi et al 2015 in the 1990s cloud seeding experiments were reduced due to skepticism of the effectiveness of cloud seeding and its poor economic feasibility but these efforts recovered in the 2000s with the progress of computer simulation and observation technologies like radar and satellite more than 24 countries are known to have conducted cloud seeding experiments for the purpose of weather modification and the securing of water resources oh 2005 the national institute of meteorological sciences nims is the leading institute in the field of cloud seeding in korea the first experiment was performed in 1963 by releasing seeding material from airplane several experiments conducted in the 1990s and 2000s mainly due to the severe droughts over the korean peninsula demonstrated the positive effect of cloud seeding on rainfall increase oh 2005 in the 2010s a more systematic approach was tried including basic theoretical research numerical simulation and cloud seeding experiment using the airplane for validation nims 2016 the use of airplane for cloud seeding introduced in 2017 activated more and various experiments nims 2018 in the winter of 2019 a joint us korea project was also performed for about a month under the name of the international joint cloud observation and weather control experiment 2019 ijco wce 2019 this project confirmed the increase of water particles as a result of releasing seeding material ku et al 2020 increasing rainfall as an effect of cloud seeding experiment has been confirmed by many studies in us about 5 to 15 rainfall increase was observed during cloud seeding experiments in wyoming north dakota and california solak et al 1987 wma 2005 griffith et al 2007 breed et al 2008 wwdc 2010 acharya et al 2011 in australia about 5 to 30 rainfall increase was reported during experiments in adelaide tasmania and new england regions morrison et al 2009 beare et al 2010 smith 2021 rainfall increases due to cloud seeding experiments were about 10 to 20 in israel about 20 in jianxi province china and 27 in karnataka india gagin and neumann 1981 ben 1990 wang et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2019 although the extent of rainfall increase varies considerably depending on the region experiment period and experiment method the rainfall increase of 5 to 20 can be a plausible expectation from cloud seeding experiment on average many studies conducted worldwide have demonstrated the positive effect of cloud seeding however only a few studies have focused on their impact on the runoff or water resources as the additional rainfall is directly converted into runoff based on the rainfall runoff analysis the role of cloud seeding can be evaluated from the viewpoint of securing additional water resources in the 1980s and 1990s several studies on the cloud seeding experiment focused on the problem of water resources ben zvi 1988 ben zvi and langerman 1993 ben zvi and fanar 1997 based on comparison of the annual and monthly runoff they quantitatively confirmed the positive effect of cloud seeding experiment on the runoff increase acharya et al 2011 also performed a similar evaluation in the north platte river basin wyoming annual runoff simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic model was found to increase by 0 2 2 due to the rainfall increase by 0 1 5 in particular during the dry season the runoff increased by 0 1 5 a bit more than that during the wet season cloud seeding can also have some disadvantages for example there is a report on the possible urban flooding due to the cloud seeding dar consultant 2020 almheiri et al 2021 they showed that the cloud seeding in the uae was so successful in developing rainstorms but its excessive effect could lead extremely high rainfall doubled the values of i d f curves this result indicates the possibility of urban flood incurring the update of stormwater network design criteria to prevent inundation the purpose of this study is similar to that of several previous studies i e to evaluate the role of cloud seeding on the increase of runoff or the securing of additional water resources however this study more concentrates on the change of various components in the hydrologic processes these components include the interception infiltration effective rainfall evapotranspiration direct runoff baseflow and interflow in fact some of the components like the baseflow are long term ones while others like the direct runoff are rather short term ones the process like interflow is an intermediate one in this paper both the event based analysis and the annual analysis are conducted to evaluate the change of these components the boryeong dam basin is considered as a study basin as several severe droughts around this dam basin frequently occurred in the 2000s and 2010s the cloud seeding is a current issue in this region in the cloud seeding simulation the weather research and forecasting wrf model is used and in the rainfall runoff analysis the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model is used the target years of this study are 2018 and 2019 2 models 2 1 the weather research and forecasting wrf model for cloud seeding simulation the cloud seeding simulation using the weather research and forecasting wrf model a medium range atmospheric modeling and forecasting system designed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar skamarock et al 2008 is implemented by adding the seeding module to the morrison microphysical processes which include the sub processes of activation auto conversion deposition condensation freezing and contact freezing in this study the spectral bin microphysics sbm scheme khain et el 2004 was used in this scheme hydrometeors are classified into a total of seven types cloud droplets three types of ice particles plate shaped column shaped and branch shaped snow soft hail and hail four types of particles nacl cacl2 agi and dry ice can be considered as seeding materials in the case of warm clouds with a temperature above 0 cacl2 a hygroscopic material tends to promote the merging of rainwater particles in contrast for cold clouds with a temperature below 0 c agi which acts as the nucleus of ice crystal or dry ice a cooling material are released agi strengthens the ice crystal process in which supercooled water contents in the cold cloud could be transformed into precipitation this study used a cloud seeding simulation model developed by the national institute of meteorological sciences nims chae et al 2018 nims 2020 this model is a wrf model equipped with a cloud seeding module simulation data from the local data assimilation and prediction system ldaps a local forecast model produced by the kma were used every 3 h as a boundary condition cacl2 was used as a seeding material because the warm rain usually occurs in summer season in korea about 200 g min of cacl2 was sprayed during the period of 30 min after an hour from starting simulation at the altitude of 1 5 2 0 km in the seedability test area the meteorological simulation was implemented up to 24 h after the moment of seeding with an integration time interval of 5 s for 1 km of a horizontal grid the temporal resolution of the simulation was 1 h and the spatial resolution was 1 km2 to maximize the seeding effect the seeding simulation was conducted only when the daily precipitation was 20 mm or greater the target area of cloud seeding was divided into two zones i e a seedability test area and an expected precipitation area the seedability test area is where clouds with water contents grow actively and the expected precipitation area is where precipitation occurs the seedability test area of this study includes the west sea where strong storms are frequently developed and moved to the inland area with high rainfall intensity the active water content growth in the seedability test area was determined using the seedability index the seebability index was estimated by considering three factors such as the precipitable water ascending air speed and maximum cloud water mixing ratio these factors observed within the seedability test area were divided by their maximum values to estimate their relative ratios and the seedability index was determined to be their average the authors assumed that the activation and auto conversion of cloud is high when the seedability index is high nims 2020 the seeding materials could be released directly on the clouds or released on the area searched by tracking the horizontal wind in reverse trajectory the seeding materials are released for a total of 30 min for 15 min before and after the time for which the seedability is optimized in this study the cloud seeding simulation was also evaluated through the cloud seeding experiment first the diffusion process of the seeding materials was simulated with the numerical weather model this was to estimate the time when the seeding materials arrive at the target area it was also possible to estimate the remaining period of the seeding materials within the atmosphere next the seeding materials were released from the aircraft operating on the route considering the weather conditions and the cloud movement after seeding was completed by analyzing the change of the precipitation particles how many precipitation clouds were formed at the target area and how long they lasted were estimated finally the observation data from the automatic weather stations awss was used to confirm the increase of ground precipitation nims 2018 in case that the wrf rainfall and the aws rainfall were different the wrf rainfall was corrected by applying the ratio between the aws and wrf rainfall 2 2 the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model for rainfall runoff analysis the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model is a physically based deterministic semi distributed and long term runoff simulation model developed by the united states geological survey usgs leavesley et al 1983 all the rainfall runoff components such as interception infiltration effective rainfall direct runoff interflow and baseflow can be simulated by the prms model parameters of the prms model can be determined using meteorological data such as precipitation and temperature and maps that provide information of topography soil and land use the target basin can be divided into several sub basins which is called the hydrologic response unit hru in the prms model runoff simulation results of the entire basin are estimated by combining the results simulated from each hru by dividing the basin into the hrus the hydrologic processes for each sub basin can be evaluated separately more accurate runoff simulation can be expected simply because each sub basin is more homogeneous than the entire basin the rainfall runoff analysis in a basin is also based on the assumption that both the rainfall and basin characteristics are spatially homogeneous rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 jakeman et al 1990 sivapalan et al 1990 vieux 2001 this study used free prms model software provided by usgs https www usgs gov software precipitation runoff modeling system prms fig s1 in supplementary materials shows a structural diagram of the hydrologic processes considered in the prms model the parameters of the prms model can be divided into two types easy to estimate parameters eeps and difficult to estimate parameters deps eeps are those related to input data or the hydrologic processes that include interception direct runoff and the behavior of water in the soil eeps can be estimated based on data such as latitude and longitude dem land cover map soil map and forest type map on the other hand deps are those related to the hydrologic processes of evapotranspiration direct runoff behavior of water in soil and groundwater dep estimation should be accompanied by additional processes because they are difficult to estimate using only observed data for example it is possible to use the values suggested by the prms model to transfer the parameters of other basins with similar hydrologic characteristics into the target basin or to refer to previous studies after estimating the initial values of deps in some cases automatic parameter tuning techniques are applied to adjust them table s1 in supplementary materials summarizes the major eeps and deps of the prms model more detailed information of the parameters can be found in markstrom et al 2015 in this study the model parameters were determined by following the parameter estimation method proposed in the hydrologic survey report of geumgang river basin moct 2006 basically the eeps are estimated by analyzing the dem soil map land cover map forest type map etc then the deps related to the precipitation are determined using the areal mean precipitation for each hru next the evapotranspiration parameters are calibrated by balancing the water budget for each hru highly sensitive deps should then be determined using some automatic parameter tuning techniques the initial values of deps of the boryeong dam basin could also be determined by following the method in this report in fact the initial values of the deps of the boryeong dam basin were determined by transferring the deps of two dam basins one was the yongdam dam basin located near the boryeong dam basin while the other was the doam dam basin with similar scale and topographical characteristics as an automatic parameter tuning technique the rosenbrock method embedded in the prms model was used most of the deps were adjusted by the rosenbrock method but some of them were adjusted manually for example the overall and monthly water balance were balanced by adjusting the hamon monthly coefficient the baseflow coefficient i e the slope of the baseflow recession curve was adjusted by matching the simulated and observed runoff data 3 study basin and data 3 1 study basin this study considered the boryeong dam basin as the study basin the cloud seeding simulation as well the rainfall runoff analysis was performed for this basin the boryeong dam basin is a part of the geumgang river basin located in the middle of the korean peninsula the area of the boryeong dam basin is 163 6 km2 and the length of its mainstream is 22 3 km the dam basin is relatively small compared to the other multi purpose dams in korea as the available water resources from the basin are small i e the annual capacity of water supply from the boryeong dam is just 106 6 106 m3 the surrounding regions are still vulnerable to drought in particular in the 2010s there were three very severe droughts in this region when the boryeong dam was almost empty and the water supply stopped fig 1 shows the location and shape of the boryeong dam basin the cloud seeding experiment over the boryeong dam basin was done over the simulation domain red box in fig 1 additionally the green box in this figure represents the seedability test area where clouds with water contents grow actively and seeding materials were released the seedability test area of this study includes the west sea where strong storms are frequently developed and moved to the inland area with high rainfall intensity 3 2 data 3 2 1 observation data this study collected observation data like the precipitation temperature and runoff these observation data were mainly used to validate the prms model basically a long term rainfall runoff analysis requires data like the daily precipitation and temperature as input as in this study the cloud seeding was intermittently simulated whenever the daily rainfall intensity was higher than 20 mm the remaining part was filled with the observed rainfall data the effect of cloud seeding was evaluated by comparing the runoff hydrographs with the simulated rainfall data under seeded and unseeded conditions the temperature data required in the prms model are the daily mean maximum and minimum data all of which were also collected to be used in this study although no meteorological observation station is available within the boryeong dam basin one station exists in nearby boryeong city red pentagon in fig 1 all the meteorological data used in this study were those collected in this boryeong meteorological observation station the inflow data measured in the boryeong dam were used as the runoff data of the boryeong dam basin for most rivers in korea the dam inflow data are generally assumed to have higher accuracy than the runoff data noh et al 2008 lee et al 2010 this study used three years of data from 2017 to 2019 the data collected in 2017 were mostly used for the parameter estimation of the prms model while the remaining data from 2018 and 2019 were used to validate the simulated runoff and to evaluate the effect of cloud seeding on the runoff 3 2 2 simulation data of cloud seeding this study considered a total of 18 events of cloud seeding in the years 2018 and 2019 when the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more the domain for cloud seeding simluation covers a 219 km 159 km rectangle with a resolution of 1 km 1 km the boryeong dam basin is located in the eastern part of this domain fig 1 a significant portion of the domain includes the west sea of korea this domain setting is in fact related to the rainfall pattern around the korean peninsula due to the effect of westerlies most storms in the west sea move toward the korean peninsula the simulation results of cloud seeding within the boryeong dam basin were averaged to generate the daily rainfall input for the prms model the simulation data of cloud seeding is composed of two cases i e unseeded case and seeded case the unseeded case represents the simulation results of rainfall without releasing any seeding material while the seeded case represents the simulation results of rainfall with releasing the seeding material the unseeded case is generally used to evaluate the wrf model performance under the real meteorological condition however due to many reasons such as the nonlinear behavior of the meteorological system and the possible uncertainty of the input data components of cloud microphysics planetary boundary layer physics pbl and parameterizations the unseeded case can thus include some degree of error gayatri et al 2022 this is because complex natural spatiotemporal variability of cloud properties could introduce major uncertainties or errors in the cloud seeding simulation al hosari et al 2021 as this error can result in error in the runoff simulation this study tried to minimize the difference between the observed rainfall and those in the unseeded cases the method was simply to derive a ratio between the observed and simulated rainfall which was then applied to the simulated rainfall data in the seeded case only six events show rather large difference between the unseeded case and seeded case 4 results 4 1 parameter estimation of the prms model by following the methodology explained in section 2 2 the initial values of the prms model parameters were determined first easy to estimate parameters were estimated by analyzing the dem forest type map soil map land use map etc the basin area basin slope average elevation land cover type canopy density interception characteristic ratio of impervious area and maximum water storage within soil were also estimated and used as fixed values without further correction initial values of those difficult to estimate parameters were determined as the proposed values in the manual or the moct 2006 these difficult to estimate parameters were corrected by evaluating their effect on the behavior of evapotranspiration direct runoff soil moisture and baseflow finally the runoff related parameters and the soil related parameters were corrected by comparing the observed and the simulated hydrographs in this step the technique of minimum root mean square differences was applied the data collected in the year of 2017 were used for the parameter estimation of the prms model and the data collected in the years 2018 and 2019 were used for their validation the validation was done by comparing the observed and simulated hydrographs which fig 2 provides as this figure shows their overall shapes were very similar to each other quantitative measures of both hydrographs were also confirmed their similarity for example the mean flow rate of the observed hydrograph was 3 6 m3 s while that of the simulated hydrograph was similar at 3 8 m3 s the peak runoff rate occurred on july 1 2018 in the observed hydrograph was 186 9 m3 s while that in the simulated hydrographs was also similar at 177 5 m3 s in both cases the total volume of flows was also found to be 2 646 4 and 2 772 6 m3 s respectively overall their difference was less than 5 in all the measures mentioned above this difference was much smaller than the satisfactory level of 10 based on the moct guideline 2006 the prms model simulation was also evaluated using some indices like cc correlation coefficient and mae mean absolute error the estimated cc and mae were 0 77 and 2 4 m3 sec respectively which confirmed that the prms model setting was done properly 4 2 runoff analysis with simulated cloud seeding 4 2 1 event based evaluation in this part of the study the runoff simulation was performed using the prms model with the rainfall input simulated for the unseeded and seeded cases for the years 2018 and 2019 as mentioned in the previous section 3 2 2 the differences between the unseeded and seeded cases were distinct in several events including the event that occurred on july 27 2019 fig 3 compares some rainfall runoff components for a good sample with somewhat distinct difference between the unseeded case and seeded case i e the event on july 27 2019 and a bad sample without any noticeable difference between the unseeded case and seeded case i e the event on june 26 2018 interception infiltration effective rainfall baseflow interflow and direct runoff are among those characteristics compared in this figure in the good sample it was found that the infiltration effective rainfall interflow and direct runoff were increased in particular the increase of the interflow continued for several days after the rainfall on the other hand no obvious change could be found in the interception and baseflow as there was no obvious increase of rainfall in the bad sample it was not surprising to find no change in the rainfall runoff components for the good sample i e the event on july 27 2019 the effect of cloud seeding was quantitatively evaluated as a result of cloud seeding the total rainfall and total effective rainfall were increased and resulted in the increase of the direct runoff and interflow the total rainfall was increased by 1 35 the infiltration by 1 38 and the effective rainfall by 1 47 the total runoff was increased by 2 38 among which the increase of interflow was dominant at 3 31 the direct runoff was also increased by 1 79 but the increase of baseflow was limited to just 0 25 and no significant increase could be found in the interception no difference was found in the evapotranspiration as it was calculated independently of the daily rainfall in the prms model the increase of the total runoff was found to be higher than that of the total rainfall which was mainly due to most of the increased rainfall being contributed to the runoff rather than to interception and evapotranspiration obviously the contribution of cloud seeding to the runoff could be greater as the cloud seeding was done after the interception capacity was almost filled the increase of the runoff with respect to the increase of the total rainfall was quantified in this study by introducing the increase rate ir this ir was then used to evaluate the role or effectiveness of cloud seeding in additionally securing water resources the ir was calculated as follows 1 ir 100 runof f seeded r u n o f f unseeded rai n seeded r a i n unseeded where runof f seeded was the total runoff for the seeded case and runof f unseeded was the total runoff for the unseeded case also rai n seeded was the total rainfall for the seeded case and rai n unseeded was the total rainfall for the unseeded case the ir was estimated to be 64 7 for the good sample on july 27 2019 i e about 65 of the increased amount of total rainfall contributed to the increase of the total runoff however the ir for the bad sample on june 26 2018 was just 50 0 even though the ir for the bad sample was estimated to be a bit smaller than for the good sample it was still quite high that is regardless of any sample cases the contribution of the additional rainfall to the total runoff was found to be very much higher 4 2 2 annual evaluation table 1 shows that both the unseeded and seeded cases are summarized by the annual totals of rainfall interception infiltration effective rainfall baseflow direct runoff and total runoff as the cloud seeding experiment was done intermittently when the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more the remaining part was filled with the observed rainfall data the increase of total rainfall due to cloud seeding was 0 13 in the year 2018 and 0 40 in the year 2019 the increase of interception was not noticeable but the infiltration was increased by 0 14 and 0 57 in the years 2018 and 2019 respectively the increase of the total runoff was 0 17 and 0 64 respectively in particular it is noticeable that the increase of total runoff was a little higher than the increase of total rainfall this result was from the fact that most rainfall was not intercepted but contributed to the infiltration and direct runoff as a result all the baseflow interflow and direct runoff were increased to make the total runoff greater among those three runoff components the increase of interflow was found to be the highest that is its increase was 0 35 in the year 2018 and 1 30 in the year 2019 the increase of baseflow was found to be smaller than the other two the relative increase of total runoff was also evaluated by the ir as the ir represents the relative increase of total runoff to the increase of total rainfall it was possible to evaluate the role of cloud seeding more quantitatively as a result the ir for the year 2018 was estimated to be 94 1 and that of 2019 was estimated to be 90 9 simply it could be concluded that most of the increased rainfall by cloud seeding contributed to the total runoff these higher irs in the annual analysis than those in the event based analysis were mostly due to the contribution of baseflow that is as the response time from rainfall to baseflow is long it could not be considered in the event based analysis but in the annual analysis 4 3 runoff analysis with scenario based cloud seeding simulation 4 3 1 event based analysis as the increase in rainfall was small in the simulation of cloud seeding experiment this study additionally considered a scenario of rainfall increase this study considered the four cases of 5 10 15 and 20 of rainfall increase by cloud seeding the cloud seeding experiment was also done similarly to the original experiment when the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more these four cases of rainfall increase in this study were assumed by considering the previous studies on cloud seeding where the increase rate was reported from 5 to a maximum 30 depending on the local climate conditions acharya et al 2011 griffith et al 2007 solak et al 1987 kulkarni et al 2019 curic et al 2019 as the previous studies were carried out at different regions the maximum increase in this study was set to be 20 which was conservatively assumed by considering the discrepancies of topographic and climatic conditions at different regions the event based simulation results were evaluated for the two events that occurred around july 27 and september 5 2019 fig 4 as the cloud seeding experiment was done whenever the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more the event on july 27 2019 contained three cloud seeding experiments but the event on september 5 2019 contained two experiments during the 21 day period these experiments are denoted by red dots in fig 4 in fig 4 the instant change of infiltration and effective rainfall can be seen but the interception did not show any obvious change the direct runoff was also instantly increased at the same day of rainfall increase but the change of interflow lasted several days after the rainfall increase however no change could be detected in the baseflow during this short 21 day period among those rainfall runoff components the increase rate of interflow was found to be greater these two events were also compared quantitatively with the relative increase of each component to the rainfall increase as explained earlier in fig 4 the most outstanding result was that most of the rainfall increase contributed to the runoff increase in the case of 5 rainfall increase the total runoff increase was marked to be 9 53 in the event around july 27 2019 and 8 72 in the event around september 5 2019 in the case of 20 rainfall increase the total runoff was increased by 39 02 and 35 64 respectively for those two events the ir was estimated to be about 70 for both events also in both cases the increase of interception was minimal but the increase of infiltration and direct runoff was noticeable among runoff components the interflow was also found to be highly increased in the case of 20 rainfall increase the interflow was increased by 52 and 130 respectively for those two events the increase rate of direct runoff was found to be similar to that of the effective rainfall 4 3 2 annual analysis annual simulation of rainfall runoff was also performed with the same scenarios as in the previous section it was simply assumed that the annual rainfall was increased by 5 10 15 and 20 however the cloud seeding experiment was only conducted when the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more see the vertical arrows in fig 5 fig 5 compares the simulation results as in the previous cases the increases of interception were all minimal but the increase of effective rainfall was found to be dominant among the runoff components the increases of interflow and direct runoff were dominant as the increase of total rainfall became more the difference between the unseeded and seeded cases was found to be more distinctly observable table 2 summarizes the results of annual simulation for the years of 2018 and 2019 for the scenario with the 20 increase of annual rainfall the total runoff was increased by 26 27 in 2018 and 30 29 in 2019 in all four scenarios considered in this study the increase ratio of runoff was also greater than that of the total rainfall as with the event based analysis the increase ratio of effective rainfall was similar to that of direct runoff the increase of interflow was also noticeable in this annual simulation the increases of interception were all small in both years but much smaller in the year 2019 on the other hand the infiltration was increased more in 2019 which resulted in more increase of baseflow and interflow overall the increase of total runoff in 2019 was found to be more than that in 2018 the ir was about 95 which was higher than that for the event based analysis as mentioned earlier this result was mainly due to the baseflow only being considered in the annual analysis 5 discussion 5 1 effect of antecedent soil moisture antecedent soil moisture is an important factor to control the infiltration and thus the direct runoff more antecedent soil moisture wet soil decreases the infiltration but increases the effective rainfall on the other hand in less antecedent soil moisture dry soil condition the infiltration becomes dominant runoff pattern is very dependent upon these relative portions of infiltration and effective rainfall the antecedent soil moisture can also play an important role in the cloud seeding experiment however as the cloud seeding causes additional rain to the given situation the role of antecedent soil moisture can be somewhat different in this part of the study the effects of cloud seeding on various rainfall runoff components were evaluated under the two conditions with large or small antecedent soil moisture amount the large or small antecedent soil moisture amounts were quantified by the concept of antecedent moisture conditions amcs with 5 day antecedent precipitation amount p5 i e amc 1 for dry condition amc ii for normal condition and amc iii for wet condition in korea amc i is defined when p5 is less than 35 5 mm and amc iii when p5 is larger than 53 3 mm in between the two is the amc ii condition yoon 2007 two rainfall events were selected to evaluate the effect of the antecedent soil moisture the first event on july 27 2019 was the case for amc 1 when the p5 was just 4 8 mm the second event on september 3 2018 was the case for amc iii with its p5 of 71 7 mm in this study the same scenarios of cloud seeding in section 4 3 were considered and table 3 compares the results as can be expected when the soil is dry more rainfall is infiltrated the infiltrated water can also contribute to the interflow on the other hand when the soil is wet less rainfall is infiltrated as the amount of effective rainfall becomes greater the direct runoff also becomes greater regardless of the soil condition however the overall effect of cloud seeding was somewhat different that is the ir under the amc i condition was just 68 71 but under the amc iii condition the ir was estimated to be as high as 91 94 this result indicates that wet soil condition is more favorable to the successful cloud seeding experiment 5 2 on the threshold daily rainfall for the cloud seeding experiment in the cloud seeding experiment of this study with the wrf model the daily rainfall of 20 mm was considered as the threshold value that is the cloud seeding experiment was conducted only when the daily rainfall was higher than or equal to 20 mm nims 2020 however the threshold value of 20 mm was determined rather arbitrarily this part of the study evaluates the sensitivity of this threshold daily rainfall on the runoff three simple cases were compared for the possible threshold values the daily rainfall of 0 to 10 mm the daily rainfall of 10 to 20 mm and the daily rainfall greater than 20 mm as in the previous section 5 1 four cloud seeding scenarios were considered in this section three rainfall events were selected for the three cases the first event that occurred on june 9 2018 5 8 mm was for the case of the threshold daily rainfall of 0 to 10 mm the second event that occurred on october 28 2018 15 7 mm was for the case of the threshold daily rainfall from 10 to 20 mm finally the rainfall event that occurred on july 27 2019 26 6 mm was for the case of the threshold daily rainfall of greater than 20 mm table 4 summarizes the simulation results of these three cases the relative portions of the interception infiltration and effective rainfall vary considerably depending on the rainfall amount in the case of small daily rainfall i e 0 10 mm in this study most of the increased rainfall was intercepted and little contributed to the infiltration and effective rainfall as a result no obvious change was found in the three runoff components on the other hand in the case of large daily rainfall i e 20 mm or more most of the increased rainfall contributed to the increase of infiltration and effective rainfall the change of interception was small in particular the increase of the infiltration was found to be significant and as a result the increase of the interflow was found to be very significant the result of the case of medium daily rainfall i e 10 20 mm was in between the previous two cases comparison of these three cases shows that when the daily rainfall was greater than 20 mm the cloud seeding experiment could be more effective when the daily rainfall was very small no effect of cloud seeding could be expected and when the daily rainfall was 10 20 mm the effect of cloud seeding was also small as a result it could be concluded that the choice of 20 mm as a threshold daily rainfall for the cloud seeding experiment was appropriate additionally it is also noticeable that the greatest effect of cloud seeding was from the increase of infiltration and the resulting interflow however if the soil moisture was wetter the contribution of the increased effective rainfall and the resulting direct runoff could be greater this possibility was evaluated in the previous section 5 1 5 3 potential efficiency of cloud seeding to secure water resources and its economic implications the results of this study presented the possibility to secure additional water resources by cloud seeding first the increase of total runoff by cloud seeding in a dam basin can alleviate drought by increasing the water supply to the domestic and industrial sectors as well as the agricultural sector however only a minor enhancement in the rainfall is found in the numerical experiment for the two years that were explored this small amount of additional water resources was obviously due to the small increase of rainfall in the cloud seeding experiment this is because complex natural spatiotemporal variability of cloud properties could introduce major uncertainties or errors in the cloud seeding simulation al hosari et al 2021 even though the secured water resources by experiment are not as much as expected it is not so disappointing as most of the increased rainfall is converted into the increase of total runoff furthermore a relatively high increase of effective rainfall and direct runoff means that cloud seeding can be efficient to secure water resources directly from the ground surface based on the scenario based simulations more practical results can be derived for example the additionally secured water resources under the 20 increase scenario were estimated to be about 42 9 106 m3 for the year 2018 and about 23 9 106 m3 for the year 2019 as the same scenario of 20 rainfall increase was applied more water resources could be secured in the wet year 2018 than the dry year 2019 however it is also true that the additionally secured water resource for the year 2019 was more than 20 of the annual water supply capacity of the boryeong dam 106 6 106 m3 as the cloud seeding experiment was conducted during rather wet condition it was possible to harvest most of the increased rainfall as additional water resources in this study four different prices were considered for the economical evaluation of the additional water resources i e raw water price from dam raw water price from the multi regional water supply system water price from the local water supply system and the water price in the mineral water market the value of the additional water resources secured by the cloud seeding was estimated in table s2 in supplementary materials using various water prices in korea if applying the raw water price from dam the cloud seeding experiment may not be very economical however if the water price in the mineral water market is considered the value of additionally secured water resources becomes very high at more than two billion us dollars it should be also noted that the value of additional water resources must be more than simply the raw water price when the cloud seeding experiment is considered in a serious drought situation 6 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the effect of cloud seeding on the increase of runoff or securing additional water resources based on both event based and annual analysis unlike previous studies this study concentrated more on the change of various components of hydrologic processes the event based analysis showed that when the rainfall increase was rather high the infiltration effective rainfall interflow and direct runoff significantly increased in particular the increase of the interflow was noticeable but no obvious change could be found in the interception and baseflow more than 60 of the increased rainfall was found to contribute to the runoff increase this ratio was estimated to be more than 90 which indicates that most of the increased rainfall by cloud seeding contributed to the total runoff in fact this higher increase in the annual analysis was mostly due to the contribution of baseflow as the response time from rainfall to baseflow is long it could not be considered in the event based analysis but was in the annual analysis similar results could also be derived in the runoff analysis with scenario based cloud seeding simulation as the increase of total rainfall became greater the difference between the unseeded and seeded cases was found to be more distinctly observable as important factors controlling the effectiveness of cloud seeding this study evaluated the role of antecedent soil moisture and the threshold daily rainfall depth on the increase of total runoff first when the soil was dry more rainfall was infiltrated as a result a significant increase of interflow could be detected on the other hand when the soil was wet more direct runoff could be detected however the overall effect of cloud seeding was higher when the soil was wet this result indicates that wet soil condition is more favorable to the successful cloud seeding experiment to secure additional water resources secondly the effect of threshold daily rainfall was also found to be very important in the case of small daily rainfall i e 0 10 mm in this study no obvious change could be found in the three runoff components on the other hand in the case of large daily rainfall i e 20 mm or more most of the increased rainfall contributed to the increase of infiltration and effective rainfall comparison of these cases shows that when the daily rainfall is more than 20 mm the cloud seeding experiment could be more effective the results of this study presented the possibility to secure additional water resources by cloud seeding first the increase of total runoff by cloud seeding in a dam basin can alleviate drought by increasing the water supply to the domestic and industrial sectors as well as the agricultural sector even though the secured water resources by experiment are not as much as expected it is not so disappointing as most of the increased rainfall is converted into the increase of total runoff furthermore a relatively high increase of effective rainfall and direct runoff means that cloud seeding can be efficient to secure water resources directly from the ground surface the value of the additional water resources secured by the cloud seeding was also found to be high especially when the water price in the mineral water market is considered

2868,this study evaluates the effect of cloud seeding on the increase of runoff or securing of additional water resources unlike previous studies this study concentrates more on the change of various components of the hydrologic processes both the event based analysis and the annual analysis are conducted to evaluate the change of these components the boryeong dam basin in korea is considered as a study basin the wrf weather research and forecasting model is used in the cloud seeding simulation while the prms precipitation runoff modeling system model is used in the rainfall runoff analysis the target years of this study are 2018 and 2019 as results the event based analysis shows that the infiltration effective rainfall interflow and direct runoff are increased relatively more among the eight rainfall runoff components considered in this study in particular the increase of interflow is noticeable more than 60 of the increased rainfall is found to contribute to the runoff increase in the annual analysis this ratio is found to become even higher the ratio is estimated to be more than 90 which is mostly due to the contribution of baseflow as important factors controlling the effectiveness of cloud seeding the effects of antecedent soil moisture and threshold daily rainfall depth on the increase of total runoff are also evaluated the results show that wet soil condition is more favorable to the successful cloud seeding experiment to secure additional water resources also it is confirmed that the cloud seeding experiment can be more effective when the daily rainfall is more than 20 mm finally the results of this study imply the efficiency of cloud seeding and its economic values are potentially high keywords cloud seeding additional water resources hydrologic processes wrf model prms model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in many countries climate change due to global warming is making it much harder to secure water resources strzepek et al 2010 cook et al 2018 more frequent and long lasting droughts exacerbate the supply of sufficient water to sectors like agriculture and the ecosystem stagge et al 2015 medellín azuara et al 2016 kuwayama et al 2019 regional and seasonal concentrations of rainfall and water resources also increase the risk of water shortage aslin and russell 2008 edwards et al 2019 this situation is the same in korea where more severe droughts have occurred since 2000 kim and park 2015 various counter measures have been explored to overcome the drought problem in some regions like small islands and rural areas rainwater harvesting can be effective but it can secure only a small amount of water resources falkland 1999 kim 2014 kang et al 2021 pumping groundwater can be an alternative but is also susceptible to pollution luoma and okkonen 2014 seeboonruang 2016 seawater desalination plants have some merits but their construction and maintenance expenses are high with large electric power demand krila 2015 rainmaking or cloud seeding is also being tried in many countries ben zvi and fanar 1997 levin et al 2010 acharya et al 2011 nims 2020 pokharel et al 2021 cloud seeding is a method of artificially increasing the rainfall in general seeding materials such as cacl2 are released to enhance the freezing of water vapor into rain drops zhu et al 2016 kulkarni et al 2019 neyman and scott 2021 as a result additional rainfall and the resultant additional water resources are expected cloud seeding as a tool for securing additional water resources was tried in israel and thailand in the 1950s and 1960s levi and rosenfeld 1996 levin et al 2010 and also in the us and australia in the 1990s king 1982 woodley et al 1994 ryan and king 1997 acharya et al 2011 pokharel et al 2021 some countries in southeastern asia like indonesia also conducted cloud seeding experiments to prepare for the hot and dry season significant increase of annual rainfall was reported as a result of those experiments silverman and sukarnjanaset 2000 maryadi et al 2015 in the 1990s cloud seeding experiments were reduced due to skepticism of the effectiveness of cloud seeding and its poor economic feasibility but these efforts recovered in the 2000s with the progress of computer simulation and observation technologies like radar and satellite more than 24 countries are known to have conducted cloud seeding experiments for the purpose of weather modification and the securing of water resources oh 2005 the national institute of meteorological sciences nims is the leading institute in the field of cloud seeding in korea the first experiment was performed in 1963 by releasing seeding material from airplane several experiments conducted in the 1990s and 2000s mainly due to the severe droughts over the korean peninsula demonstrated the positive effect of cloud seeding on rainfall increase oh 2005 in the 2010s a more systematic approach was tried including basic theoretical research numerical simulation and cloud seeding experiment using the airplane for validation nims 2016 the use of airplane for cloud seeding introduced in 2017 activated more and various experiments nims 2018 in the winter of 2019 a joint us korea project was also performed for about a month under the name of the international joint cloud observation and weather control experiment 2019 ijco wce 2019 this project confirmed the increase of water particles as a result of releasing seeding material ku et al 2020 increasing rainfall as an effect of cloud seeding experiment has been confirmed by many studies in us about 5 to 15 rainfall increase was observed during cloud seeding experiments in wyoming north dakota and california solak et al 1987 wma 2005 griffith et al 2007 breed et al 2008 wwdc 2010 acharya et al 2011 in australia about 5 to 30 rainfall increase was reported during experiments in adelaide tasmania and new england regions morrison et al 2009 beare et al 2010 smith 2021 rainfall increases due to cloud seeding experiments were about 10 to 20 in israel about 20 in jianxi province china and 27 in karnataka india gagin and neumann 1981 ben 1990 wang et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2019 although the extent of rainfall increase varies considerably depending on the region experiment period and experiment method the rainfall increase of 5 to 20 can be a plausible expectation from cloud seeding experiment on average many studies conducted worldwide have demonstrated the positive effect of cloud seeding however only a few studies have focused on their impact on the runoff or water resources as the additional rainfall is directly converted into runoff based on the rainfall runoff analysis the role of cloud seeding can be evaluated from the viewpoint of securing additional water resources in the 1980s and 1990s several studies on the cloud seeding experiment focused on the problem of water resources ben zvi 1988 ben zvi and langerman 1993 ben zvi and fanar 1997 based on comparison of the annual and monthly runoff they quantitatively confirmed the positive effect of cloud seeding experiment on the runoff increase acharya et al 2011 also performed a similar evaluation in the north platte river basin wyoming annual runoff simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic model was found to increase by 0 2 2 due to the rainfall increase by 0 1 5 in particular during the dry season the runoff increased by 0 1 5 a bit more than that during the wet season cloud seeding can also have some disadvantages for example there is a report on the possible urban flooding due to the cloud seeding dar consultant 2020 almheiri et al 2021 they showed that the cloud seeding in the uae was so successful in developing rainstorms but its excessive effect could lead extremely high rainfall doubled the values of i d f curves this result indicates the possibility of urban flood incurring the update of stormwater network design criteria to prevent inundation the purpose of this study is similar to that of several previous studies i e to evaluate the role of cloud seeding on the increase of runoff or the securing of additional water resources however this study more concentrates on the change of various components in the hydrologic processes these components include the interception infiltration effective rainfall evapotranspiration direct runoff baseflow and interflow in fact some of the components like the baseflow are long term ones while others like the direct runoff are rather short term ones the process like interflow is an intermediate one in this paper both the event based analysis and the annual analysis are conducted to evaluate the change of these components the boryeong dam basin is considered as a study basin as several severe droughts around this dam basin frequently occurred in the 2000s and 2010s the cloud seeding is a current issue in this region in the cloud seeding simulation the weather research and forecasting wrf model is used and in the rainfall runoff analysis the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model is used the target years of this study are 2018 and 2019 2 models 2 1 the weather research and forecasting wrf model for cloud seeding simulation the cloud seeding simulation using the weather research and forecasting wrf model a medium range atmospheric modeling and forecasting system designed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar skamarock et al 2008 is implemented by adding the seeding module to the morrison microphysical processes which include the sub processes of activation auto conversion deposition condensation freezing and contact freezing in this study the spectral bin microphysics sbm scheme khain et el 2004 was used in this scheme hydrometeors are classified into a total of seven types cloud droplets three types of ice particles plate shaped column shaped and branch shaped snow soft hail and hail four types of particles nacl cacl2 agi and dry ice can be considered as seeding materials in the case of warm clouds with a temperature above 0 cacl2 a hygroscopic material tends to promote the merging of rainwater particles in contrast for cold clouds with a temperature below 0 c agi which acts as the nucleus of ice crystal or dry ice a cooling material are released agi strengthens the ice crystal process in which supercooled water contents in the cold cloud could be transformed into precipitation this study used a cloud seeding simulation model developed by the national institute of meteorological sciences nims chae et al 2018 nims 2020 this model is a wrf model equipped with a cloud seeding module simulation data from the local data assimilation and prediction system ldaps a local forecast model produced by the kma were used every 3 h as a boundary condition cacl2 was used as a seeding material because the warm rain usually occurs in summer season in korea about 200 g min of cacl2 was sprayed during the period of 30 min after an hour from starting simulation at the altitude of 1 5 2 0 km in the seedability test area the meteorological simulation was implemented up to 24 h after the moment of seeding with an integration time interval of 5 s for 1 km of a horizontal grid the temporal resolution of the simulation was 1 h and the spatial resolution was 1 km2 to maximize the seeding effect the seeding simulation was conducted only when the daily precipitation was 20 mm or greater the target area of cloud seeding was divided into two zones i e a seedability test area and an expected precipitation area the seedability test area is where clouds with water contents grow actively and the expected precipitation area is where precipitation occurs the seedability test area of this study includes the west sea where strong storms are frequently developed and moved to the inland area with high rainfall intensity the active water content growth in the seedability test area was determined using the seedability index the seebability index was estimated by considering three factors such as the precipitable water ascending air speed and maximum cloud water mixing ratio these factors observed within the seedability test area were divided by their maximum values to estimate their relative ratios and the seedability index was determined to be their average the authors assumed that the activation and auto conversion of cloud is high when the seedability index is high nims 2020 the seeding materials could be released directly on the clouds or released on the area searched by tracking the horizontal wind in reverse trajectory the seeding materials are released for a total of 30 min for 15 min before and after the time for which the seedability is optimized in this study the cloud seeding simulation was also evaluated through the cloud seeding experiment first the diffusion process of the seeding materials was simulated with the numerical weather model this was to estimate the time when the seeding materials arrive at the target area it was also possible to estimate the remaining period of the seeding materials within the atmosphere next the seeding materials were released from the aircraft operating on the route considering the weather conditions and the cloud movement after seeding was completed by analyzing the change of the precipitation particles how many precipitation clouds were formed at the target area and how long they lasted were estimated finally the observation data from the automatic weather stations awss was used to confirm the increase of ground precipitation nims 2018 in case that the wrf rainfall and the aws rainfall were different the wrf rainfall was corrected by applying the ratio between the aws and wrf rainfall 2 2 the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model for rainfall runoff analysis the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model is a physically based deterministic semi distributed and long term runoff simulation model developed by the united states geological survey usgs leavesley et al 1983 all the rainfall runoff components such as interception infiltration effective rainfall direct runoff interflow and baseflow can be simulated by the prms model parameters of the prms model can be determined using meteorological data such as precipitation and temperature and maps that provide information of topography soil and land use the target basin can be divided into several sub basins which is called the hydrologic response unit hru in the prms model runoff simulation results of the entire basin are estimated by combining the results simulated from each hru by dividing the basin into the hrus the hydrologic processes for each sub basin can be evaluated separately more accurate runoff simulation can be expected simply because each sub basin is more homogeneous than the entire basin the rainfall runoff analysis in a basin is also based on the assumption that both the rainfall and basin characteristics are spatially homogeneous rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 jakeman et al 1990 sivapalan et al 1990 vieux 2001 this study used free prms model software provided by usgs https www usgs gov software precipitation runoff modeling system prms fig s1 in supplementary materials shows a structural diagram of the hydrologic processes considered in the prms model the parameters of the prms model can be divided into two types easy to estimate parameters eeps and difficult to estimate parameters deps eeps are those related to input data or the hydrologic processes that include interception direct runoff and the behavior of water in the soil eeps can be estimated based on data such as latitude and longitude dem land cover map soil map and forest type map on the other hand deps are those related to the hydrologic processes of evapotranspiration direct runoff behavior of water in soil and groundwater dep estimation should be accompanied by additional processes because they are difficult to estimate using only observed data for example it is possible to use the values suggested by the prms model to transfer the parameters of other basins with similar hydrologic characteristics into the target basin or to refer to previous studies after estimating the initial values of deps in some cases automatic parameter tuning techniques are applied to adjust them table s1 in supplementary materials summarizes the major eeps and deps of the prms model more detailed information of the parameters can be found in markstrom et al 2015 in this study the model parameters were determined by following the parameter estimation method proposed in the hydrologic survey report of geumgang river basin moct 2006 basically the eeps are estimated by analyzing the dem soil map land cover map forest type map etc then the deps related to the precipitation are determined using the areal mean precipitation for each hru next the evapotranspiration parameters are calibrated by balancing the water budget for each hru highly sensitive deps should then be determined using some automatic parameter tuning techniques the initial values of deps of the boryeong dam basin could also be determined by following the method in this report in fact the initial values of the deps of the boryeong dam basin were determined by transferring the deps of two dam basins one was the yongdam dam basin located near the boryeong dam basin while the other was the doam dam basin with similar scale and topographical characteristics as an automatic parameter tuning technique the rosenbrock method embedded in the prms model was used most of the deps were adjusted by the rosenbrock method but some of them were adjusted manually for example the overall and monthly water balance were balanced by adjusting the hamon monthly coefficient the baseflow coefficient i e the slope of the baseflow recession curve was adjusted by matching the simulated and observed runoff data 3 study basin and data 3 1 study basin this study considered the boryeong dam basin as the study basin the cloud seeding simulation as well the rainfall runoff analysis was performed for this basin the boryeong dam basin is a part of the geumgang river basin located in the middle of the korean peninsula the area of the boryeong dam basin is 163 6 km2 and the length of its mainstream is 22 3 km the dam basin is relatively small compared to the other multi purpose dams in korea as the available water resources from the basin are small i e the annual capacity of water supply from the boryeong dam is just 106 6 106 m3 the surrounding regions are still vulnerable to drought in particular in the 2010s there were three very severe droughts in this region when the boryeong dam was almost empty and the water supply stopped fig 1 shows the location and shape of the boryeong dam basin the cloud seeding experiment over the boryeong dam basin was done over the simulation domain red box in fig 1 additionally the green box in this figure represents the seedability test area where clouds with water contents grow actively and seeding materials were released the seedability test area of this study includes the west sea where strong storms are frequently developed and moved to the inland area with high rainfall intensity 3 2 data 3 2 1 observation data this study collected observation data like the precipitation temperature and runoff these observation data were mainly used to validate the prms model basically a long term rainfall runoff analysis requires data like the daily precipitation and temperature as input as in this study the cloud seeding was intermittently simulated whenever the daily rainfall intensity was higher than 20 mm the remaining part was filled with the observed rainfall data the effect of cloud seeding was evaluated by comparing the runoff hydrographs with the simulated rainfall data under seeded and unseeded conditions the temperature data required in the prms model are the daily mean maximum and minimum data all of which were also collected to be used in this study although no meteorological observation station is available within the boryeong dam basin one station exists in nearby boryeong city red pentagon in fig 1 all the meteorological data used in this study were those collected in this boryeong meteorological observation station the inflow data measured in the boryeong dam were used as the runoff data of the boryeong dam basin for most rivers in korea the dam inflow data are generally assumed to have higher accuracy than the runoff data noh et al 2008 lee et al 2010 this study used three years of data from 2017 to 2019 the data collected in 2017 were mostly used for the parameter estimation of the prms model while the remaining data from 2018 and 2019 were used to validate the simulated runoff and to evaluate the effect of cloud seeding on the runoff 3 2 2 simulation data of cloud seeding this study considered a total of 18 events of cloud seeding in the years 2018 and 2019 when the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more the domain for cloud seeding simluation covers a 219 km 159 km rectangle with a resolution of 1 km 1 km the boryeong dam basin is located in the eastern part of this domain fig 1 a significant portion of the domain includes the west sea of korea this domain setting is in fact related to the rainfall pattern around the korean peninsula due to the effect of westerlies most storms in the west sea move toward the korean peninsula the simulation results of cloud seeding within the boryeong dam basin were averaged to generate the daily rainfall input for the prms model the simulation data of cloud seeding is composed of two cases i e unseeded case and seeded case the unseeded case represents the simulation results of rainfall without releasing any seeding material while the seeded case represents the simulation results of rainfall with releasing the seeding material the unseeded case is generally used to evaluate the wrf model performance under the real meteorological condition however due to many reasons such as the nonlinear behavior of the meteorological system and the possible uncertainty of the input data components of cloud microphysics planetary boundary layer physics pbl and parameterizations the unseeded case can thus include some degree of error gayatri et al 2022 this is because complex natural spatiotemporal variability of cloud properties could introduce major uncertainties or errors in the cloud seeding simulation al hosari et al 2021 as this error can result in error in the runoff simulation this study tried to minimize the difference between the observed rainfall and those in the unseeded cases the method was simply to derive a ratio between the observed and simulated rainfall which was then applied to the simulated rainfall data in the seeded case only six events show rather large difference between the unseeded case and seeded case 4 results 4 1 parameter estimation of the prms model by following the methodology explained in section 2 2 the initial values of the prms model parameters were determined first easy to estimate parameters were estimated by analyzing the dem forest type map soil map land use map etc the basin area basin slope average elevation land cover type canopy density interception characteristic ratio of impervious area and maximum water storage within soil were also estimated and used as fixed values without further correction initial values of those difficult to estimate parameters were determined as the proposed values in the manual or the moct 2006 these difficult to estimate parameters were corrected by evaluating their effect on the behavior of evapotranspiration direct runoff soil moisture and baseflow finally the runoff related parameters and the soil related parameters were corrected by comparing the observed and the simulated hydrographs in this step the technique of minimum root mean square differences was applied the data collected in the year of 2017 were used for the parameter estimation of the prms model and the data collected in the years 2018 and 2019 were used for their validation the validation was done by comparing the observed and simulated hydrographs which fig 2 provides as this figure shows their overall shapes were very similar to each other quantitative measures of both hydrographs were also confirmed their similarity for example the mean flow rate of the observed hydrograph was 3 6 m3 s while that of the simulated hydrograph was similar at 3 8 m3 s the peak runoff rate occurred on july 1 2018 in the observed hydrograph was 186 9 m3 s while that in the simulated hydrographs was also similar at 177 5 m3 s in both cases the total volume of flows was also found to be 2 646 4 and 2 772 6 m3 s respectively overall their difference was less than 5 in all the measures mentioned above this difference was much smaller than the satisfactory level of 10 based on the moct guideline 2006 the prms model simulation was also evaluated using some indices like cc correlation coefficient and mae mean absolute error the estimated cc and mae were 0 77 and 2 4 m3 sec respectively which confirmed that the prms model setting was done properly 4 2 runoff analysis with simulated cloud seeding 4 2 1 event based evaluation in this part of the study the runoff simulation was performed using the prms model with the rainfall input simulated for the unseeded and seeded cases for the years 2018 and 2019 as mentioned in the previous section 3 2 2 the differences between the unseeded and seeded cases were distinct in several events including the event that occurred on july 27 2019 fig 3 compares some rainfall runoff components for a good sample with somewhat distinct difference between the unseeded case and seeded case i e the event on july 27 2019 and a bad sample without any noticeable difference between the unseeded case and seeded case i e the event on june 26 2018 interception infiltration effective rainfall baseflow interflow and direct runoff are among those characteristics compared in this figure in the good sample it was found that the infiltration effective rainfall interflow and direct runoff were increased in particular the increase of the interflow continued for several days after the rainfall on the other hand no obvious change could be found in the interception and baseflow as there was no obvious increase of rainfall in the bad sample it was not surprising to find no change in the rainfall runoff components for the good sample i e the event on july 27 2019 the effect of cloud seeding was quantitatively evaluated as a result of cloud seeding the total rainfall and total effective rainfall were increased and resulted in the increase of the direct runoff and interflow the total rainfall was increased by 1 35 the infiltration by 1 38 and the effective rainfall by 1 47 the total runoff was increased by 2 38 among which the increase of interflow was dominant at 3 31 the direct runoff was also increased by 1 79 but the increase of baseflow was limited to just 0 25 and no significant increase could be found in the interception no difference was found in the evapotranspiration as it was calculated independently of the daily rainfall in the prms model the increase of the total runoff was found to be higher than that of the total rainfall which was mainly due to most of the increased rainfall being contributed to the runoff rather than to interception and evapotranspiration obviously the contribution of cloud seeding to the runoff could be greater as the cloud seeding was done after the interception capacity was almost filled the increase of the runoff with respect to the increase of the total rainfall was quantified in this study by introducing the increase rate ir this ir was then used to evaluate the role or effectiveness of cloud seeding in additionally securing water resources the ir was calculated as follows 1 ir 100 runof f seeded r u n o f f unseeded rai n seeded r a i n unseeded where runof f seeded was the total runoff for the seeded case and runof f unseeded was the total runoff for the unseeded case also rai n seeded was the total rainfall for the seeded case and rai n unseeded was the total rainfall for the unseeded case the ir was estimated to be 64 7 for the good sample on july 27 2019 i e about 65 of the increased amount of total rainfall contributed to the increase of the total runoff however the ir for the bad sample on june 26 2018 was just 50 0 even though the ir for the bad sample was estimated to be a bit smaller than for the good sample it was still quite high that is regardless of any sample cases the contribution of the additional rainfall to the total runoff was found to be very much higher 4 2 2 annual evaluation table 1 shows that both the unseeded and seeded cases are summarized by the annual totals of rainfall interception infiltration effective rainfall baseflow direct runoff and total runoff as the cloud seeding experiment was done intermittently when the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more the remaining part was filled with the observed rainfall data the increase of total rainfall due to cloud seeding was 0 13 in the year 2018 and 0 40 in the year 2019 the increase of interception was not noticeable but the infiltration was increased by 0 14 and 0 57 in the years 2018 and 2019 respectively the increase of the total runoff was 0 17 and 0 64 respectively in particular it is noticeable that the increase of total runoff was a little higher than the increase of total rainfall this result was from the fact that most rainfall was not intercepted but contributed to the infiltration and direct runoff as a result all the baseflow interflow and direct runoff were increased to make the total runoff greater among those three runoff components the increase of interflow was found to be the highest that is its increase was 0 35 in the year 2018 and 1 30 in the year 2019 the increase of baseflow was found to be smaller than the other two the relative increase of total runoff was also evaluated by the ir as the ir represents the relative increase of total runoff to the increase of total rainfall it was possible to evaluate the role of cloud seeding more quantitatively as a result the ir for the year 2018 was estimated to be 94 1 and that of 2019 was estimated to be 90 9 simply it could be concluded that most of the increased rainfall by cloud seeding contributed to the total runoff these higher irs in the annual analysis than those in the event based analysis were mostly due to the contribution of baseflow that is as the response time from rainfall to baseflow is long it could not be considered in the event based analysis but in the annual analysis 4 3 runoff analysis with scenario based cloud seeding simulation 4 3 1 event based analysis as the increase in rainfall was small in the simulation of cloud seeding experiment this study additionally considered a scenario of rainfall increase this study considered the four cases of 5 10 15 and 20 of rainfall increase by cloud seeding the cloud seeding experiment was also done similarly to the original experiment when the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more these four cases of rainfall increase in this study were assumed by considering the previous studies on cloud seeding where the increase rate was reported from 5 to a maximum 30 depending on the local climate conditions acharya et al 2011 griffith et al 2007 solak et al 1987 kulkarni et al 2019 curic et al 2019 as the previous studies were carried out at different regions the maximum increase in this study was set to be 20 which was conservatively assumed by considering the discrepancies of topographic and climatic conditions at different regions the event based simulation results were evaluated for the two events that occurred around july 27 and september 5 2019 fig 4 as the cloud seeding experiment was done whenever the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more the event on july 27 2019 contained three cloud seeding experiments but the event on september 5 2019 contained two experiments during the 21 day period these experiments are denoted by red dots in fig 4 in fig 4 the instant change of infiltration and effective rainfall can be seen but the interception did not show any obvious change the direct runoff was also instantly increased at the same day of rainfall increase but the change of interflow lasted several days after the rainfall increase however no change could be detected in the baseflow during this short 21 day period among those rainfall runoff components the increase rate of interflow was found to be greater these two events were also compared quantitatively with the relative increase of each component to the rainfall increase as explained earlier in fig 4 the most outstanding result was that most of the rainfall increase contributed to the runoff increase in the case of 5 rainfall increase the total runoff increase was marked to be 9 53 in the event around july 27 2019 and 8 72 in the event around september 5 2019 in the case of 20 rainfall increase the total runoff was increased by 39 02 and 35 64 respectively for those two events the ir was estimated to be about 70 for both events also in both cases the increase of interception was minimal but the increase of infiltration and direct runoff was noticeable among runoff components the interflow was also found to be highly increased in the case of 20 rainfall increase the interflow was increased by 52 and 130 respectively for those two events the increase rate of direct runoff was found to be similar to that of the effective rainfall 4 3 2 annual analysis annual simulation of rainfall runoff was also performed with the same scenarios as in the previous section it was simply assumed that the annual rainfall was increased by 5 10 15 and 20 however the cloud seeding experiment was only conducted when the daily rainfall was 20 mm or more see the vertical arrows in fig 5 fig 5 compares the simulation results as in the previous cases the increases of interception were all minimal but the increase of effective rainfall was found to be dominant among the runoff components the increases of interflow and direct runoff were dominant as the increase of total rainfall became more the difference between the unseeded and seeded cases was found to be more distinctly observable table 2 summarizes the results of annual simulation for the years of 2018 and 2019 for the scenario with the 20 increase of annual rainfall the total runoff was increased by 26 27 in 2018 and 30 29 in 2019 in all four scenarios considered in this study the increase ratio of runoff was also greater than that of the total rainfall as with the event based analysis the increase ratio of effective rainfall was similar to that of direct runoff the increase of interflow was also noticeable in this annual simulation the increases of interception were all small in both years but much smaller in the year 2019 on the other hand the infiltration was increased more in 2019 which resulted in more increase of baseflow and interflow overall the increase of total runoff in 2019 was found to be more than that in 2018 the ir was about 95 which was higher than that for the event based analysis as mentioned earlier this result was mainly due to the baseflow only being considered in the annual analysis 5 discussion 5 1 effect of antecedent soil moisture antecedent soil moisture is an important factor to control the infiltration and thus the direct runoff more antecedent soil moisture wet soil decreases the infiltration but increases the effective rainfall on the other hand in less antecedent soil moisture dry soil condition the infiltration becomes dominant runoff pattern is very dependent upon these relative portions of infiltration and effective rainfall the antecedent soil moisture can also play an important role in the cloud seeding experiment however as the cloud seeding causes additional rain to the given situation the role of antecedent soil moisture can be somewhat different in this part of the study the effects of cloud seeding on various rainfall runoff components were evaluated under the two conditions with large or small antecedent soil moisture amount the large or small antecedent soil moisture amounts were quantified by the concept of antecedent moisture conditions amcs with 5 day antecedent precipitation amount p5 i e amc 1 for dry condition amc ii for normal condition and amc iii for wet condition in korea amc i is defined when p5 is less than 35 5 mm and amc iii when p5 is larger than 53 3 mm in between the two is the amc ii condition yoon 2007 two rainfall events were selected to evaluate the effect of the antecedent soil moisture the first event on july 27 2019 was the case for amc 1 when the p5 was just 4 8 mm the second event on september 3 2018 was the case for amc iii with its p5 of 71 7 mm in this study the same scenarios of cloud seeding in section 4 3 were considered and table 3 compares the results as can be expected when the soil is dry more rainfall is infiltrated the infiltrated water can also contribute to the interflow on the other hand when the soil is wet less rainfall is infiltrated as the amount of effective rainfall becomes greater the direct runoff also becomes greater regardless of the soil condition however the overall effect of cloud seeding was somewhat different that is the ir under the amc i condition was just 68 71 but under the amc iii condition the ir was estimated to be as high as 91 94 this result indicates that wet soil condition is more favorable to the successful cloud seeding experiment 5 2 on the threshold daily rainfall for the cloud seeding experiment in the cloud seeding experiment of this study with the wrf model the daily rainfall of 20 mm was considered as the threshold value that is the cloud seeding experiment was conducted only when the daily rainfall was higher than or equal to 20 mm nims 2020 however the threshold value of 20 mm was determined rather arbitrarily this part of the study evaluates the sensitivity of this threshold daily rainfall on the runoff three simple cases were compared for the possible threshold values the daily rainfall of 0 to 10 mm the daily rainfall of 10 to 20 mm and the daily rainfall greater than 20 mm as in the previous section 5 1 four cloud seeding scenarios were considered in this section three rainfall events were selected for the three cases the first event that occurred on june 9 2018 5 8 mm was for the case of the threshold daily rainfall of 0 to 10 mm the second event that occurred on october 28 2018 15 7 mm was for the case of the threshold daily rainfall from 10 to 20 mm finally the rainfall event that occurred on july 27 2019 26 6 mm was for the case of the threshold daily rainfall of greater than 20 mm table 4 summarizes the simulation results of these three cases the relative portions of the interception infiltration and effective rainfall vary considerably depending on the rainfall amount in the case of small daily rainfall i e 0 10 mm in this study most of the increased rainfall was intercepted and little contributed to the infiltration and effective rainfall as a result no obvious change was found in the three runoff components on the other hand in the case of large daily rainfall i e 20 mm or more most of the increased rainfall contributed to the increase of infiltration and effective rainfall the change of interception was small in particular the increase of the infiltration was found to be significant and as a result the increase of the interflow was found to be very significant the result of the case of medium daily rainfall i e 10 20 mm was in between the previous two cases comparison of these three cases shows that when the daily rainfall was greater than 20 mm the cloud seeding experiment could be more effective when the daily rainfall was very small no effect of cloud seeding could be expected and when the daily rainfall was 10 20 mm the effect of cloud seeding was also small as a result it could be concluded that the choice of 20 mm as a threshold daily rainfall for the cloud seeding experiment was appropriate additionally it is also noticeable that the greatest effect of cloud seeding was from the increase of infiltration and the resulting interflow however if the soil moisture was wetter the contribution of the increased effective rainfall and the resulting direct runoff could be greater this possibility was evaluated in the previous section 5 1 5 3 potential efficiency of cloud seeding to secure water resources and its economic implications the results of this study presented the possibility to secure additional water resources by cloud seeding first the increase of total runoff by cloud seeding in a dam basin can alleviate drought by increasing the water supply to the domestic and industrial sectors as well as the agricultural sector however only a minor enhancement in the rainfall is found in the numerical experiment for the two years that were explored this small amount of additional water resources was obviously due to the small increase of rainfall in the cloud seeding experiment this is because complex natural spatiotemporal variability of cloud properties could introduce major uncertainties or errors in the cloud seeding simulation al hosari et al 2021 even though the secured water resources by experiment are not as much as expected it is not so disappointing as most of the increased rainfall is converted into the increase of total runoff furthermore a relatively high increase of effective rainfall and direct runoff means that cloud seeding can be efficient to secure water resources directly from the ground surface based on the scenario based simulations more practical results can be derived for example the additionally secured water resources under the 20 increase scenario were estimated to be about 42 9 106 m3 for the year 2018 and about 23 9 106 m3 for the year 2019 as the same scenario of 20 rainfall increase was applied more water resources could be secured in the wet year 2018 than the dry year 2019 however it is also true that the additionally secured water resource for the year 2019 was more than 20 of the annual water supply capacity of the boryeong dam 106 6 106 m3 as the cloud seeding experiment was conducted during rather wet condition it was possible to harvest most of the increased rainfall as additional water resources in this study four different prices were considered for the economical evaluation of the additional water resources i e raw water price from dam raw water price from the multi regional water supply system water price from the local water supply system and the water price in the mineral water market the value of the additional water resources secured by the cloud seeding was estimated in table s2 in supplementary materials using various water prices in korea if applying the raw water price from dam the cloud seeding experiment may not be very economical however if the water price in the mineral water market is considered the value of additionally secured water resources becomes very high at more than two billion us dollars it should be also noted that the value of additional water resources must be more than simply the raw water price when the cloud seeding experiment is considered in a serious drought situation 6 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the effect of cloud seeding on the increase of runoff or securing additional water resources based on both event based and annual analysis unlike previous studies this study concentrated more on the change of various components of hydrologic processes the event based analysis showed that when the rainfall increase was rather high the infiltration effective rainfall interflow and direct runoff significantly increased in particular the increase of the interflow was noticeable but no obvious change could be found in the interception and baseflow more than 60 of the increased rainfall was found to contribute to the runoff increase this ratio was estimated to be more than 90 which indicates that most of the increased rainfall by cloud seeding contributed to the total runoff in fact this higher increase in the annual analysis was mostly due to the contribution of baseflow as the response time from rainfall to baseflow is long it could not be considered in the event based analysis but was in the annual analysis similar results could also be derived in the runoff analysis with scenario based cloud seeding simulation as the increase of total rainfall became greater the difference between the unseeded and seeded cases was found to be more distinctly observable as important factors controlling the effectiveness of cloud seeding this study evaluated the role of antecedent soil moisture and the threshold daily rainfall depth on the increase of total runoff first when the soil was dry more rainfall was infiltrated as a result a significant increase of interflow could be detected on the other hand when the soil was wet more direct runoff could be detected however the overall effect of cloud seeding was higher when the soil was wet this result indicates that wet soil condition is more favorable to the successful cloud seeding experiment to secure additional water resources secondly the effect of threshold daily rainfall was also found to be very important in the case of small daily rainfall i e 0 10 mm in this study no obvious change could be found in the three runoff components on the other hand in the case of large daily rainfall i e 20 mm or more most of the increased rainfall contributed to the increase of infiltration and effective rainfall comparison of these cases shows that when the daily rainfall is more than 20 mm the cloud seeding experiment could be more effective the results of this study presented the possibility to secure additional water resources by cloud seeding first the increase of total runoff by cloud seeding in a dam basin can alleviate drought by increasing the water supply to the domestic and industrial sectors as well as the agricultural sector even though the secured water resources by experiment are not as much as expected it is not so disappointing as most of the increased rainfall is converted into the increase of total runoff furthermore a relatively high increase of effective rainfall and direct runoff means that cloud seeding can be efficient to secure water resources directly from the ground surface the value of the additional water resources secured by the cloud seeding was also found to be high especially when the water price in the mineral water market is considered

2869,merging the satellite and gauge precipitation has been proofed as an efficient approach to improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation however for areas with few and unevenly distributed rain gauges accurate precipitation estimation still remains challenging to address this problem this paper proposes a framework to improve precipitation estimation for the data scarce area based on transfer learning taking the qinghai tibet plateau as a representative case study we used two transfer learning methods fine tuning domain adversarial neural network dann to transfer precipitation fusion model from the source domain to the target domain results indicate that in comparison with the original trmm data the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae of the merged precipitation in the qinghai tibet plateau during 2001 2005 are reduced by 27 6 and 22 5 by using the fine tuning method and reduced by 29 4 and 21 5 by using the dann method respectively meanwhile the correlation coefficient cc is increased from 0 54 trmm data rain gauge data to 0 65 merged data rain gauge data the performances of the proposed methods vary spatially with cc decreased from southeast 0 80 to northwest 0 40 of the study area the dann method performed well on different precipitation intensities while swish loss function can help dann achieve better results on extreme precipitation estimation with rmse and mae reduced by 2 5 and 4 5 respectively the performances of the proposed methods are affected by various factors such as source domain selection and the length of study period findings imply that transfer learning provides new insights and new methods to improve precipitation estimation for the data scarce area which would benefit regional water related disaster defense and water resources management keywords precipitation estimation transfer learning fine tunning dann cnn lstm data fusion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precipitation is an essential component of meteorology and hydrology system its high variability in spatiotemporal distribution and extreme complex process affects hydrologic cycle significantly niu et al 2017 hong et al 2004 for instance it is documented that even 70 80 of the uncertainty in land surface hydrological process simulation is caused by the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation syed et al 2004 gebregiorgis et al 2013 moreover in the context of changing environment climate change has caused and will continue to lead to an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation which will result in more intensive flooding events ipcc 2014 xu et al 2018 therefore it is of great importance to improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation qpe so as for better flood risk prevention to estimate precipitation rain gauges observation provides a traditional but precise and reliable method the world meteorological organization wmo claims that the density of rain gauges should be in the 250 575 km2 per station range for mountainous and hill and valley type terrains arsenault and brissette 2014 in fact due to the constraints of geography economy and human resources many places especially for the areas with high altitude have no rainfall stations or have rainfall stations with low density even for the areas where rainfall stations are established the distribution of rainfall stations is often uneven wu et al 2020 to improve the precipitation estimation accuracy in data scarce regions diverse methods such as tyson polygons inverse distance weighting idw and kriging were widely used for interpolation chen et al 2010 however the above mentioned methods only take the neighboring stations instead of complex spatial variations into account during precipitation interpolation moreover when the rainfall stations are too sparse interpolation is hard to reflect the spatial distribution of precipitation ma et al 2020 alternatively remote sensing provides a valuable way to estimate precipitation with a wide coverage where sensors such as microwave visible light infrared and precipitation radar pr are mainly used to obtain the spatial distribution of precipitation kozu et al 2001 hamada et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 up to present there exist a huge number of remotely precipitation products including trmm cmorph persiann etc comparing with the rain gauge observations the remote sensing precipitation products may underestimate or overestimate the precipitation sun et al 2018 the accuracy of precipitation products is closely related with altitude temporal scale and the rainfall intensity for instance trmm version 7 trmm v7 has been proved to have a better performance than the other aforementioned remote sensing precipitation products liu et al 2016 however the trmm products are still limited by their regional inaccuracy such as relatively high uncertainty in dry and high altitude areas fu et al 2007 xu et al 2017 therefore although remote sensing could estimate precipitation over a wide range the estimation accuracy still needs to be improved since single method i e interpolation based on limited rainfall gauges remote sensing failed in estimating precipitation with high accuracy data fusion was developed by combining satellite data and rain gauge data beck et al 2017 various data fusion methods for qpe have been investigated mckee et al 2016 chao et al 2018 namely including optimal interpolation techniques shen et al 2014 mean filed bias correction method kim et al 2018 kalman filter ushio et al 2009 bayesian estimation todini 2001 probability density function xie and xiong 2011 wavelet transform analysis pradhan et al 2016 statistical objective analysis rozante et al 2010 variation method shao et al 2021 neural network approach long et al 2016 geographical difference analysis verdin et al 2016 geographically weighted regression gwr based methods chao et al 2018 co kriging yan et al 2021 and deep learning models wu et al 2020 loads of previous studies reported that the accuracy of fusion data can be significantly improved than the original satellite data yu et al 2011 fujihara et al 2014 wu et al 2020 however for the data scarce regions due to the lack of rain gauges the applications of data fusion methods are limited taking the qinghai tibet plateau as an example the average correlation coefficient cc between the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep data produced by beck et al 2017 and the rain gauge observation only reached 0 44 liu et al 2019 the cc in the qinghai tibet plateau was much lower than that in southeast china wu et al 2020 thus improving the qpe accuracy in data scarce regions still remains a challenge machine learning has been increasingly applied in the fields of meteorology and hydrology ashouri et al 2015 miao et al 2019 tao et al 2016 due to its strong learning and generalization abilities and its advantages in modeling complex patterns and processing large amounts of data shao et al 2019b shao et al 2015 wu et al 2020 many machine learning algorithms assume that the training data and the test data own the same distribution however in most real applications this assumption can not hold especially when the available samples are limited to deal with the issues of different distributions and insufficient training data transfer learning which can apply the knowledge or pattern learned from a certain field or task to a different but related fields or problems is proposed and rapidly developed up to present transfer learning has been successfully applied to many fields like natural language processing houlsby et al 2019 and image classification weiss et al 2016 meanwhile some attempts have also been made in the fields of hydrology and climate li et al 2021 xie et al 2015 for instance kimura et al 2020 used a convolutional neural network cnn pre trained by large datasets to predict water level and reduced the error by 15 based on a feature transfer method the features of standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei were extracted tian et al 2021 however transfer learning is seldom applied in precipitation estimation in fact the basic idea of transfer learning which is to train a model with certain amount of data in the source domain and transfer the learned knowledge to the target domain with limited data fits the problem of precipitation estimation in data scarce region well this study aims to improve the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in data scarce area by using the transfer learning methods the specific objectives are as follows 1 to transfer precipitation data fusion model trained in eastern china to the qinghai tibet plateau in china 2 to verify and compare the suitability of different transfer learning methods on precipitation estimation in the qinghai tibet plateau 3 to produce an improved precipitation dataset for the qinghai tibet plateau 2 research area and data acquisition 2 1 study area due to the vast territory 9 6 million km2 and large geographical spans 73 135 e and 10 53 n as shown in fig 1 china covers complex terrains including mountains plateaus hills basins plains and deserts significantly affected by the complex terrain annual precipitation in china exists high variations on both spatial distribution ranging from less than 100 mm to 2000 mm lu et al 2019 and temporal distribution 60 70 concentrates in flood season liu et al 2016 to measure precipitation about 800 national meteorological stations and 2000 automatic rain gauges have been established over the mainland of china however the distribution of these meteorological stations is imbalanced with higher density in eastern china and lower density in western china for instance the qinghai tibet plateau occupies about 25 of the total area of china and accounts for 10 3 of the total number of meteorological stations in china in this study we take the mainland of china fig 1 as the research area and focus on two regions eastern china with 448 rain gauges minimum elevation 0 m maximum elevation 2629 m over the east of 110 e where can be regarded as data sufficient area and the qinghai tibet plateau with 82 rain stations minimum elevation 2231 m maximum elevation 5129 m where can be regarded as data scarce area the two regions have large differences on terrain climates and landforms the eastern china with elevation ranging from 0 to 2700 m is dominated by plateaus and basins around 1000 2700 m low hills less than 1000 m and plains less than 200 m the area covers several climate zones according to the köppen geiger climate classification rules peel et al 2007 namely continental climate in northeast of china arid climate in northern china and temperate climate hot and rainy in summer and a cold and dry in winter in southern china guan et al 2020 in contrast the qinghai tibet plateau target domain with elevation ranging from about 2400 to above 8800 m is dominated by frozen soils grassland glaciers and alpine lakes sun et al 2021 the area belongs to the alpine climate characterized by strong solar radiation low temperature large daily temperature variation and distinct dry and wet seasons pan et al 2017 lu et al 2019 guan et al 2020 due to its vast territory annual precipitation shows high disparity on spatial distribution decreasing from east to west and from south to north for instance the annual precipitation in this area is about 500 mm reaching 500 to 1000 mm in southeast and only 40 100 mm in northwest yao et al 2012 2 2 data acquisition this study is a further study of the previous work wu et al 2020 to keep the comparison in consistent we use the same study period namely from 2001 to 2005 the data used in this study include the trmm 3b42 v7 satellite data gridsat b1 data and rain gauges data in the mainland of china between 2001 and 2005 the trmm 3b42 v7 data 0 25 3 h are obtained from nasa https pmm nasa gov data access downloads trmm gridsat b1 data 0 07 3 h are downloaded from noaa https www ncdc noaa gov gridsat gridsat index php the observed daily precipitation data at 530 rain gauges are provided by china meteorological data service center https data cma cn besides digital elevation model dem data 90 m are obtained from the usgs nasa srtm data http srtm csi cgiqar org srtmdata 3 methodology the framework of the methods adopted in this study is illustrated in fig 2 it covers three modules data preprocessing yellow part precipitation fusion model green part and transfer learning tasks blue part firstly data from different sources with different spatiotemporal resolutions are preprocessed to reach a unified form afterwards the cnn lstm model used for precipitation fusion was established wu et al 2020 finally the precipitation fusion model was transferred to the data scarce regions by using two transfer learning strategies fine tuning and dann network which are shown in fig 3 and fig 5 respectively 3 1 data preprocessing firstly to keep temporal consistency with rain gauge data the satellite precipitation data trmm 3b42 v7 are converted from 3 hourly to daily cumulative precipitation to reach consistent spatial resolution trmm and gridsat b1 data are downscaled by the widely used nearest neighbor interpolation method zheng et al 2017 to 0 05 and dem is resampled to 0 05 by pixel averaging as well after achieving unified spatio temporal resolution all the data are normalized considering the spatial representativeness of a rain gauge for each rain gauge 7 7 grids about 38 5 km 38 5 km centered on it are identified and their corresponding satellite data are extracted finally the dataset including rain gauge data series and their corresponding satellite data series with 7 7 grids from 2001 to 2005 are established 3 2 cnn lstm model for precipitation fusion to better merge precipitation of satellite data and rain gauge data more recently wu et al 2020 proposed a joint spatio temporal deep neural network model by coupling cnn convolutional neural network and lstm long short term memory network in the cnn lstm model cnn is used to learn the spatial correlations between the rain gauge data and the surrounding satellite data while lstm is applied to capture the time dependence of precipitation information at different time stamps for more details of the cnn lstm model for precipitation fusion please refer to the publication by wu et al 2020 in this study we take the cnn lstm model for precipitation fusion as a basis and focus on transfer learning namely transferring the pretrained cnn lstm model in data sufficient area to data scarce area 3 3 transfer learning in this section we will introduce some definitions of transfer learning a domain d can be described as d x p x where x is defined as a feature space and p x is defined as probability distribution x x 1 x 2 x n x a task t can be defined as t y f where y is a label space and f is an objective predictive function if there are two specific domains a source domain d s and a target domain d t and they have learning tasks t s and t t separately transfer learning aims to improve the effects of target predictive function f t by using the knowledge learned from source domain with the condition that d s d t or t s t t according to what to transfer transfer learning can be divided into four categories instance transfer feature representation transfer parameter transfer and relationship knowledge transfer pan et al 2010 instance transfer can be realized by re weighting some labeled data in source domain and adding these data into the target domain data quionero candela et al 2009 jiang and zhai 2007 instance transfer represents the idea that some samples in the source domain are weighted again and it may not use full source data it is more flexible because its implementation can be simple feature representation means to find out features that can reduce the distance between the source and the target domains and benefit the performance of models blitzer et al 2007 argyriou et al 2007 evgeniou et al 2008 parameter transfer also called model transfer means that sharing some parameters prior distributions or hyper parameters between two domains lawrence and platt 2004 bonilla et al 2008 schwaighofer et al 2005 as for relationship knowledge transfer it can be understood that some relationships among the source data and the target data are similar and the relationships are transferred mihalkova and mooney 2008 davis and domingos 2008 the former three methods require the assumption of independent and identically distributed on data while the last one doesn t among the transfer learning strategies parameter transfer is fast to achieve and has been widely used in previous studies ma et al 2019 huang et al 2020 in this paper we used two methods of parameter transfer to improve the precipitation estimation accuracy in data scarce region fine tuning and domain adversarial neural network dann 3 3 1 fine tuning fine tuning is a parameter transfer learning method and has been widely used in image classification yosinski et al 2014 it generally includes three steps as follows 1 pretrain a basic model with the data in the source domain and save its network structure and parameters 2 freeze the front part of the pretrained network and fine tune the weight of the last full connected layer of the network by using the training data of the target domain and 3 use the test data in the target domain to verify the effectiveness of the fine tuned model generally the first layer of the pretrained network is not particularly related to the target dataset while the last layer of the network is closely related to the target task correspondingly the features of the first layer are called general features and those of the last layer are called specific features yosinski et al 2014 therefore fine tuning strategy usually adjusts the parameters of the last full connected layers of the pretrained network in this study we regard the data at 448 rain gauges with the longitude ranging from 110 e to 135 e and the corresponding satellite data as the source domain data while regard those data in the qinghai tibet plateau as the target domain data firstly we use the source domain data to train the precipitation fusion model cnn lstm model proposed by wu et al 2020 afterwards fixing the parameters in the front layers of the pre trained model we adjust the parameters of the full connection layers by using the target domain data the flowchart of the fine tuning approach is illustrated in fig 3 3 3 2 domain adversarial neural network dann domain adaption is another strategy of parameter transfer learning aiming to address the problem that the source domain and the target domain have the same task but with different distributions generative adversarial networks gan which contains generator and discriminator models provides a promising solution to domain adaption via feature space alignment goodfellow et al 2014 based on the mechanism of gan the domain adversarial neural network dann was proposed ganin and lempitsky 2015 for transfer learning as shown in fig 4 dann includes three components feature extractor g f θ f quantitative precipitation estimator g y θ y and domain classifier g d θ d specifically feature extractor aims at mapping data to a feature space and identifying the common features of the two domains quantitative precipitation estimator is used to predict precipitation of the target domain in the feature space domain classifier is supposed to distinguish the source domain from the target domain in the feature space the domain classifier is connected to the feature extractor via a gradient reversal layer grl which multiplies the gradient by a negative constant during the process of backpropagation training while transfers parameters in the forward propagation training the grl ensures the distributions of features from two domains are extracted similarly leading to domain invariant features overall the loss of dann can be calculated by using equation 1 1 e θ f θ y θ d i 1 n d i 0 l y g y g f x i θ f θ y y i λ i 1 n l d g d g f x i θ f θ d y i i 1 n d i 0 l y i θ f θ y λ i 1 n l d i θ f θ d where the former part is the loss of label classification the smaller the better the latter part is the loss of domain classification the larger the better the main task of dann is not only cheating the domain classifier but also satisfying the label classifier at the same time therefore the parameters should be updated following equation 2 2 θ f θ y argmin θ f θ y e θ f θ y θ d θ d argmax θ d e θ f θ y θ d at the same time the gradient reversal layer grl is introduced into dann in the forward propagation the function of grl is identity transform while in the backward propagation grl reverses the gradient and updates the parameters 3 g r l s f r o n t w a r d b e h a v i o r r λ x x 4 g r l s b a c k w a r d b e h a v i o r d r λ dx i in this study we used the data from the source domain eastern china and the target domain qinghai tibet plateau to build up the domain adversarial neural network dann model for feature space alignment afterwards the cnn lstm model was established for precipitation fusion the flowchart of the domain adversarial neural network dann method is depicted in fig 5 in order to better capture the characteristics of high intensity precipitation we used a new loss function called s w i s h ramachandran et al 2017 for model optimization as shown in fig 6 the s w i s h function assigns more significance to peak value corresponding to this study the error of precipitation with high intensity will be more concerned during the model optimization the expression of s w i s h in this study can be written as follows 5 swish r m s e s i g m o i d r m s e 3 4 evaluation metrics and evaluation strategy to quantitatively evaluate the performances of the transfer learning based models on precipitation estimation we split the dataset into training set and validation set via splitting the rain gauges sites and applied the 10 fold cross validation strategy intuitively fig 7 illustrates the evaluation strategy specifically the data are firstly organized by rain gauges each of which has a site id for each site the data is sorted by time at each timestamp each sample includes the observed daily precipitation at the site trmm precipitation in a 7 7 grid centered on the site dem data in a 7 7 grid centered on the site and the gridsat data in a 7 7 grid centered on the site afterwards the data of 82 rain gauges are divided into 10 folds among which 9 folds are used for training and the left one fold used for validation after 10 rounds data of rain gauges in each fold should have been validated finally the average of results at 10 rounds are used to represent the performance of the method the reason why we did not divide the dataset into different time periods is to avoid destroying the temporal correlation of data at the rain gauges meanwhile root mean square error rmse relative bias rb mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient cc are selected as evaluation criteria these indicators are defined by the following equations 6 9 according to bennett et al 2013 6 rmse i 1 n p pre i p obs i 2 n 7 rb i 1 n p pre i p obs i i 1 n p pre i 8 mae i 1 n p pre i p obs i n 9 cc i 1 n p pre i p pre p obs i p obs i 1 n p pre i p pre 2 i 1 n p obs i p obs 2 where pi pre and pi obs denote the predicted and the observed precipitation respectively ppre and pobs are the average values of the predicted and the observed precipitation respectively n is the number of all observations based on the above mentioned metrics taking the 448 rain gauges data as source domain the performances of the fine tuning and dann approaches can be initially evaluated regarding the superior method to further evaluate its efficiency we take more influencing factors into account specifically considering source domain may affect model s performance we conduct comparative experiments by taking rain gauges data over different hydro meteorological zones as different source domains considering the length of study period may also impact the results we test the performances of the superior model over different time spans e g 1 2 3 4 and 5 years respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance comparison among different methods to evaluate the performances of the proposed transfer learning based methods fine tuning and dann on improving precipitation estimation in the data scarce region qinghai tibet plateau taking the rain gauge data as ground truth we compared the merged precipitation by using the fine tuning dann and co kriging methods with the original trmm data during 2001 2005 the comparison results are listed in table 1 the correlation coefficient cc between trmm data and rain gauge data is 0 54 which indicates that the original trmm data are associated with relatively high uncertainty based on the transfer learning methods the accuracy of precipitation estimations in the qinghai tibet plateau has been improved specifically fine tuning method increased the correlation coefficient by 16 7 and reduced the rmse and mae by 27 6 22 5 respectively in contrast the dann method performed better increasing the cc by 19 6 and decreasing the rmse and mae by 29 4 and 21 5 respectively in contrast the representative conventional method co kriging achieved a lower cc 0 47 and the transfer learning methods showed superiority dann and fine tuning methods are both based on the fusion model of cnn lstm wu et al 2020 however dann showed a higher mean absolute error mae than fine tuning which means that dann has a weaker ability of peak value s prediction and tends to get more stable results so that dann has fewer outliers resulting in lower root mean square error rmse and a higher correlation coefficient cc we assumed that dann tends to reduce the distance of the distribution between source and target domain while fine tuning tends to approach the target domain overall the methods of transfer learning achieved better results on improving the accuracy of precipitation estimation in the qinghai tibet plateau than the conventional co kriging method and the dann method outperformed the fine tuning method to illustrate the performances of different methods in a more intuitive way fig 8 shows the scatter plots of daily precipitation observed by rain gauges versus daily precipitation estimated by trmm co kriging fine tuning and dann respectively 4 2 performance of the dann method under different lengths of study period the initial evaluation of the proposed transfer learning methods section 4 1 indicates that the dann method achieved better performance on qpe in the study area to further evaluate the efficiency of the dann method we performed the model under different lengths of study period in this study we took 1 year 2001 2 years 2001 2002 3 years 2001 2003 4 years 2001 2004 and 5 years 2001 2005 for comparison and presented the results in table 1 overall the dann method effectively improved qpe over different lengths of periods 1 5 years in term of all the evaluation criteria although it did not show the longer the study period the better the performance relatively the dann method achieved the best results over a 5 year period 2001 2005 for instance when the study period increased from 1 year to 5 years the rmse was reduced by 27 1 26 4 28 1 29 1 and 29 4 respectively accordingly the cc was improved by 12 7 14 0 16 4 16 1 and 20 4 respectively to some extent the results in this study imply that the dann method is robust to the length of study period however when taking only one year results will vary depending on the year that is selected it can be found from table 1 that uncertainties associated with trmm in different years also differ furthermore a short study period e g 1 year may hinder the transfer learning methods capture the temporal change features of the precipitation data e g seasonal change therefore we suggest using available data with longer study period 1 year when using the dann method for extended similar applications for the extended applications considering many factors such as te difference of study areas data quality climate characteristics source domain may affect the results it is hard to give a specific value for the suitable length of study period in contrast we recommend to discuss the appropriate length of study period in light of the actual situation of specific applications 4 3 performance of the dann method under different source domains furthermore considering different source domains may affect the performance of the transfer learning model dann we evaluated the performance of the dann method on qpe during 2001 2005 with different source domains in this study taking chinese spatial distribution of the mean annual concentration index ci an indicator used to evaluate the distribution pattern of daily precipitation as reference lu et al 2019 to choose potential domains the larger the ci value is the larger the contribution of heavy precipitation to the total precipitation has therefore if an area has a larger ci value its precipitation tends to concentrate in fewer days according to the ci distribution map in china lu et al 2019 the ci of the qinghai tibet plateau shows spatial heterogeneity covering several ranges namely 0 54 0 58 0 58 0 60 0 60 0 62 0 62 0 64 and 0 64 0 66 regions within the similar range of ci value means that their precipitation patterns are similar for example the south eastern qinghai tibet plateau where has relatively abundant precipitation with an annual precipitation above 1000 mm mainly concentrated in summer is similar to source regions with ci value of 0 62 0 66 specifically 83 rain gauges with ci of 0 62 0 64 290 rain gauges with ci of 0 64 0 66 231 rain gauges with ci of 0 66 0 68 and 77 rain gauges with ci of 0 68 0 70 are selected as different source domains the comparison results are presented in table 1 the results of different source domains indicate table 1 that using 448 rain gauges in eastern china as source domain achieved the best results in terms of all evaluation indices as the number of rain gauges in source domain decreased ranging from 448 to 77 only the improvement of rmse showed a consistent downward trend ranging from 29 4 to 27 9 comparing the results of two source domains with similar ci 0 62 0 64 0 64 0 66 with the qinghai tibet plateau target domain we can find that the source domain with 290 rain gauges achieved better results than that with 83 rain gauges in terms of rmse mae and cc on the other hand comparsions in two groups of source domains 83 vs 77 and 290 vs 231 indicate that the former source domains outperformed the latter ones the source domain with 83 rain gauges ci 0 62 0 64 even achieved equal cc 0 64 and better rb and mae than the source domain with 231 rain gauges ci 0 66 0 68 briefly it can be noted that both the number of rain gauges in source domain and the similarity of precipitation pattern between source domain and target domain are important factors affecting transfer learning for source domains with similar size the source domain with more similar ci with target domain tends to achieve better results for source domains with similar ci the source domain with larger size tends to achieve better results 4 4 comparison on spatial distributions of the evaluation metrics to illustrate the spatial distribution of the evaluation results the rmse mae and cc at each rain gauge are calculated and interpolated over the qinghai tibet plateau fig 9 displays the spatial distributions of the evaluation metrics for precipitation estimation in the qinghai tibet plateau the results indicate that dann and fine tuning methods achieved better results than the original trmm in terms of precipitation estimation precision specifically the merged precipitation based on transfer learning of dann has higher correlation coefficients of closing to 0 8 in the south and east of the qinghai tibet plateau while lower cc below 0 4 in the northern and western regions the imbalanced distribution of cc may be due to the uneven distribution of rain gauges in the qinghai tibet plateau which means that gauges in the eastern plateau are denser while the western gauges are sparser since limited information can be learnt from the limited data the cc in the northern and western regions of plateau is low the method of fine tuning is an insufficient training method which has led to higher uncertainty of precipitation estimation however fine tuning method can be performed easily and fast to further illustrate the statistics of qpe at 82 rain gauges fig 10 presents the boxplots of three statistical metrics cc rmse and mae of daily precipitation estimated by trmm dann and fine tuning methods fig 10 a indicates the dann method and the fine tuning method achieved similar statistics of cc with a median of 0 61 at the 82 rain gauges which is significantly improved in comparison with the original trmm with a median of cc of 0 53 the median of rmse of the dann method 2 82 mm was smaller than that of the fine tuning method 2 88 mm while the fine tuning method achieved a smaller median of mae 1 17 mm than that of the dann method 1 27 mm the outliers in the boxplots mean that certain rain gauges exhibit distinct precipitation patterns with the other rain gauges the outlier may also be attributed to the isolation of the rain gauge specifically the two outliers in fig 10 a refer to two different rain gauges one is the westernmost gauge 75 23 e 37 78 n and the other is located near the northern edge 90 15 e 38 37 n both of them are isolated and their cc values with trmm are about 0 2 the upper three outliers of mae in fig 10 c represent the same rain gauge 98 75 e 28 05 n which has nearly half 11 out of 23 of the records of daily precipitation exceeding 50 mm during 2001 and 2005 in the study area the rain gauge also exhibits as outliers in fig 10 b the lower outlier rain gauge 85 97 e 28 18 n is located in southeast of the qinghai tibet plateau gauge precipitation at this rain gauge is overestimated by trmm 4 5 performance on precipitation estimation under different precipitation intensities the spatial distribution of precipitation in the qinghai tibet plateau is very uneven for instance the mean annual precipitation ranges from less than 100 mm to 1000 mm among the 82 rain gauges therefore how to identify an appropriate threshold of extreme precipitation for the study area is an interesting question the percentile method is a widely recognized method for determining the threshold of extreme precipitation friederichs 2010 commonly used percentiles are the 95th and 99th percentiles of which the 99th percentile method can often extract more extreme cases yang et al 2012 sukovich et al 2014 considering the threshold of extreme precipitation may vary at different rain gauges he et al 2021 we calculated the thresholds of extreme precipitation for 82 rain gauges respectively using the 99th percentile method and then took their average as the threshold of extreme precipitation for the qinghai tibet plateau finally 16 3 mm d was selected as the threshold of extreme precipitation for the study area consequently we separate the precipitation in the study area into four intensities namely 0 5 5 10 10 16 3 and 16 3 mm d table 2 shows the errors of original trmm data and the performances of the propose methods on precipitation estimation under four precipitation intensities it can be noticed both the fine tuning method and the dann method achieved good results for the precipitation intensity of 0 10 mm d and their performances degraded for the precipitation intensity of 10 16 3 mm d when the precipitation intensity is below 16 3 mm d transfer learning methods showed improvement of qpe in comparison with the original trmm data however when encountering heavy rain events with precipitation intensity over 16 3 mm d the fine tuning method failed to improve the qpe over the original trmm data the main reason is that only few heavy rain events occurred in the qinghai tibet plateau which led to insufficient training of the neural network models for instance in the recorded daily precipitation at the 82 stations from 2001 too 2005 there are only 23 records with daily precipitation 50 mm of which 11 records are from the same station in addition transfer learning is more likely to capture more common feature from the data and thus somehow owns some disadvantages on extreme events in contrast to fine tuning dann performed better on extreme precipitation estimation with the rmse and mae reduced by 1 0 and 2 9 respectively taking the swish as the loss function dann obtained further better results on extreme precipitation 16 3 mm d estimation with improvements of rmse and mae of 2 5 and 4 5 respectively however dann with swish reduced the estimation accuracy of precipitation with low intensity 0 5 mm d compared with dann that s because swish function tends to overestimate the extreme low precipitation 0 or close to 0 mm d therefore it can be concluded that the s w i s h loss function is effective on improving the extreme high precipitation estimation 4 6 advantages limitations and future work to improve the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in data scarce area a framework has been proposed based on transfer learning methods fine tuning and dann among them the fine tuning method is easy and fast to train the dann method takes the adversarial thought using both target domain and source domain data into training process outperforming the fine tuning method in terms of rmse rb and cc the two methods allow for transferring knowledge learnt from the data sufficient areas e g eastern china to the data scarce regions the qinghai tibet plateau which could be extended in other areas and benefit the qpe and water related risk prevention for the data scarce areas the performances of the proposed methods are impacted by diverse factors including the selection of source domain the lengths of the study period the number of rain gauges with available data the density of the rain gauges elevation etc experiment results indicate that the climatic similarity between the source domain and the target domain plays an important role on the performance of transfer learning methods which implies that users are suggested to select rain gauges data with similar precipitation patterns with the target domain as the source domain using completely different or non related data model may even cause a negative migration futhermore the more rain gauges with similar precipitation patterns available the better results tend to be up to present we did not see clear thresholds for the minimum number of rain gauges and the suitable length of study period required for the source domain for the future work considering the temporal change of precipitation patterns over decades we will attempt to extend the study period such as from 2001 to 2020 compare the model performance over different time spans and try to find some trends besides as the qinghai tibet plateau is vast and exists spatial heterogeneity on climate elevation and landforms transfer learning for sub regions can be investigated furthermore more efforts need to make on further improving the estimation accuracy of the extreme values including heavy precipitation and zero precipitation 5 conclusions in this paper a framework based on transfer learning is proposed to address the problem of quantitative precipitation estimation in the data scarce region taking the qinghai tibet plateau as case study using two transfer learning methods fine tuning and dann we can find that both methods outperformed the conventional co kriging method the fine tuning method is easy and fast to train performing better on the improvement of mae 22 5 the dann method outperforming the fine tuning method towards better improvements of rmse 29 4 re 93 8 and cc from 0 54 to 0 65 the performances of the proposed methods vary spatially with cc decreased from southeast 0 80 to northwest less than0 40 of the plateau the dann method performed well for precipitation estimation under four different intensities better for low precipitation intensity 0 10 mm d worse for extreme precipitation over 16 3 mm d dann with swish loss function achieved better performance on extreme precipitation estimation with improvements of rmse and mae of 2 5 and 4 5 respectively selecting source domain with climatic similarity with the target domain using longer span of rain gauges data are helpful for the transfer learning tasks findings indicate that the proposed transfer learning methods can provide effective tools to improve the quantitative precipitation estimation for data scarce regions which would benefit water related risk reduction and water resources management in the data scarce area credit authorship contribution

2869,merging the satellite and gauge precipitation has been proofed as an efficient approach to improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation however for areas with few and unevenly distributed rain gauges accurate precipitation estimation still remains challenging to address this problem this paper proposes a framework to improve precipitation estimation for the data scarce area based on transfer learning taking the qinghai tibet plateau as a representative case study we used two transfer learning methods fine tuning domain adversarial neural network dann to transfer precipitation fusion model from the source domain to the target domain results indicate that in comparison with the original trmm data the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae of the merged precipitation in the qinghai tibet plateau during 2001 2005 are reduced by 27 6 and 22 5 by using the fine tuning method and reduced by 29 4 and 21 5 by using the dann method respectively meanwhile the correlation coefficient cc is increased from 0 54 trmm data rain gauge data to 0 65 merged data rain gauge data the performances of the proposed methods vary spatially with cc decreased from southeast 0 80 to northwest 0 40 of the study area the dann method performed well on different precipitation intensities while swish loss function can help dann achieve better results on extreme precipitation estimation with rmse and mae reduced by 2 5 and 4 5 respectively the performances of the proposed methods are affected by various factors such as source domain selection and the length of study period findings imply that transfer learning provides new insights and new methods to improve precipitation estimation for the data scarce area which would benefit regional water related disaster defense and water resources management keywords precipitation estimation transfer learning fine tunning dann cnn lstm data fusion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precipitation is an essential component of meteorology and hydrology system its high variability in spatiotemporal distribution and extreme complex process affects hydrologic cycle significantly niu et al 2017 hong et al 2004 for instance it is documented that even 70 80 of the uncertainty in land surface hydrological process simulation is caused by the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation syed et al 2004 gebregiorgis et al 2013 moreover in the context of changing environment climate change has caused and will continue to lead to an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation which will result in more intensive flooding events ipcc 2014 xu et al 2018 therefore it is of great importance to improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation qpe so as for better flood risk prevention to estimate precipitation rain gauges observation provides a traditional but precise and reliable method the world meteorological organization wmo claims that the density of rain gauges should be in the 250 575 km2 per station range for mountainous and hill and valley type terrains arsenault and brissette 2014 in fact due to the constraints of geography economy and human resources many places especially for the areas with high altitude have no rainfall stations or have rainfall stations with low density even for the areas where rainfall stations are established the distribution of rainfall stations is often uneven wu et al 2020 to improve the precipitation estimation accuracy in data scarce regions diverse methods such as tyson polygons inverse distance weighting idw and kriging were widely used for interpolation chen et al 2010 however the above mentioned methods only take the neighboring stations instead of complex spatial variations into account during precipitation interpolation moreover when the rainfall stations are too sparse interpolation is hard to reflect the spatial distribution of precipitation ma et al 2020 alternatively remote sensing provides a valuable way to estimate precipitation with a wide coverage where sensors such as microwave visible light infrared and precipitation radar pr are mainly used to obtain the spatial distribution of precipitation kozu et al 2001 hamada et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 up to present there exist a huge number of remotely precipitation products including trmm cmorph persiann etc comparing with the rain gauge observations the remote sensing precipitation products may underestimate or overestimate the precipitation sun et al 2018 the accuracy of precipitation products is closely related with altitude temporal scale and the rainfall intensity for instance trmm version 7 trmm v7 has been proved to have a better performance than the other aforementioned remote sensing precipitation products liu et al 2016 however the trmm products are still limited by their regional inaccuracy such as relatively high uncertainty in dry and high altitude areas fu et al 2007 xu et al 2017 therefore although remote sensing could estimate precipitation over a wide range the estimation accuracy still needs to be improved since single method i e interpolation based on limited rainfall gauges remote sensing failed in estimating precipitation with high accuracy data fusion was developed by combining satellite data and rain gauge data beck et al 2017 various data fusion methods for qpe have been investigated mckee et al 2016 chao et al 2018 namely including optimal interpolation techniques shen et al 2014 mean filed bias correction method kim et al 2018 kalman filter ushio et al 2009 bayesian estimation todini 2001 probability density function xie and xiong 2011 wavelet transform analysis pradhan et al 2016 statistical objective analysis rozante et al 2010 variation method shao et al 2021 neural network approach long et al 2016 geographical difference analysis verdin et al 2016 geographically weighted regression gwr based methods chao et al 2018 co kriging yan et al 2021 and deep learning models wu et al 2020 loads of previous studies reported that the accuracy of fusion data can be significantly improved than the original satellite data yu et al 2011 fujihara et al 2014 wu et al 2020 however for the data scarce regions due to the lack of rain gauges the applications of data fusion methods are limited taking the qinghai tibet plateau as an example the average correlation coefficient cc between the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep data produced by beck et al 2017 and the rain gauge observation only reached 0 44 liu et al 2019 the cc in the qinghai tibet plateau was much lower than that in southeast china wu et al 2020 thus improving the qpe accuracy in data scarce regions still remains a challenge machine learning has been increasingly applied in the fields of meteorology and hydrology ashouri et al 2015 miao et al 2019 tao et al 2016 due to its strong learning and generalization abilities and its advantages in modeling complex patterns and processing large amounts of data shao et al 2019b shao et al 2015 wu et al 2020 many machine learning algorithms assume that the training data and the test data own the same distribution however in most real applications this assumption can not hold especially when the available samples are limited to deal with the issues of different distributions and insufficient training data transfer learning which can apply the knowledge or pattern learned from a certain field or task to a different but related fields or problems is proposed and rapidly developed up to present transfer learning has been successfully applied to many fields like natural language processing houlsby et al 2019 and image classification weiss et al 2016 meanwhile some attempts have also been made in the fields of hydrology and climate li et al 2021 xie et al 2015 for instance kimura et al 2020 used a convolutional neural network cnn pre trained by large datasets to predict water level and reduced the error by 15 based on a feature transfer method the features of standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei were extracted tian et al 2021 however transfer learning is seldom applied in precipitation estimation in fact the basic idea of transfer learning which is to train a model with certain amount of data in the source domain and transfer the learned knowledge to the target domain with limited data fits the problem of precipitation estimation in data scarce region well this study aims to improve the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in data scarce area by using the transfer learning methods the specific objectives are as follows 1 to transfer precipitation data fusion model trained in eastern china to the qinghai tibet plateau in china 2 to verify and compare the suitability of different transfer learning methods on precipitation estimation in the qinghai tibet plateau 3 to produce an improved precipitation dataset for the qinghai tibet plateau 2 research area and data acquisition 2 1 study area due to the vast territory 9 6 million km2 and large geographical spans 73 135 e and 10 53 n as shown in fig 1 china covers complex terrains including mountains plateaus hills basins plains and deserts significantly affected by the complex terrain annual precipitation in china exists high variations on both spatial distribution ranging from less than 100 mm to 2000 mm lu et al 2019 and temporal distribution 60 70 concentrates in flood season liu et al 2016 to measure precipitation about 800 national meteorological stations and 2000 automatic rain gauges have been established over the mainland of china however the distribution of these meteorological stations is imbalanced with higher density in eastern china and lower density in western china for instance the qinghai tibet plateau occupies about 25 of the total area of china and accounts for 10 3 of the total number of meteorological stations in china in this study we take the mainland of china fig 1 as the research area and focus on two regions eastern china with 448 rain gauges minimum elevation 0 m maximum elevation 2629 m over the east of 110 e where can be regarded as data sufficient area and the qinghai tibet plateau with 82 rain stations minimum elevation 2231 m maximum elevation 5129 m where can be regarded as data scarce area the two regions have large differences on terrain climates and landforms the eastern china with elevation ranging from 0 to 2700 m is dominated by plateaus and basins around 1000 2700 m low hills less than 1000 m and plains less than 200 m the area covers several climate zones according to the köppen geiger climate classification rules peel et al 2007 namely continental climate in northeast of china arid climate in northern china and temperate climate hot and rainy in summer and a cold and dry in winter in southern china guan et al 2020 in contrast the qinghai tibet plateau target domain with elevation ranging from about 2400 to above 8800 m is dominated by frozen soils grassland glaciers and alpine lakes sun et al 2021 the area belongs to the alpine climate characterized by strong solar radiation low temperature large daily temperature variation and distinct dry and wet seasons pan et al 2017 lu et al 2019 guan et al 2020 due to its vast territory annual precipitation shows high disparity on spatial distribution decreasing from east to west and from south to north for instance the annual precipitation in this area is about 500 mm reaching 500 to 1000 mm in southeast and only 40 100 mm in northwest yao et al 2012 2 2 data acquisition this study is a further study of the previous work wu et al 2020 to keep the comparison in consistent we use the same study period namely from 2001 to 2005 the data used in this study include the trmm 3b42 v7 satellite data gridsat b1 data and rain gauges data in the mainland of china between 2001 and 2005 the trmm 3b42 v7 data 0 25 3 h are obtained from nasa https pmm nasa gov data access downloads trmm gridsat b1 data 0 07 3 h are downloaded from noaa https www ncdc noaa gov gridsat gridsat index php the observed daily precipitation data at 530 rain gauges are provided by china meteorological data service center https data cma cn besides digital elevation model dem data 90 m are obtained from the usgs nasa srtm data http srtm csi cgiqar org srtmdata 3 methodology the framework of the methods adopted in this study is illustrated in fig 2 it covers three modules data preprocessing yellow part precipitation fusion model green part and transfer learning tasks blue part firstly data from different sources with different spatiotemporal resolutions are preprocessed to reach a unified form afterwards the cnn lstm model used for precipitation fusion was established wu et al 2020 finally the precipitation fusion model was transferred to the data scarce regions by using two transfer learning strategies fine tuning and dann network which are shown in fig 3 and fig 5 respectively 3 1 data preprocessing firstly to keep temporal consistency with rain gauge data the satellite precipitation data trmm 3b42 v7 are converted from 3 hourly to daily cumulative precipitation to reach consistent spatial resolution trmm and gridsat b1 data are downscaled by the widely used nearest neighbor interpolation method zheng et al 2017 to 0 05 and dem is resampled to 0 05 by pixel averaging as well after achieving unified spatio temporal resolution all the data are normalized considering the spatial representativeness of a rain gauge for each rain gauge 7 7 grids about 38 5 km 38 5 km centered on it are identified and their corresponding satellite data are extracted finally the dataset including rain gauge data series and their corresponding satellite data series with 7 7 grids from 2001 to 2005 are established 3 2 cnn lstm model for precipitation fusion to better merge precipitation of satellite data and rain gauge data more recently wu et al 2020 proposed a joint spatio temporal deep neural network model by coupling cnn convolutional neural network and lstm long short term memory network in the cnn lstm model cnn is used to learn the spatial correlations between the rain gauge data and the surrounding satellite data while lstm is applied to capture the time dependence of precipitation information at different time stamps for more details of the cnn lstm model for precipitation fusion please refer to the publication by wu et al 2020 in this study we take the cnn lstm model for precipitation fusion as a basis and focus on transfer learning namely transferring the pretrained cnn lstm model in data sufficient area to data scarce area 3 3 transfer learning in this section we will introduce some definitions of transfer learning a domain d can be described as d x p x where x is defined as a feature space and p x is defined as probability distribution x x 1 x 2 x n x a task t can be defined as t y f where y is a label space and f is an objective predictive function if there are two specific domains a source domain d s and a target domain d t and they have learning tasks t s and t t separately transfer learning aims to improve the effects of target predictive function f t by using the knowledge learned from source domain with the condition that d s d t or t s t t according to what to transfer transfer learning can be divided into four categories instance transfer feature representation transfer parameter transfer and relationship knowledge transfer pan et al 2010 instance transfer can be realized by re weighting some labeled data in source domain and adding these data into the target domain data quionero candela et al 2009 jiang and zhai 2007 instance transfer represents the idea that some samples in the source domain are weighted again and it may not use full source data it is more flexible because its implementation can be simple feature representation means to find out features that can reduce the distance between the source and the target domains and benefit the performance of models blitzer et al 2007 argyriou et al 2007 evgeniou et al 2008 parameter transfer also called model transfer means that sharing some parameters prior distributions or hyper parameters between two domains lawrence and platt 2004 bonilla et al 2008 schwaighofer et al 2005 as for relationship knowledge transfer it can be understood that some relationships among the source data and the target data are similar and the relationships are transferred mihalkova and mooney 2008 davis and domingos 2008 the former three methods require the assumption of independent and identically distributed on data while the last one doesn t among the transfer learning strategies parameter transfer is fast to achieve and has been widely used in previous studies ma et al 2019 huang et al 2020 in this paper we used two methods of parameter transfer to improve the precipitation estimation accuracy in data scarce region fine tuning and domain adversarial neural network dann 3 3 1 fine tuning fine tuning is a parameter transfer learning method and has been widely used in image classification yosinski et al 2014 it generally includes three steps as follows 1 pretrain a basic model with the data in the source domain and save its network structure and parameters 2 freeze the front part of the pretrained network and fine tune the weight of the last full connected layer of the network by using the training data of the target domain and 3 use the test data in the target domain to verify the effectiveness of the fine tuned model generally the first layer of the pretrained network is not particularly related to the target dataset while the last layer of the network is closely related to the target task correspondingly the features of the first layer are called general features and those of the last layer are called specific features yosinski et al 2014 therefore fine tuning strategy usually adjusts the parameters of the last full connected layers of the pretrained network in this study we regard the data at 448 rain gauges with the longitude ranging from 110 e to 135 e and the corresponding satellite data as the source domain data while regard those data in the qinghai tibet plateau as the target domain data firstly we use the source domain data to train the precipitation fusion model cnn lstm model proposed by wu et al 2020 afterwards fixing the parameters in the front layers of the pre trained model we adjust the parameters of the full connection layers by using the target domain data the flowchart of the fine tuning approach is illustrated in fig 3 3 3 2 domain adversarial neural network dann domain adaption is another strategy of parameter transfer learning aiming to address the problem that the source domain and the target domain have the same task but with different distributions generative adversarial networks gan which contains generator and discriminator models provides a promising solution to domain adaption via feature space alignment goodfellow et al 2014 based on the mechanism of gan the domain adversarial neural network dann was proposed ganin and lempitsky 2015 for transfer learning as shown in fig 4 dann includes three components feature extractor g f θ f quantitative precipitation estimator g y θ y and domain classifier g d θ d specifically feature extractor aims at mapping data to a feature space and identifying the common features of the two domains quantitative precipitation estimator is used to predict precipitation of the target domain in the feature space domain classifier is supposed to distinguish the source domain from the target domain in the feature space the domain classifier is connected to the feature extractor via a gradient reversal layer grl which multiplies the gradient by a negative constant during the process of backpropagation training while transfers parameters in the forward propagation training the grl ensures the distributions of features from two domains are extracted similarly leading to domain invariant features overall the loss of dann can be calculated by using equation 1 1 e θ f θ y θ d i 1 n d i 0 l y g y g f x i θ f θ y y i λ i 1 n l d g d g f x i θ f θ d y i i 1 n d i 0 l y i θ f θ y λ i 1 n l d i θ f θ d where the former part is the loss of label classification the smaller the better the latter part is the loss of domain classification the larger the better the main task of dann is not only cheating the domain classifier but also satisfying the label classifier at the same time therefore the parameters should be updated following equation 2 2 θ f θ y argmin θ f θ y e θ f θ y θ d θ d argmax θ d e θ f θ y θ d at the same time the gradient reversal layer grl is introduced into dann in the forward propagation the function of grl is identity transform while in the backward propagation grl reverses the gradient and updates the parameters 3 g r l s f r o n t w a r d b e h a v i o r r λ x x 4 g r l s b a c k w a r d b e h a v i o r d r λ dx i in this study we used the data from the source domain eastern china and the target domain qinghai tibet plateau to build up the domain adversarial neural network dann model for feature space alignment afterwards the cnn lstm model was established for precipitation fusion the flowchart of the domain adversarial neural network dann method is depicted in fig 5 in order to better capture the characteristics of high intensity precipitation we used a new loss function called s w i s h ramachandran et al 2017 for model optimization as shown in fig 6 the s w i s h function assigns more significance to peak value corresponding to this study the error of precipitation with high intensity will be more concerned during the model optimization the expression of s w i s h in this study can be written as follows 5 swish r m s e s i g m o i d r m s e 3 4 evaluation metrics and evaluation strategy to quantitatively evaluate the performances of the transfer learning based models on precipitation estimation we split the dataset into training set and validation set via splitting the rain gauges sites and applied the 10 fold cross validation strategy intuitively fig 7 illustrates the evaluation strategy specifically the data are firstly organized by rain gauges each of which has a site id for each site the data is sorted by time at each timestamp each sample includes the observed daily precipitation at the site trmm precipitation in a 7 7 grid centered on the site dem data in a 7 7 grid centered on the site and the gridsat data in a 7 7 grid centered on the site afterwards the data of 82 rain gauges are divided into 10 folds among which 9 folds are used for training and the left one fold used for validation after 10 rounds data of rain gauges in each fold should have been validated finally the average of results at 10 rounds are used to represent the performance of the method the reason why we did not divide the dataset into different time periods is to avoid destroying the temporal correlation of data at the rain gauges meanwhile root mean square error rmse relative bias rb mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient cc are selected as evaluation criteria these indicators are defined by the following equations 6 9 according to bennett et al 2013 6 rmse i 1 n p pre i p obs i 2 n 7 rb i 1 n p pre i p obs i i 1 n p pre i 8 mae i 1 n p pre i p obs i n 9 cc i 1 n p pre i p pre p obs i p obs i 1 n p pre i p pre 2 i 1 n p obs i p obs 2 where pi pre and pi obs denote the predicted and the observed precipitation respectively ppre and pobs are the average values of the predicted and the observed precipitation respectively n is the number of all observations based on the above mentioned metrics taking the 448 rain gauges data as source domain the performances of the fine tuning and dann approaches can be initially evaluated regarding the superior method to further evaluate its efficiency we take more influencing factors into account specifically considering source domain may affect model s performance we conduct comparative experiments by taking rain gauges data over different hydro meteorological zones as different source domains considering the length of study period may also impact the results we test the performances of the superior model over different time spans e g 1 2 3 4 and 5 years respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance comparison among different methods to evaluate the performances of the proposed transfer learning based methods fine tuning and dann on improving precipitation estimation in the data scarce region qinghai tibet plateau taking the rain gauge data as ground truth we compared the merged precipitation by using the fine tuning dann and co kriging methods with the original trmm data during 2001 2005 the comparison results are listed in table 1 the correlation coefficient cc between trmm data and rain gauge data is 0 54 which indicates that the original trmm data are associated with relatively high uncertainty based on the transfer learning methods the accuracy of precipitation estimations in the qinghai tibet plateau has been improved specifically fine tuning method increased the correlation coefficient by 16 7 and reduced the rmse and mae by 27 6 22 5 respectively in contrast the dann method performed better increasing the cc by 19 6 and decreasing the rmse and mae by 29 4 and 21 5 respectively in contrast the representative conventional method co kriging achieved a lower cc 0 47 and the transfer learning methods showed superiority dann and fine tuning methods are both based on the fusion model of cnn lstm wu et al 2020 however dann showed a higher mean absolute error mae than fine tuning which means that dann has a weaker ability of peak value s prediction and tends to get more stable results so that dann has fewer outliers resulting in lower root mean square error rmse and a higher correlation coefficient cc we assumed that dann tends to reduce the distance of the distribution between source and target domain while fine tuning tends to approach the target domain overall the methods of transfer learning achieved better results on improving the accuracy of precipitation estimation in the qinghai tibet plateau than the conventional co kriging method and the dann method outperformed the fine tuning method to illustrate the performances of different methods in a more intuitive way fig 8 shows the scatter plots of daily precipitation observed by rain gauges versus daily precipitation estimated by trmm co kriging fine tuning and dann respectively 4 2 performance of the dann method under different lengths of study period the initial evaluation of the proposed transfer learning methods section 4 1 indicates that the dann method achieved better performance on qpe in the study area to further evaluate the efficiency of the dann method we performed the model under different lengths of study period in this study we took 1 year 2001 2 years 2001 2002 3 years 2001 2003 4 years 2001 2004 and 5 years 2001 2005 for comparison and presented the results in table 1 overall the dann method effectively improved qpe over different lengths of periods 1 5 years in term of all the evaluation criteria although it did not show the longer the study period the better the performance relatively the dann method achieved the best results over a 5 year period 2001 2005 for instance when the study period increased from 1 year to 5 years the rmse was reduced by 27 1 26 4 28 1 29 1 and 29 4 respectively accordingly the cc was improved by 12 7 14 0 16 4 16 1 and 20 4 respectively to some extent the results in this study imply that the dann method is robust to the length of study period however when taking only one year results will vary depending on the year that is selected it can be found from table 1 that uncertainties associated with trmm in different years also differ furthermore a short study period e g 1 year may hinder the transfer learning methods capture the temporal change features of the precipitation data e g seasonal change therefore we suggest using available data with longer study period 1 year when using the dann method for extended similar applications for the extended applications considering many factors such as te difference of study areas data quality climate characteristics source domain may affect the results it is hard to give a specific value for the suitable length of study period in contrast we recommend to discuss the appropriate length of study period in light of the actual situation of specific applications 4 3 performance of the dann method under different source domains furthermore considering different source domains may affect the performance of the transfer learning model dann we evaluated the performance of the dann method on qpe during 2001 2005 with different source domains in this study taking chinese spatial distribution of the mean annual concentration index ci an indicator used to evaluate the distribution pattern of daily precipitation as reference lu et al 2019 to choose potential domains the larger the ci value is the larger the contribution of heavy precipitation to the total precipitation has therefore if an area has a larger ci value its precipitation tends to concentrate in fewer days according to the ci distribution map in china lu et al 2019 the ci of the qinghai tibet plateau shows spatial heterogeneity covering several ranges namely 0 54 0 58 0 58 0 60 0 60 0 62 0 62 0 64 and 0 64 0 66 regions within the similar range of ci value means that their precipitation patterns are similar for example the south eastern qinghai tibet plateau where has relatively abundant precipitation with an annual precipitation above 1000 mm mainly concentrated in summer is similar to source regions with ci value of 0 62 0 66 specifically 83 rain gauges with ci of 0 62 0 64 290 rain gauges with ci of 0 64 0 66 231 rain gauges with ci of 0 66 0 68 and 77 rain gauges with ci of 0 68 0 70 are selected as different source domains the comparison results are presented in table 1 the results of different source domains indicate table 1 that using 448 rain gauges in eastern china as source domain achieved the best results in terms of all evaluation indices as the number of rain gauges in source domain decreased ranging from 448 to 77 only the improvement of rmse showed a consistent downward trend ranging from 29 4 to 27 9 comparing the results of two source domains with similar ci 0 62 0 64 0 64 0 66 with the qinghai tibet plateau target domain we can find that the source domain with 290 rain gauges achieved better results than that with 83 rain gauges in terms of rmse mae and cc on the other hand comparsions in two groups of source domains 83 vs 77 and 290 vs 231 indicate that the former source domains outperformed the latter ones the source domain with 83 rain gauges ci 0 62 0 64 even achieved equal cc 0 64 and better rb and mae than the source domain with 231 rain gauges ci 0 66 0 68 briefly it can be noted that both the number of rain gauges in source domain and the similarity of precipitation pattern between source domain and target domain are important factors affecting transfer learning for source domains with similar size the source domain with more similar ci with target domain tends to achieve better results for source domains with similar ci the source domain with larger size tends to achieve better results 4 4 comparison on spatial distributions of the evaluation metrics to illustrate the spatial distribution of the evaluation results the rmse mae and cc at each rain gauge are calculated and interpolated over the qinghai tibet plateau fig 9 displays the spatial distributions of the evaluation metrics for precipitation estimation in the qinghai tibet plateau the results indicate that dann and fine tuning methods achieved better results than the original trmm in terms of precipitation estimation precision specifically the merged precipitation based on transfer learning of dann has higher correlation coefficients of closing to 0 8 in the south and east of the qinghai tibet plateau while lower cc below 0 4 in the northern and western regions the imbalanced distribution of cc may be due to the uneven distribution of rain gauges in the qinghai tibet plateau which means that gauges in the eastern plateau are denser while the western gauges are sparser since limited information can be learnt from the limited data the cc in the northern and western regions of plateau is low the method of fine tuning is an insufficient training method which has led to higher uncertainty of precipitation estimation however fine tuning method can be performed easily and fast to further illustrate the statistics of qpe at 82 rain gauges fig 10 presents the boxplots of three statistical metrics cc rmse and mae of daily precipitation estimated by trmm dann and fine tuning methods fig 10 a indicates the dann method and the fine tuning method achieved similar statistics of cc with a median of 0 61 at the 82 rain gauges which is significantly improved in comparison with the original trmm with a median of cc of 0 53 the median of rmse of the dann method 2 82 mm was smaller than that of the fine tuning method 2 88 mm while the fine tuning method achieved a smaller median of mae 1 17 mm than that of the dann method 1 27 mm the outliers in the boxplots mean that certain rain gauges exhibit distinct precipitation patterns with the other rain gauges the outlier may also be attributed to the isolation of the rain gauge specifically the two outliers in fig 10 a refer to two different rain gauges one is the westernmost gauge 75 23 e 37 78 n and the other is located near the northern edge 90 15 e 38 37 n both of them are isolated and their cc values with trmm are about 0 2 the upper three outliers of mae in fig 10 c represent the same rain gauge 98 75 e 28 05 n which has nearly half 11 out of 23 of the records of daily precipitation exceeding 50 mm during 2001 and 2005 in the study area the rain gauge also exhibits as outliers in fig 10 b the lower outlier rain gauge 85 97 e 28 18 n is located in southeast of the qinghai tibet plateau gauge precipitation at this rain gauge is overestimated by trmm 4 5 performance on precipitation estimation under different precipitation intensities the spatial distribution of precipitation in the qinghai tibet plateau is very uneven for instance the mean annual precipitation ranges from less than 100 mm to 1000 mm among the 82 rain gauges therefore how to identify an appropriate threshold of extreme precipitation for the study area is an interesting question the percentile method is a widely recognized method for determining the threshold of extreme precipitation friederichs 2010 commonly used percentiles are the 95th and 99th percentiles of which the 99th percentile method can often extract more extreme cases yang et al 2012 sukovich et al 2014 considering the threshold of extreme precipitation may vary at different rain gauges he et al 2021 we calculated the thresholds of extreme precipitation for 82 rain gauges respectively using the 99th percentile method and then took their average as the threshold of extreme precipitation for the qinghai tibet plateau finally 16 3 mm d was selected as the threshold of extreme precipitation for the study area consequently we separate the precipitation in the study area into four intensities namely 0 5 5 10 10 16 3 and 16 3 mm d table 2 shows the errors of original trmm data and the performances of the propose methods on precipitation estimation under four precipitation intensities it can be noticed both the fine tuning method and the dann method achieved good results for the precipitation intensity of 0 10 mm d and their performances degraded for the precipitation intensity of 10 16 3 mm d when the precipitation intensity is below 16 3 mm d transfer learning methods showed improvement of qpe in comparison with the original trmm data however when encountering heavy rain events with precipitation intensity over 16 3 mm d the fine tuning method failed to improve the qpe over the original trmm data the main reason is that only few heavy rain events occurred in the qinghai tibet plateau which led to insufficient training of the neural network models for instance in the recorded daily precipitation at the 82 stations from 2001 too 2005 there are only 23 records with daily precipitation 50 mm of which 11 records are from the same station in addition transfer learning is more likely to capture more common feature from the data and thus somehow owns some disadvantages on extreme events in contrast to fine tuning dann performed better on extreme precipitation estimation with the rmse and mae reduced by 1 0 and 2 9 respectively taking the swish as the loss function dann obtained further better results on extreme precipitation 16 3 mm d estimation with improvements of rmse and mae of 2 5 and 4 5 respectively however dann with swish reduced the estimation accuracy of precipitation with low intensity 0 5 mm d compared with dann that s because swish function tends to overestimate the extreme low precipitation 0 or close to 0 mm d therefore it can be concluded that the s w i s h loss function is effective on improving the extreme high precipitation estimation 4 6 advantages limitations and future work to improve the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in data scarce area a framework has been proposed based on transfer learning methods fine tuning and dann among them the fine tuning method is easy and fast to train the dann method takes the adversarial thought using both target domain and source domain data into training process outperforming the fine tuning method in terms of rmse rb and cc the two methods allow for transferring knowledge learnt from the data sufficient areas e g eastern china to the data scarce regions the qinghai tibet plateau which could be extended in other areas and benefit the qpe and water related risk prevention for the data scarce areas the performances of the proposed methods are impacted by diverse factors including the selection of source domain the lengths of the study period the number of rain gauges with available data the density of the rain gauges elevation etc experiment results indicate that the climatic similarity between the source domain and the target domain plays an important role on the performance of transfer learning methods which implies that users are suggested to select rain gauges data with similar precipitation patterns with the target domain as the source domain using completely different or non related data model may even cause a negative migration futhermore the more rain gauges with similar precipitation patterns available the better results tend to be up to present we did not see clear thresholds for the minimum number of rain gauges and the suitable length of study period required for the source domain for the future work considering the temporal change of precipitation patterns over decades we will attempt to extend the study period such as from 2001 to 2020 compare the model performance over different time spans and try to find some trends besides as the qinghai tibet plateau is vast and exists spatial heterogeneity on climate elevation and landforms transfer learning for sub regions can be investigated furthermore more efforts need to make on further improving the estimation accuracy of the extreme values including heavy precipitation and zero precipitation 5 conclusions in this paper a framework based on transfer learning is proposed to address the problem of quantitative precipitation estimation in the data scarce region taking the qinghai tibet plateau as case study using two transfer learning methods fine tuning and dann we can find that both methods outperformed the conventional co kriging method the fine tuning method is easy and fast to train performing better on the improvement of mae 22 5 the dann method outperforming the fine tuning method towards better improvements of rmse 29 4 re 93 8 and cc from 0 54 to 0 65 the performances of the proposed methods vary spatially with cc decreased from southeast 0 80 to northwest less than0 40 of the plateau the dann method performed well for precipitation estimation under four different intensities better for low precipitation intensity 0 10 mm d worse for extreme precipitation over 16 3 mm d dann with swish loss function achieved better performance on extreme precipitation estimation with improvements of rmse and mae of 2 5 and 4 5 respectively selecting source domain with climatic similarity with the target domain using longer span of rain gauges data are helpful for the transfer learning tasks findings indicate that the proposed transfer learning methods can provide effective tools to improve the quantitative precipitation estimation for data scarce regions which would benefit water related risk reduction and water resources management in the data scarce area credit authorship contribution
