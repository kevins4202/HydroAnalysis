8085,study region three river source region qinghai tibetan plateau china study focus evapotranspiration et is often the largest loss of water from grassland ecosystems and consists of two constituents evaporation e and transpiration t but it is very difficult to separate e and t in this study we used an energy balance model shuttleworth wallace and a water balance model soilwat2 to estimate the water budget variables over a 10 year period 2007 2016 in a degraded alpine meadow in the three river source region on the qinghai tibetan plateau new hydrological insights for the region the models produced contrasting patterns of precipitation and et partitioning at the study site precipitation partitioning by sw2 resulted in substantial fluxes of both et and deep drainage while et estimated by sw consumed almost all precipitation et was partitioned by the models into different annual e and t fluxes as well as different monthly and annual t et our study site located in an important water source region suggests that its water balance would contribute to drainage which aligns better with sw2 results the surprising discrepancies between the models in the partitioning of precipitation into t e and deep drainage however is limiting our understanding and management of the degraded site and will require future work to reconcile keywords the soilwat2 model the shuttleworth wallace model water balance energy balance degraded meadow 1 introduction the three river source region trsr located in the central part of the qinghai tibetan plateau is the headwaters of three great rivers of asia the yangtze the yellow and the mekong rivers it is often called the water tower of asia since the major rivers in china originate from the trsr and its altitude is more than 4000 m guo et al 2016 qu et al 2018 xu et al 2018 the trsr encompasses a surface area of approximately 3 95 105 km2 of which more than two third of this region is covered by alpine meadow zhang et al 2019 however the degraded meadow area has been expanding under the combined effects of climate change e g rapid temperature rise and human disturbance such as overgrazing zhou et al 2005 wang et al 2017 in recent years the moderately degraded grassland area has accounted for about 58 of the total usable grassland liu et al 2008 meadow degradation can lead to not only a significant decline in ecosystem productivity but also to changes in both water and energy budgets however there is a lack of long term quantitative research on the water budget in this region especially how precipitation is partitioned into soil evaporation e vegetation transpiration t and deep drainage d therefore it is important that we clarify the contributions of e t and d to the water budget in degraded meadows and provide a basis for understanding the water resource dynamics in the trsr the terrestrial ecosystem water balance is controlled and explained by the partitioning of incoming precipitation p into evapotranspiration et runoff ro soil water storage δs and deep drainage d lauenroth and bradford 2006 thus the annual water balance can be written as follows 1 1 p et ro s d ro is small and is often assumed to be negligible for a relatively flat terrain and δs 0 on a multi year scale lauenroth and bradford 2006 these assumptions reduce eq 1 1 to 1 2 p et d eq 1 2 suggests that annual precipitation is returned to the atmosphere as et or lost from the soil as deep drainage between these two processes et is the main component of water loss from most grassland ecosystems to the atmosphere lauenroth and bradford 2006 wang and dickinson 2012 based on the energy balance of the terrestrial ecosystem net radiation rn can be partitioned into soil g sensible h and latent λe heat fluxes stannard 1993 zhang et al 2019 1 3 r n g h λ e λe is the energy consumed by et which makes it possible to estimate et from knowledge of the remaining terms in equation 3 et is divided into evaporation e and transpiration t and changes in e and t have important consequences for ecological biogeochemical and hydrological processes over numerous temporal and spatial scales hu et al 2009 moran et al 2009 our understanding of precipitation and et partitioning is limited due largely to complex interactions between biotic and environmental factors moran et al 2009 xiao et al 2018 et partitioning can be determined in situ eddy covariance system bowen ratio equipment weighing lysimeters and sap flow meters williams et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 agam et al 2012 holland et al 2013 or by modeling lauenroth and bradford 2006 hu et al 2009 bradford et al 2014a and 2014b chen et al 2020 or both the advantage of modeling is that it can address ecosystem processes over a range of temporal scales we choose two widely used models soilwat2 sw2 and shuttleworth wallace sw to explore whether the results of models developed based on different principles are different the sw2 ecosystem water balance model simulates interception and subsequent evaporation from vegetation and litter snow dynamics sublimation and wind redistribution infiltration into the soil percolation through soil layers hydraulic redistribution bare soil evaporation transpiration from each soil layer and deep drainage sw2 is open source and available as an r package schlaepfer and murphy 2018 sw2 has been used and validated in a range of dryland ecosystems globally including dry grasslands big sagebrush ecosystems palmquist et al 2018 croplands bradford et al 2017 and low elevation forests bradford et al 2014a and 2014b unlike the sw2 model the sw model does not calculate water balance but estimates et from energy balance calculations e and t are weighted coefficients using a combination of soil and canopy resistances shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the sw model makes it possible to partition et into e and t using surface resistances to represent energy transfer from plants rsc and soil rss and aerodynamic resistances raa rac ras to control the transfer from these surfaces to the atmosphere zhao et al 2015 the sw model is well established and has been widely used to estimate et from grassland hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 and cropland ecosystems wei et al 2018 chen et al 2020 we compared precipitation and et partitioning for a degraded meadow in the trsr using soilwat2 an ecosystem water balance simulation model and the shuttleworth wallace energy balance approach our analyses focused on answering the following three questions 1 do the two approaches water balance and energy balance produce similar estimates of the partitioning of precipitation and et if not what accounts for the differences 2 to which input variables are the soilwat2 and shuttleworth wallace models most sensitive and 3 which models results best represent the ecohydrological context of the trsr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study site is located in a degraded meadow 34 24 n 100 24 e 3963 m a s l in maqin county qinghai province china mean annual precipitation is 514 mm with greater than 80 falling in the growing season from may to september while the mean annual temperature is 0 5 li et al 2014 he et al 2018 and the warmest is july 10 in this degraded meadow the ground cover is dominated by forbs such as aconitum pendulum ligularia virgaurea pedicularis kansuensis oxytropis ochrantha ajania tenuifolia polygonum sibiricum euphorbia fischeriana and morina chinensis the average vegetation height is less than 5 cm and maximum canopy cover is approximately 55 the soil is classified as humic cambisol iuss working group wrb 2014 2 2 modelling we used the soilwat2 sw2 and the shuttleworth wallace sw models to calculate et partitioning and water balance from 2007 to 2016 and applied observed data from an eddy covariance system to make a comparison appendix 1 of supplementary materials the weather data were either directly obtained from maqin meteorological station or calculated from the directly obtained data 34 28 n 100 15 e 3720 m a s l national meteorological data center http data cma cn we used a leaf area meter li 3100 li cor to observe leaf area index lai about once a month during the growing season in 2007 live leaves were cut from 5 randomly selected quadrats with an area of 6 25 10 2 m2 and the mean lai for the 5 quadrats was used in this study lai gaps were linearly interpolated to daily intervals using the same approach as li et al 2006 2 2 1 the soilwat2 model we used the soilwat2 sw2 model v3 4 0 details available in github repositories schlaepfer and murphy 2018 sw2 uses multiple soil layers and several vegetation types to simulate the daily water balance in dryland ecosystems palmquist et al 2018 bradford et al 2020 daily weather soil properties of each soil layer and vegetation are the main inputs required to run sw2 precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperatures are used as daily inputs atmospheric demand is determined additionally as a function of geographic and topographic location as well as albedo and mean monthly relative humidity wind speed and cloud cover sw2 represents each vegetation type with a profile of root water uptake capacity as well as monthly biomass values of litter aboveground and leaf components since there is a lot of bare soil in the degraded meadow and maximum canopy cover is approximately 55 we divided the degraded meadow into vegetation patches and soil patches for our simulations the vegetation patches account for 55 of the whole degraded meadow and the soil patches account for 45 we represented the soils at the two study sites with texture gravel content and bulk density of each of eight soil layers at depths of 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 cm sw2 simulations of the daily water balance include interception by and evaporation from the plant canopy and litter layer infiltration into the soil percolation hydraulic redistribution deep drainage i e percolation at the lower simulated soil boundary evaporation and root water extraction for transpiration from each layer sw2 estimates daily evapotranspiration as the sum of bare soil evaporation evaporation of surface water e g water intercepted by vegetation sublimation from a snowpack and transpiration each process is calculated by considering potential evapotranspiration pet as a maximum daily rate which is limited by scaling factors such as snow cover leaf area water use efficiency shading by vegetation and soil moisture 2 2 2 the shuttleworth

and sw models to the uncertainties of input parameters the percentage variation in the estimated et e and t were calculated in this study values of input parameters were varied by 5 10 20 respectively then variation rate vr of estimated et e and t were calculated by 14 vr i v i n i n 100 where iv is the value of et e and t estimated from varied input parameters and in is the value of et e and t estimated from normal input parameters for each model we chose 10 input parameters to vary ideally we would select the same parameters however the input parameters of the two models are not exactly the same finally we chose precipitation air temperature wind speed sky cover relative humidity gravel content proportion of sand proportion of clay biomass and leaf area index for sw2 and soil water

the same e g air temperature some are similar e g relative humidity for sw2 and vapor pressure deficit for sw and some are very important for the respective model e g precipitation for sw2 and net radiation for sw 3 results 3 1 precipitation partitioning precipitation is the only source of water input for our two study sites and annual precipitation ranged from 463 to 629 mm during our 10 year study period with a mean of 530 mm and a coefficient of variation cv of 12 table 1 for sw2 almost all of the precipitation was lost to the combination of evapotranspiration etsw2 and deep drainage in the degraded meadow etsw2 plus deep drainage accounted for 95 105 of annual precipitation with a mean of 99 table 2 etsw2 accounted for the largest part of water loss the annual ratio of etsw2 to precipitation ranged from 71 to 86 with a mean of 78 table 2 for the sw model the percentage of annual precipitation that was lost by etsw ranged from 76 to 114 with a mean of 98 for the degraded meadow table 3 the majority of precipitation was accounted for by etsw 3 2 evapotranspiration partitioning evapotranspiration estimated by the sw2 etsw2 and sw etsw models had similar seasonal variation with lowest values in non growing season october april and highest values during growing season may september fig 1 etsw2 and etsw both started to increase in march and reached their maxima during the summer then decreased to minima in december and or january although etsw2 and etsw had similar seasonal trends compared with etsw2 etsw had more day to day variability fig 1 the amounts of etsw2 ranged from 359 to 449 mm with a mean of 411 mm while the amounts of etsw were larger than that of etsw2 the minimum maximum and mean for etsw were 427 599 and 516 mm respectively 3 3 differences in evapotranspiration partitioning both the sw2 and sw models partitioned evapotranspiration into its two important components evaporation and transpiration the sw2 model estimates evaporation esw2 in three components bare soil evaporation eb snow loss and surface evaporation es for the degraded meadow evaporation and transpiration modeled by sw2 esw2 and tsw2 and sw esw and tsw had similar seasonal variation fig 1 for esw2 and esw they both had two peaks in each year which was most pronounced for esw fig 1 the first peak of esw2 occurred in april may and the second in september october while for esw the first peak was in april may and the second in october november tsw2 and tsw both began to increase in march april and reached peak values in july august then decreased to 0 in november december fig 1 esw and tsw was more variable day to day than esw2 and tsw2 the annual amounts of esw and tsw were larger than esw2 and tsw2 tables 2 and 3 the means of esw2 and tsw2 were 299 and 112 mm while the means for esw and tsw were 350 and 166 mm although sw2 and sw had differences in their partitioning of evapotranspiration into e and t they estimated similar values of proportions tables 2 and 3 for sw2 the mean annual ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration t et was 27 while for the sw model the mean ratio was 32 3 4 sensitivity analysis of the two models the sensitivities of modeled evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration to input parameters were different between the models in the case of sw2 relative humidity and sky cover were the most influential in changing etsw2 esw2 and tsw2 fig 2 for example varying relative humidity by 5 20 introduced an average deviation ranging from 2 to 10 in etsw2 from 1 to 7 in esw2 and from 3 to 13 in tsw2 tables a1 in appendix 2 of supplementary materials besides relative humidity and sky cover esw2 and tsw2 were also sensitive to precipitation air temperature ta and leaf area index lai for sw the most influential factors affecting etsw esw and tsw were net radiation rn soil water content swc and ta fig 3 for example varying rn by 5 20 introduced an average deviation ranging from 5 20 in etsw esw and tsw tables a2 in appendix 2 of supplementary materials evapotranspiration partitioning of sw was also sensitive to lai and wind speed but these two factors did not have much impact on etsw 4 discussion the water balance and et partitioning calculated based on soilwat2 sw2 and derived from the shuttleworth wallace sw model had some important differences the explicit water balance approach sw2 partitioned precipitation into two components et and deep drainage this contrasts with the energy balance approach of the sw model which estimated that et consumed all precipitation during the study period the differences in total water loss were not reflected in proportions of et represented by e and t here the estimates were nearly identical 4 1 what caused the difference in the results of the two models because we used same weather data for both models the annual amount of et should have been similar but our results showed that etsw was significantly higher than etsw2 p 0 01 tables 2 and 3 figs 1 and 5 appendix 3 in supplementary materials the difference between sw2 and sw derives from their different fundamental assumptions sw2 is based on water balance and it calculates the various components evaporation transpiration deep drainage etc using input variables and process based relationships lauenroth and bradford 2006 palmquist et al 2018 bradford et al 2020 sw is governed by energy balance and estimates evapotranspiration from the summation of evaporation and transpiration shuttleworth and wallace 1985 stannard 1993 gong et al 2019 annual precipitation is an important boundary condition for sw2 and etsw2 is reflecting the temporal patterns of precipitation fig 4 by comparison the annual trend of etsw is reflecting the temporal patterns of rn sw2 considers water balance explicitly in addition to evapotranspiration it also calculates the daily vertical soil water movement using soil physical properties water exits the sw2 soil profile through evapotranspiration and deep drainage appendix s1 of palmquist et al 2018 the sw model estimates evapotranspiration based on energy balance in our simulations almost all of the precipitation was accounted for by evapotranspiration table 3 and fig 4 this is reasonable for many semiarid and arid ecosystems in which et precipitation however in our degraded meadow this most likely is not the case in the winter because the environment is extremely cold daily minimum winter air temperature was 19 5 during the study period the soil is frozen and the study site experienced a water stress period in the summer months the soil thaws and precipitation on many days exceeds pet data not shown when water inputs exceed both the atmospheric demand and the storage capacity of the soil water percolates through the soil layers and can be lost as deep drainage our results indicated that etsw was higher than etsw2 in winter months while in summer months they were almost equal figs 1 and 5 because there was not enough water for evaporation in cold season we suggest that the sw model overestimated evapotranspiration in winter months this is possibly caused by the equation we used to calculate the soil surface resistance rss we used a single parameter soil water content to calculate rss because soil water will remain frozen during the winter months soil water content will remain low and almost constant this may lead to inaccuracy in rss calculation similar to our research some other studies chen et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 also pointed out that rss is an important input argument of the sw model which needs to be paid more attention both models have been successfully applied to many ecosystems globally such as the sw2 model in grassland and shrubsteppe ecosystems lauenroth and bradford 2006 lauenroth and bradford 2012 schlaepfer et al 2017 palmquist et al 2018 renne et al 2019 bradford et al 2020 and the sw model in cropland ecosystems ortega farias et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 wei et al 2018 chen et al 2020 and alpine ecosystems hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 however hu et al 2009 and chen et al 2020 reported that the sw model overestimated evapotranspiration when compared with measured data zhang et al 2008 compared the sw model and a soil water balance method they included observed precipitation irrigation and change in storage of soil water then calculated et by the water balance equation and indicated that evapotranspiration estimated by the sw model was about 20 higher than that calculated by their water balance this is very similar to our estimate of the average percentage of water lost to deep drainage from our sites comparison between the two models and statistical analysis revealed that evaporation and transpiration estimated by the sw model and that simulated by the sw2 model have significant differences p 0 01 in annual amounts and proportions tables 2 and 3 figs 1 and 5 appendix 3 in supplementary materials compared with esw2 esw was higher in cold season but lower in warm season fig 1 tsw was higher than tsw2 figs 1 and 5 frozen soil and few precipitation events in winter suggest that esw2 is probably a better estimate than esw the sw2 model may have resulted in a better estimate of transpiration than the sw model previous studies have revealed that leaf area index lai and biomass are important factors controlling transpiration garcía leoz et al 2018 hu et al 2018 according to our measured data the lai of this degraded meadow was very low even in the peak growing season lower than 1 0 m2 m 2 therefore the sw2 model may provide a better simulation fig 1 overall compared with the sw2 the sw model overestimates evaporation in the non growing season november to april in next year and overestimates transpiration in the growing season may to september fig 1 sw also estimates higher t et and et p at both monthly and annual time scales tables 2 and 3 fig 5 that is because the sw model is not constrained by the daily amounts of precipitation it assumes that all of the water received by the vegetation is available to be lost by evapotranspiration and only constrained by available energy and soil and canopy resistances by contrast sw2 is constrained by soil water and available energy many previous studies have shown that the sw model has this overestimation and underestimation problem hu et al 2009 found that the sw model overestimated evapotranspiration by 8 15 and zhao et al 2015 reported that there were estimation errors of soil evaporation and overestimation of transpiration in the sw model gong et al 2019 reported in their study the sw model overestimated and underestimated evapotranspiration at different stages and wei et al 2019 indicated that the sw model overestimated half hourly evapotranspiration compared to measured data 4 2 model sensitivity our sensitivity analysis revealed that for the sw2 model relative humidity and sky cover were most influential for etsw2 esw2 and tsw2 in the case of the sw model etsw esw and tsw were all most sensitive to rn and swc this is not surprising because relative humidity sky cover and rn are environmental variables that influence pet and swc is the only input variable we used in the sw model to calculate the soil surface resistance rss which is a key variable hu et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 chen et al 2020 it is worth noting that in both models evaporation and transpiration were more sensitive individually to lai than was evapotranspiration figs 2 and 3 indicating that even when they agree about estimates of evapotranspiration the simulated estimates of evaporation and transpiration may not be accurate this is clearest for the sw model because the sw model divides evapotranspiration into its two parts evaporation and transpiration when the evapotranspiration is confirmed by pet and one of the components increases the other must decrease this is clear in the sensitivity analysis fig 3 rn affects evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration to the same extent for other variables it either has an opposite effect on evaporation and transpiration thus having a small impact on evapotranspiration or directly has a small impact on evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration in the sw2 model evaporation includes three components bare soil evaporation eb snow loss and surface evaporation es lauenroth and bradford 2006 palmquist et al 2018 therefore esw2 and tsw2 are not a simple trade off relationship as they are in the sw model our research is the first time that a sensitivity analysis of e and t in the sw2 model has been published but there have been several studies that have conducted sensitivity analysis on the sw model and found similar results to ours that indicated that e and t in the sw model are sensitive to soil surface resistance and lai ortega farias et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 wei et al 2018 our sensitivity analysis confirmed that relative humidity sky cover and lai are the most important parameters for the sw2 model while rn swc and lai are the most important for the sw method that means when we apply these two models to calculate precipitation or evapotranspiration partitioning these five key parameters should be observed as accurately as possible errors in estimating these parameters will result in inaccuracy of model outputs especially rn for the sw model a variation in rn will cause the same degree of variation in the output of the sw model 4 3 ecohydrology of the study site the two models implied different ecohydrology of our study site based on the sw model almost all of the precipitation was lost by et during the study period that means there was on average little water left to percolate deeply into the soil beyond plant root systems and contribute to groundwater storage or lakes and rivers however results of the sw2 model suggest that on average 21 of the precipitation penetrated beyond plant roots and was lost via deep drainage these waters can recharge the groundwater and then recharge adjacent lakes or rivers considering that our study site is located in the three river source region trsr from where a considerable amount of the water volume of major rivers in china originates xu et al 2018 it is not surprising that water balance indicated water inputs in excess of atmospheric losses many studies that have focused on the hydrology and water balance of the entire trsr have pointed out that contributions to groundwater and or runoff are important items of water balance in this region xu et al 2016 du et al 2017 qin et al 2017 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2016 reported that water storage in the trsr had significantly increased during 2003 2010 and du et al 2017 reported that runoff appears to have increased in this region qin et al 2017 reported that runoff occurs most often during the growing season and accounted for 32 of the precipitation xu et al 2018 reported that since the aquiclude changed more soil water has percolated into groundwater sw2 does not estimate runoff instead the water that may have contributed to runoff from our site is represented by deep drainage overall from the perspective of the ecohydrology of our degraded meadow the results of the sw2 model seem more reasonable than those of the sw model 5 conclusion our study is the first time that a comparison between the soilwat2 sw2 and the shuttleworth wallace sw models have been made and we found the results of the sw2 model which based on water balance principle to be most consistent with conditions at our degraded meadow on the trsr compared with the sw2 model the sw model both overestimated and underestimated evaporation and overestimated transpiration the sw model also overestimated annual et since our study site is located in a water source region there must be a surplus of water to flow into groundwater and lakes and rivers therefore although the sw model had a better agreement with observed data from eddy covariance system than the sw2 we suggest sw2 better represents the ecohydrological context of the trsr sensitivity analysis indicated that relative humidity and sky cover were the most influential factors for the sw2 model while for the sw model the most sensitive factors are net radiation and soil water content credit authorship contribution statement lifeng zhang software validation formal

8085,study region three river source region qinghai tibetan plateau china study focus evapotranspiration et is often the largest loss of water from grassland ecosystems and consists of two constituents evaporation e and transpiration t but it is very difficult to separate e and t in this study we used an energy balance model shuttleworth wallace and a water balance model soilwat2 to estimate the water budget variables over a 10 year period 2007 2016 in a degraded alpine meadow in the three river source region on the qinghai tibetan plateau new hydrological insights for the region the models produced contrasting patterns of precipitation and et partitioning at the study site precipitation partitioning by sw2 resulted in substantial fluxes of both et and deep drainage while et estimated by sw consumed almost all precipitation et was partitioned by the models into different annual e and t fluxes as well as different monthly and annual t et our study site located in an important water source region suggests that its water balance would contribute to drainage which aligns better with sw2 results the surprising discrepancies between the models in the partitioning of precipitation into t e and deep drainage however is limiting our understanding and management of the degraded site and will require future work to reconcile keywords the soilwat2 model the shuttleworth wallace model water balance energy balance degraded meadow 1 introduction the three river source region trsr located in the central part of the qinghai tibetan plateau is the headwaters of three great rivers of asia the yangtze the yellow and the mekong rivers it is often called the water tower of asia since the major rivers in china originate from the trsr and its altitude is more than 4000 m guo et al 2016 qu et al 2018 xu et al 2018 the trsr encompasses a surface area of approximately 3 95 105 km2 of which more than two third of this region is covered by alpine meadow zhang et al 2019 however the degraded meadow area has been expanding under the combined effects of climate change e g rapid temperature rise and human disturbance such as overgrazing zhou et al 2005 wang et al 2017 in recent years the moderately degraded grassland area has accounted for about 58 of the total usable grassland liu et al 2008 meadow degradation can lead to not only a significant decline in ecosystem productivity but also to changes in both water and energy budgets however there is a lack of long term quantitative research on the water budget in this region especially how precipitation is partitioned into soil evaporation e vegetation transpiration t and deep drainage d therefore it is important that we clarify the contributions of e t and d to the water budget in degraded meadows and provide a basis for understanding the water resource dynamics in the trsr the terrestrial ecosystem water balance is controlled and explained by the partitioning of incoming precipitation p into evapotranspiration et runoff ro soil water storage δs and deep drainage d lauenroth and bradford 2006 thus the annual water balance can be written as follows 1 1 p et ro s d ro is small and is often assumed to be negligible for a relatively flat terrain and δs 0 on a multi year scale lauenroth and bradford 2006 these assumptions reduce eq 1 1 to 1 2 p et d eq 1 2 suggests that annual precipitation is returned to the atmosphere as et or lost from the soil as deep drainage between these two processes et is the main component of water loss from most grassland ecosystems to the atmosphere lauenroth and bradford 2006 wang and dickinson 2012 based on the energy balance of the terrestrial ecosystem net radiation rn can be partitioned into soil g sensible h and latent λe heat fluxes stannard 1993 zhang et al 2019 1 3 r n g h λ e λe is the energy consumed by et which makes it possible to estimate et from knowledge of the remaining terms in equation 3 et is divided into evaporation e and transpiration t and changes in e and t have important consequences for ecological biogeochemical and hydrological processes over numerous temporal and spatial scales hu et al 2009

by modeling lauenroth and bradford 2006 hu et al 2009 bradford et al 2014a and 2014b chen et al 2020 or both the advantage of modeling is that it can address ecosystem processes over a range of temporal scales we choose two widely used models soilwat2 sw2 and shuttleworth wallace sw to explore whether the results of models developed based on different principles are different the sw2 ecosystem water balance model simulates interception and subsequent evaporation from vegetation and litter snow dynamics sublimation and wind redistribution infiltration into the soil percolation through soil layers hydraulic redistribution bare soil evaporation transpiration from each soil layer and deep drainage sw2 is open source and available as an r package schlaepfer and murphy 2018 sw2 has been used and validated in a range of dryland ecosystems globally including dry grasslands big sagebrush ecosystems palmquist et al 2018 croplands bradford et al 2017 and low elevation forests bradford et al 2014a and 2014b unlike the sw2 model the sw model does not calculate water balance but estimates et from energy balance calculations e and t are weighted coefficients using a combination of soil and canopy resistances shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the sw model makes it possible to partition et into e and t using surface resistances to represent energy transfer from plants rsc and soil rss and aerodynamic resistances raa rac ras to control the transfer from these surfaces to the atmosphere zhao et al 2015 the sw model is well established and has been widely used to estimate et from grassland hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 and cropland ecosystems wei et al 2018 chen et al 2020 we compared precipitation and et partitioning for a degraded meadow in the trsr using soilwat2 an ecosystem water balance simulation model and the shuttleworth wallace energy balance approach our analyses focused on answering the following three questions 1 do the two approaches water balance and energy balance produce similar estimates of the partitioning of precipitation and et if not what accounts for the differences 2 to which input variables are the soilwat2 and shuttleworth wallace models most sensitive and 3 which models results best represent the ecohydrological context of the trsr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study site is located in a degraded meadow 34 24 n 100 24 e 3963 m a s l in maqin county qinghai province china mean annual precipitation is 514 mm with greater than 80 falling in the growing season from may to september while the mean annual temperature is 0 5 li et al 2014 he et al 2018 and the warmest is july 10 in this degraded meadow the ground cover is dominated by forbs such as aconitum pendulum ligularia virgaurea pedicularis kansuensis oxytropis ochrantha ajania tenuifolia polygonum sibiricum euphorbia fischeriana and morina chinensis the average vegetation height is less than 5 cm and maximum canopy cover is approximately 55 the soil is classified as humic cambisol iuss working group wrb 2014 2 2 modelling we used the soilwat2 sw2 and the shuttleworth wallace sw models to calculate et partitioning and water balance from 2007 to 2016 and applied observed data from an eddy covariance system to make a comparison appendix 1 of supplementary materials the weather data were either directly obtained from maqin meteorological station or calculated from the directly obtained data 34 28 n 100 15 e 3720 m a s l national meteorological data center http data cma cn we used a leaf area meter li 3100 li cor to observe leaf area index lai about once a month during the growing season in 2007 live leaves were cut from 5 randomly selected quadrats with an area of 6 25 10 2 m2 and the mean lai for the 5 quadrats was used in this study lai gaps were linearly interpolated to daily intervals using the same approach as li et al 2006 2 2 1 the soilwat2 model we used the soilwat2 sw2 model v3 4 0 details available in github repositories schlaepfer and murphy 2018 sw2 uses multiple soil layers and several vegetation types to simulate the daily water balance in dryland ecosystems palmquist et al 2018 bradford et al 2020 daily weather soil properties of each soil layer and vegetation are the main inputs required to run sw2 precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperatures are used as daily inputs atmospheric demand is determined additionally as a function of geographic and topographic location as well as albedo and mean monthly relative humidity wind speed and cloud cover sw2 represents each vegetation type with a profile of root water uptake capacity as well as monthly biomass values of litter aboveground and leaf components since there is a lot of bare soil in the degraded meadow and maximum canopy cover is approximately 55 we divided the degraded meadow into vegetation patches and soil patches for our simulations the vegetation patches account for 55 of the whole degraded meadow and the soil patches account for 45 we represented the soils at the two study sites with texture gravel content and bulk density of each of eight soil layers at depths of 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 cm sw2 simulations of the daily water balance include interception by and evaporation from the plant canopy and litter layer infiltration into the soil percolation hydraulic redistribution deep drainage i e percolation at the lower simulated soil boundary evaporation and root water extraction for transpiration from each layer sw2 estimates daily evapotranspiration as the sum of bare soil evaporation evaporation of surface water e g water intercepted by vegetation sublimation from a snowpack and transpiration each process is calculated by considering potential evapotranspiration pet as a maximum daily rate which is limited by scaling factors such as snow cover leaf area water use efficiency shading by vegetation and soil moisture 2 2 2 the shuttleworth

and sw models to the uncertainties of input parameters the percentage variation in the estimated et e and t were calculated in this study values of input parameters were varied by 5 10 20 respectively then variation rate vr of estimated et e and t were calculated by 14 vr i v i n i n 100 where iv is the value of et e and t estimated from varied input parameters and in is the value of et e and t estimated from normal input parameters for each model we chose 10 input parameters to vary ideally we would select the same parameters however the input parameters of the two models are not exactly the same finally we chose precipitation air temperature wind speed sky cover relative humidity gravel content proportion of sand proportion of clay biomass and leaf area index for sw2 and soil water

radiation for sw 3 results 3 1 precipitation partitioning precipitation is the only source of water input for our two study sites and annual precipitation ranged from 463 to 629 mm during our 10 year study period with a mean of 530 mm and a coefficient of variation cv of 12 table 1 for sw2 almost all of the precipitation was lost to the combination of evapotranspiration etsw2 and deep drainage in the degraded meadow etsw2 plus deep drainage accounted for 95 105 of annual precipitation with a mean of 99 table 2 etsw2 accounted for the largest part of water loss the annual ratio of etsw2 to precipitation ranged from 71 to 86 with a mean of 78 table 2 for the sw model the percentage of annual precipitation that was lost by etsw ranged from 76 to 114 with a mean of 98 for the degraded meadow table 3 the majority of precipitation was accounted for by etsw 3 2 evapotranspiration partitioning evapotranspiration estimated by the sw2 etsw2 and sw etsw models had similar seasonal variation with lowest values in non growing season october april and highest values during growing season may september fig 1 etsw2 and etsw both started to increase in march and reached their maxima during the summer then decreased to minima in december and or january although etsw2 and etsw had similar seasonal trends compared with etsw2 etsw had more day to day variability fig 1 the amounts of etsw2 ranged from 359 to 449 mm with a mean of 411 mm while the amounts of etsw were larger than that of etsw2 the minimum maximum and mean for etsw were 427 599 and 516 mm respectively 3 3 differences in evapotranspiration partitioning both the sw2 and sw models partitioned evapotranspiration into its two important components evaporation and transpiration the sw2 model estimates evaporation esw2 in three components bare soil evaporation eb snow loss and surface evaporation es for the degraded meadow evaporation and transpiration modeled by sw2 esw2 and tsw2 and sw esw and tsw had similar seasonal variation fig 1 for esw2 and esw they both had two peaks in each year which was most pronounced for esw fig 1 the first peak of esw2 occurred in april may and the second in september october while for esw the first peak was in april may and the second in october november tsw2 and tsw both began to increase in march april and reached peak values in july august then decreased to 0 in november december fig 1 esw and tsw was more variable day to day than esw2 and tsw2 the annual amounts of esw and tsw were larger than esw2 and tsw2 tables 2 and 3 the means of esw2 and tsw2 were 299 and 112 mm while the means for esw and tsw were 350 and 166 mm although sw2 and sw had differences in their partitioning of evapotranspiration into e and t they estimated similar values of proportions tables 2 and 3 for sw2 the mean annual ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration t et was 27 while for the sw model the mean ratio was 32 3 4 sensitivity analysis of the two models the sensitivities of modeled evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration to input parameters were different between the models in the case of sw2 relative humidity and sky cover were the most influential in changing etsw2 esw2 and tsw2 fig 2 for example varying relative humidity by 5 20 introduced an average deviation ranging from 2 to 10 in etsw2 from 1 to 7 in esw2 and from 3 to 13 in tsw2 tables a1 in appendix 2 of supplementary materials besides relative humidity and sky cover esw2 and tsw2 were also sensitive to precipitation air temperature ta and leaf area index lai for sw the most influential factors affecting etsw esw and tsw were net radiation rn soil water content swc and ta fig 3 for example varying rn by 5 20 introduced an average deviation ranging from 5 20 in etsw esw and tsw tables a2 in appendix 2 of supplementary materials evapotranspiration partitioning of sw was also sensitive to lai and wind speed but these two factors did not have much impact on etsw 4 discussion the water balance and et partitioning calculated based on soilwat2 sw2 and derived from the shuttleworth wallace sw model had some important differences the explicit water balance approach sw2 partitioned precipitation into two components et and deep drainage this contrasts with the energy balance approach of the sw model which estimated that et consumed all precipitation during the study period the differences in total water loss were not reflected in proportions of et represented by e and t here the estimates were nearly identical 4 1 what caused the difference in the results of the two models because we used same weather data for both models the annual amount of et should have been similar but our results showed that etsw was significantly higher than etsw2 p 0 01 tables 2 and 3 figs 1 and 5 appendix 3 in supplementary materials the difference between sw2 and sw derives from their different fundamental assumptions sw2 is based on water balance and it calculates the various components evaporation transpiration deep drainage etc using input variables and process based relationships lauenroth and bradford 2006 palmquist et al 2018 bradford et al 2020 sw is governed by energy balance and estimates evapotranspiration from the summation of evaporation and transpiration shuttleworth and wallace 1985 stannard 1993 gong et al 2019 annual precipitation is an important boundary condition for sw2 and etsw2 is reflecting the temporal patterns of precipitation fig 4 by comparison the annual trend of etsw is reflecting the temporal patterns of rn sw2 considers water balance explicitly in addition to evapotranspiration it also calculates the daily vertical soil water movement using soil physical properties water exits the sw2 soil profile through evapotranspiration and deep drainage appendix s1 of palmquist et al 2018 the sw model estimates evapotranspiration based on energy balance in our simulations almost all of the precipitation was accounted for by evapotranspiration table 3 and fig 4 this is reasonable for many semiarid and arid ecosystems in which et precipitation however in our degraded meadow this most likely is not the case in the winter because the environment is extremely cold daily minimum winter air temperature was 19 5 during the study period the soil is frozen and the study site experienced a water stress period in the summer months the soil thaws and precipitation on many days exceeds pet data not shown when water inputs exceed both the atmospheric demand and the storage capacity of the soil water percolates through the soil layers and can be lost as deep drainage our results indicated that etsw was higher than etsw2 in winter months while in summer months they were almost equal figs 1 and 5 because there was not enough water for evaporation in cold season we suggest that the sw model overestimated evapotranspiration in winter months this is possibly caused by the equation we used to calculate the soil surface resistance rss we used a single parameter soil water content to calculate rss because soil water will remain frozen during the winter months soil water content will remain low and almost constant this may lead to inaccuracy in rss calculation similar to our research some other studies chen et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 also pointed out that rss is an important input argument of the sw model which needs to be paid more attention both models have been successfully applied to many ecosystems globally such as the sw2 model in grassland and shrubsteppe ecosystems lauenroth and bradford 2006 lauenroth and bradford 2012 schlaepfer et al 2017 palmquist et al 2018 renne et al 2019 bradford et al 2020 and the sw model in cropland ecosystems ortega farias et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 wei et al 2018 chen et al 2020 and alpine ecosystems hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 however hu et al 2009 and chen et al 2020 reported that the sw model overestimated evapotranspiration when compared with measured data zhang et al 2008 compared the sw model and a soil water balance method they included observed precipitation irrigation and change in storage of soil water then calculated et by the water balance equation and indicated that evapotranspiration estimated by the sw model was about 20 higher than that calculated by their water balance this is very similar to our estimate of the average percentage of water lost to deep drainage from our sites comparison between the two models and statistical analysis revealed that evaporation and transpiration estimated by the sw model and that simulated by the sw2 model have significant differences p 0 01 in annual amounts and proportions tables 2 and 3 figs 1 and 5 appendix 3 in supplementary materials compared with esw2 esw was higher in cold season but lower in warm season fig 1 tsw was higher than tsw2 figs 1 and 5 frozen soil and few precipitation events in winter suggest that esw2 is probably a better estimate than esw the sw2 model may have resulted in a better estimate of transpiration than the sw model previous studies have revealed that leaf area index lai and biomass are important factors controlling transpiration garcía leoz et al 2018 hu et al 2018 according to our measured data the lai of this degraded meadow was very low even in the peak growing season lower than 1 0 m2 m 2 therefore the sw2 model may provide a better simulation fig 1 overall compared with the sw2 the sw model overestimates evaporation in the non growing season november to april in next year and overestimates transpiration in the growing season may to september fig 1 sw also estimates higher t et and et p at both monthly and annual time scales tables 2 and 3 fig 5 that is because the sw model is not constrained by the daily amounts of precipitation it assumes that all of the water received by the vegetation is available to be lost by evapotranspiration and only constrained by available energy and soil and canopy resistances by contrast sw2 is constrained by soil water and available energy many previous studies have shown that the sw model has this overestimation and underestimation problem hu et al 2009 found that the sw model overestimated evapotranspiration by 8 15 and zhao et al 2015 reported that there were estimation errors of soil evaporation and overestimation of transpiration in the sw model gong et al 2019 reported in their study the sw model overestimated and underestimated evapotranspiration at different stages and wei et al 2019 indicated that the sw model overestimated half hourly evapotranspiration compared to measured data 4 2 model sensitivity our sensitivity analysis revealed that for the sw2 model relative humidity and sky cover were most influential for etsw2 esw2 and tsw2 in the case of the sw model etsw esw and tsw were all most sensitive to rn and swc this is not surprising because relative humidity sky cover and rn are environmental variables that influence pet and swc is the only input variable we used in the sw model to calculate the soil surface resistance rss which is a key variable hu et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 chen et al 2020 it is worth noting that in both models evaporation and transpiration were more sensitive individually to lai than was evapotranspiration figs 2 and 3 indicating that even when they agree about estimates of evapotranspiration the simulated estimates of evaporation and transpiration may not be accurate this is clearest for the sw model because the sw model divides evapotranspiration into its two parts evaporation and transpiration when the evapotranspiration is confirmed by pet and one of the components increases the other must decrease this is clear in the sensitivity analysis fig 3 rn affects evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration to the same extent for other variables it either has an opposite effect on evaporation and transpiration thus having a small impact on evapotranspiration or directly has a small impact on evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration in the sw2 model evaporation includes three components bare soil evaporation eb snow loss and surface evaporation es lauenroth and bradford 2006 palmquist et al 2018 therefore esw2 and tsw2 are not a simple trade off relationship as they are in the sw model our research is the first time that a sensitivity analysis of e and t in the sw2 model has been published but there have been several studies that have conducted sensitivity analysis on the sw model and found similar results to ours that indicated that e and t in the sw model are sensitive to soil surface resistance and lai ortega farias et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 wei et al 2018 our sensitivity analysis confirmed that relative humidity sky cover and lai are the most important parameters for the sw2 model while rn swc and lai are the most important for the sw method that means when we apply these two models to calculate precipitation or evapotranspiration partitioning these five key parameters should be observed as accurately as possible errors in estimating these parameters will result in inaccuracy of model outputs especially rn for the sw model a variation in rn will cause the same degree of variation in the output of the sw model 4 3 ecohydrology of the study site the two models implied different ecohydrology of our study site based on the sw model almost all of the precipitation was lost by et during the study period that means there was on average little water left to percolate deeply into the soil beyond plant root systems and contribute to groundwater storage or lakes and rivers however results of the sw2 model suggest that on average 21 of the precipitation penetrated beyond plant roots and was lost via deep drainage these waters can recharge the groundwater and then recharge adjacent lakes or rivers considering that our study site is located in the three river source region trsr from where a considerable amount of the water volume of major rivers in china originates xu et al 2018 it is not surprising that water balance indicated water inputs in excess of atmospheric losses many studies that have focused on the hydrology and water balance of the entire trsr have pointed out that contributions to groundwater and or runoff are important items of water balance in this region xu et al 2016 du et al 2017 qin et al 2017 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2016 reported that water storage in the trsr had significantly increased during 2003 2010 and du et al 2017 reported that runoff appears to have increased in this region qin et al 2017 reported that runoff occurs most often during the growing season and accounted for 32 of the precipitation xu et al 2018 reported that since the aquiclude changed more soil water has percolated into groundwater sw2 does not estimate runoff instead the water that may have contributed to runoff from our site is represented by deep drainage overall from the perspective of the ecohydrology of our degraded meadow the results of the sw2 model seem more reasonable than those of the sw model 5 conclusion our study is the first time that a comparison between the soilwat2 sw2 and the shuttleworth wallace sw models have been made and we found the results of the sw2 model which based on water balance principle to be most consistent with conditions at our degraded meadow on the trsr compared with the sw2 model the sw model both overestimated and underestimated evaporation and overestimated transpiration the sw model also overestimated annual et since our study site is located in a water source region there must be a surplus of water to flow into groundwater and lakes and rivers therefore although the sw model had a better agreement with observed data from eddy covariance system than the sw2 we suggest sw2 better represents the ecohydrological context of the trsr sensitivity analysis indicated that relative humidity and sky cover were the most influential factors for the sw2 model while for the sw model the most sensitive factors are net radiation and soil water content credit authorship contribution statement lifeng zhang software validation formal

8086,study region the sirikit dam in the nan river basin is located on a main tributary of the chao phraya river in thailand study focus this study investigates forecasting river flows and real time optimization of dam release using a distributed hydrological model with ensemble weather forecasting for reservoir operations which provide hydropower and irrigation facilities in thailand during a case study of the 2019 drought event medium range ensemble precipitation forecasts were employed using a hydrological model to predict the real time reservoir inflow real time optimization of the water release strategy determined a week in advance with an effective initial condition for hydropower generation and irrigation was conducted with different scenarios using dynamic programming considering inflow predictions new hydrological insights for the region the medium range ensemble precipitation forecast conducted by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts was used to quantify precipitation for the study basin the ensemble precipitation forecast with the hydrological model was employed for inflow prediction of the study basin which was located in a tropical climate with a distinct wet and dry season the initial conditions of the hydrological model largely influenced the real time inflow forecast to determine the initial conditions of the model the empirical data assimilation considering a drainage area factor was utilized and observed precipitation data were used for model input forcing data during the initial analysis period this method improved the reservoir inflow prediction and real time reservoir optimization using dynamic programming with considering ensemble forecasts provided more efficient operating decisions than employing historical data the resulting information will be useful for water resource management which may be adapted to other basins in the study region keywords ensemble inflow forecasting data assimilation distributed hydrologic model reservoir optimization dynamic programing thailand 1 introduction the sirikit dam is one of the two large reservoirs in the chao phraya river basin cprb that is the largest 158 000 km2 and most important in thailand the sirikit reservoir containing 9510 million m3 of the total storage volume has a significant role in effectively managing the water resources of the basin however the dam is located in a tropical climate with significant seasonal differences and uncertainty regarding the basin s hydrological condition influenced by both the indian and pacific oceans nguyen et al 2020 in turn these conditions cause both floods and droughts sayama et al 2015 like the 2011 flood event and the 2015 and 2019 drought events which proved to be very challenging for reservoir operators these uncertainties regarding the basin s hydrological condition have a primary effect on reservoir operation increasing the risk of water disaster tingsanchali and boonyasirikul 2006 in addition climate change complicates future water resource management in cprb because of increasing extreme weather fluctuations kotsuki et al 2014 wichakul et al 2015 incorporating weather forecast may improve the efficiency of decision making hamlet et al 2002 lettenmaier and wood 1993 zhu et al 2002 however the forecast has limitations in accuracy forecast uncertainty with increasing forecast lead time the optimum solution to capture and reduce this forecast error uncertainty is to use an ensemble forecast rather than a single deterministic forecast because the ensemble forecast produces a set of randomly equally likely independent solutions for the future zhu 2005 in recent decades ensemble forecast techniques have been rapidly developed ensemble forecast techniques are now generally accepted as a reliable approach for estimating forecast confidence especially for high impact weather bougeault et al 2010 based on these advantages several studies have been conducted using ensemble forecast data such as storm track prediction lin et al 2020 nishimura and yamaguchi 2015 weber 2003 reservoir inflow prediction fan et al 2015 river flow prediction and flood forecasting alfieri et al 2012 bao et al 2011 he et al 2010 sayama et al 2020 combining with using ensemble forecast information in a reservoir operation study the dynamic programming dp is a well known method to construct a mathematical model for decision support alemu et al 2011 a number of studies have been conducted regarding ensemble streamflow predictions esp with dp to improve reservoir operation efficiency faber and stedinger 2001 demonstrated that using esp forecasts in a real time dp reservoir system optimization model provides more efficient operating decisions than employing historical time series kim et al 2007 reported that updating operation policy using esp forecasts with dp is appropriate for the geum river multi reservoir system in korea in addition operational ensemble hydrometeorological predictions have been used with a hydrological model to predict a reservoir inflow and adapted it to real time reservoir optimization using dp for water use in a drought event nohara and hori 2018 the study reported that this approach generally mitigates drought damage compared with considering historical flow time series although these studies indicated that association of ensemble forecast information with dp for reservoir optimization can improve the operation efficiency information regarding the methods for performing reservoir inflow forecasts using ensemble hydrometeorological predictions with hydrological model reservoir inflow prediction approach such as real time state update produce is scarce this procedure becomes more important for a reservoir located in a tropical climate basin with distinct wet and dry hydrological conditions such as the cprb recently the cprb frequently faces drought conditions since 2011 massive flooding occurred in the basin the accumulated annual inflow of two major dams bhumibol and sirikit during 2012 2019 is 17 1 lower than the historical 30 year average which means 6 in 8 years of annual inflow are lower than the historical mean especially the severe drought in 2015 and 2019 the accumulated annual inflow of two dams is 48 5 and 40 0 lower than the historical mean respectively regarding the downstream water requirement this resulted in a low storage volume of the reservoirs as a result of the imbalance between inflows and outflows the events resulted in difficulties in water management for the coming years as a result of insufficient reservoir water storage in thailand the drought problem over the long term develops into a primary social and economic issue zenkoji et al 2019 therefore this study aims to introduce the forecast information for water resources management to mitigate the impact of drought the main objectives are as follows 1 to investigate the ability of river flows forecasting using a distributed hydrological model with ensemble precipitation forecasts epf and 2 to utilize the river flow prediction for real time reservoir optimization using dp to mitigate the drought event for a case study in 2019 for this purpose a physically based distributed hydrological model is adopted an adaptive mode of operation state variable update with different update procedures to assess the effect of the model s initial state condition is also utilized on the results of river flow forecasts medium range epfs are used to determine the reservoir inflow 2 weeks in advance of reservoir inflow forecast then the optimization of reservoir release is examined in different scenarios of optimization using the 2 week inflow forecasts in section 2 a case study of the difficulties for reservoir operation of the sirikit dam during the drought event in 2019 has been proposed in section 3 the hydrological model is calibrated and validated in offline mode prior to its application and its use for forecasting in section 4 the methodology of implementing the real time inflow forecast using ensemble precipitation forecasts is described and the effect of the model s initial conditions with different model state update procedures on the inflow forecast results is evaluated in section 5 real time reservoir optimization for 1 week advanced release strategy using forecast inflows is examined with different scenarios regarding future long term inflow assumptions in section 6 the advantages of introducing ensemble hydrometeorological forecasts are demonstrated for real time optimization of sirikit reservoir operation during 2019 2 current dam operation at the sirikit dam the sirikit dam contains 6660 million m3 of effective storage and 500 mw of power generation capacity located on the nan river one of the four main tributaries of the chao phraya river the dam controls 13 130 km2 of drainage area the main functions of the dam include irrigation purposes domestic and industrial use flood control ecological conservation and power generation amnatsan et al 2018 the location of the study basin is shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows the operation records of the sirikit reservoir during 2019 compared to the 30 years historical data in the percentile of each 7 days unit fig 2a and b show the comparison of accumulated reservoir inflow and release respectively fig 2c show the comparison of reservoir storage between 2019 and historical data due to unpredicted inflow reservoir operation faces significant challenges in controlling water for society the reservoir storage level was higher than the lower rule curve lrc at the beginning of the year see fig 2c whereas the released volume is relatively high close to the 75th percentile because of the downstream demand and power supply requirement during the dry season as shown in fig 2b however the low inflow volume from the beginning to the middle of the wet season was unexpected compared to the 30 years historical data the reservoir inflow volume is low lower than the 25th percentile as shown in fig 2a this event presented difficulties for reservoir operation and resulted in a low storage level lower than lrc after mid august and led to a low level of reservoir storage at the end of the year significantly less than the lrc as shown in fig 2c for effective basin water management reservoir operation requires forecasting information the dam reservoir water level in 2019 is historically low and to investigate the precipitation forecast to reduce the drought disaster is an urgent issue therefore we selected this period as a case study to evaluate the performance of release strategy estimation forecasting 1 week in advance using medium range weather forecast information and the reservoir optimization process 3 reservoir inflow prediction model the 1k dhm is a distributed hydrological model based on kinematic wave flow approximation that considers surface subsurface flow the elevation and flow direction are determined using topographical data provided by hydrosheds lehner et al 2006 in digital elevation models with a resolution of 30 s approximately 1 km each cell of the hydrological process consists of river and slope flow components tanaka and tachikawa 2015 meema and tachikawa 2020 incorporated unconfined bedrock aquifers into the slope flow component of the original model to improve the long term river flow simulation in a tropical climate basin and this improved model was used as an inflow the continuity and momentum equations for the surface soil layer are as follows 1 h s t q s x r e p u 2 q s h s d m k m h s d m β i 0 h s d m d m k m i h s d m k a i d m h s d a d m k m i h s d m k a i i n s h s d a m d a h s where q s is the runoff per unit slope width h s is the water depth r is the rainfall intensity e is the evapotranspiration p u is the vertical infiltration rate from the surface soil layer into the bedrock aquifer d m is the maximum water content in the capillary pore k m is the hydraulic conductivity when the capillary pore is saturated β is an exponent parameter that describes the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and water content d a is the maximum water content in the effective porosity k a is the saturated hydraulic conductivity n s is the manning s roughness coefficient for surface flow i is the slope gradient and m 5 3 the continuity and momentum equations for bedrock aquifer layer are as follows 3 h u t q u x p u 4 q u h u α u h u 2 where d u is the total effective depth of rock fracture in the unconfined bedrock aquifer h u is the total water depth in the fracture of the aquifer and α u k u i d u where k u is the hydraulic conductivity that corresponds to the actual cross sectional area of flow in the rock fracture and i is the gradient of the hillslope the discharge from the slope flow component on both sides of the river channel contributes to the river channel component as the lateral discharge per unit length the discharge from the upper cells is assigned to the river channel component of the cell as the boundary condition the river flow of the river channel component is computed by the following 1d kinematic wave equations 5 q α a m 6 a t q x 2 q s q u where q is the river discharge a is the cross sectional area m 5 3 and α i nb 2 3 in which the river channel b is assumed to be a wide rectangle and vary each grid based on the grid drainage area determined by b a a grid b where a grid is grid drainage area a and b are constant parameters the model was calibrated and validated before applying it to the inflow forecast to apply the model for long term forecasting the calibration periods was set to contain the seasonal hydrological characteristics of the basin wet and dry seasons the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1994 was applied to optimize the model parameters by searching for the parameter with the smallest root mean square error rmse when compared with observations designing the range of the parameters is important to identify the parameter set the model calibration method was described by meema and tachikawa 2020 to determine the parameter of the total effective depth of rock fracture d u for the study basin the hydrogeological map of the study basin was used and resulted in most of the area is shale considering the porosity of 0 0 0 1 freeze and cherry 1979 the total storage of bedrock aquifer may be ranged from 0 0 to 3 0 m the inflow of the sirikit reservoir in 2014 which is considered a normal hydrological year was selected as the calibration period the optimized model parameters are listed in table 1 the optimal parameter such as the total effective depth of rock fracture d u agreed with the hydrogeological map which the aquifer productivity is quite small this indicates that the effective depth may be much smaller than the maximum of the designed range the same parameter set was applied to the validation periods in 2008 and 1998 which were considered wet and dry respectively the model performed well in both calibration and validation periods with an rmse less than 63 9 million m3 1 1 relative difference using mean annual inflow and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient greater than 0 82 as shown in the comparison between simulated and observed inflow of the reservoir in fig 3 the model efficiently represents the inflow characteristics of the basin for both the wet and dry seasons for all simulation periods this model with the optimized parameter set was applied to produce real time inflow forecasts for the 2019 sirikit reservoir 4 ensemble inflow prediction using european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf precipitation forecast 4 1 ensemble precipitation forecast used in the study tigge thorpex interactive grand global ensemble is a database of ensemble medium range forecasts conducted by different forecasting centers worldwide for conducting scientific research bougeault et al 2010 ensemble prediction system data are available from approximately ten of these forecasting centers among all data on tigge ecmwf has advantages in a number of forecast members associated with high forecast uncertainty and spatial resolution applicable for the study basin compared to other forecasting systems regarding these advantages it was selected as the epf data for generating reservoir inflow forecasts in this study the ecmwf forecasts consist of 51 members of precipitation with approximately 0 5 resolution for the whole globe initial uncertainties are considered using a singular vector technique a stochastic scheme is used to model uncertainties resulting in possible variations in physical parameterizations buizza et al 2007 the data are available twice a day at 00 00 utc and 12 00 utc with time steps of 6 h and 15 d of forecast lead time 4 2 real time state update of hydrological model the update procedure of the model state variables is based on observed errors in river flow and empirical methods or kalman filtering has been used moore et al 2005 romanowicz et al 2006 using kalman filtering with complex distributed and nonlinear models results in highly complex computations o connell and clarke 1981 a cost effective approach has been developed for computation using an empirical data assimilation procedure and applied to a large scale hydrological model collischonn et al 2005 therefore we adopted this empirical data assimilation procedure to incorporate the large scale distributed hydrological model as explained in section 3 to obtain the initial state of the basin at t0 using observed and ensemble precipitation forecasts as the model input prior to performing reservoir inflow forecasts the updating correction factor fca is calculated at gauge station k using the following equation 7 fca k q obs k q cal k where q obs k and q cal k are the observed and calculated river discharges at gauge station k to evaluate the updating procedure during the initial analysis period different empirical equations were investigated in this study first model states update type 1 the correction factor is directly applied to update the state variables for any cell i located upstream of gauge station k as expressed in eq 8 second model states update type 2 the correction factor is applied to correct the state variables for any cell i located upstream of gauge station k considering a drainage area factor of the upstream grids at each cell as expressed in eq 9 8 s up i k fca k s cal i 9 s up i k fca k s cal i a i a k s cal i 1 a i a k where s up i k are the updated model state variables at cell i located upstream of gauge station k s up i k can be substitute with the variables of the hydrological model such as river discharge q lateral discharge from the surface soil layer q s and the bedrock aquifer layer q u a i and a k are the drainage areas upstream of cell i and gauging station k 4 3 real time reservoir inflow forecast algorithm fig 4 illustrates the procedure of the reservoir inflow forecast using the epf the simulation can be divided into two periods the initial analysis and forecast periods for real time forecasting it is necessary to operate the model in adaptive mode moore et al 2005 for which the model output is based on previous model inputs as well as previously observed information that is used to update the model prior to a new forecast thus this study proposes an initial analysis period to account for uncertainties in the model initial conditions before the forecast period is performed for this purpose data assimilation as explained in section 4 2 is adopted to improve the estimate of the initial states of the model and to reduce the simulation errors in the forecast period madsen and skotner 2005 we not only considered model state variables for the data assimilation implementation but also the errors due to model input to assess the errors due to input data during the initial analysis period two procedures of input precipitation data for the model were considered first a single pattern of observed data was applied to the model second a combination of observed data and ensemble forecasts with 52 patterns one pattern of observation 51 patterns of ensemble forecasts of precipitation was applied to the model fig 4a describes the procedure of using observed precipitation and model state updates up to the starting time of the forecasts t0 then the epfs were applied to the model as forcing input data up to the lead time t 15 for the 15 d reservoir inflow forecasts fig 4b describes the procedure of using a combination of observed and ensemble forecast data and the update procedure of the model states up to the starting time of the forecasts t0 using 52 precipitation patterns during the initial analysis period 52 flow patterns were obtained to select the flow pattern that represents the model states at the starting time of the forecasts t0 the highest nse coefficient computed from the comparison between each simulated flow pattern with the observation during the initial analysis period was selected data assimilation methods used during the initial analysis period to reproduce the initial state of the model at the initial time of the forecast t0 are summarized in table 2 the model state variables were updated in forecast methods 1 and 2 using eq 8 and in forecast methods 3 and 4 using eq 9 a single pattern of observed precipitation was used in forecast methods 1 and 3 fig 4a for forecast methods 2 and 4 52 precipitation patterns were used fig 4b for the forecast period all methods precipitation forecasts were used and the observed precipitation was applied in this study to evaluate the inflow forecast procedures as a possibly perfect forecast of precipitation 5 reservoir optimization with ensemble inflow forecast in sirikit dam 5 1 application of dp for reservoir optimization to interpret the results of the ensemble inflow forecast the general method is to consider the mean value ensemble mean or median which represents the tendency of all ensemble forecast members to optimize the operation strategy of the reservoir using the ensemble mean or median of the ensemble inflow forecast the deterministic dp ddp can be applied nohara and hori 2018 by using ddp in reservoir problems the reservoir storage at time t is divided into decision making stages s t the optimized water release r t at each state is selected based on the minimum value of the sum of the current drought damage b t r t and future drought damage function f t 1 s t 1 the computation is started at the end of the optimization time the final stage and then moved backward to the beginning stage louoks and falkson 1970 the recursive equation for optimization can be defined by the following equation 10 f t s t min h t r t f t 1 s t 1 where t is the time period and h t is the drought damage function of period t and f t 1 s t 1 is the future drought function which represents the minimal drought damage expected after time step t when the storage state is s t at time step t 5 2 implementation with the optimized strategy and scenarios we assume that the simulation for 1 week in advance released strategy performs every sunday the volume of water released from the reservoir follows the simulated strategy throughout the week a total of 52 weeks in 2019 was the target period of this study fig 5 presents the optimization scheme for a target week t release strategy using dp to adopt dp the penalties must be utilized at lower reservoir storage levels after the final time step of optimization this is to ensure that the reservoir will not draw down to low storage levels by releasing excess water to generate quantified benefits during the optimized period for this purpose the sum of future benefits was applied to each storage level after the final time step of the optimization f t 2 as losses or penalties to calculate penalties at the stage of t 2 f t 2 for each storage level the next year s benefits possible future benefit in 2020 were also considered however to begin the calculation of the dp recursive equation as expressed in eq 10 the initial assumption is that all future benefits losses or penalties will be zero at some point of time loucks et al 2005 for this purpose a dummy year was proposed to quantify the benefits or penalties at the end of 2020 f t 1 avoiding the assumption of terminating operation the 50th percentile of the 30 year historical data was used for the reservoir inflow in the dummy year thus all future benefits losses or penalties after the final stage of the dummy year f t 1 were defined as 0 following eq 10 we can start calculating the penalties f in each stage progressing backward to the stage after the optimization period t 2 finally the penalties at the stage after the optimization period f t 2 for each storage level were obtained according to the limitation of forecast information approximately 2 weeks the future long term reservoir inflow that is used to calculate the penalties after the optimization period t 2 was proposed with different assumptions which is summarized in table 3 the general method for future inflow assumptions is to use the 50th percentile of historical data for all remaining periods up to the end of 2020 this is proposed in scenario 1 the 25th percentile of historical data was adopted in scenario 2 assuming drought conditions to assess the effect of the future inflow assumption it was assumed that the assumption is perfect as proposed in scenario 3 a combination of perfect forecasting and future assumptions was proposed in scenario 4 to assess the effect of the use of forecast inflow in optimization scenario 5 was introduced with the general procedure using the 50th percentile of historical data as the future inflow assumption the 1 week advanced release strategy r t obtained from the optimized process can be implemented for any initial reservoir storage level s t at the target time t this signifies that this strategy can be implemented under different flow patterns using linear interpolation among the release tables obtained from the optimization process to determine the strategy performance the strategies were utilized on observed flow patterns using a forward calculation the strategy performance is evaluated based on the sum of the drought damage function from the present to the future storage of the target time s t 1 can be estimated using the continuity equation of the reservoir routing which will be the initial storage of the following time step the same procedure will be repeated with the next operation strategy 5 3 objective function the objective function for the reservoir operation optimization in the drought problem may be defined as a minimization of the total drought damage over the study period the objective function for this problem is expressed as follows 11 min t 1 t h t where t is the number of optimization stages and h t is the drought damage function at stage t a drought damage function proposed by ikebuchi et al 1990 was employed in this case study for the objective function of optimization the function is defined by the following equation 12 h t r t max d t r t 0 2 d t where d t is water demand required from the reservoir this function represented the absolute value of the water gap multiplied by the rate of the gap to the demand giving equal weight to both the absolute value and the rate of the gap when the drought damage is evaluated water demand from the sirikit reservoir generally depends on the correlation between irrigation demand and hydropower generation as well as the amount of water supply from other sources such as release from the bhumibol reservoir and side flows from other tributaries for this purpose huge information is required leading to the huge dimension of analysis to simplify this the amount of historical release from the reservoir might specify as the target for the water requirement from the reservoir this assumption is based on the assumption that a particular amount of water is released from the sirikit reservoir supplying the existing demand in the cprb water allocation from the reservoir to irrigation sector in thailand varies annually takeda et al 2016 regarding the drought condition in 2019 the downstream water requirement such as from the irrigation sector may require more water from the reservoir than usual thus we assumed that the actual release during 2019 could supply the downstream demand for the future assumption demand for calculating future drought damage the downstream water demand may consider as the usual thus the average releases during 2004 2018 except the unusual release in 2011 from the reservoir was used 5 4 optimization framework for dam release strategy using dp the objective of this study is to develop a future release strategy for large scale reservoirs using weather forecasts for this purpose the optimization process of the released strategy for long term reservoir operation using epf is illustrated in fig 6 for real time river flow forecasting an initial condition setting of the hydrological model is necessary the previous week s t 1 flow condition initial analysis period was simulated with observed rainfall forecast method 3 was selected discussed in section 6 2 to determine initial condition of the model using adaptive mode data assimilation is associated the model state variables at the beginning of the forecast period obtained from the simulation in the initial analysis period t 1 were assigned to the model as the initial state condition see section 4 the 2 week inflow forecast q t and q t 1 obtained from the hydrological model simulated with 2 week advanced epf was input into the dp to optimize the 1 week advanced release strategy r t at any storage level to optimize the release strategy the future benefit at the end of the target period f t 2 is required to associate the penalties to lower storage levels of the reservoir see section 5 2 objective function of the drought damage is required for the optimization process see section 5 3 reservoir information such as elevation storage area maximum minimum storage evaporation rate from the water body at any stage and generated power capacity are required furthermore the minimum and maximum released capacities are assigned to the dp algorithm as the constraint for the reservoir release condition for the reservoir release constraint in this study two release functions were adopted for dp firstly the maximum total release turbine release and spillway release was used for unusual release such as flood events considering the capacity of the downstream river channel secondly the constraint for usual release power generation and downstream water requirement regards the historical maximum and minimum demands varying monthly 6 results and discussion 6 1 performance of epf fig 7a and b present the comparison of accumulated basin averaged precipitation between forecasts and observations for accumulated 1 week days 1 7 and accumulated 2 weeks days 1 14 respectively the forecast is capable of estimating precipitation during the dry season around weeks 1 17 and weeks 45 52 however during the wet season there are some differences between precipitation forecasts and observation especially during the start to mid of the wet season around weeks 18 29 which resulted in an overestimation of the accumulated precipitation for both 1 week and 2 weeks in contrast using the mean of forecast ensembles for accumulated basin precipitation the forecast performed well when compared to the observation with an rmse value of 22 6 mm 2 0 relative difference using annual precipitation and 43 6 mm 3 9 relative difference using annual precipitation for 1 week and 2 weeks respectively 6 2 performance of inflow forecasting figs 8 and 9 present the reservoir inflow comparison between forecasts box plot and observations in different forecast methods for 1 and 2 weeks accumulated inflows respectively precipitation forecasts were used during the forecast period and the observed precipitation was adopted to evaluate the forecast procedure as a possible perfect forecast the performances of inflow forecasts such as rmse and nse in different forecast methods were calculated by comparing the mean of the forecast ensembles with the observations as summarized in table 4 according to the results obtained from different forecast methods the model initial state condition including its spatial distribution has a primary effect on inflow forecasts this results in a significant difference in the forecast inflow volume using the state update a type 1 scenario applied same ratio to all upstream grids the forecast inflow had a significant fluctuation among the forecast members compared to using the state update type 2 the use of forecast and observed precipitation resulted in a significant difference in the forecast volume especially during high flow see fig 8a b a and b moreover the 2 week accumulated inflow forecast resulted in a significant overestimation throughout the year compared to the observations see fig 9a and b using the state update type 2 considered grid drainage area the inflow forecast had more stable results among the members compared to the results obtained from the type 1 state update there is no primary difference in the simulated results obtained using forecasts and observed precipitation see fig 8c d c and d furthermore the accumulated forecast inflow for 1 and 2 weeks corresponded well with observations this may be described by comparing the spatial distribution of the model s initial state the model state at the initial forecast time t0 that resulted in a difference in the forecast inflow for example fig 10 presents a comparison of the initial model state spatial distribution for week 31 july 28 2019 00 00 utc using different forecast methods fig 10a d present the distributed grid discharge ranged from 0 0 to 265 0 m3 s that emphasize the discharge state in the mainstream fig 10e h present the distributed grid discharge ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 m3 s that emphasize the discharge state for the most of catchment area small streams the spatial distribution of discharge state at the upstream grids shows a difference in value compared among different update methods see the procedure in section 4 in contrast to the river discharge at the basin outlet observed station having the same value for all methods fig 10a b e and f present the spatial distribution of the initial model state resulting from update procedure type 1 that the correction factor fca is directly applied to update the state variables for any upstream grid of the observed station as expressed in eq 8 which exhibited greater river discharge at the upstream grids than fig 10c d g and h resulting from update type 2 that the correction factor fca is reduced when updating the state variables for any upstream grid based on a drainage area factor at each cell the ratio of drainage area between any upstream grid and the observed station as expressed in eq 9 the difference in the initial state value resulted in different inflow forecasts as shown in fig 11 the forecast hydrograph in fig 11a and b resulting from state updated type 1 presented a higher forecast inflow than those fig 11c and d from state updated type 2 higher discharge from the upstream grids at the initial state of forecast simulation resulted from the higher update coefficient flow to the outlet when the simulation time was extended there is no primary difference in the forecast results compared to the use of different forcing data during the initial analysis period using only observed precipitation during the initial analysis period the inflow forecast resulted in higher performance and lower simulation cost therefore it may be considered as a cost effective procedure for setting the initial states of the model prior to performing the forecast as forecast method 3 resulted in satisfactory performance and reduced simulation cost the result from this method was adopted to optimize the sirikit dam release strategy 6 3 reservoir optimization results fig 12 presents the results of the reservoir operation by adopting the release strategies obtained from different scenarios of the real time optimization process fig 12a shows a comparison of the reservoir releases in different optimization scenarios the actual release scenario 0 is significantly larger than the average historical release during may july week 18 30 increased demand for downstream water use due to the unexpected drought period although the reservoir storage might be considered to be at a high level much higher than the lrc the storage gradually decreased to low storage levels as a result of the imbalance between reservoir inflows and outflows the water release hydrographs resulting from the optimization process scenarios 1 5 have a similar tendency to reduce water releases smaller than the actual operation scenario 0 to mitigate the drought damage in the future based on different scenarios of optimization criteria fig 12b shows a comparison of the reservoir storage operated by the release strategies obtained from different optimization scenarios using an optimization process to determine the reservoir release decision the reservoir storage at the end of 2019 was greater than that observed in operation scenario 0 for all scenarios by associating forecast information in the real time optimization of reservoir operation decision making such as scenarios 1 4 the overall reservoir water storage in 2019 is greater than that when predictions had not been considered scenario 5 although scenario 4 is considered as the perfect inflow forecast there is no primary difference in the results obtained from scenario 3 the forecast inflow for determining the release strategy in scenario 3 has a similar tendency compared the actual inflow used in scenario 4 fig 12c presents a comparison of the accumulated total drought damage of the reservoir operation in different optimization scenarios although increased releases provided a smaller drought damage at the end of the year as the damage is a function of reservoir release the remaining water budget for the future operation is different difference in reservoir storage level at the end of the year to compare the effectiveness of the optimization scenarios the penalty might be considered for each storage level at the end of the year this storage penalty can be calculated based on the future long term inflow and the future demand assumptions using a backward calculation eq 10 for this study we used the actual inflow in 2020 and the 50th percentile of the historical data in the dummy year thus the penalties based on the end storage level for each scenario are summarized in table 5 the sum of the total drought damage in 2019 and end year storage penalty were the smallest for scenarios 3 and 4 and had the lowest value among all scenarios regarding the assumption of water demand scenario 0 actual operation had no damage in 2019 considering end year storage penalty it had the highest damage compared to all scenarios scenario 5 without considering forecast had the smallest drought damage in 2019 among optimization scenarios scenarios 1 5 but resulted in the highest value when considering the storage penalty furthermore we considered that the hydropower production was generated following the optimized release amount considering forecast information also resulted in a better potential of power generation as shown in table 5 this demonstrates that there are advantages when associating forecast information with real time optimization for decision making in reservoir operation the future long term inflow assumption for penalty calculation has a significant effect on the results of the reservoir operation to improve optimization process efficiency long term forecasts with high performance should be utilized in contrast although the future long term inflow is practically difficult to predict the use of historical data such as in scenarios 1 and 2 provided satisfactory results in this study 7 conclusions this study presented a methodology to introduce ensemble weather forecast information collected from tigge archive data for real time optimization of a 1 week advanced release strategy of the sirikit reservoir thailand the basin is located in a tropical climate region with a distinct wet and dry season which has high uncertainty regarding hydrological conditions this uncertainty increases challenges for reservoir operation despite the reservoir s operational challenges resulting from the high uncertainty regarding hydrological conditions in a tropical climate basin the case study indicated that reservoir operation would benefit by considering ensemble weather forecasts such reservoir operation improvements would have positive impacts for long term hydropower generation and irrigation purposes this result agrees with previous study in different regions that using forecast information with dp can support decision making in water management faber and stedinger 2001 kim et al 2007 nohara and hori 2018 nohara et al 2009 although this study indicates potential advantages of considering ensemble weather predictions for the 1 week advanced reservoir release strategy there are some limitations firstly the shortest time step of prediction can provide more advantages in reservoir operation such as floods control purposes secondly further study may consider the forecast information such as temperature to predict the actual evapotranspiration rather than adopt historical data for improving inflow prediction thirdly a real time downstream water requirement may take into account for robust decision making of long term reservoirs fourthly although this study demonstrated the advantages of the real time reservoir optimization considering inflow predictions for a case study of 2019 the evaluation of the real time scheme should be followed up with the further years lastly this study presented significant differences in reservoir operation results driven by future long term inflow assumptions for a storage penalty estimation further studies might introduce long range weather forecasts for more robust decision making during reservoir operation by achieving the limitations the real time optimization scheme considering inflow predictions would be practically providing the benefit to society in terms of water resources management of the cprb in addition this study illustrates the importance of tigge which provides forecast data from various centers worldwide which provides the benefits of research

8086,study region the sirikit dam in the nan river basin is located on a main tributary of the chao phraya river in thailand study focus this study investigates forecasting river flows and real time optimization of dam release using a distributed hydrological model with ensemble weather forecasting for reservoir operations which provide hydropower and irrigation facilities in thailand during a case study of the 2019 drought event medium range ensemble precipitation forecasts were employed using a hydrological model to predict the real time reservoir inflow real time optimization of the water release strategy determined a week in advance with an effective initial condition for hydropower generation and irrigation was conducted with different scenarios using dynamic programming considering inflow predictions new hydrological insights for the region the medium range ensemble precipitation forecast conducted by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts was used to quantify precipitation for the study basin the ensemble precipitation forecast with the hydrological model was employed for inflow prediction of the study basin which was located in a tropical climate with a distinct wet and dry season the initial conditions of the hydrological model largely influenced the real time inflow forecast to determine the initial conditions of the model the empirical data assimilation considering a drainage area factor was utilized and observed precipitation data were used for model input forcing data during the initial analysis period this method improved the reservoir inflow prediction and real time reservoir optimization using dynamic programming with considering ensemble forecasts provided more efficient operating decisions than employing historical data the resulting information will be useful for water resource management which may be adapted to other basins in the study region keywords ensemble inflow forecasting data assimilation distributed hydrologic model reservoir optimization dynamic programing thailand 1 introduction the sirikit dam is one of the two large reservoirs in the chao phraya river basin cprb that is the largest 158 000 km2 and most important in thailand the sirikit reservoir containing 9510 million m3 of the total storage volume has a significant role in effectively managing the water resources of the basin however the dam is located in a tropical climate with significant seasonal differences and uncertainty regarding the basin s hydrological condition influenced by both the indian and pacific oceans nguyen et al 2020 in turn these conditions cause both floods and droughts sayama et al 2015 like the 2011 flood event and the 2015 and 2019 drought events which proved to be very challenging for reservoir operators these uncertainties regarding the basin s hydrological condition have a primary effect on reservoir operation increasing the risk of water disaster tingsanchali and boonyasirikul 2006 in addition climate change complicates future water resource management in cprb because of increasing extreme weather fluctuations kotsuki et al 2014 wichakul et al 2015 incorporating weather forecast may improve the efficiency of decision making hamlet et al 2002 lettenmaier and wood 1993 zhu et al 2002 however the forecast has limitations in accuracy forecast uncertainty with increasing forecast lead time the optimum solution to capture and reduce this forecast error uncertainty is to use an ensemble forecast rather than a single deterministic forecast because the ensemble forecast produces a set of randomly equally likely independent solutions for the future zhu 2005 in recent decades ensemble forecast techniques have been rapidly developed ensemble forecast techniques are now generally accepted as a reliable approach for estimating forecast confidence especially for high impact weather bougeault et al 2010 based on these advantages several studies have been conducted using ensemble forecast data such as storm track prediction lin et al 2020 nishimura and yamaguchi 2015 weber 2003 reservoir inflow prediction fan et al 2015 river flow prediction and flood forecasting alfieri et al 2012 bao et al 2011 he et al 2010 sayama et al 2020 combining with using ensemble forecast information in a reservoir operation study the dynamic programming dp is a well known method to construct a mathematical model for decision support alemu et al 2011 a number of studies have been conducted regarding ensemble streamflow predictions esp with dp to improve reservoir operation efficiency faber and stedinger 2001 demonstrated that using esp forecasts in a real time dp reservoir system optimization model provides more efficient operating decisions than employing historical time series kim et al 2007 reported that updating operation policy using esp forecasts with dp is appropriate for the geum river multi reservoir system in korea in addition operational ensemble hydrometeorological predictions have been used with a hydrological model to predict a reservoir inflow and adapted it to real time reservoir optimization using dp for water use in a drought event nohara and hori 2018 the study reported that this approach generally mitigates drought damage compared with considering historical flow time series although these studies indicated that association of ensemble forecast information with dp for reservoir optimization can improve the operation efficiency information regarding the methods for performing reservoir inflow forecasts using ensemble hydrometeorological predictions with hydrological model reservoir inflow prediction approach such as real time state update produce is scarce this procedure becomes more important for a reservoir located in a tropical climate basin with distinct wet and dry hydrological conditions such as the cprb recently the cprb frequently faces drought conditions since 2011 massive flooding occurred in the basin the accumulated annual inflow of two major dams bhumibol and sirikit during 2012 2019 is 17 1 lower than the historical 30 year average which means 6 in 8 years of annual inflow are lower than the historical mean especially the severe drought in 2015 and 2019 the accumulated annual inflow of two dams is 48 5 and 40 0 lower than the historical mean respectively regarding the downstream water requirement this resulted in a low storage volume of the reservoirs as a result of the imbalance between inflows and outflows the events resulted in difficulties in water management for the coming years as a result of insufficient reservoir water storage in thailand the drought problem over the long term develops into a primary social and economic issue zenkoji et al 2019 therefore this study aims to introduce the forecast information for water resources management to mitigate the impact of drought the main objectives are as follows 1 to investigate the ability of river flows forecasting using a distributed hydrological model with ensemble precipitation forecasts epf and 2 to utilize the river flow prediction for real time reservoir optimization using dp to mitigate the drought event for a case study in 2019 for this purpose a physically based distributed hydrological model is adopted an adaptive mode of operation state variable update with different update procedures to assess the effect of the model s initial state condition is also utilized on the results of river flow forecasts medium range epfs are used to determine the reservoir inflow 2 weeks in advance of reservoir inflow forecast then the optimization of reservoir release is examined in different scenarios of optimization using the 2 week inflow forecasts in section 2 a case study of the difficulties for reservoir operation of the sirikit dam during the drought event in 2019 has been proposed in section 3 the hydrological model is calibrated and validated in offline mode prior to its application and its use for forecasting in section 4 the methodology of implementing the real time inflow forecast using ensemble precipitation forecasts is described and the effect of the model s initial conditions with different model state update procedures on the inflow forecast results is evaluated in section 5 real time reservoir optimization for 1 week advanced release strategy using forecast inflows is examined with different scenarios regarding future long term inflow assumptions in section 6 the advantages of introducing ensemble hydrometeorological forecasts are demonstrated for real time optimization of sirikit reservoir operation during 2019 2 current dam operation at the sirikit dam the sirikit dam contains 6660 million m3 of effective storage and 500 mw of power generation capacity located on the nan river one of the four main tributaries of the chao phraya river the dam controls 13 130 km2 of drainage area the main functions of the dam include irrigation purposes domestic and industrial use flood control ecological conservation and power generation amnatsan et al 2018 the location of the study basin is shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows the operation records of the sirikit reservoir during 2019 compared to the 30 years historical data in the percentile of each 7 days unit fig 2a and b show the comparison of accumulated reservoir inflow and release respectively fig 2c show the comparison of reservoir storage between 2019 and historical data due to unpredicted inflow reservoir operation faces significant challenges in controlling water for society the reservoir storage level was higher than the lower rule curve lrc at the beginning of the year see fig 2c whereas the released volume is relatively high close to the 75th percentile because of the downstream demand and power supply requirement during the dry season as shown in fig 2b however the low inflow volume from the beginning to the middle of the wet season was unexpected compared to the 30 years historical data the reservoir inflow volume is low lower than the 25th percentile as shown in fig 2a this event presented difficulties for reservoir operation and resulted in a low storage level lower than lrc after mid august and led to a low level of reservoir storage at the end of the year significantly less than the lrc as shown in fig 2c for effective basin water management reservoir operation requires forecasting information the dam reservoir water level in 2019 is historically low and to investigate the precipitation forecast to reduce the drought disaster is an urgent issue therefore we selected this period as a case study to evaluate the performance of release strategy estimation forecasting 1 week in advance using medium range weather forecast information and the reservoir optimization process 3 reservoir inflow prediction model the 1k dhm is a distributed hydrological model based on kinematic wave flow approximation that considers surface subsurface flow the elevation and flow direction are determined using topographical data provided by hydrosheds lehner et al 2006 in digital elevation models with a resolution of 30 s approximately 1 km each cell of the hydrological process consists of river and slope flow components tanaka and tachikawa 2015 meema and tachikawa 2020 incorporated unconfined bedrock aquifers into the slope flow component of the original model to improve the long term river flow simulation in a tropical climate basin and this improved model was used as an inflow the continuity and momentum equations for the surface soil layer are as follows 1 h s t q s x r e p u 2 q s h s d m k m h s d m β i 0 h s d m d m k m i h s d m k a i d m h s d a d m k m i h s d m k a i i n s h s d a m d a h s where q s is the runoff per unit slope width h s is the

capillary pore k m is the hydraulic conductivity when the capillary pore is saturated β is an exponent parameter that describes the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and water content d a is the maximum water content in the effective porosity k a is the saturated hydraulic conductivity n s is the manning s roughness coefficient for surface flow i is the slope gradient and m 5 3 the continuity and momentum equations for bedrock aquifer layer are as follows 3 h u t q u x p u 4 q u h u α u h u 2 where d u is the total effective depth of rock fracture in the unconfined bedrock aquifer h u is the total water depth in the fracture of the aquifer and α u k u i d u where k u is the hydraulic conductivity that corresponds to the actual cross sectional area of flow in the rock fracture and i is the gradient of the hillslope the discharge from the slope flow component on both sides of the river channel contributes to the river channel component as the lateral discharge per unit length the discharge from the upper cells is assigned to the river channel component of the cell as the boundary condition the river flow of the river channel component is computed by the following 1d kinematic wave equations 5 q α a m 6 a t q x 2 q s q u where q is the river discharge a is the cross sectional area m 5 3 and α i nb 2 3 in which the river channel b is assumed to be a wide rectangle and vary each grid based on the grid drainage area determined by b a a grid b where a grid is grid drainage area a and b are constant parameters the model was calibrated and validated before applying it to the inflow forecast to apply the model for long term forecasting the calibration periods was set to contain the seasonal hydrological characteristics of the basin wet and dry seasons the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1994 was applied to optimize the model parameters by searching for the parameter with the smallest root mean square error rmse when compared with observations designing the range of the parameters is important to identify the parameter set the model calibration method was described by meema and tachikawa 2020 to determine the parameter of the total effective depth of rock fracture d u for the study basin the hydrogeological map of the study basin was used and resulted in most of the area is shale considering the porosity of 0 0 0 1 freeze and cherry 1979 the total storage of bedrock aquifer may be ranged from 0 0 to 3 0 m the inflow of the sirikit reservoir in 2014 which is considered a normal hydrological year was selected as the calibration period the optimized model parameters are listed in table 1 the optimal parameter such as the total effective depth of rock fracture d u agreed with the hydrogeological map which the aquifer productivity is quite small this indicates that the effective depth may be much smaller than the maximum of the designed range the same parameter set was applied to the validation periods in 2008 and 1998 which were considered wet and dry respectively the model performed well in both calibration and validation periods with an rmse less than 63 9 million m3 1 1 relative difference using mean annual inflow and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient greater than 0 82 as shown in the comparison between simulated and observed inflow of the reservoir in fig 3 the model efficiently represents the inflow characteristics of the basin for both the wet and dry seasons for all simulation periods this model with the optimized parameter set was applied to produce real time inflow forecasts for the 2019 sirikit reservoir 4 ensemble inflow prediction using european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf precipitation forecast 4 1 ensemble precipitation forecast used in the study tigge thorpex interactive grand global ensemble is a database of ensemble medium range forecasts conducted by different forecasting centers worldwide for conducting scientific research bougeault et al 2010 ensemble prediction system data are available from approximately ten of these forecasting centers among all data on tigge ecmwf has advantages in a number of forecast members associated with high forecast uncertainty and spatial resolution applicable for the study basin compared to other forecasting systems regarding these advantages it was selected as the epf data for generating reservoir inflow forecasts in this study the ecmwf forecasts consist of 51 members of precipitation with approximately 0 5 resolution for the whole globe initial uncertainties are considered using a singular vector technique a stochastic scheme is used to model uncertainties resulting in possible variations in physical parameterizations buizza et al 2007 the data are available twice a day at 00 00 utc and 12 00 utc with time steps of 6 h and 15 d of forecast lead time 4 2 real time state update of hydrological model the update procedure of the model state variables is based on observed errors in river flow and empirical methods or kalman filtering has been used moore et al 2005 romanowicz et al 2006 using kalman filtering with complex distributed and nonlinear models results in highly complex computations o connell and clarke 1981 a cost effective approach has been developed for computation using an empirical data assimilation procedure and applied to a large scale hydrological model collischonn et al 2005 therefore we adopted this empirical data assimilation procedure to incorporate the large scale distributed hydrological model as explained in section 3 to obtain the initial state of the basin at t0 using observed and ensemble precipitation forecasts as the model input prior to performing reservoir inflow forecasts the updating correction factor fca is calculated at gauge station k using the following equation 7 fca k q obs k q cal k where q obs k and q cal k are the observed and calculated river discharges at gauge station k to evaluate the updating procedure during the initial analysis period different empirical equations were investigated in this study first model states update type 1 the correction factor is directly applied to update the state variables for any cell i located upstream of gauge station k as expressed in eq 8 second model states update type 2 the correction factor is applied to correct the state variables for any cell i located upstream of gauge station k considering a drainage area factor of the upstream grids at each cell as expressed in eq 9 8 s up i k fca k s cal i 9 s up i k fca k s cal i a i a k s cal i

discharge q lateral discharge from the surface soil layer q s and the bedrock aquifer layer q u a i and a k are the drainage areas upstream of cell i and gauging station k 4 3 real time reservoir inflow forecast algorithm fig 4 illustrates the procedure of the reservoir inflow forecast using the epf the simulation can be divided into two periods the initial analysis and forecast periods for real time forecasting it is necessary to operate the model in adaptive mode moore et al 2005 for which the model output is based on previous model inputs as well as previously observed information that is used to update the model prior to a new forecast thus this study proposes an initial analysis period to account for uncertainties in the model initial conditions before the forecast period is performed for this purpose data assimilation as explained in section 4 2 is adopted to improve the estimate of the initial states of the model and to reduce the simulation errors in the forecast period madsen and skotner 2005 we not only considered model state variables for the data assimilation implementation but also the errors due to model input to assess the errors due to input data during the initial analysis period two procedures of input precipitation data for the model were considered first a single pattern of observed data was applied to the model second a combination of observed data and ensemble forecasts with 52 patterns one pattern of observation 51 patterns of ensemble forecasts of precipitation was applied to the model fig 4a describes the procedure of using observed precipitation and model state updates up to the starting time of the forecasts t0 then the epfs were applied to the model as forcing input data up to the lead time t 15 for the 15 d reservoir inflow forecasts fig 4b describes the procedure of using a combination of observed and ensemble forecast data and the update procedure of the model states up to the starting time of the forecasts t0 using 52 precipitation patterns during the initial analysis period 52 flow patterns were obtained to select the flow pattern that represents the model states at the starting time of the forecasts t0 the highest nse coefficient computed from the comparison between each simulated flow pattern with the observation during the initial analysis period was selected data assimilation methods used during the initial analysis period to reproduce the initial state of the model at the initial time of the forecast t0 are summarized in table 2 the model state variables were updated in forecast methods 1 and 2 using eq 8 and in forecast methods 3 and 4 using eq 9 a single pattern of observed precipitation was used in forecast methods 1 and 3 fig 4a for forecast methods 2 and 4 52 precipitation patterns were used fig 4b for the forecast period all methods precipitation forecasts were used and the observed precipitation was applied in this study to evaluate the inflow forecast procedures as a possibly perfect forecast of precipitation 5 reservoir optimization with ensemble inflow forecast in sirikit dam 5 1 application of dp for reservoir optimization to interpret the results of the ensemble inflow forecast the general method is to consider the mean value ensemble mean or median which represents the tendency of all ensemble forecast members to optimize the operation strategy of the reservoir using the ensemble mean or median of the ensemble inflow forecast the deterministic dp ddp can be applied nohara and hori 2018 by using ddp in reservoir problems the reservoir storage at time t is divided into decision making stages s t the optimized water release r t at each state is selected based on the minimum value of the sum of the current drought damage b t r t and future drought damage function f t 1 s t 1 the computation is started at the end of the optimization time the final stage and then moved backward to the beginning stage louoks and falkson 1970 the recursive equation for optimization can be defined by the following equation 10 f t s t min h t r t f t 1 s t 1 where t is the time period and h t is the drought damage function of period t and f t 1 s t 1 is the future drought function which represents the minimal drought damage expected after time step t when the storage state is s t at time step t 5 2 implementation with the optimized strategy and scenarios we assume that the simulation for 1 week in advance released strategy performs every sunday the volume of water released from the reservoir follows the simulated strategy throughout the week a total of 52 weeks in 2019 was the target period of this study fig 5 presents the optimization scheme for a target week t release strategy using dp to adopt dp the penalties must be utilized at lower reservoir storage levels after the final time step of optimization this is to ensure that the reservoir will not draw down to low storage levels by releasing excess water to generate quantified benefits during the optimized period for this purpose the sum of future benefits was applied to each storage level after the final time step of the optimization f t 2 as losses or penalties to calculate penalties at the stage of t 2 f t 2 for each storage level the next year s benefits possible future benefit in 2020 were also considered however to begin the calculation of the dp recursive equation as expressed in eq 10 the initial assumption is that all future benefits losses or penalties will be zero at some point of time loucks et al 2005 for this purpose a dummy year was proposed to quantify the benefits or penalties at the end of 2020 f t 1 avoiding the assumption of terminating operation the 50th percentile of the 30 year historical data was used for the reservoir inflow in the dummy year thus all future benefits losses or penalties after the final stage of the dummy year f t 1 were defined as 0 following eq 10 we can start calculating the penalties f in each stage progressing backward to the stage after the optimization period t 2 finally the penalties at the stage after the optimization period f t 2 for each storage level were obtained according to the limitation of forecast information approximately 2 weeks the future long term reservoir inflow that is used to calculate the penalties after the optimization period t 2 was proposed with different assumptions which is summarized in table 3 the general method for future inflow assumptions is to use the 50th percentile of historical data for all remaining periods up to the end of 2020 this is proposed in scenario 1 the 25th percentile of historical data was adopted in scenario 2 assuming drought conditions to assess the effect of the future inflow assumption it was assumed that the assumption is perfect as proposed in scenario 3 a combination of perfect forecasting and future assumptions was proposed in scenario 4 to assess the effect of the use of forecast inflow in optimization scenario 5 was introduced with the general procedure using the 50th percentile of historical data as the future inflow assumption the 1 week advanced release strategy r t obtained from the optimized process can be implemented for any initial reservoir storage level s t at the target time t this signifies that this strategy can be implemented under different flow patterns using linear interpolation among the release tables obtained from the optimization process to determine the strategy performance the strategies were utilized on observed flow patterns using a forward calculation the strategy performance is evaluated based on the sum of the drought damage function from the present to the future storage of the target time s t 1 can be estimated using the continuity equation of the reservoir routing which will be the initial storage of the following time step the same procedure will be repeated with the next operation strategy 5 3 objective function the objective function for the reservoir operation optimization in the drought problem may be defined as a minimization of the total drought damage over the study period the objective function for this problem is expressed as follows 11 min t 1 t h t where t is the number of optimization stages and h t is the drought damage function at stage t a drought damage function proposed by ikebuchi et al 1990 was employed in this case study for the objective function of optimization the function is defined by the following equation 12 h t r t max d t r t 0 2 d t where d t is water demand required from the reservoir this function represented the absolute value of the water gap multiplied by the rate of the gap to the demand giving equal weight to both the absolute value and the rate of the gap when the drought damage is evaluated water demand from the sirikit reservoir generally depends on the correlation between irrigation demand and hydropower generation as well as the amount of water supply from other sources such as release from the bhumibol reservoir and side flows from other tributaries for this purpose huge information is required leading to the huge dimension of analysis to simplify this the amount of historical release from the reservoir might specify as the target for the water requirement from the reservoir this assumption is based on the assumption that a particular amount of water is released from the sirikit reservoir supplying the existing demand in the cprb water allocation from the reservoir to irrigation sector in thailand varies annually takeda et al 2016 regarding the drought condition in 2019 the downstream water requirement such as from the irrigation sector may require more water from the reservoir than usual thus we assumed that the actual release during 2019 could supply the downstream demand for the future assumption demand for calculating future drought damage the downstream water demand may consider as the usual thus the average releases during 2004 2018 except the unusual release in 2011 from the reservoir was used 5 4 optimization framework for dam release strategy using dp the objective of this study is to develop a future release strategy for large scale reservoirs using weather forecasts for this purpose the optimization process of the released strategy for long term reservoir operation using epf is illustrated in fig 6 for real time river flow forecasting an initial condition setting of the hydrological model is necessary the previous week s t 1 flow condition initial analysis period was simulated with observed rainfall forecast method 3 was selected discussed in section 6 2 to determine initial condition of the model using adaptive mode data assimilation is associated the model state variables at the beginning of the forecast period obtained from the simulation in the initial analysis period t 1 were assigned to the model as the initial state condition see section 4 the 2 week inflow forecast q t and q t 1 obtained from the hydrological model simulated with 2 week advanced epf was input into the dp to optimize the 1 week advanced release strategy r t at any storage level to optimize the release strategy the future benefit at the end of the target period f t 2 is required to associate the penalties to lower storage levels of the reservoir see section 5 2 objective function of the drought damage is required for the optimization process see section 5 3 reservoir information such as elevation storage area maximum minimum storage evaporation rate from the water body at any stage and generated power capacity are required furthermore the minimum and maximum released capacities are assigned to the dp algorithm as the constraint for the reservoir release condition for the reservoir release constraint in this study two release functions were adopted for dp firstly the maximum total release turbine release and spillway release was used for unusual release such as flood events considering the capacity of the downstream river channel secondly the constraint for usual release power generation and downstream water requirement regards the historical maximum and minimum demands varying monthly 6 results and discussion 6 1 performance of epf fig 7a and b present the comparison of accumulated basin averaged precipitation between forecasts and observations for accumulated 1 week days 1 7 and accumulated 2 weeks days 1 14 respectively the forecast is capable of estimating precipitation during the dry season around weeks 1 17 and weeks 45 52 however during the wet season there are some differences between precipitation forecasts and observation especially during the start to mid of the wet season around weeks 18 29 which resulted in an overestimation of the accumulated precipitation for both 1 week and 2 weeks in contrast using the mean of forecast ensembles for accumulated basin precipitation the forecast performed well when compared to the observation with an rmse value of 22 6 mm 2 0 relative difference using annual precipitation and 43 6 mm 3 9 relative difference using annual precipitation for 1 week and 2 weeks respectively 6 2 performance of inflow forecasting figs 8 and 9 present the reservoir inflow comparison between forecasts box plot and observations in different forecast methods for 1 and 2 weeks accumulated inflows respectively precipitation forecasts were used during the forecast period and the observed precipitation was adopted to evaluate the forecast procedure as a possible perfect forecast the performances of inflow forecasts such as rmse and nse in different forecast methods were calculated by comparing the mean of the forecast ensembles with the observations as summarized in table 4 according to the results obtained from different forecast methods the model initial state condition including its spatial distribution has a primary effect on inflow forecasts this results in a significant difference in the forecast inflow volume using the state update a type 1 scenario applied same ratio to all upstream grids the forecast inflow had a significant fluctuation among the forecast members compared to using the state update type 2 the use of forecast and observed precipitation resulted in a significant difference in the forecast volume especially during high flow see fig 8a b a and b moreover the 2 week accumulated inflow forecast resulted in a significant overestimation throughout the year compared to the observations see fig 9a and b using the state update type 2 considered grid drainage area the inflow forecast had more stable results among the members compared to the results obtained from the type 1 state update there is no primary difference in the simulated results obtained using forecasts and observed precipitation see fig 8c d c and d furthermore the accumulated forecast inflow for 1 and 2 weeks corresponded well with observations this may be described by comparing the spatial distribution of the model s initial state the model state at the initial forecast time t0 that resulted in a difference in the forecast inflow for example fig 10 presents a comparison of the initial model state spatial distribution for week 31 july 28 2019 00 00 utc using different forecast methods fig 10a d present the distributed grid discharge ranged from 0 0 to 265 0 m3 s that emphasize the discharge state in the mainstream fig 10e h present the distributed grid discharge ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 m3 s that emphasize the discharge state for the most of catchment area small streams the spatial distribution of discharge state at the upstream grids shows a difference in value compared among different update methods see the procedure in section 4 in contrast to the river discharge at the basin outlet observed station having the same value for all methods fig 10a b e and f present the spatial distribution of the initial model state resulting from update procedure type 1 that the correction factor fca is directly applied to update the state variables for any upstream grid of the observed station as expressed in eq 8 which exhibited greater river discharge at the upstream grids than fig 10c d g and h resulting from update type 2 that the correction factor fca is reduced when updating the state variables for any upstream grid based on a drainage area factor at each cell the ratio of drainage area between any upstream grid and the observed station as expressed in eq 9 the difference in the initial state value resulted in different inflow forecasts as shown in fig 11 the forecast hydrograph in fig 11a and b resulting from state updated type 1 presented a higher forecast inflow than those fig 11c and d from state updated type 2 higher discharge from the upstream grids at the initial state of forecast simulation resulted from the higher update coefficient flow to the outlet when the simulation time was extended there is no primary difference in the forecast results compared to the use of different forcing data during the initial analysis period using only observed precipitation during the initial analysis period the inflow forecast resulted in higher performance and lower simulation cost therefore it may be considered as a cost effective procedure for setting the initial states of the model prior to performing the forecast as forecast method 3 resulted in satisfactory performance and reduced simulation cost the result from this method was adopted to optimize the sirikit dam release strategy 6 3 reservoir optimization results fig 12 presents the results of the reservoir operation by adopting the release strategies obtained from different scenarios of the real time optimization process fig 12a shows a comparison of the reservoir releases in different optimization scenarios the actual release scenario 0 is significantly larger than the average historical release during may july week 18 30 increased demand for downstream water use due to the unexpected drought period although the reservoir storage might be considered to be at a high level much higher than the lrc the storage gradually decreased to low storage levels as a result of the imbalance between reservoir inflows and outflows the water release hydrographs resulting from the optimization process scenarios 1 5 have a similar tendency to reduce water releases smaller than the actual operation scenario 0 to mitigate the drought damage in the future based on different scenarios of optimization criteria fig 12b shows a comparison of the reservoir storage operated by the release strategies obtained from different optimization scenarios using an optimization process to determine the reservoir release decision the reservoir storage at the end of 2019 was greater than that observed in operation scenario 0 for all scenarios by associating forecast information in the real time optimization of reservoir operation decision making such as scenarios 1 4 the overall reservoir water storage in 2019 is greater than that when predictions had not been considered scenario 5 although scenario 4 is considered as the perfect inflow forecast there is no primary difference in the results obtained from scenario 3 the forecast inflow for determining the release strategy in scenario 3 has a similar tendency compared the actual inflow used in scenario 4 fig 12c presents a comparison of the accumulated total drought damage of the reservoir operation in different optimization scenarios although increased releases provided a smaller drought damage at the end of the year as the damage is a function of reservoir release the remaining water budget for the future operation is different difference in reservoir storage level at the end of the year to compare the effectiveness of the optimization scenarios the penalty might be considered for each storage level at the end of the year this storage penalty can be calculated based on the future long term inflow and the future demand assumptions using a backward calculation eq 10 for this study we used the actual inflow in 2020 and the 50th percentile of the historical data in the dummy year thus the penalties based on the end storage level for each scenario are summarized in table 5 the sum of the total drought damage in 2019 and end year storage penalty were the smallest for scenarios 3 and 4 and had the lowest value among all scenarios regarding the assumption of water demand scenario 0 actual operation had no damage in 2019 considering end year storage penalty it had the highest damage compared to all scenarios scenario 5 without considering forecast had the smallest drought damage in 2019 among optimization scenarios scenarios 1 5 but resulted in the highest value when considering the storage penalty furthermore we considered that the hydropower production was generated following the optimized release amount considering forecast information also resulted in a better potential of power generation as shown in table 5 this demonstrates that there are advantages when associating forecast information with real time optimization for decision making in reservoir operation the future long term inflow assumption for penalty calculation has a significant effect on the results of the reservoir operation to improve optimization process efficiency long term forecasts with high performance should be utilized in contrast although the future long term inflow is practically difficult to predict the use of historical data such as in scenarios 1 and 2 provided satisfactory results in this study 7 conclusions this study presented a methodology to introduce ensemble weather forecast information collected from tigge archive data for real time optimization of a 1 week advanced release strategy of the sirikit reservoir thailand the basin is located in a tropical climate region with a distinct wet and dry season which has high uncertainty regarding hydrological conditions this uncertainty increases challenges for reservoir operation despite the reservoir s operational challenges resulting from the high uncertainty regarding hydrological conditions in a tropical climate basin the case study indicated that reservoir operation would benefit by considering ensemble weather forecasts such reservoir operation improvements would have positive impacts for long term hydropower generation and irrigation purposes this result agrees with previous study in different regions that using forecast information with dp can support decision making in water management faber and stedinger 2001 kim et al 2007 nohara and hori 2018 nohara et al 2009 although this study indicates potential advantages of considering ensemble weather predictions for the 1 week advanced reservoir release strategy there are some limitations firstly the shortest time step of prediction can provide more advantages in reservoir operation such as floods control purposes secondly further study may consider the forecast information such as temperature to predict the actual evapotranspiration rather than adopt historical data for improving inflow prediction thirdly a real time downstream water requirement may take into account for robust decision making of long term reservoirs fourthly although this study demonstrated the advantages of the real time reservoir optimization considering inflow predictions for a case study of 2019 the evaluation of the real time scheme should be followed up with the further years lastly this study presented significant differences in reservoir operation results driven by future long term inflow assumptions for a storage penalty estimation further studies might introduce long range weather forecasts for more robust decision making during reservoir operation by achieving the limitations the real time optimization scheme considering inflow predictions would be practically providing the benefit to society in terms of water resources management of the cprb in addition this study illustrates the importance of tigge which provides forecast data from various centers worldwide which provides the benefits of research

8087,study region the study was conducted in the mortes river basin mrb mato grosso state brazil owing to the constant removal of native forest brazilian savannah popularly known as cerrado for agriculture and pasture purposes study focus the hydrological model for large basins mgb iph was employed to assess the hydrological impacts due to land use and land cover scenarios three scenarios were built according to the soil use capacity in the mrb c1 savannah recovery and agriculture removal by pasture areas c2 pasture expansion and c3 agriculture expansion new hydrological insights for the region in general the c2 and c3 results show an increase in water availability however c2 increases flood risk and c3 tends to worsen drought these extreme configurations of land use and land cover reveal poor water distribution throughout the year however c1 provided the most favorable results increasing water availability during the dry season without increasing flood risk the results highlight that anthropic activities already dominate the upper middle and lower parts of the basin representing a risk for sustainable land use our hydrological modeling results demonstrated strategies for planning and management to avoid critical scenarios of lack of water in the mrb due to the intensity of soil use beyond its capacity keywords soil use capacity hydrologic modeling deforestation 1 introduction continuous land use and cover changes add complexity to the analysis of the phenomena involved in hydrological cycles worldwide with many environmental responses depending on the type of biome and their characteristics these changes can alter the biodiversity in different ways depending on the type of biome and their region garcía vega and newbold 2019 the fao 2006 has elucidated in hydrological terms the impacts of native forest to pasture conversion on local water cycle decreasing infiltration rate and increasing runoff due to soil compaction by animal trampling thereby increasing risks of erosion and organic matter losses dionizio et al 2020 global deforestation tendencies have exacerbated these negative impacts however the 1970s policies have driven increased agriculture practices into the mato grosso state higa and moreno 2009 trigueiro et al 2020 revealed some drivers that favor the savannah biome also known as cerrado deforestation and according to inpe 2021 this biome had suffered 46 781 92 km2 of forest loss until 2020 currently brazilian agricultural areas consist of 45 savannah bolfe et al 2020 and without adequate planning of land use and water resource management the high potential of its increase will impact the local hydrological cycle the construction of land use and land cover scenarios based on the land use capacity and its consequences on the streamflow of water courses can generate important information for public and private managers to formulate soil and water conservation actions linked to sustainable agricultural production because of savannah s importance for food production and environmental conservation we selected the mortes river basin mrb in mato grosso state brazil as the study area this basin has some savannah characteristics from the broader region that is it still has native vegetation consisting of riparian forest also known as cerradão indigenous lands gomide and kawakubo 2005 and conservation units unb 2016 as well as areas used for agriculture and livestock purposes which led to its consideration as a pilot basin for research to better understand this issue hydrological

variables that is the model can be used to assess streamflow changes due to climate changes quedi and fan 2020 and land use and land cover pereira et al 2013 lin et al 2007 assessed soil practices with hydrological modeling anticipating potential impacts on hydrological components due to land use and land cover changes similarly shirmohammadi et al 2020 built land use and land cover scenarios through the probability of land use occurrence and showed pathways for integrated management of urmia lake according to sustainable land use according to calegario et al 2020 land use capacity must be understood as the intensity with which the land must be used in ways that ensure no loss in agricultural production and increased soil erosion the methodology proposed for this study was adapted from the land use capacity system proposed by lepsch et al 2015 which consists of a scenario construction that considers land use capacity and criteria related to its agricultural suitability for soils in the brazilian territory based on the determination of the classes of land use capacity it is possible to make an overlay with the current coverage allowing the identification of regions of the basin with inappropriate land use these areas require interventions and must be prioritized in programs for the recovery of degraded areas additionally this study addresses one of the main questions in the current hydrology literature what are the impacts of land cover changes and soil disturbances on land surface water and energy fluxes and on the resulting groundwater recharge blöschl et al 2019 demonstrating that land use and cover changes are complex the study also addresses some sustainable development goals such as clean water and sanitation sdg no 6 and life on land sdg no 15 united nations 2020 thus the study objective was to simulate scenarios of land use and land cover based on the criteria of the land use capacity model lepsch et al 2015 and to evaluate its impacts on streamflows in the mrb using the mgb iph 2 material and methods the methodological process comprised three main stages the first stage consisted of calibration and validation of the mgb iph from 2000 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2014 respectively this stage followed the three steps proposed by fan and collischonn 2014 a spatial data pre processing wherein physical and topological information is summarized and compiled b input processing by obtaining analyzing and preparing hydroclimatic data and c model calibration and validation notably the mgb iph was calibrated and validated using a land use and cover image equivalent to half of the study period 2007 following the suggestion by alves et al 2020 on mgb iph the second main stage involved the construction of land use and land cover scenarios in the mrb using the land use capacity method proposed by the united states department of agriculture soil conservation service klingebiel and montgomery 1961 modified by lepsch et al 2015 for the brazilian context incorporating the good practice index gpi described by almeida 2014 finally the third main stage involved assessment of the scenarios generated using the mgb iph to conduct the evaluation we compared the maximum max average long term alt and minimum q95 streamflow values obtained for each scenario with the simulated streamflow in 2017 the impact of these scenarios was compared to the current situation of the basin in terms of land use and cover indeed according to the inpe 2021 approximately 14 778 km2 of the savannah biome has been cleared since 2007 our reference year for the calibration and validation of the model 2 1 study area mrb fig 1 which is located in mato grosso state brazil was selected as the study area the mortes river is the main tributary of the left side of the araguaia river which is the fourth largest basin in brazil gomes and fernandes 2017 ho et al 2016 we considered the outlet basin as the gauging station of santo antônio do leverger f1 26300000 with 57 343 km2 of drainage area the mortes river originates in the serra são lourenço campo verde county and flows into the araguaia river on bananal island which is a seasonal floodplain of 88 119 km2 area and is mainly formed by quaternary sediments irion et al 2016 valente and latrubesse 2012 the climate is aw class köppen s classification which refers to a tropical climate with dry winters and rainy summers alvares et al 2013 the rainy season lasts from october to april and the dry season from may to september prada and marinho filho 2004 with average annual rainfall ranging from 1200 to 2000 mm arvor et al 2012 2 2 mgb iph description the mgb iph was developed by the instituto de pesquisas hidraulicas in the federal university of rio grande do sul brazil it works on large scale basins and as a distributed model it is divided into mini basins which are composed of small homogeneous areas called hydrological response units hrus which are commonly the result of the type of soil and land use and cover combinations haghnegahdar et al 2015 according to tucci and collischonn 2001 the structure is composed of three main modules the first calculates the soil water balance eq 1 on one layer of soil 1 dw dt p et d sup d int d bas where w mm is the water storage in the soil layer p mm δt 1 is the rainfall that reaches the soil et mm δt 1 is the evapotranspiration et from the soil dsup mm δt 1 is the surface runoff dint mm δt 1 is the subsurface flow and dbas mm δt 1 is the percolation to the groundwater reservoir infiltration and runoff dsup were calculated using the arno model todini 1996 subsurface runoff dint was calculated using the brooks and corey unsaturated hydraulic conductivity equation rawls et al 1993 and the percolation from the soil layer to groundwater dbas was calculated based on the linear relationship between the moisture content in the soil and their maximum storage capacity in the second module the generated runoff was guided to the nearest river stretches using three linear reservoir systems base sub superficial and superficial flow collischonn et al 2007 et eq 2 was estimated using the penman monteith equation shuttleworth 1993 2 e t δ a ρ a c p d r a δ γ 1 r s r a 1 λ ρ w where λ mj kg 1 is the latent heat of vaporization δ kpa c 1 is the gradient of the saturated vapor pressure function a mj m 2 s 1 is the available

constant rs s m 1 is the surface resistance of the land cover and ra s m 1 is the aerodynamic resistance the last module calculates the streamflow propagation in the hydrographic network using the inertial method which is a simplification of the saint venant equations eqs 3 and 4 fan and collischonn 2014 3 a t q x 0 4 q t q 2 a x ga h x ga s 0 ga s f where q is the flow m3 s 1 a is the cross sectional area of the flow m2 x is the longitudinal distance m t is time s q is the flow per unit width m2 s 1 h is the river depth m s 0 is the bottom slope m m 1 s f is the water surface slope m m 1 and g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 disregarding the first term of eq 4 dynamic equation considering the river has a rectangular cross section with width b then a bxh and the value of sf can be estimated by manning s empirical equation as shown in eq 5 the dynamic equation can be simplified as eq 6 5 s f q q n 2 a 2 r 4 3 6 q t g b h y x g b h q q n 2 b h 2 r 4 3 0 where q is the streamflow m3 s 1 a is the section area m2 r is the hydraulic radius m n is the manning roughness coefficient m 1 3 s b is the river width m and h is the river depth m finally the hydraulic radius r is considered equal to the depth h which is reasonable for natural channels which are much wider than deep therefore eq 6 can be expressed as modified and written as 7 q t g b h y x g q q n 2 h 7 3 0

input database digital elevation model from the shuttle radar topography mission available from the united states geological survey website http earthexplorer usgs gov was used to delineate the mrb drainage area fig 1 and to define the slope classes fig 2e soil type and groundwater units were obtained from the empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecuária https www embrapa br tema solos brasileiros solos do brasil and the serviço geologico do brasil http www cprm gov br publique hidrologia estudos hidrologicos e hidrogeologicos mapa hidrogeologico do brasil ao milionesimo 756 html both with a spatial scale of 1 5 000 000 embrapa 2011 the land use and cover classification 2007 of the mapbiomas project was also used it classifies different biomes amazon rainforest atlantic forest caatinga savannah pampa and pantanal and thematic classes pasture agriculture forest plantation coastal areas planning and urban areas in the brazilian territory souza 2020 then hrus were generated fig 2c by combining soil type land use and land cover maps fig 2a and d it is worth mentioning that the mapbiomas classification was reduced into five classes riparian forest savannah pasture agriculture urban areas and water because the mgb iph supports up to 12 hrus and the combination of these classes with soil depths deep or shallow resulted in only 10 hrus furthermore the study area was divided into five sub basins fig 1 and we decided to set their outlets considering the spatial heterogeneity of variables as slope fig 2e altitude fig 2f hydrogeological units fig 2b hrus fig 2c and gauging station proximities for example for sub basin 5 most of the area is covered by agriculture on a deep soil with a low slope 0 4 in contrast in sub basin 4 the agriculture in the deep soil has a higher slope higher runoff thus it was necessary to distinguish this with different magnitudes of parameter b separation of infiltration and runoff the latter is used to improve the performance of the model in every gauging station used as a reference because the streamflow propagation module used by the mgb iph mentioned in section 2 2 has difficulties in flat areas pontes et al 2017 to evaluate the benefit of this approach we compared our results with the results of a simulation with calibrated parameters without subdividing the mrb and thus using the same parameters for all hrus the overall performance of the model without our framework is inferior to that obtained in this study section 3 2 supplementary material 2 3 1 2 input processing daily records were used as the input data for the mgb iph the data were gathered from 30 rainfall stations five climatological stations and five gauging stations table 1s supplementary material fig 1 missing rainfall data 5 on average for all stations were completed using the trmm data rozante et al 2010 cassalho et al 2020 and the climate and rainfall series were interpolated to the mini basin geometric centroids through the inverse square distance method pontes et al 2017 historical data were obtained from the national water agency ana 2005 and the national meteorology institute inmet 1992 moreover the mgb iph requires fixed parameters table 2s supplementary material for different land uses and covers i e albedo leaf area index tree height and surface resistance which were obtained from different sources bravo 2008 giongo and vettorazzi 2014 ruhoff et al 2013 2 3 2 mgb iph calibration and validation parameters and indexes the mgb iph was calibrated using data from 01 01 2000 12 31 2010 totaling 11 years of data as mentioned earlier according to the mgb iph author recommendations we used land use and cover images for half the study period 2007 including calibration and validation processes 2000 2014 calibration was manually performed trial and error according to the method described by tucci and collischonn 2003 this aimed to represent changes in the slope in each sub basin from upstream to downstream therefore the calibration sequence included sub basins 5 4 3 2 and 1 fig 1 according to the criteria provided by tucci and collischonn 2001 and oliveira et al 2019 as shown in table 1 the mgb iph was validated using data from 01 01 2011 12 31 2014 totaling 4 years of data therefore validation ceased owing to a lack of recent hydrological data for the mrb model accuracy was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index eq 8 nse logarithm log nse eq 9 nash and sutcliffe 1970 kling gupta efficiency kge eq 10 paiva et al 2012 and bias percentage eq 11 tucci 1998 8 nse 1 σ i 1 n o i p i 2 σ i 1 n o i o 2 9 log nse 1 σ i 1 n ln o i ln p i 2 σ i 1 n ln o i ln o 2 10 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 0 5 11 p bias σ i 1 n p i o i σ i 1 n o i 100 where pi is the estimated streamflow oi is the observed streamflow n is the number of values in the sample α is the reason for the variation between simulated and observed streamflows β is the reason for the average between simulated and observed streamflows and r is the correlation between simulated and observed streamflows the nse and log nse indexes have a maximum value of 1 which corresponds to a perfect fit between the estimated and observed streamflows these indices show sensitivity to errors in the maximum and minimum streamflows respectively therefore when the indices are close to 1 the mgb iph estimations have a good fit for the observed data for both floods and droughts model performance is considered adequate and good if the value of nse or log nse is higher than 0 75 and it is considered acceptable if the value is between 0 36 and 0 75 gottschal et al 2001 the kge index was used to detect problems related to nse as described by gupta et al 2009 finally the bias percentage pbias has neither a maximum nor a minimum value and is not influenced by floods or droughts differently its value only expresses the relative difference between the sum of all estimated and observed streamflows 2 4 land use and cover scenarios land use capacity is a technical interpretative classification used in the management of soil conservation practices such classification considers different soil traits and properties to obtain homogeneous land classes and thus defines its maximum use capacity without degradation risk lepsch et al 2015 pruski et al 2006 calegario et al 2020 in this system only two categories were used to classify land use capacity given the limited detailing of the spatial information used the first category was divided into use capacity groups a b and c according to land use intensity whereas the second category comprised use capacity classes from i to viii based on the degree of limited use table 3s supplementary material in the first category group a included lands that are likely to be cropped with annual or perennial crops pasture and or reforestation and fauna protection classes i iv group b comprised land unsuitable for intensive farming but still adapted for pasture and or reforestation and wild fauna protection classes v vii finally group c consisted of lands unsuitable for annual or perennial crops pasture or reforestation but still suitable for wild fauna and flora protection recreation or water storage class viii lepsch et al 2015 calegario et al 2020 notably the intensity of soil conservation and maintenance improvements increased proportionally with the class number i viii land use capacity was classified using a method proposed by rio grande do sul 1983 that provides criteria adapted to the brazilian reality the method considers soil aspects such as depth erosion risk slope drainage fertility stoniness and flood risk further details on these factors have been provided in a previous study lepsch et al 2015 fig 3 shows the crossing of information between land use capacity and intensity as described by lepsch et al 2015 in the case of the mrb land use intensity comprised only three classes wildlife protection and recreation moderate grazing and intensive cropping with simple conservation problems fig 3 this is because the basin had a limited number of land use and land cover classes to generate hrus which were used as input data for mgb iph calibration and validation then the land use and land cover classes such as riparian forest savannah urban area and water were classified as wildlife and recreation pastures as moderated grazing and agriculture as intensive cropping with simple conservation problems notably the classes of water and urban areas are not included in the land use capacity method thus we decided to consider them as underused lands and statical along within the analyses to avoid impacts on the generated scenarios having defined land use capacity classes and their intensity the number of classes above the capacity was determined and calculated using eq 12 12 n ca cl ca where nca is the number of classes above the land use capacity dimensionless cl is the class of land use capacity dimensionless and ca is the current class of land use dimensionless using eq 12 positive results overused land null or zero values rational land use and negative results underused land can be obtained however we adopted the processing method proposed by almeida 2014 which considers only positive or zero values negative values were considered null to avoid problems when determining the gpi finally the obtained results were weighted in relation to the study area to determine the gpi eq 13 table 4s supplementary material which aims to establish a value for the current land use within the basin drainage area almeida 2014 the index is divided into five ranges that vary at every interval of 0 5 ranging from 0 to 2 5 and these ranges are classified as ideal good moderate bad and worst respectively 13 g pi i 0 n a c n ca a t where ac is the corresponding land used area km2 nca is the number of classes above land use capacity dimensionless and at is the basin drainage area km2 land use and cover scenarios were set based on the current situation of the mrb using mapbiomas images from 2017 given these limits three scenarios were established focusing on maintaining indigenous and permanent preservation areas the procedure for building scenarios consisted of increasing or decreasing land use and cover intensities for each land use capacity class once the scenarios were generated the number of classes above the land use capacity was assessed with the gpi to determine the general condition of the basin as a limit point we considered a situation in which the mrb was in a bad situation based on the anthropic practices scenario 1 c1 aimed to recover areas explored with crops and pastures with native vegetation in the upper part of the basin all classes with excessive soil use were removed exchanging the growth of crops for pasture and in the remaining area of the mrb pasture was replaced with savannah vegetation which is an opposite dynamic of deforestation due to agriculture and livestock described by liniger et al 2017 scenario 2 c2 considered an increase in soil exploitation with crops and pasture to rational land use without significant changes from the use capacity system and the gpi moreover most of the soil under savannah has been replaced with well managed pastures over time lastly scenario 3 c3 considered increased soil exploitation by changing crops and pasture intensities into the category of overused land in addition as a limit point we considered the bad situation of good practices indicated by the gpi as most of the soil under savannah was replaced with crops it is worth mentioning that the riparian forests and permanently protected areas were considered constants assuming the political legal background was respected in the region a graphical representation of the built scenarios is provided in the supplementary material fig 1s supplementary material 2 5 comparison of the scenarios for the mapbiomass image of 2017 and each land use and cover scenario built new hrus were determined and the mgb iph was run again for the analysis period from the streamflow time series the maximum qmax average long term qavg and minimum q95 were calculated and compared with the base scenario in 2017 for the mrb additionally variables from the soil water balance were estimated for each scenario and their magnitudes and behavior of the time series were compared the values of qmax were associated with different return periods tr 10 20 50 subjecting the historical series of qmax values to statistical analysis then we determined the theoretical probability model with the best fit for the data series for maximum extreme events the following distribution models were tested log pearson type 3 gamma gumbel maximum extreme value type 1 and lognormal tucci 2009 to verify whether the probability distribution adhered to the maximum streamflow data kolmogorov smirnov test was used at a 20 significance level naghettini 2016 the average long term qavg streamflow was determined as the average of the arithmetic mean of all daily streamflows in the historical series matos et al 2020 minimum streamflows were associated with 95 permanence q95 and a permanence curve was constructed for this purpose all daily historical series of streamflows simulated for each gauging station and scenario were used as described by pruski et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 mgb iph calibrated parameters land use and land cover information in 2007 from the mapbiomas project highlighted that riparian forests occupy 14 9 of the basin area savannah occupies 39 3 pasture 27 5 agriculture 17 6 and the rest are water and urban areas regarding soil type acrisols occupied 1 5 cambisols 8 2 gleysols 4 2 ferrasols 41 6 entisols 22 2 and plinthosols 22 2 overlaying this information yielded 10 hrus which comprised the following classes riparian forest savanna pasture and agriculture both in shallow and deep soils as well as urban area and water classes fig 2c tables 2 and 3 show the calibrated parameters for each hru in each sub basin within the mrb in each hru the values of soil moisture storage capacity wm were the same for all sub basins these values were higher in deep soils than in shallow soils depending on their use oliveira et al 2019 moreover higher wm values were observed in deep soils under dense vegetation as in latosols in riparian forests conversely the values were lower in shallow soils under less dense vegetation as in cambisols under crops generally deep soil thickness and high vegetation density increase soil capacity to hold larger water volumes keeping them moist preventing free flow and favoring water infiltration in the soil luo et al 2020 cabral et al 2015 runoff and infiltration separation b in sub basins 1 3 and 5 lower slopes had smaller magnitudes than those in sub basins 4 and 2 this is because a relatively flat terrain influences runoff generation runoff generation was also limited by deep soil associated with latosols and plinthosols which cover most of the mrb area up to 65 3 however the sub basins with steep slopes 4 and 2 had shallow soils such as cambisols gleysols and arenosols where runoff was favored of note some parameter values such as wm and kint were consistent with those obtained by oliveira et al 2019 for an application in the same region however we made the distinction of separating the hrus according to the slope and also included a new hru called urban areas baseflows in the dry season kbas were higher in sub basins 4 and 5 than in sub basins 3 2 and 1 this was because of the predominance of hydrogeological units with greater transmissivity such as the ronuro and ponta grossa formations and the alluvial deposit infiltration is also boosted by the presence of deep soil contrarily limited infiltration in sub basins 3 2 and 1 due to shallow soils was unique owing to their lower kbas magnitudes according to moreton 2001 this is because of the araguaia formation in flat areas with low baseflow rates such as in the lower part of the mrb where bananal island is located likewise sub surface runoff control kint had only two magnitudes as this parameter depends only on soil type it was higher in deep soils than in shallow soils it is noteworthy that the sub surface runoff kint values were higher than kbas values this is because surface runoff is faster than subsurface runoff and the latter is even faster than underground runoff tucci and collischonn 2001 the parameters influencing flow delay were isolated for each sub basin table 3 surface cs and subsurface ci delays were longer in sub basins 1 3 and 5 than in the other sub basins given their lower slopes additionally the underground delay cb was pre calibrated to determine the hydrograph recession times in hours for each gauging station 3 2 mgb iph calibration and validation fig 4 shows the hydrographs of the observed and estimated streamflows in the calibration and validation periods for each gauging station and table 4 shows the indices of model performance also in section 3 2 in supplementary material table 7s is presented the mgb performance in the mrb with the land use and land cover image from the 2017 precisely the hydrographs showed systematic errors during the calibration and validation periods seasons were also adequately featured especially during the dry period nash sutcliffe efficiency indexes nse in mgb iph calibration and validation ranged from 0 77 to 0 83 and from 0 70 to 0 87 respectively this indicated that in most cases streamflows were well and properly estimated mainly for extreme events in the rainy season van liew et al 2007 tucci and collischonn 2001 gottschal et al 2001 overall lower nses were obtained by gauging stations located in the low slope sub basins the gauging station of toriqueje f5 had similar results for the mrb using the swat and wasim models with nses of 0 58 and 0 81 for calibration and 0 48 and 0 68 for validation respectively guzha et al 2014 meister et al 2017 these values are considered acceptable for estimating the daily streamflows in the upper part of the mrb nse logarithm values log nse for calibration and validation by the mgb iph ranged from 0 82 to 0 92 and from 0 81 to 0 90 respectively in most cases these values were higher than the nse values when comparing estimated and observed flows greater precision was observed in recession periods during the dry season as this objective function is more sensitive in those hydrograph periods tucci and collischonn 2001 van liew et al 2007 in general nse and log nse values are approximately 0 8 for all gauging stations in the calibration and validation periods and similar results were obtained by oliveira et al 2019 with the mgb iph for the upper teles pires basin which has the same situation as deforested savannah for agriculture and pasture purposes it appears that the distinction between land use and cover for this region into general classes such as forest pasture agriculture secondary vegetation and water bodies promotes good performance with the mgb iph kge indexes ranged from 0 74 to 0 90 and from 0 70 to 0 94 for calibration and validation respectively overall this index showed similar behavior to nse which obtains lower values at stations in flat or slightly sloped sites most nses were lower than kge values possibly because of several factors involved in nse use for example relatively high nse values can be obtained using models considered weak or poor or with poor overall fit jain and sudheer 2008 likewise a model with a high nse may not take advantage of all input information consequently owing to problems associated with the nse calculation the kge index is predominant because it is used as an objective function to assess performance in hydrological modeling gupta et al 2009 bias percentages pbias were generally lower in the calibration periods than in the validation periods the highest value was obtained from the rio pindaíba f3 station and the lowest from the santo anônio do leverger f1 station f1 stations were located on flat terrains and presented an underestimation error of 9 55 a similar result was obtained by pontes et al 2017 who reported a streamflow underestimation of 8 84 at the same gauge station notably the hydrographs in fig 4 show a considerable event of high streamflows in 2004 and it has not been fully estimated by the mgb iph this is a common behavior related to most of the hydrologic models that have difficulty in representing extreme events accurately for example in the upper part of the mrb in 1988 using wasim meister et al 2017 particularly for this event in 2004 streamflow magnitudes increased from toriqueje f5 to trecho medio f2 stations fig 4a d as expected due to the rainfall captured by the accumulated drainage area however for santo antônio do leverger f1 fig 4e the streamflow magnitudes were considerably lower than those for the other gauge stations according to valente and latrubesse 2012 f1 is located on a periodically flooded savannah araguaia floodplain or bananal island thus the presence of meanders and floodplain lakes around the f1 station see fig 3s supplementary material might be the main reason for the attenuation of the peak flow in the 2004 event lininger and latrubesse 2016 showed that floodplain lakes connect to the main river during floods and increase their area attenuating peak flows up to 30 in the araguaia floodplain and this increases the base flow during the dry season therefore the mgb iph showed difficulties in estimating streamflows in santo antônio do leverger f1 station according to pontes et al 2017 this may be because of the flow propagation module inertial used in the mgb iph which still does not appropriately represent water losses by evaporation or retention in floodplain lakes and meanders in flat areas the values in table 4 show that the model performance was similar for calibration and validation but sometimes superior for validation conversely values in other studies were mostly lower for validation than for calibration this indicates which model maintains its performance across different periods as already discussed by tucci and collischonn 2001 however notably the length of the validation period does not capture large flood events as those in the calibration period which may have a positive impact on the model performance it is worth mentioning that owing to the framework that we adopted here to divide the mrb into sub basins with different parameters for each hru table 2 we demonstrated that the mgb iph performed better than without our proposed framework generally in all gauging stations f5 to f1 streamflows were underestimated and overestimated in the dry and wet seasons respectively section 3 2 supplementary material 3 3 land use and cover scenarios regarding soil types the upper part of the mrb is mostly covered by dystrophic red latosols dystrophic red yellow latosols and arenosols occupying 21 2 19 9 and 17 6 respectively in the lower part dystrophic haplic plinthosols and dystrophic haplic plinthosols covered 19 4 and 8 1 respectively the remaining area 13 6 was covered by dystrophic red yellow acrisols eutrophic red acrisols dystrophic haplic gleysols dystrophic leptosols hydromorphic arenosols and concretionary plinthosols fig 5 shows the land use capacity classes and their spatial distributions table 5 shows the magnitude of the area for each class most of the mrb area was classified as class iv representing 88 24 of its drainage area lepsch et al 2015 reported that these lands present permanent risks or limitations that can be very severe when used for agriculture the lands located on the araguaia floodplain were classified as class viii which has flooding problems and is therefore inappropriate for cropping table 6 shows the mrb status according to the gpi resulting from the assessment of each scenario classes i and v were not observed because of the traits of the studied soils deep and well drained soils such as latosols or arenosols can be classified as class i or v but they must be in flat terrains less than 3 therefore we did not register such classes in the study area the results in table 6 indicate that for a base scenario most of the mrb 82 was within the recommended limits for land cover and land use the remaining 18 was in a good situation according to the gpi likewise the c2 magnitudes were close in terms of the drainage area and gpi furthermore to recover exploited areas the entire c1 drainage area was in ideal conditions according to the gpi this scenario does not represent any impact related to land use however c3 had an increase in drainage area 69 with two classes above the rational soil use which indicates a worse situation table 7 and fig 6 show the changes in land use and land cover conditions and spatial distributions according to the land use capacity method we also noted changes in the drainage area for each land use class and scenario in the mrb it is worth mentioning that in table 7 the hrus area for riparian forests on shallow and deep soils urban areas and water bodies 2661 km2 4 6 6193 km2 10 8 42 km2 0 1 and 269 km2 0 5 respectively were not included because no difference between scenarios was observed and the results for the remaining hrus are shown at the sub basin scale according to mapbiomas 2017 images our hru setup and summarized individual hru magnitudes from table 7 for the base scenario our results indicate land use and cover in shallow and deep soils with savannah recording 8576 and 14 493 km2 and riparian forest 2661 and 6193 km2 respectively most of these hrus are distributed in sub basins 4 2 and 1 representing more than half of the mrb drainage area 55 7 the areas occupied by pasture in shallow and deep soils were 5666 and 9377 km2 respectively and predominant in sub basins 4 3 and 2 and those related to agriculture were 2817 and 7235 km2 respectively and dominant in sub basin 5 finally urban areas and water classes occupied the remaining 311 km2 of the study area excessive soil use within the mrb mostly occurred in the upper part sub basin 5 due to agricultural land exploitation in these areas soils such as dystrophic red latosols dystrophic red yellow latosols and arenosols were identified as class iv these have several limitations when used for growing annual crops and must therefore be used for pastures they can also be good for growing occasional crops lepsch et al 2015 when comparing the base scenario with c1 soil use magnitudes were similar and only agriculture was changed with pasture mostly in the sub basin 5 thus pasture areas in shallow and deep soils increased by 2710 and 6884 km2 respectively with respect to c2 in shallow and deep soils the savannah areas were reduced by 5912 and 10 961 km2 while pasture areas increased by 5907 and 10 600 km2 respectively presenting significant changes in all sub basins but mostly in sub basins 1 and 2 in c3 savannah presented the same pattern as that in c2 wherein pasture area in shallow and deep soils was reduced by 5205 and 7680 km2 respectively and agriculture area increased by 11 117 and 18 642 km2 respectively showing significant changes in all sub basins precisely one can observe that anthropogenic uses of the soil were predominant in c2 and c3 in the mrb c1 pointed to an almost complete replacement of agriculture with pasture and farmland only in acrisols the gpi indicated that in c2 there was no considerable overuse of soil in the mrb as in the base scenario the increasing agricultural areas in c3 indicate poor conservation conditions in the mrb according to the gpi generally sub basins 1 2 and 3 were the least modified because of the presence of the largest indigenous areas and riparian forest which we maintained as a constant throughout the construction of the scenarios hence the riparian forest in sub basins 4 and 5 were in a situation that deserves attention owing to their lower area magnitudes fig 6a contrarily sub basin 5 upper part of the mrb was already dominated by agriculture sub basins 4 3 and 2 middle part of the mrb was predominated by pasture and in general sub basin 1 lower part of the mrb had the most native vegetation in relation to the base scenario the gpi indicates that the general situation in the mrb in 2017 can be considered good however according to almeida 2014 the gpi is limited to identifying the real effect of a small area of high density of soil exploration in a large scale basin because the index does not consider the spatial distribution of the number of classes above the soil use capacity this was observed in the mrb mainly in the upper part which represents a small area and a low risk of the total drainage area of the basin the latter is a potential risk due to stream water reduction owing to water withdrawal accumulation zeilhofer and klemp 2011 identified central irrigation pivots in the upper part of the mrb and in 2017 ghellere 2019 reported that 96 of water withdrawals were made in the same zone in general 79 of the water demand within the basin is related to irrigation purposes liniger et al 2017 such changes can increase runoff sediment transport and generation and organic matter losses dionizio et al 2020 favored by the condition of the slope of the terrain kogo et al 2020 moreover alewell et al 2020 have proven on a worldwide scale that erosion leads to massive losses of soil phosphorus which threatens agricultural production as a result farmers have been forced to use cultivation alternatives that are adaptable to current nutritional availability thus runoff generation and concentration of agricultural activities in the upper part of the mrb increase the risk of water contamination owing to pesticide use zeilhofer et al 2016 however schindewolf et al 2014 reported that some erosion prevention practices were carried out in the mrb but were not efficient enough it is clear that the upper part of the mrb represents a potential risk for quantity and quality of water in addition according to the base scenarios few spots of agriculture are expanding in the middle part of the basin fig 6a most of the land is classified as iv according to the land use capacity indicating that problems from sub basin 5 can be replicated in sub basins 4 3 and 2 thus planning actions for sustainable agriculture will be necessary 3 4 land use and land cover scenario impacts upon hydrological modeling tables 8 10 show the minimum q95 maximum qmax and long term qavg streamflows respectively which were obtained from the assessed scenarios using the mgb iph in the mrb the results show the percentage of change between each scenario built with respect to the base scenario fig 7 shows the behaviors and trends of streamflow permanence curves summarized in the santo antônio do leverger f1 station as the outlet of the mrb moreover for clarity fig 7b summarizes the behaviors of the minimum q95 maximum qmax and long term qavg streamflows complementing the impacts of changes in land use and land cover seasonal variations in et superficial infiltration and underground recharge were included in each evaluated scenario table 11 and figs 4s and 5s in supplementary material qmax in c1 showed differences with small magnitudes compared with streamflows in the base scenario this is because of few changes made in the study area sub basins 1 4 and was related to the replacement of agriculture with pasture in soils considered overused the upper part of the mrb sub basin 5 showed higher magnitudes in streamflow f5 which decreased in the middle and lower parts of the basin in a downstream order the qavg streamflows showed similar behavior to qmax but with higher magnitudes of the change percentage finally for the q95 streamflow in c1 an increase was observed at every gauge station following the same trend as qmax and qavg the effects of c1 in streamflows were mainly present in the upper part of the mrb sub basin 5 which underwent major changes in land use and cover in other words owing to the decrease in rainfall interception and subsequently reduced et taxes antecedent soil moisture was increased and soil storage capacity was consequently decreased brown et al 2005 leading to better scenarios for runoff generation in maximum events and average streamflow during the rainy season guimberteau et al 2017 wijesekara et al 2012 however et taxes in other sub basins 2 and 4 showed higher changes not following a proportional increase in maximum streamflows which indicates that many other variables have a high influence such as altitude slope soil depth and precipitation gradient in the mrb observed from the upper to the lower part of the basin with 1800 and 1500 mm of average annual precipitation respectively fig 6s supplementary material viglione et al 2016 argued that it becomes more difficult to identify the effect of land use and cover on floods when the spatial scale of analyses increases because controlling factors and process interactions also increase according to rogger et al 2017 the nonlinearity of runoff generation at large basin scales and non stationarities induced by land use and cover changes must be better understood with respect to the q95 in sub basin 5 which is also highly influenced by the change in land use and cover most of the agriculture land was changed to pastures with lower lai magnitude decreasing the et and rain interception during the rainy season therefore increasing infiltration and recharge magnitudes which increases water availability during the dry season in c2 all gauging stations showed significant increases in qmax qavg and q95 streamflow magnitudes because of the replacement of soil use mainly with pasture along the mrb significantly sub basin 5 showed minor increases in streamflows due to less changes in land use and cover nonetheless sub basins 4 1 experienced a high loss of savannah vegetation like the c1 scenario with lai and height vegetation reduction and albedo increase leading to et and rainfall interception decrease and favoring infiltration and subsequently groundwater recharge baker and miller 2013 notably pasture was considered to be well managed over time to decrease uncertainties about pasture degradation it affects soil cover as well as groundwater recharges in the short term lai fluctuations due to grazing bresloff et al 2013 and impacts of switching from native forest to pasture costa et al 2003 have similar impacts such as a considerable reduction in et and hence increases in streamflows moreover in a study conducted by dias et al 2015 in the upper xingu river within the savannah biome similar behavior was observed when native vegetation was changed to pasture causing reductions in the mean annual et and increasing mean annual streamflow the qmax and qavg streamflows in c3 showed similar behaviors to those in c2 but with smaller magnitudes moreover replacing land use and cover with agriculture in most of the drainage areas tended to decrease q95 streamflow in most of the gauge stations replacement by agriculture decreases the et taxes in the dry season owing to the lower albedo associated with pasture however et increases due to lower vegetation height concerning the savannah vegetation reducing air resistance which is inversely proportional to et fluxes notably for the rainy season et is equal to the et base scenario and for the dry season it is lower which is because of the lai variation throughout the year these behaviors under similar conditions of streamflow changes due to land use and cover changes were observed in a study conducted by pereira et al 2016 wherein the minimum streamflow decreased by 2 7 in the pomba river basin additionally abe et al 2018 reported a reduction in the minimum streamflow owing to amazonian deforestation in the tapajós basin notably sub basin 3 showed a lower increase in q95 which might be because of the highest changes in land use and cover into cultures compared with the rest of the sub basins almost 90 of the area was covered by agriculture for sub basin 4 even if most of the land use was changed by agriculture it preserved most of its savannah vegetation due to the preserved area within the sub basin the combination of many influencing variables and the non linearity in the responses of runoff generation leads to complexities and the masking of variables that have the major influence on minimum streamflow changes owing to land use cover as revealed by tucci and clarke 1997 who considered many minor basins in their analyses certain behaviors about vegetation loss and runoff behavior were observed however those behaviors may vary in larger basins due to the non linearity runoff process and the heterogeneity of characteristics along the basin notably for c3 changing riparian forests with irrigated agricultural areas exposes the soil to a critical situation of topsoil layer compaction due to heavy machinery decreasing infiltration rogger et al 2017 and erosion susceptibility dionizio et al 2020 moreover this is a real situation in the upper part of the basin which tends to favor sediment losses that are more frequent in this scenario than in undisturbed natural soils cerdà et al 2009 moreover as previously mentioned in the mrb some erosion prevention practices were adopted but these could be improved for greater efficiency schindewolf et al 2014 however according to gomes et al 2019 agricultural expansion in the savannah brazilian cerrado is increasing resulting in agricultural productivity decreases and soil nutrient depletion which indicates that government policies should focus on sustainable soil use practices moreover according to twine et al 2004 little is known about the hydrological effects of switching from pasture to agriculture generally considering f1 as the mrb outlet the greatest impacts on qmax streamflows were caused by c2 12 36 tr 10 followed by c3 8 58 tr 10 and c1 1 17 tr 10 the qavg streamflows exhibited similar behavior with the largest increases in c2 10 05 c3 5 64 and c1 1 76 the q95 increased in c3 and c2 by 3 28 and 2 61 respectively however in c3 q95 was reduced by 0 72 pereira et al 2016 observed similar effects for c3 in the rio pomba basin using the swat model they noted that in a scenario of agricultural expansion maximum and average streamflows increased by 3 and 1 4 respectively additionally näschen et al 2019 reported a decrease in low flow by 6 due to an agricultural expansion scenario over the savannah in the rufiji river basin tanzania for c2 a replacement of 57 of the riparian forest with pasture caused an increase in average streamflow by 6 5 in the xingu river basin santos et al 2018 similar to our results with 55 replacement by pasture table 7 in c1 agricultural replacement with caatinga like savannah in the mandaú river basin decreased the runoff generated provoking more infiltration which favors low flow in the dry season andrade et al 2017 overall native forest removal in tropical basins reduces rain interception and et while increasing maximum and average streamflows during the rainy season guimberteau et al 2017 wijesekara et al 2012 additionally according to etehadi abari et al 2017 due to forest harvesting the canopy cover is reduced and the average surface runoff volume and sediment transport are increased moreover c2 mainly pasture had the lowest lai followed by c3 mainly agriculture and finally c1 a combination of pasture with savannah and riparian rainforest we observed that the conjugation of many variables responds differently owing to the basin scale which makes it difficult to identify which variables are responsible for the major changes in streamflow related to land use and land cover moreover for average streamflow it was less complex to identify which variables had major influences on streamflow changes compared with the maximum and minimum streamflow 4 conclusions in this study the mgb iph was calibrated and validated for the study period between 2000 and 2014 for the mrb located in the brazilian savannah biome additionally we assessed streamflow changes due to some land use and cover scenarios constructed according to the land use capacity of the basin after calibration and validation even with certain limitations in representing some physical processes in flat areas the mgb iph performance was considered good and suitable for estimating daily streamflows over the analyzed period providing a tool for management and planning for decision making in the mrb related to water forecasting in a constantly changing environment the analysis of land use capacity in the mrb revealed overused soils in the upper part of the basin owing to agriculture which could be replicated in the middle part of the basin thus planning actions for sustainable agriculture are necessary along the basin moreover the scenarios constructed using a land use capacity system exhibited different behaviors in streamflow magnitudes scenarios c3 and c2 which simulated agriculture and pasture in most of the drainage areas in the mrb respectively indicated that these options have the greatest negative impacts on human development because of their increased risk of flooding and increases in the maximum streamflows as well as reduction in the minimum q95 streamflow however scenario c1 which simulated riparian forest recovery and agriculture to pasture changes was the most favorable option reducing maximum streamflows and increasing average and minimum q95 streamflows such hydrological modeling allows us to better understand changes in water cycles due to anthropic activities providing strategies for planning and management of threatened brazilian biomes aimed at water security and

8087,study region the study was conducted in the mortes river basin mrb mato grosso state brazil owing to the constant removal of native forest brazilian savannah popularly known as cerrado for agriculture and pasture purposes study focus the hydrological model for large basins mgb iph was employed to assess the hydrological impacts due to land use and land cover scenarios three scenarios were built according to the soil use capacity in the mrb c1 savannah recovery and agriculture removal by pasture areas c2 pasture expansion and c3 agriculture expansion new hydrological insights for the region in general the c2 and c3 results show an increase in water availability however c2 increases flood risk and c3 tends to worsen drought these extreme configurations of land use and land cover reveal poor water distribution throughout the year however c1 provided the most favorable results increasing water availability during the dry season without increasing flood risk the results highlight that anthropic activities already dominate the upper middle and lower parts of the basin representing a risk for sustainable land use our hydrological modeling results demonstrated strategies for planning and management to avoid critical scenarios of lack of water in the mrb due to the intensity of soil use beyond its capacity keywords soil use capacity hydrologic modeling deforestation 1 introduction continuous land use and cover changes add complexity to the analysis of the phenomena involved in hydrological cycles worldwide with many environmental responses depending on the type of biome and their characteristics these changes can alter the biodiversity in different ways depending on the type of biome and their region garcía vega and newbold 2019 the fao 2006 has elucidated in hydrological terms the impacts of native forest to pasture conversion on local water cycle decreasing infiltration rate and increasing runoff due to soil compaction by animal trampling thereby increasing risks of erosion and organic matter losses dionizio et al 2020 global deforestation tendencies have exacerbated these negative impacts however the 1970s policies have driven increased agriculture practices into the mato grosso state higa and moreno 2009 trigueiro et al 2020 revealed some drivers that favor the savannah biome also known as cerrado deforestation and according to inpe 2021 this biome had suffered 46 781 92 km2 of forest loss until 2020 currently brazilian agricultural areas consist of 45 savannah bolfe et al 2020 and without adequate planning of land use and water resource management the high potential of its increase will impact the local hydrological cycle the construction of land use and land cover scenarios based on the land use capacity and its consequences on the streamflow of water courses can generate important information for public and private managers to formulate soil and water conservation actions linked to sustainable agricultural production because of savannah s importance for food production and environmental conservation we selected the mortes river basin mrb in mato grosso state brazil as the study area this basin has some savannah characteristics from the broader region that is it still has native vegetation consisting of riparian forest also known as cerradão indigenous lands gomide and kawakubo 2005 and conservation units unb 2016 as well as areas used for agriculture and livestock purposes which led to its consideration as a pilot basin for research to better understand this issue hydrological modeling has been applied to forecast streamflow magnitudes in areas under land use changes for reservoir management flood mitigation hydraulic infrastructure projects water quality and quantity and sediment production sarkar and kumar 2012 ni et al 2021 serrão et al 2021 however hydrological models differ in spatial distribution time and spatial scale and structure sitterson et al 2017 devia et al 2015 pechlivanidis et al 2011 some of the most commonly used models are the hec hms sms 2d mike she soil and water assessment tool swat and model for large basins mgb iph among others junior et al 2015 abbott et al 1986 tucci and collischonn 2001 many studies have proven the capabilities of the mgb iph it is an open source code and employs fewer parameters than other hydrological models making their use more friendly see section 2 2 for more mgb iph details additionally it can properly represent streamflow propagation under delay conditions and wave flooding attenuation in low slope areas paiva et al 2012 can use calibrated parameters from other basins with similar characteristics collischonn et al 2007 and can be applied in large drainage areas such as the amazon river basin paiva et al 2013 fan and collischonn 2014 and it has been used in risk mitigation in dams junior et al 2016 moreover as a distributed model it allows the characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of variables that is the model can be used to assess streamflow changes due to climate changes quedi and fan 2020 and land use and land cover pereira et al 2013 lin et al 2007 assessed soil practices with hydrological modeling anticipating potential impacts on hydrological components due to land use and land cover changes similarly shirmohammadi et al 2020 built land use and land cover scenarios through the probability of land use occurrence and showed pathways for integrated management of urmia lake according to sustainable land use according to calegario et al 2020 land use capacity must be understood as the intensity with which the land must be used in ways that ensure no loss in agricultural production and increased soil erosion the methodology proposed for this study was adapted from the land use capacity system proposed by lepsch et al 2015 which consists of a scenario construction that considers land use capacity and criteria related to its agricultural suitability for soils in the brazilian territory based on the determination of the classes of land use capacity it is possible to make an overlay with the current coverage allowing the identification of regions of the basin with inappropriate land use these areas require interventions and must be prioritized in programs for the recovery of degraded areas additionally this study addresses one of the main questions in the current hydrology literature what are the impacts of land cover changes and soil disturbances on land surface water and energy fluxes and on the resulting groundwater recharge blöschl et al 2019 demonstrating that land use and cover changes are complex the study also addresses some sustainable development goals such as clean water and sanitation sdg no 6 and life on land sdg no 15 united nations 2020 thus the study objective was to simulate scenarios of land use and land cover based on the criteria of the land use capacity model lepsch et al 2015 and to evaluate its impacts on streamflows in the mrb using the mgb iph 2 material and methods the methodological process comprised three main stages the first stage consisted of calibration and validation of the mgb iph from 2000 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2014 respectively this stage followed the three steps proposed by fan and collischonn 2014 a spatial data pre processing wherein physical and topological information is summarized and compiled b input processing by obtaining analyzing and preparing hydroclimatic data and c model calibration and validation notably the mgb iph was calibrated and validated using a land use and cover image equivalent to half of the study period 2007 following the suggestion by alves et al 2020 on mgb iph the second main stage involved the construction of land use and land cover scenarios in the mrb using the land use capacity method proposed by the united states department of agriculture soil conservation service klingebiel and montgomery 1961 modified by lepsch et al 2015 for the brazilian context incorporating the good practice index gpi described by almeida 2014 finally the third main stage involved assessment of the scenarios generated using the mgb iph to conduct the evaluation we compared the maximum max average long term alt and minimum q95 streamflow values obtained for each scenario with the simulated streamflow in 2017 the impact of these scenarios was compared to the current situation of the basin in terms of land use and cover indeed according to the inpe 2021 approximately 14 778 km2 of the savannah biome has been cleared since 2007 our reference year for the calibration and validation of the model 2 1 study area mrb fig 1 which is located in mato grosso state brazil was selected as the study area the mortes river is the main tributary of the left side of the araguaia river which is the fourth largest basin in brazil gomes and fernandes 2017 ho et al 2016 we considered the outlet basin as the gauging station of santo antônio do leverger f1 26300000 with 57 343 km2 of drainage area the mortes river originates in the serra são lourenço campo verde county and flows into the araguaia river on bananal island which is a seasonal floodplain of 88 119 km2 area and is mainly formed by quaternary sediments irion et al 2016 valente and latrubesse 2012 the climate is aw class köppen s classification which refers to a tropical climate with dry winters and rainy summers alvares et al 2013 the rainy season lasts from october to april and the dry season from may to september prada and marinho filho 2004 with average annual rainfall ranging from 1200 to 2000 mm arvor et al 2012 2 2 mgb iph description the mgb iph was developed by the instituto de pesquisas hidraulicas in the federal university of rio grande do sul brazil it works on large scale basins and as a distributed model it is divided into mini basins which are composed of small homogeneous areas called hydrological response units hrus which are commonly the result of the type of soil and land use and cover combinations haghnegahdar et al 2015 according to tucci and collischonn 2001 the structure is composed of three main modules the first calculates the soil water balance eq 1 on one layer of soil 1 dw dt p et d sup d int d bas where w mm is the water storage in the soil layer p mm δt 1 is the rainfall that reaches the soil et mm δt 1 is the evapotranspiration et from the soil dsup mm δt 1 is the surface runoff dint mm δt 1 is the subsurface flow and dbas mm δt 1 is the percolation to the groundwater reservoir infiltration and runoff dsup were calculated using the arno model todini 1996 subsurface runoff dint was calculated using the brooks and corey unsaturated hydraulic conductivity equation rawls et al 1993 and the percolation from the soil layer to groundwater dbas was calculated based on the linear relationship between the moisture content in the soil and their maximum storage capacity in the second module the generated runoff was guided to the nearest river stretches using three linear reservoir systems base sub superficial and superficial flow collischonn et al 2007 et eq 2 was estimated using the penman monteith equation shuttleworth 1993 2 e t δ a ρ a c p d r a δ γ 1 r s r a 1 λ ρ w where λ mj kg 1 is the latent heat of vaporization δ kpa c 1 is the gradient of the saturated vapor pressure function a mj m 2 s 1 is the available energy ρa kg m 3 is the density of air ρw kg m 3 is the specific mass of water cp mj kg 1 c 1 is the specific heat of moist air d kpa is the vapor pressure deficit γ kpa c 1 is the psychrometric constant rs s m 1 is the surface resistance of the land cover and ra s m 1 is the aerodynamic resistance the last module calculates the streamflow propagation in the hydrographic network using the inertial method which is a simplification of the saint venant equations eqs 3 and 4 fan and collischonn 2014 3 a t q x 0 4 q t q 2 a x ga h x ga s 0 ga s f where q is the flow m3 s 1 a is the cross sectional area of the flow m2 x is the longitudinal distance m t is time s q is the flow per unit width m2 s 1 h is the river depth m s 0 is the bottom slope m m 1 s f is the water surface slope m m 1 and g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 disregarding the first term of eq 4 dynamic equation considering the river has a rectangular cross section with width b then a bxh and the value of sf can be estimated by manning s empirical equation as shown in eq 5 the dynamic equation can be simplified as eq 6 5 s f q q n 2 a 2 r 4 3 6 q t g b h y x g b h q q n 2 b h 2 r 4 3 0 where q is the streamflow m3 s 1 a is the section area m2 r is the hydraulic radius m n is the manning roughness coefficient m 1 3 s b is the river width m and h is the river depth m finally the hydraulic radius r is considered equal to the depth h which is reasonable for natural channels which are much wider than deep therefore eq 6 can be expressed as modified and written as 7 q t g b h y x g q q n 2 h 7 3 0

input database digital elevation model from the shuttle radar topography mission available from the united states geological survey website http earthexplorer usgs gov was used to delineate the mrb drainage area fig 1 and to define the slope classes fig 2e soil type and groundwater units were obtained from the empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecuária https www embrapa br tema solos brasileiros solos do brasil and the serviço geologico do brasil http www cprm gov br publique hidrologia estudos hidrologicos e hidrogeologicos mapa hidrogeologico do brasil ao milionesimo 756 html both with a spatial scale of 1 5 000 000 embrapa 2011 the land use and cover classification 2007 of the mapbiomas project was also used it classifies different biomes amazon rainforest atlantic forest caatinga savannah pampa and pantanal and thematic classes pasture agriculture forest plantation coastal areas planning and urban areas in the brazilian territory souza 2020 then hrus were generated fig 2c by combining soil type land use and land cover maps fig 2a and d it is worth mentioning that the mapbiomas classification was reduced into five classes riparian forest savannah pasture agriculture urban areas and water because the mgb iph supports up to 12 hrus and the combination of these classes with soil depths deep or shallow resulted in only 10 hrus furthermore the study area was divided into five sub basins fig 1 and we decided to set their outlets considering the spatial heterogeneity of variables as slope fig 2e altitude fig 2f hydrogeological units fig 2b hrus fig 2c and gauging station proximities for example for sub basin 5 most of the area is covered by agriculture on a deep soil with a low slope 0 4 in contrast in sub basin 4 the agriculture in the deep soil has a higher slope higher runoff thus it was necessary to distinguish this with different magnitudes of parameter b separation of infiltration and runoff the latter is used to improve the performance of the model in every gauging station used as a reference because the streamflow propagation module used by the mgb iph mentioned in section 2 2 has difficulties in flat areas pontes et al 2017 to evaluate the benefit of this approach we compared our results with the results of a simulation with calibrated parameters without subdividing the mrb and thus using the same parameters for all hrus the overall performance of the model without our framework is inferior to that obtained in this study section 3 2 supplementary material 2 3 1 2 input processing daily records were used as the input data for the mgb iph the data were gathered from 30 rainfall stations five climatological stations and five gauging stations table 1s supplementary material fig 1 missing rainfall data 5 on average for all stations were completed using the trmm data rozante et al 2010 cassalho et al 2020 and the climate and rainfall series were interpolated to the mini basin geometric centroids through the inverse square distance method pontes et al 2017 historical data were obtained from the national water agency ana 2005 and the national meteorology institute inmet 1992 moreover the mgb iph requires fixed parameters table 2s supplementary material for different land uses and covers i e albedo leaf area index tree height and surface resistance which were obtained from different sources bravo 2008 giongo and vettorazzi 2014 ruhoff et al 2013 2 3 2 mgb iph calibration and validation parameters and indexes the mgb iph was calibrated using data from 01 01 2000 12 31 2010 totaling 11 years of data as mentioned earlier according to the mgb iph author recommendations we used land use and cover images for half the study period 2007 including calibration and validation processes 2000 2014 calibration was manually performed trial and error according to the method described by tucci and collischonn 2003 this aimed to represent changes in the slope in each sub basin from upstream to downstream therefore the calibration sequence included sub basins 5 4 3 2 and 1 fig 1 according to the criteria provided by tucci and collischonn 2001 and oliveira et al 2019 as shown in table 1 the mgb iph was validated using data from 01 01 2011 12 31 2014 totaling 4 years of data therefore validation ceased owing to a lack of recent hydrological data for the mrb model accuracy was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index eq 8 nse logarithm log nse eq 9 nash and sutcliffe 1970 kling gupta efficiency kge eq 10 paiva et al 2012 and bias percentage eq 11 tucci 1998 8 nse 1 σ i

is the observed streamflow n is the number of values in the sample α is the reason for the variation between simulated and observed streamflows β is the reason for the average between simulated and observed streamflows and r is the correlation between simulated and observed streamflows the nse and log nse indexes have a maximum value of 1 which corresponds to a perfect fit between the estimated and observed streamflows these indices show sensitivity to errors in the maximum and minimum streamflows respectively therefore when the indices are close to 1 the mgb iph estimations have a good fit for the observed data for both floods and droughts model performance is considered adequate and good if the value of nse or log nse is higher than 0 75 and it is considered acceptable if the value is between 0 36 and 0 75 gottschal et al 2001 the kge index was used to detect problems related to nse as described by gupta et al 2009 finally the bias percentage pbias has neither a maximum nor a minimum value and is not influenced by floods or droughts differently its value only expresses the relative difference between the sum of all estimated and observed streamflows 2 4 land use and cover scenarios land use capacity is a technical interpretative classification used in the management of soil conservation practices such classification considers different soil traits and properties to obtain homogeneous land classes and thus defines its maximum use capacity without degradation risk lepsch et al 2015 pruski et al 2006 calegario et al 2020 in this system only two categories were used to classify land use capacity given the limited detailing of the spatial information used the first category was divided into use capacity groups a b and c according to land use intensity whereas the second category comprised use capacity classes from i to viii based on the degree of limited use table 3s supplementary material in the first category group a included lands that are likely to be cropped with annual or perennial crops pasture and or reforestation and fauna protection classes i iv group b comprised land unsuitable for intensive farming but still adapted for pasture and or reforestation and wild fauna protection classes v vii finally group c consisted of lands unsuitable for annual or perennial crops pasture or reforestation but still suitable for wild fauna and flora protection recreation or water storage class viii lepsch et al 2015 calegario et al 2020 notably the intensity of soil conservation and maintenance improvements increased proportionally with the class number i viii land use capacity was classified using a method proposed by rio grande do sul 1983 that provides criteria adapted to the brazilian reality the method considers soil aspects such as depth erosion risk slope drainage fertility stoniness and flood risk further details on these factors have been provided in a previous study lepsch et al 2015 fig 3 shows the crossing of information between land use capacity and intensity as described by lepsch et al 2015 in the case of the mrb land use intensity comprised only three classes wildlife protection and recreation moderate grazing and intensive cropping with simple conservation problems fig 3 this is because the basin had a limited number of land use and land cover classes to generate hrus which were used as input data for mgb iph calibration and validation then the land use and land cover classes such as riparian forest savannah urban area and water were classified as wildlife and recreation pastures as moderated grazing and agriculture as intensive cropping with simple conservation problems notably the classes of water and urban areas are not included in the land use capacity method thus we decided to consider them as underused lands and statical along within the analyses to avoid impacts on the generated scenarios having defined land use capacity classes and their intensity the number of classes above the capacity was determined and calculated using eq 12 12 n ca cl ca where nca is the number of classes above the land use capacity dimensionless cl is the class of land use capacity dimensionless and ca is the current class of land use dimensionless using eq 12 positive results overused land null or zero values rational land use and negative results underused land can be obtained however we adopted the processing method proposed by almeida 2014 which considers only positive or zero values negative values were considered null to avoid problems when determining the gpi finally the obtained results were weighted in relation to the study area to determine the gpi eq 13 table 4s supplementary material which aims to establish a value for the current land use within the basin drainage area almeida 2014 the index is divided into five ranges that vary at every interval of 0 5 ranging from 0 to 2 5 and these ranges are classified as ideal good moderate bad and worst respectively 13 g pi i 0 n a c n ca a t where ac is the corresponding land used area km2 nca is the number of classes above land use capacity dimensionless and at is the basin drainage area km2 land use and cover scenarios were set based on the current situation of the mrb using mapbiomas images from 2017 given these limits three scenarios were established focusing on maintaining indigenous and permanent preservation areas the procedure for building scenarios consisted of increasing or decreasing land use and cover intensities for each land use capacity class once the scenarios were generated the number of classes above the land use capacity was assessed with the gpi to determine the general condition of the basin as a limit point we considered a situation in which the mrb was in a bad situation based on the anthropic practices scenario 1 c1 aimed to recover areas explored with crops and pastures with native vegetation in the upper part of the basin all classes with excessive soil use were removed exchanging the growth of crops for pasture and in the remaining area of the mrb pasture was replaced with savannah vegetation which is an opposite dynamic of deforestation due to agriculture and livestock described by liniger et al 2017 scenario 2 c2 considered an increase in soil exploitation with crops and pasture to rational land use without significant changes from the use capacity system and the gpi moreover most of the soil under savannah has been replaced with well managed pastures over time lastly scenario 3 c3 considered increased soil exploitation by changing crops and pasture intensities into the category of overused land in addition as a limit point we considered the bad situation of good practices indicated by the gpi as most of the soil under savannah was replaced with crops it is worth mentioning that the riparian forests and permanently protected areas were considered constants assuming the political legal background was respected in the region a graphical representation of the built scenarios is provided in the supplementary material fig 1s supplementary material 2 5 comparison of the scenarios for the mapbiomass image of 2017 and each land use and cover scenario built new hrus were determined and the mgb iph was run again for the analysis period from the streamflow time series the maximum qmax average long term qavg and minimum q95 were calculated and compared with the base scenario in 2017 for the mrb additionally variables from the soil water balance were estimated for each scenario and their magnitudes and behavior of the time series were compared the values of qmax were associated with different return periods tr 10 20 50 subjecting the historical series of qmax values to statistical analysis then we determined the theoretical probability model with the best fit for the data series for maximum extreme events the following distribution models were tested log pearson type 3 gamma gumbel maximum extreme value type 1 and lognormal tucci 2009 to verify whether the probability distribution adhered to the maximum streamflow data kolmogorov smirnov test was used at a 20 significance level naghettini 2016 the average long term qavg streamflow was determined as the average of the arithmetic mean of all daily streamflows in the historical series matos et al 2020 minimum streamflows were associated with 95 permanence q95 and a permanence curve was constructed for this purpose all daily historical series of streamflows simulated for each gauging station and scenario were used as described by pruski et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 mgb iph calibrated parameters land use and land cover information in 2007 from the mapbiomas project highlighted that riparian forests occupy 14 9 of the basin area savannah occupies 39 3 pasture 27 5 agriculture 17 6 and the rest are water and urban areas regarding soil type acrisols occupied 1 5 cambisols 8 2 gleysols 4 2 ferrasols 41 6 entisols 22 2 and plinthosols 22 2 overlaying this information yielded 10 hrus which comprised the following classes riparian forest savanna pasture and agriculture both in shallow and deep soils as well as urban area and water classes fig 2c tables 2 and 3 show the calibrated parameters for each hru in each sub basin within the mrb in each hru the values of soil moisture storage capacity wm were the same for all sub basins these values were higher in deep soils than in shallow soils depending on their use oliveira et al 2019 moreover higher wm values were observed in deep soils under dense vegetation as in latosols in riparian forests conversely the values were lower in shallow soils under less dense vegetation as in cambisols under crops generally deep soil thickness and high vegetation density increase soil capacity to hold larger water volumes keeping them moist preventing free flow and favoring water infiltration in the soil luo et al 2020 cabral et al 2015 runoff and infiltration separation b in sub basins 1 3 and 5 lower slopes had smaller magnitudes than those in sub basins 4 and 2 this is because a relatively flat terrain influences runoff generation runoff generation was also limited by deep soil associated with latosols and plinthosols which cover most of the mrb area up to 65 3 however the sub basins with steep slopes 4 and 2 had shallow soils such as cambisols gleysols and arenosols where runoff was favored of note some parameter values such as wm and kint were consistent with those obtained by oliveira et al 2019 for an application in the same region however we made the distinction of separating the hrus according to the slope and also included a new hru called urban areas baseflows in the dry season kbas were higher in sub basins 4 and 5 than in sub basins 3 2 and 1 this was because of the predominance of hydrogeological units with greater transmissivity such as the ronuro and ponta grossa formations and the alluvial deposit infiltration is also boosted by the presence of deep soil contrarily limited infiltration in sub basins 3 2 and 1 due to shallow soils was unique owing to their lower kbas magnitudes according to moreton 2001 this is because of the araguaia formation in flat areas with low baseflow rates such as in the lower part of the mrb where bananal island is located likewise sub surface runoff control kint had only two magnitudes as this parameter depends only on soil type it was higher in deep soils than in shallow soils it is noteworthy that the sub surface runoff kint values were higher than kbas values this is because surface runoff is faster than subsurface runoff and the latter is even faster than underground runoff tucci and collischonn 2001 the parameters influencing flow delay were isolated for each sub basin table 3 surface cs and subsurface ci delays were longer in sub basins 1 3 and 5 than in the other sub basins given their lower slopes additionally the underground delay cb was pre calibrated to determine the hydrograph recession times in hours for each gauging station 3 2 mgb iph calibration and validation fig 4 shows the hydrographs of the observed and estimated streamflows in the calibration and validation periods for each gauging station and table 4 shows the indices of model performance also in section 3 2 in supplementary material table 7s is presented the mgb performance in the mrb with the land use and land cover image from the 2017 precisely the hydrographs showed systematic errors during the calibration and validation periods seasons were also adequately featured especially during the dry period nash sutcliffe efficiency indexes nse in mgb iph calibration and validation ranged from 0 77 to 0 83 and from 0 70 to 0 87 respectively this indicated that in most cases streamflows were well and properly estimated mainly for extreme events in the rainy season van liew et al 2007 tucci and collischonn 2001 gottschal et al 2001 overall lower nses were obtained by gauging stations located in the low slope sub basins the gauging station of toriqueje f5 had similar results for the mrb using the swat and wasim models with nses of 0 58 and 0 81 for calibration and 0 48 and 0 68 for validation respectively guzha et al 2014 meister et al 2017 these values are considered acceptable for estimating the daily streamflows in the upper part of the mrb nse logarithm values log nse for calibration and validation by the mgb iph ranged from 0 82 to 0 92 and from 0 81 to 0 90 respectively in most cases these values were higher than the nse values when comparing estimated and observed flows greater precision was observed in recession periods during the dry season as this objective function is more sensitive in those hydrograph periods tucci and collischonn 2001 van liew et al 2007 in general nse and log nse values are approximately 0 8 for all gauging stations in the calibration and validation periods and similar results were obtained by oliveira et al 2019 with the mgb iph for the upper teles pires basin which has the same situation as deforested savannah for agriculture and pasture purposes it appears that the distinction between land use and cover for this region into general classes such as forest pasture agriculture secondary vegetation and water bodies promotes good performance with the mgb iph kge indexes ranged from 0 74 to 0 90 and from 0 70 to 0 94 for calibration and validation respectively overall this index showed similar behavior to nse which obtains lower values at stations in flat or slightly sloped sites most nses were lower than kge values possibly because of several factors involved in nse use for example relatively high nse values can be obtained using models considered weak or poor or with poor overall fit jain and sudheer 2008 likewise a model with a high nse may not take advantage of all input information consequently owing to problems associated with the nse calculation the kge index is predominant because it is used as an objective function to assess performance in hydrological modeling gupta et al 2009 bias percentages pbias were generally lower in the calibration periods than in the validation periods the highest value was obtained from the rio pindaíba f3 station and the lowest from the santo anônio do leverger f1 station f1 stations were located on flat terrains and presented an underestimation error of 9 55 a similar result was obtained by pontes et al 2017 who reported a streamflow underestimation of 8 84 at the same gauge station notably the hydrographs in fig 4 show a considerable event of high streamflows in 2004 and it has not been fully estimated by the mgb iph this is a common behavior related to most of the hydrologic models that have difficulty in representing extreme events accurately for example in the upper part of the mrb in 1988 using wasim meister et al 2017 particularly for this event in 2004 streamflow magnitudes increased from toriqueje f5 to trecho medio f2 stations fig 4a d as expected due to the rainfall captured by the accumulated drainage area however for santo antônio do leverger f1 fig 4e the streamflow magnitudes were considerably lower than those for the other gauge stations according to valente and latrubesse 2012 f1 is located on a periodically flooded savannah araguaia floodplain or bananal island thus the presence of meanders and floodplain lakes around the f1 station see fig 3s supplementary material might be the main reason for the attenuation of the peak flow in the 2004 event lininger and latrubesse 2016 showed that floodplain lakes connect to the main river during floods and increase their area attenuating peak flows up to 30 in the araguaia floodplain and this increases the base flow during the dry season therefore the mgb iph showed difficulties in estimating streamflows in santo antônio do leverger f1 station according to pontes et al 2017 this may be because of the flow propagation module inertial used in the mgb iph which still does not appropriately represent water losses by evaporation or retention in floodplain lakes and meanders in flat areas the values in table 4 show that the model performance was similar for calibration and validation but sometimes superior for validation conversely values in other studies were mostly lower for validation than for calibration this indicates which model maintains its performance across different periods as already discussed by tucci and collischonn 2001 however notably the length of the validation period does not capture large flood events as those in the calibration period which may have a positive impact on the model performance it is worth mentioning that owing to the framework that we adopted here to divide the mrb into sub basins with different parameters for each hru table 2 we demonstrated that the mgb iph performed better than without our proposed framework generally in all gauging stations f5 to f1 streamflows were underestimated and overestimated in the dry and wet seasons respectively section 3 2 supplementary material 3 3 land use and cover scenarios regarding soil types the upper part of the mrb is mostly covered by dystrophic red latosols dystrophic red yellow latosols and arenosols occupying 21 2 19 9 and 17 6 respectively in the lower part dystrophic haplic plinthosols and dystrophic haplic plinthosols covered 19 4 and 8 1 respectively the remaining area 13 6 was covered by dystrophic red yellow acrisols eutrophic red acrisols dystrophic haplic gleysols dystrophic leptosols hydromorphic arenosols and concretionary plinthosols fig 5 shows the land use capacity classes and their spatial distributions table 5 shows the magnitude of the area for each class most of the mrb area was classified as class iv representing 88 24 of its drainage area lepsch et al 2015 reported that these lands present permanent risks or limitations that can be very severe when used for agriculture the lands located on the araguaia floodplain were classified as class viii which has flooding problems and is therefore inappropriate for cropping table 6 shows the mrb status according to the gpi resulting from the assessment of each scenario classes i and v were not observed because of the traits of the studied soils deep and well drained soils such as latosols or arenosols can be classified as class i or v but they must be in flat terrains less than 3 therefore we did not register such classes in the study area the results in table 6 indicate that for a base scenario most of the mrb 82 was within the recommended limits for land cover and land use the remaining 18 was in a good situation according to the gpi likewise the c2 magnitudes were close in terms of the drainage area and gpi furthermore to recover exploited areas the entire c1 drainage area was in ideal conditions according to the gpi this scenario does not represent any impact related to land use however c3 had an increase in drainage area 69 with two classes above the rational soil use which indicates a worse situation table 7 and fig 6 show the changes in land use and land cover conditions and spatial distributions according to the land use capacity method we also noted changes in the drainage area for each land use class and scenario in the mrb it is worth mentioning that in table 7 the hrus area for riparian forests on shallow and deep soils urban areas and water bodies 2661 km2 4 6 6193 km2 10 8 42 km2 0 1 and 269 km2 0 5 respectively were not included because no difference between scenarios was observed and the results for the remaining hrus are shown at the sub basin scale according to mapbiomas 2017 images our hru setup and summarized individual hru magnitudes from table 7 for the base scenario our results indicate land use and cover in shallow and deep soils with savannah recording 8576 and 14 493 km2 and riparian forest 2661 and 6193 km2 respectively most of these hrus are distributed in sub basins 4 2 and 1 representing more than half of the mrb drainage area 55 7 the areas occupied by pasture in shallow and deep soils were 5666 and 9377 km2 respectively and predominant in sub basins 4 3 and 2 and those related to agriculture were 2817 and 7235 km2 respectively and dominant in sub basin 5 finally urban areas and water classes occupied the remaining 311 km2 of the study area excessive soil use within the mrb mostly occurred in the upper part sub basin 5 due to agricultural land exploitation in these areas soils such as dystrophic red latosols dystrophic red yellow latosols and arenosols were identified as class iv these have several limitations when used for growing annual crops and must therefore be used for pastures they can also be good for growing occasional crops lepsch et al 2015 when comparing the base scenario with c1 soil use magnitudes were similar and only agriculture was changed with pasture mostly in the sub basin 5 thus pasture areas in shallow and deep soils increased by 2710 and 6884 km2 respectively with respect to c2 in shallow and deep soils the savannah areas were reduced by 5912 and 10 961 km2 while pasture areas increased by 5907 and 10 600 km2 respectively presenting significant changes in all sub basins but mostly in sub basins 1 and 2 in c3 savannah presented the same pattern as that in c2 wherein pasture area in shallow and deep soils was reduced by 5205 and 7680 km2 respectively and agriculture area increased by 11 117 and 18 642 km2 respectively showing significant changes in all sub basins precisely one can observe that anthropogenic uses of the soil were predominant in c2 and c3 in the mrb c1 pointed to an almost complete replacement of agriculture with pasture and farmland only in acrisols the gpi indicated that in c2 there was no considerable overuse of soil in the mrb as in the base scenario the increasing agricultural areas in c3 indicate poor conservation conditions in the mrb according to the gpi generally sub basins 1 2 and 3 were the least modified because of the presence of the largest indigenous areas and riparian forest which we maintained as a constant throughout the construction of the scenarios hence the riparian forest in sub basins 4 and 5 were in a situation that deserves attention owing to their lower area magnitudes fig 6a contrarily sub basin 5 upper part of the mrb was already dominated by agriculture sub basins 4 3 and 2 middle part of the mrb was predominated by pasture and in general sub basin 1 lower part of the mrb had the most native vegetation in relation to the base scenario the gpi indicates that the general situation in the mrb in 2017 can be considered good however according to almeida 2014 the gpi is limited to identifying the real effect of a small area of high density of soil exploration in a large scale basin because the index does not consider the spatial distribution of the number of classes above the soil use capacity this was observed in the mrb mainly in the upper part which represents a small area and a low risk of the total drainage area of the basin the latter is a potential risk due to stream water reduction owing to water withdrawal accumulation zeilhofer and klemp 2011 identified central irrigation pivots in the upper part of the mrb and in 2017 ghellere 2019 reported that 96 of water withdrawals were made in the same zone in general 79 of the water demand within the basin is related to irrigation purposes liniger et al 2017 such changes can increase runoff sediment transport and generation and organic matter losses dionizio et al 2020 favored by the condition of the slope of the terrain kogo et al 2020 moreover alewell et al 2020 have proven on a worldwide scale that erosion leads to massive losses of soil phosphorus which threatens agricultural production as a result farmers have been forced to use cultivation alternatives that are adaptable to current nutritional availability thus runoff generation and concentration of agricultural activities in the upper part of the mrb increase the risk of water contamination owing to pesticide use zeilhofer et al 2016 however schindewolf et al 2014 reported that some erosion prevention practices were carried out in the mrb but were not efficient enough it is clear that the upper part of the mrb represents a potential risk for quantity and quality of water in addition according to the base scenarios few spots of agriculture are expanding in the middle part of the basin fig 6a most of the land is classified as iv according to the land use capacity indicating that problems from sub basin 5 can be replicated in sub basins 4 3 and 2 thus planning actions for sustainable agriculture will be necessary 3 4 land use and land cover scenario impacts upon hydrological modeling tables 8 10 show the minimum q95 maximum qmax and long term qavg streamflows respectively which were obtained from the assessed scenarios using the mgb iph in the mrb the results show the percentage of change between each scenario built with respect to the base scenario fig 7 shows the behaviors and trends of streamflow permanence curves summarized in the santo antônio do leverger f1 station as the outlet of the mrb moreover for clarity fig 7b summarizes the behaviors of the minimum q95 maximum qmax and long term qavg streamflows complementing the impacts of changes in land use and land cover seasonal variations in et superficial infiltration and underground recharge were included in each evaluated scenario table 11 and figs 4s and 5s in supplementary material qmax in c1 showed differences with small magnitudes compared with streamflows in the base scenario this is because of few changes made in the study area sub basins 1 4 and was related to the replacement of agriculture with pasture in soils considered overused the upper part of the mrb sub basin 5 showed higher magnitudes in streamflow f5 which decreased in the middle and lower parts of the basin in a downstream order the qavg streamflows showed similar behavior to qmax but with higher magnitudes of the change percentage finally for the q95 streamflow in c1 an increase was observed at every gauge station following the same trend as qmax and qavg the effects of c1 in streamflows were mainly present in the upper part of the mrb sub basin 5 which underwent major changes in land use and cover in other words owing to the decrease in rainfall interception and subsequently reduced et taxes antecedent soil moisture was increased and soil storage capacity was consequently decreased brown et al 2005 leading to better scenarios for runoff generation in maximum events and average streamflow during the rainy season guimberteau et al 2017 wijesekara et al 2012 however et taxes in other sub basins 2 and 4 showed higher changes not following a proportional increase in maximum streamflows which indicates that many other variables have a high influence such as altitude slope soil depth and precipitation gradient in the mrb observed from the upper to the lower part of the basin with 1800 and 1500 mm of average annual precipitation respectively fig 6s supplementary material viglione et al 2016 argued that it becomes more difficult to identify the effect of land use and cover on floods when the spatial scale of analyses increases because controlling factors and process interactions also increase according to rogger et al 2017 the nonlinearity of runoff generation at large basin scales and non stationarities induced by land use and cover changes must be better understood with respect to the q95 in sub basin 5 which is also highly influenced by the change in land use and cover most of the agriculture land was changed to pastures with lower lai magnitude decreasing the et and rain interception during the rainy season therefore increasing infiltration and recharge magnitudes which increases water availability during the dry season in c2 all gauging stations showed significant increases in qmax qavg and q95 streamflow magnitudes because of the replacement of soil use mainly with pasture along the mrb significantly sub basin 5 showed minor increases in streamflows due to less changes in land use and cover nonetheless sub basins 4 1 experienced a high loss of savannah vegetation like the c1 scenario with lai and height vegetation reduction and albedo increase leading to et and rainfall interception decrease and favoring infiltration and subsequently groundwater recharge baker and miller 2013 notably pasture was considered to be well managed over time to decrease uncertainties about pasture degradation it affects soil cover as well as groundwater recharges in the short term lai fluctuations due to grazing bresloff et al 2013 and impacts of switching from native forest to pasture costa et al 2003 have similar impacts such as a considerable reduction in et and hence increases in streamflows moreover in a study conducted by dias et al 2015 in the upper xingu river within the savannah biome similar behavior was observed when native vegetation was changed to pasture causing reductions in the mean annual et and increasing mean annual streamflow the qmax and qavg streamflows in c3 showed similar behaviors to those in c2 but with smaller magnitudes moreover replacing land use and cover with agriculture in most of the drainage areas tended to decrease q95 streamflow in most of the gauge stations replacement by agriculture decreases the et taxes in the dry season owing to the lower albedo associated with pasture however et increases due to lower vegetation height concerning the savannah vegetation reducing air resistance which is inversely proportional to et fluxes notably for the rainy season et is equal to the et base scenario and for the dry season it is lower which is because of the lai variation throughout the year these behaviors under similar conditions of streamflow changes due to land use and cover changes were observed in a study conducted by pereira et al 2016 wherein the minimum streamflow decreased by 2 7 in the pomba river basin additionally abe et al 2018 reported a reduction in the minimum streamflow owing to amazonian deforestation in the tapajós basin notably sub basin 3 showed a lower increase in q95 which might be because of the highest changes in land use and cover into cultures compared with the rest of the sub basins almost 90 of the area was covered by agriculture for sub basin 4 even if most of the land use was changed by agriculture it preserved most of its savannah vegetation due to the preserved area within the sub basin the combination of many influencing variables and the non linearity in the responses of runoff generation leads to complexities and the masking of variables that have the major influence on minimum streamflow changes owing to land use cover as revealed by tucci and clarke 1997 who considered many minor basins in their analyses certain behaviors about vegetation loss and runoff behavior were observed however those behaviors may vary in larger basins due to the non linearity runoff process and the heterogeneity of characteristics along the basin notably for c3 changing riparian forests with irrigated agricultural areas exposes the soil to a critical situation of topsoil layer compaction due to heavy machinery decreasing infiltration rogger et al 2017 and erosion susceptibility dionizio et al 2020 moreover this is a real situation in the upper part of the basin which tends to favor sediment losses that are more frequent in this scenario than in undisturbed natural soils cerdà et al 2009 moreover as previously mentioned in the mrb some erosion prevention practices were adopted but these could be improved for greater efficiency schindewolf et al 2014 however according to gomes et al 2019 agricultural expansion in the savannah brazilian cerrado is increasing resulting in agricultural productivity decreases and soil nutrient depletion which indicates that government policies should focus on sustainable soil use practices moreover according to twine et al 2004 little is known about the hydrological effects of switching from pasture to agriculture generally considering f1 as the mrb outlet the greatest impacts on qmax streamflows were caused by c2 12 36 tr 10 followed by c3 8 58 tr 10 and c1 1 17 tr 10 the qavg streamflows exhibited similar behavior with the largest increases in c2 10 05 c3 5 64 and c1 1 76 the q95 increased in c3 and c2 by 3 28 and 2 61 respectively however in c3 q95 was reduced by 0 72 pereira et al 2016 observed similar effects for c3 in the rio pomba basin using the swat model they noted that in a scenario of agricultural expansion maximum and average streamflows increased by 3 and 1 4 respectively additionally näschen et al 2019 reported a decrease in low flow by 6 due to an agricultural expansion scenario over the savannah in the rufiji river basin tanzania for c2 a replacement of 57 of the riparian forest with pasture caused an increase in average streamflow by 6 5 in the xingu river basin santos et al 2018 similar to our results with 55 replacement by pasture table 7 in c1 agricultural replacement with caatinga like savannah in the mandaú river basin decreased the runoff generated provoking more infiltration which favors low flow in the dry season andrade et al 2017 overall native forest removal in tropical basins reduces rain interception and et while increasing maximum and average streamflows during the rainy season guimberteau et al 2017 wijesekara et al 2012 additionally according to etehadi abari et al 2017 due to forest harvesting the canopy cover is reduced and the average surface runoff volume and sediment transport are increased moreover c2 mainly pasture had the lowest lai followed by c3 mainly agriculture and finally c1 a combination of pasture with savannah and riparian rainforest we observed that the conjugation of many variables responds differently owing to the basin scale which makes it difficult to identify which variables are responsible for the major changes in streamflow related to land use and land cover moreover for average streamflow it was less complex to identify which variables had major influences on streamflow changes compared with the maximum and minimum streamflow 4 conclusions in this study the mgb iph was calibrated and validated for the study period between 2000 and 2014 for the mrb located in the brazilian savannah biome additionally we assessed streamflow changes due to some land use and cover scenarios constructed according to the land use capacity of the basin after calibration and validation even with certain limitations in representing some physical processes in flat areas the mgb iph performance was considered good and suitable for estimating daily streamflows over the analyzed period providing a tool for management and planning for decision making in the mrb related to water forecasting in a constantly changing environment the analysis of land use capacity in the mrb revealed overused soils in the upper part of the basin owing to agriculture which could be replicated in the middle part of the basin thus planning actions for sustainable agriculture are necessary along the basin moreover the scenarios constructed using a land use capacity system exhibited different behaviors in streamflow magnitudes scenarios c3 and c2 which simulated agriculture and pasture in most of the drainage areas in the mrb respectively indicated that these options have the greatest negative impacts on human development because of their increased risk of flooding and increases in the maximum streamflows as well as reduction in the minimum q95 streamflow however scenario c1 which simulated riparian forest recovery and agriculture to pasture changes was the most favorable option reducing maximum streamflows and increasing average and minimum q95 streamflows such hydrological modeling allows us to better understand changes in water cycles due to anthropic activities providing strategies for planning and management of threatened brazilian biomes aimed at water security and

8088,study region noseongcheon catchment is a mesoscale agricultural basin with crystalline bedrocks with seasonally variable precipitation and groundwater use study focus this study aimed to assess the influence of headwater streams on streamflow across the stream network in the study area under the temperate monsoonal climate conditions using hydrochemical parameters and stable isotopes in stream water and groundwater in the dry and rainy seasons the water sources contributing to the stream network were identified and the seasonal changes in the streamflow system were evaluated new hydrological insights for the region seasonal variations of hydrochemical parameters and water stable isotopes indicated that the contributions of major water sources to streamflow in the catchment changed according to the seasonal precipitation pattern groundwater affected by agricultural activities discharges into the stream at the piedmont area from mountain to plain irrespective of season however the contribution of uncontaminated mountain bedrock discharge mbd showed a marked difference between dry season and rainy season the contribution of mbd ranged from 20 to 75 in the dry season while it increased up to 90 in the rainy season these results indicate that the responses of mountainous area to precipitation in the rainy season is a major factor affecting the hydrological functioning of the whole stream network keywords streamflow headwater hydrochemistry stable isotope seasonal variation 1 introduction mountainous areas have been regarded as water towers and their role in the whole catchment draws increasing interests in terms of research and management of water resources funell and price 2003 chen et al 2016 marchina et al 2020 the subsurface inflow from adjacent mountains to lowland aquifers which is known as mountain block recharge mbr is estimated to comprise 5 50 of basin filled aquifer recharge around the world markovich et al 2019 typically mountains are highly sensitive to global warming and the change of precipitation pattern and fresh water derived from the mountainous area can be more affected by climate change viviroli et al 2007 bates et al 2008 in this regard it is crucial to understand water flow regimes associated with precipitation pattern in the mountainous area for proper management of water resources at the catchment scale viviroli et al 2011 a stream network typically consists of a set of dozens of headwater streams and the channel length of the headwater streams corresponds to 70 80 of the entire stream network wohl 2017 the quantity and quality of headwater streams are considered to have great influence on the health of the entire stream network alexander et al 2007 in addition headwater streams play roles in flood prevention pollution reduction and groundwater recharge in downstream areas gomes and wai 2014 dynamics of groundwater recharge and discharge in bedrock zones are considered to be a major factor controlling catchment hydrographs and streamflow generation processes in the mountain areas katsuyama et al 2010 therefore understanding changes of hydrological processes that reflect headwater stream flow generation according to precipitation patterns can be important for effective management across the stream network although headwater streams in mountainous areas are important water resources they typically receive less attention in catchment management than larger streams in the lower basin most studies on stream longitudinal profiles have been conducted based on stream network digitization by measuring the stream discharge rate to evaluate the contribution of headwater streams in the whole stream system godsey and kirchner 2014 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 jensen et al 2017 the approach can evaluate quantitative fluctuations in discharge rate according to increasing stream order but various water sources cannot be identified because environmental tracers such as stable isotopes and major elements allow a quantitative assessment of water sources and their contributions they can provide a new perspective for assessing the role of headwater streams in stream networks haiyan et al 2018 segura et al 2019 jung et al 2020 headwater streams are very sensitive to characteristics of precipitation such as the timing duration interval and amount of precipitation events ward et al 2020 in many regions influenced by the asian monsoon the stream water flow system i e source pathway and discharge rate changes with seasonal differences in precipitation amount lee and lee 1999 vuille et al 2005 huang et al 2012 this change of the flow system impacts environmental tracers for example due to the amount effect and air mass change water isotopic compositions of precipitation are more depleted and deuterium excess d excess is lower in the rainy season than in the dry season lee et al 2003 these isotopic signals are linked to headwater streams jung et al 2020 in the korean peninsula the number of non precipitation days and frequency of heavy rainfall during the rainy season have increased compared to the past due to climate change korea meteorological administration kma 2012 this trend is expected to significantly increase in the future kim et al 2018 in this regard stable isotopes and hydrochemical parameters can be useful for determining variability in stream water sources and their mixing processes the purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of headwater streams on the stream network in a mesoscale catchment with crystalline bedrock under temperate monsoonal climate conditions in the mid western region of south korea previous studies on stream water in the catchment focused on the mountainous area jung et al 2020 or the agricultural plain area kwon et al 2020 oh et al 2021 in a spatially separate manner in this study we assumed uncontaminated bedrock groundwater from the mountain area as mountain bedrock discharge mbd and evaluated the role of mbd as a major water source throughout the mesoscale catchment for this study we examined the hydrological connection between the mountainous areas to the plain area in the mesoscale catchment more specifically we identified water sources in the stream network of the study catchment and determined their relative contribution to stream water using the seasonal variation of stable isotopes and conservative solutes in stream water and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the catchment area of noseongcheon stream located in the mid western part of the korea peninsula fig 1 has an area of approximately 202 5 km2 the stream with a total stream channel length of 27 7 km is one of the main tributaries of the geum river most headwater streams originate at gyeryong mountain located in the eastern part of the catchment and flows into noseongcheon stream the study catchment was divided into forest dominated mountainous area 100 m asl piedmont area where forest and agricultural fields are mixed 50 100 m asl and lower plain area 50 m asl based on altitude and land uses the bedrock lithology is mainly granitic rocks and shallow aquifers are developed in alluvium and weathered zone kim et al 1976 koh et al 2010 on average the alluvium had a thickness of 20 m in lowlands and less than 0 5 m in the mountainous area knps 2010 cho et al 2012 cho et al 2003 reported that the ancient weathering profile plays a key role in the groundwater yield in the jurassic granite lowland of south korea recently jung et al 2020 also reported that shallow groundwater through the weathered zone has a significant effect on streamflow generation in mountainous areas groundwater in the crystalline aquifer has a variety of flow paths water qualities and residence times depending on the connectivity of fractures and the land use pattern lee and lee 2000 koh et al 2010 land uses in the study area are distributed in the order of 45 4 agricultural area 43 3 forest and 7 3 residential area most of the agricultural and residential areas are located on floodplains in the lowland groundwater usage is approximately 6 5 106 m3 year and 73 5 of the groundwater is used for agricultural activities nonsan si 2018 previous studies have reported that heavy groundwater pumping for water curtain cultivation in dry farmland caused significant drop in groundwater level up to 10 m in the study area cho et al 2012 lee et al 2015 kwon et al 2020 reported that the heavy pumping can disturb groundwater stream water interaction resulting in changes in physical and chemical conditions of groundwater the mean annual precipitation 1981 2010 is 1349 mm and approximately 68 3 of the precipitation occurs in summer season from june to september kma 2020 in 2018 annual precipitation was 1458 mm of which 52 fell in summer the monthly average temperature during the sampling period was 12 7 with a range from 2 9 in january to 27 9 in august the study area is under the influence of asian monsoonal climate system with hot and humid in summer and cold and dry in winter the stream flow rate in the outlet of noseongcheon stream ranged from 69 603 to 186 124 m3 day with the lowest stream water level in february and the highest in august kwon et al 2020 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis to investigate the seasonal and spatial variations of the hydrochemical and stable isotopic compositions of the noseongcheon catchment two campaigns were conducted in april dry season and september rainy season in 2018 at a total of 56 sampling points 40 stream water and 16 groundwater samples because annual precipitation is affected mainly by the east asian monsoon rainfall patterns differ significantly by season numerous studies have classified the period from june to september as rainy season and the period from october to may as dry season lee and lee 1999 koh et al 2010 jung et al 2019 the precipitation patterns and soil wetness index related to changes in headwater stream discharge were different during the two sampling periods jung et al 2016 jung et al 2020 in the study area heavy pumping for crop cultivation in winter affects hydraulic condition in the aquifer and its relationship to stream cho et al 2012 kwon et al 2017 therefore field campaigns were conducted in april and september to understand the seasonal variations of water flow systems according to natural precipitation fluctuations groundwater and stream water samples were collected at base flow conditions during non precipitation periods at least 3 days after a precipitation event in particular groundwater samples were collected from domestic wells using dedicated pumps after sufficient purging until field parameters had stabilized all water samples were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane filters and aliquots for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 using ultrapure hno3 in the field cations and silica were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes optima 4300du perkin elmer waltham ma usa and anions were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 1500 dionex sunnyvale ca usa at the korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources kigam alkalinity was determined by gran titration in the field using 0 1 n hcl charge balance errors of measured concentrations of major cations and anions were less than 5 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of all water samples were quantified with liquid water isotope analyzer l2120 i picarro santa clara ca usa at kigam results were reported using δ notation relative to vsmow2 a detailed description of the analytical method for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes is reported in jung et al 2013 the stable isotopic compositions were calibrated using the primary standards of vsmow2 gisp and slap2 and three kigam laboratory standards the analytical uncertainties of δ18o and δ2h were 0 1 and 0 5 respectively jung et al 2013 the measured values of water samples were shown in supplementary tables 1 and 2 2 3 data analysis to assess the effect of chemical weathering and fertilizer use in agricultural area molar concentrations of major cations and anions were compared in stream water and groundwater ca2 mg2 vs hco3 and ca2 mg2 vs hco3 no3 which were referred to as molar ratios for natural weathering rnw and for combination of natural weathering and anthropogenic contamination rac respectively the rnw has been described as being 0 5 under natural weathering processes of carbonates and silicates barth et al 2003 perrin et al 2008 shin et al 2017 evaluated the effects of nitrate contamination on water chemistry by comparing rac rather than rnw considering the role of n fertilizers on weathering suggested by perrin et al 2008 where the rac ratio of 0 5 means that the fertilizer derived nitric acid is involved in the chemical weathering interpolation maps for δ18o of groundwater were drawn using arcgis software version 10 8 esri redlands ca to visualize seasonal variability using ordinary kriging with an exponential model in addition the whole stream network of the catchment was divided into five tributaries and the main stream to evaluate the effect of tributaries on the main stream topographic indices of the subcatchment of each tributary e g stream length mean stream gradient area and mean slope gradient were obtained by spatial analysis using arcgis mixing models that rely on natural tracers allow the assessment of varying contributions of source water to stream network james and roulet 2006 end member mixing analysis emma has been widely used to integrate hydrological response along hydrologic flow paths at the catchment scale hooper 2003 scanlon et al 2001 end members must distinguish from each other and have lower variability than stream water hopper 2011 koh et al 2010 showed that sources of recharge and agricultural contaminants in groundwater were identified by major land uses and δ18o and cl concentration in this study groundwater samples were collected considering the major land uses and shallow groundwater from wells with total depths of 20 m or less was selected as end members that can represent the land uses in this study we defined three end members for groundwater mbd from mountainous area end member a contaminated groundwater from lowland recharge affected by agricultural activities end member b and paddy impounded water with evaporation and denitrification signatures end member c the isotopic composition and no3 concentration of the paddy impounded water is similar to those of irrigation return flow on paddy field reported in lee et al 2021 the three end members showed negligible seasonal variations of major ion compositions and isotopic compositions and similar to the end members reported in koh et al 2010 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of stream water and groundwater based on major ions water samples were classified into two water types ca hco3 and ca cl fig 2 groundwater adjacent to mountainous areas were ca hco3 type and the most of groundwater distributed in agricultural fields were predominantly ca cl type ca hco3 type groundwater had low mineral contents and was subdivided into those with the relatively low cl and no3 concentrations and the others considering that cl concentration in groundwater is about 5 mg l in natural area koh et al 2010 which is much lower than other anions the ca cl type water can be regarded as significantly contaminated water the water type of individual groundwater samples was invariant irrespective of seasons in the dry season stream water in tributaries was a mixture of ca cl and ca hco3 types whereas ca hco3 type was dominant in the main stream on the other hand ca hco3 type was dominant across the stream network during the rainy season groundwater showed a wide range of major ion concentrations with negligible seasonal variations fig 3 koh et al 2009 showed that elevated concentrations of cl and no3 in groundwater were strongly associated with agricultural land uses in the hilly terrains and plains of the study area in contrast stream water had a narrow range of major ion concentrations and showed relatively higher seasonal variability in the concentrations based on the mean values of stream water sio2 concentration was generally higher in the rainy season than in the dry season whereas opposite result was observed for cl and no3 concentrations chemistry of stream water in the study area seemed to be significantly influenced by land uses which is related to elevation groups stream water derived from the mountainous area had lower major ion concentrations than those in stream water in the lower area fig 3 cl and no3 concentrations in stream water were higher at the piedmont area where forest and agricultural fields are mixed in the lower plain area the highest cl and no3 concentrations were observed with the increase in the proportion of agricultural fields near the stream channels in the dry season the mean ec of stream water in the lower area 200 μs cm was approximately two fold higher than that in the upper area 93 μs cm in addition mean cl concentration was 0 18 mmol l in upper stream group 100 m while it was dramatically increased in lower stream group 50 m as 0 43 mmol l in the rainy season the spatial difference was similar to that in the dry season but the rate of increase in the lower area was lower than that in the dry season ca2 and so4 2 concentrations in stream water were gradually increased with the decrease in the elevation fig 4 for stream water rnw was 0 64 in the dry season and 0 54 in the rainy season which is a significant seasonal difference whereas rac was 0 48 irrespective of season fig 5 for groundwater rnw was 0 69 in the dry season and 0 66 in the rainy season with considerable scattering while rac was 0 43 and mostly around 0 5 irrespective of season 3 2 stable isotopic compositions of stream water and groundwater the mean values of δ18o and δ2h of stream water were 7 6 and 50 in the dry season and ranged from 8 5 to 6 6 and from 54 to 44 respectively the mean values of δ18o and δ2h of stream water in the rainy season were 8 3 and 58 and ranged from 9 1 to 7 4 and from 62 to 52 respectively fig 3 the stream water had the most depleted isotopic composition in the upper stream reaches in the mountainous area however the ranges and mean values of δ18o and d excess for stream water varied significantly between seasons fig 3 the mean values of δ18o and δ2h of groundwater were 7 5 and 51 in both dry and rainy seasons respectively in the dry season δ18o and δ2h of groundwater ranged from 9 2 to 5 3 and from 61 to 40 respectively in the rainy season the δ18o and δ2h of groundwater ranged from 9 0 to 5 2 and from 61 to 39 respectively fig 3 the δ18o and δ2h values of most groundwater samples were quite similar irrespective of season whereas those of stream water showed considerable seasonal variation in both seasons δ18o and δ2h of stream water were gradually enriched toward the downstream areas fig 6 in the dry season δ18o and δ2h of stream water in the upstream area were distributed between the local meteoric water lines lmwls for summer and winter with slopes of 7 16 and 7 98 respectively δ18o and δ2h of stream water in the downstream area were plotted near lmwl for summer in the rainy season all δ18o and δ2h of stream water were close to the lmwl for summer δ18o and δ2h of groundwater samples were also closely plotted near the lmwl for summer irrespective of season on the plot of δ18o and δ2h of stream water the slope is commonly used as a proxy to determine the evaporation effect stewart 1975 simpson and herczeg 1991 stream water in this study had a slope of 4 38 in the dry season and of 6 32 in the rainy season indicating that the degree of evaporation in stream water was dependent on seasonal change by contrast δ18o and δ2h of groundwater had a similar slope of 5 50 in the dry season and 5 91 in the rainy season these results suggest that the recharge or inflow of evaporated water is relatively constant in the groundwater flow system groundwater showed no difference in the slope of δ18o and δ2h depending on elevation not shown but stream water showed a clear difference table 1 the highest slope was observed for stream water in the mountainous area 100 m asl and the slope decreased significantly at the piedmont area 50 100 m asl irrespective of season based on the d excess of the elevation groups the seasonal difference in d excess of stream water adjacent to the mountainous area was larger than that of other stream water 3 3 spatial patterns and end member mixing analysis of environmental tracers the changes in water flow systems contributing to stream water can be evaluated by the spatial and temporal distributions of δ18o in the main stream and tributaries along the distance downstream fig 7 in order to visualize spatial distribution of δ18o of stream water it was plotted on the interpolation map for δ18o of groundwater fig 8 the upper stream of the five tributaries located near the mountainous region showed the most depleted δ18o which was gradually enriched with increasing distance downstream regardless of season fig 7 in particular δ18o of stream water in most of tributaries increased toward the downstream area in the dry season on the other hand δ18o of stream water in the main stream was either slightly enriched in the dry season or depleted in the rainy season with the increase in distance downstream which is likely to be the result of successive inflow from tributaries with more enriched dry season or more depleted rainy season isotopic compositions based on isotopic and hydrochemical compositions end member mixing analysis emma was conducted to determine the relative contributions of various groundwater sources to stream water fig 9 most of stream water samples were within the triangle of the three end members on δ18o and no3 rather than δ18o and cl concentration emma results on the plot of δ18o and no3 showed that end member a and end member c dominantly contributed to the stream network in the study area in the dry season the proportions of end members a and c were estimated by ranges from 20 to 75 and from 12 to 65 respectively fig 9 in the rainy season the proportion of end member a significantly increased up to 95 which was accompanied by the decreased contribution of end member c from 0 to 45 in both seasons the contribution of end member a to most of stream water in upper reaches is dominant with more than 75 by contrast contribution of end member b to stream water is much less compared to that of other end members the relative contribution of the water sources to stream water considerably varied with seasons fig 10 particularly changes in the relative contribution of water sources by season were evident in stream water in the piedmont area and lower reaches contribution of end member c to stream water in the piedmont area ranged from 25 to 56 in the dry season while the contribution decreased to less than 25 in the rainy season the main water source in the plain area was end member c with the proportion of 40 65 in the dry season while end member a was the most influential water source with the proportion of 55 95 in the rainy season 4 discussion 4 1 water sources of streamflow in the catchment groundwater in crystalline bedrocks is a major source of stream water and its isotopic compositions and water chemistry are dependent on the flow path flow depth land use and recharge elevation wassenaar et al 2011 liu and yamanaka 2012 wright and novakowski 2019 in terms of flow paths shallow groundwater flows through surficial sediments and weathered zones and deep groundwater through fractured zones underlain by massive non fractured rocks hassan et al 2014 pacheco 2015 the solute concentrations and isotopic compositions of stream water in the study area showed seasonal differences caused by precipitation patterns in particular d excess of stream water reflects seasonal variations depending on the asian monsoon climatic conditions fig s1 i e d excess of precipitation is highest in winter from december to february and lowest in summer from june to september in the korean peninsula lee et al 2003 jung et al 2020 seasonal variation of d excess in stream water indicated that the main sources of stream water quickly respond to precipitation and that their contributions are seasonally variable jung et al 2020 determined mean transit time of mbd in the mountainous area of the study area as 1 5 years using time series data of δ18o koh et al 2010 reported that average groundwater ages in the lowland was about 30 years using cfc contents in groundwater wells 50 m these previous results suggest that groundwater flow in the study area is dominated by annual mixing of precipitation which accounts for negligible seasonal variations of major ion compositions in individual groundwater samples in the study catchment tributaries showed a mixture of ca cl and ca hco3 types in the dry season whereas ca hco3 type was dominant in the whole tributaries in the rainy season jung et al 2016 reported that discharge of headwater streams was much less in the dry season than those in the rainy season lee et al 2021 reported that most of precipitation recharges into the subsurface and groundwater mainly sustains base flow of headwater streams in the dry season considering that agricultural land uses increase toward to the lowland area contaminated groundwater affected by agricultural activities can greatly contribute to stream water in tributaries with decreased contribution of mbd by contrast ca hco3 type water was dominant in the main stream irrespective of season indicating that streamflow in the main stream is derived from the tributaries with higher contribution of mbd kwon et al 2020 reported that elevated concentrations of ca and so4 in groundwater are indicative of agricultural contamination in the study area fig 4 therefore the increase in ca and so4 concentrations with the decrease in the elevation indicates that the inflow of groundwater affected by agricultural contaminations to the stream network increases toward the lowland area in the study area rac of stream water and groundwater was near 0 5 indicating that nitrate from agricultural activities can cause chemical weathering and has an effect on both stream water and groundwater in the study catchment fig 5 in the study area nitrogenous fertilizers have been widely used at a rate of 102 kg ha nonsan si 2018 which can cause soil acidification due to proton release during nitrification ehrlich and ehrlich 1990 numerous studies have reported that chemical fertilizers and manures adversely affect stream water and groundwater quality in agricultural areas lang et al 2006 perrin et al 2008 shin et al 2017 kwon et al 2020 in this regard oh et al 2021 reported that more groundwater inflow occurs in the upper stream reaches based on higher 222rn than lower stream reaches in the study catchment hence different slopes of δ18o and δ2h in stream water according to elevation groups can be attributed to diverse water flow systems contributing to stream water fig 6 and table 1 in particular the slope of δ18o and δ2h in the piedmont area was lower than those in other zones indicating that groundwater inflow containing agricultural contaminants increases in the piedmont area with thin alluvium in the study catchment alluvium is distributed with thicknesses exceeding 20 m on the plain area consisting of agricultural fields but poorly developed in the mountainous area kowaco 2002 in addition permeable sand point bars are generally developed around the lower part of the stream chae et al 2009 these conditions indicate that lateral flow through the sandy layer seems to be the dominant flow path that supplies evaporated water affected by agricultural activities to streams in the plain area considering gaining stream conditions in the dry season 4 2 identification of seasonal changes in the streamflow system heavy rainfall in the rainy season can lead to depleted isotopic composition by amount effect and dilution of solute concentrations lee and lee 1999 in addition dissolved sio2 concentration increases with the increase in depth of flow path in the crystalline bedrock uchida and asano 2010 in this study stream water was isotopically depleted with increased sio2 concentration and decreased cl concentration from dry season to rainy season indicating the increase in contribution of subsurface stormflow in response to higher precipitation the solute concentration and isotopic composition in soil water reflect a balance between precipitation infiltration and evaporation while those of groundwater in fractured aquifers are relatively constant hsieh et al 1998 jung et al 2020 kelly et al 1998 in the mountainous area soil moisture is closely related to infiltration and evaporation in soil layer and spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture plays a key role in controlling the flow paths that generate streamflow kim and jung 2014 penna et al 2011 also reported that main water source contributing to headwater generation is the saturated riparian zone in the dry season whereas subsurface stormflow in the hillslope area in the rainy season varies depending on the soil moisture threshold condition related to seasonal precipitation patterns therefore seasonal changes in solute concentrations and isotopic compositions in tributaries are likely to be mainly influenced by the hydrological condition of soil layer in the mountainous area these results suggest that the responses to precipitation recharge and runoff processes in the mountainous area have a considerable impact on the entire stream network three component mixing using δ18o and no3 revealed the three water sources of stream water as mbd from mountainous area contaminated groundwater from lowland recharge affected by agricultural activities and paddy impounded water with evaporation and denitrification signatures the predominant water source of stream water is mbd and its contribution varies according to seasonal precipitation patterns fig 9 the paddy impounded water is also one of the major water sources that contribute to stream water in the lower reaches in the dry season allen et al 2010 reported that groundwater in crystalline bedrock regions is generally recharged by precipitation and predominantly discharges to stream channel in the dry season chae et al 2010 reported that groundwater level in the mountainous area was more sensitive to precipitation events in this regard the level of shallow groundwater flowing through the weathered zone in mountainous area is sensitive to precipitation intensity uchida et al 2003 therefore precipitation runoff processes in the mountainous hillslope is considered to be a major factor influencing seasonal variations of the whole stream network fig 9 groundwater level in the plain area is affected by agricultural land uses in the study catchment cho et al 2012 the groundwater level in paddy field is higher than the stream water level from march to september however in the same period the groundwater level in dry farmland is lower than the stream water level due to heavy pumping during winter kwon et al 2020 considering the effects of these groundwater level conditions the influence of paddy impounded water on stream water is considered to be relatively higher than that of contaminated water from dry farmland though paddy field and dry farmland show similar spatial distributions fig 10 these indicate that groundwater stream water interactions dominantly impact on stream water around the piedmont area and plain area in the dry season thus groundwater level response and topographic gradient play key roles in stream water generation with various chemical and isotopic signatures in the study area environmental tracers are a useful tool to evaluate hydrological processes in the catchment unfortunately fundamental hydrological data such as stream discharge evapotranspiration and water usage are not available in the study catchment which imposed limitations on delineation of streamflow generation processes jeelani et al 2010 investigated the seasonal variation of isotopic composition along with discharge for spring water and stream water in a mountainous catchment and identified different contributions of snow melt rainfall and baseflow to springs and streams with three distinct periods dor et al 2011 combined a water balance model and isotope techniques to evaluate surface water groundwater interactions in irrigation canals in this aspect future researches are needed in the study catchment linking hydrological data with chemical and isotopic measurements to better understand hydrological functioning of the mountainous areas in the mesoscale stream network 5 conclusions seasonal changes in stable isotopic composition and solute concentration were much larger in stream water compared to groundwater indicating that relative proportions of water sources contributing streamflow were variable depending on the precipitation pattern headwater streams in the mountainous area showed lower solute concentrations and more depleted isotopic compositions than stream water in the downstream area irrespective of season the molar ratios of ca2 mg2 and hco3 no3 were similar for stream water and groundwater indicating that groundwater affected by chemical weathering and agricultural activities mainly contributes to stream water the slope of δ18o and δ2h of stream water decreased with increasing no3 and cl concentration in the piedmont area and plain area where agricultural land uses are dominant indicating that evaporated water from agricultural activities discharge to the stream through permeable alluvium irrespective of season the δ18o of tributaries in the study area became enriched with increasing flow distance due to local groundwater discharge from agricultural fields however the δ18o of the main stream showed different trends in the dry and rainy seasons these results indicate that the δ18o of the main stream is controlled mainly by tributary junctions rather than groundwater inflow from around the stream channel water sources were clearly identified by emma using δ18o and no3 which showed that mbd is a dominant source contributing to stream water across the whole stream network the effect of paddy impounded water generally increased in the dry season and the effect of groundwater in dry farmland where a low groundwater level was maintained due to heavy pumping in winter was not significant irrespective of season these results indicate that streamflow in the mesoscale catchment is significantly affected by the hydrological responses in the mountainous area and the use of groundwater in agricultural fields this study showed that water stable isotopes and solute concentrations can be useful for evaluating seasonal variability of streamflow generation processes in the larger catchment as well as headwater catchments our results revealed that the hydrological response in the mountainous area is a major factor influencing seasonal variations of the whole stream network in particular the decrease in concentration of contaminants from agricultural activities in the rainy season is due to the increased contribution of stream water originating from the mountainous area these findings suggest that mountainous headwater catchments and piedmont areas are crucial for management of water resources of the mesoscale

8088,study region noseongcheon catchment is a mesoscale agricultural basin with crystalline bedrocks with seasonally variable precipitation and groundwater use study focus this study aimed to assess the influence of headwater streams on streamflow across the stream network in the study area under the temperate monsoonal climate conditions using hydrochemical parameters and stable isotopes in stream water and groundwater in the dry and rainy seasons the water sources contributing to the stream network were identified and the seasonal changes in the streamflow system were evaluated new hydrological insights for the region seasonal variations of hydrochemical parameters and water stable isotopes indicated that the contributions of major water sources to streamflow in the catchment changed according to the seasonal precipitation pattern groundwater affected by agricultural activities discharges into the stream at the piedmont area from mountain to plain irrespective of season however the contribution of uncontaminated mountain bedrock discharge mbd showed a marked difference between dry season and rainy season the contribution of mbd ranged from 20 to 75 in the dry season while it increased up to 90 in the rainy season these results indicate that the responses of mountainous area to precipitation in the rainy season is a major factor affecting the hydrological functioning of the whole stream network keywords streamflow headwater hydrochemistry stable isotope seasonal variation 1 introduction mountainous areas have been regarded as water towers and their

1999 vuille et al 2005 huang et al 2012 this change of the flow system impacts environmental tracers for example due to the amount effect and air mass change water isotopic compositions of precipitation are more depleted and deuterium excess d excess is lower in the rainy season than in the dry season lee et al 2003 these isotopic signals are linked to headwater streams jung et al 2020 in the korean peninsula the number of non precipitation days and frequency of heavy rainfall during the rainy season have increased compared to the past due to climate change korea meteorological administration kma 2012 this trend is expected to significantly increase in the future kim et al 2018 in this regard stable isotopes and hydrochemical parameters can be useful for determining variability in stream water sources and their mixing processes the purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of headwater streams on the stream network in a mesoscale catchment with crystalline bedrock under temperate monsoonal climate conditions in the mid western region of south korea previous studies on stream water in the catchment focused on the mountainous area jung et al 2020 or the agricultural plain area kwon et al 2020 oh et al 2021 in a spatially separate manner in this study we assumed uncontaminated bedrock groundwater from the mountain area as mountain bedrock discharge mbd and evaluated the role of mbd as a major water source throughout the mesoscale catchment for this study we examined the hydrological connection between the mountainous areas to the plain area in the mesoscale catchment more specifically we identified water sources in the stream network of the study catchment and determined their relative contribution to stream water using the seasonal variation of stable isotopes and conservative solutes in stream water and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the catchment area of noseongcheon stream located in the mid western part of the korea peninsula fig 1 has an area of approximately 202 5 km2 the stream with a total stream channel length of 27 7 km is one of the main tributaries of the geum river most headwater streams originate at gyeryong mountain located in the eastern part of the catchment and flows into noseongcheon stream the study catchment was divided into forest dominated mountainous area 100 m asl piedmont area where forest and agricultural fields are mixed 50 100 m asl and lower plain area 50 m asl based on altitude and land uses the bedrock lithology is mainly granitic rocks and shallow aquifers are developed in alluvium and weathered zone kim et al 1976 koh et al 2010 on average the alluvium had a thickness of 20 m in lowlands and less than 0 5 m in the mountainous area knps 2010 cho et al 2012 cho et al 2003 reported that the ancient weathering profile plays a key role in the groundwater yield in the jurassic granite lowland of south korea recently jung et al 2020 also reported that shallow groundwater through the weathered zone has a significant effect on streamflow generation in mountainous areas groundwater in the crystalline aquifer has a variety of flow paths water qualities and residence times depending on the connectivity of fractures and the land use pattern lee and lee 2000 koh et al 2010 land uses in the study area are distributed in the order of 45 4 agricultural area 43 3 forest and 7 3 residential area most of the agricultural and residential areas are located on floodplains in the lowland groundwater usage is approximately 6 5 106 m3 year and 73 5 of the groundwater is used for agricultural activities nonsan si 2018 previous studies have reported that heavy groundwater pumping for water curtain cultivation in dry farmland caused significant drop in groundwater level up to 10 m in the study area cho et al 2012 lee et al 2015 kwon et al 2020 reported that the heavy pumping can disturb groundwater stream water interaction resulting in changes in physical and chemical conditions of groundwater the mean annual precipitation 1981 2010 is 1349 mm and approximately 68 3 of the precipitation occurs in summer season from june to september kma 2020 in 2018 annual precipitation was 1458 mm of which 52 fell in summer the monthly average temperature during the sampling period was 12 7 with a range from 2 9 in january to 27 9 in august the study area is under the influence of asian monsoonal climate system with hot and humid in summer and cold and dry in winter the stream flow rate in the outlet of noseongcheon stream ranged from 69 603 to 186 124 m3 day with the lowest stream water level in february and the highest in august kwon et al 2020 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis to investigate the seasonal and spatial variations of the hydrochemical and stable isotopic compositions of the noseongcheon catchment two campaigns were conducted in april dry season and september rainy season in 2018 at a total of 56 sampling points 40 stream water and 16 groundwater samples because annual precipitation is affected mainly by the east asian monsoon rainfall patterns differ significantly by season numerous studies have classified the period from june to september as rainy season and the period from october to may as dry season lee and lee 1999 koh et al 2010 jung et al 2019 the precipitation patterns and soil wetness index related to changes in headwater stream discharge were different during the two sampling periods jung et al 2016 jung et al 2020 in the study area heavy pumping for crop cultivation in winter affects hydraulic condition in the aquifer and its relationship to stream cho et al 2012 kwon et al 2017 therefore field campaigns were conducted in april and september to understand the seasonal variations of water flow systems according to natural precipitation fluctuations groundwater and stream water samples were collected at base flow conditions during non precipitation periods at least 3 days after a precipitation event in particular groundwater samples were collected from domestic wells using dedicated pumps after sufficient purging until field parameters had stabilized all water samples were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane filters and aliquots for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 using ultrapure hno3 in the field cations and silica were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes optima 4300du perkin elmer waltham ma usa and anions were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 1500 dionex sunnyvale ca usa at the korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources kigam alkalinity was determined by gran titration in the field using 0 1 n hcl charge balance errors of measured concentrations of major cations and anions were less than 5 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of all water samples were quantified with liquid water isotope analyzer l2120 i picarro santa clara ca usa at kigam results were reported using δ notation relative to vsmow2 a detailed description of the analytical method for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes is reported in jung et al 2013 the stable isotopic compositions were calibrated using the primary standards of vsmow2 gisp and slap2 and three kigam laboratory standards the analytical uncertainties of δ18o and δ2h were 0 1 and 0 5 respectively jung et al 2013 the measured values of water samples were shown in supplementary tables 1 and 2 2 3 data analysis to assess the effect of chemical weathering and fertilizer use in agricultural area molar concentrations of major cations and anions were compared in stream water and groundwater ca2 mg2 vs hco3 and ca2 mg2 vs hco3 no3 which were referred to as molar ratios for natural weathering rnw and for combination of natural weathering and anthropogenic contamination rac respectively the rnw has been described as being 0 5 under natural weathering processes of carbonates and silicates barth et al 2003 perrin et al 2008 shin et al 2017 evaluated the effects of nitrate contamination on water chemistry by comparing rac rather than rnw considering the role of n fertilizers on weathering suggested by perrin et al 2008 where the rac ratio of 0 5 means that the fertilizer derived nitric acid is involved in the chemical weathering interpolation maps for δ18o of groundwater were drawn using arcgis software version 10 8 esri redlands ca to visualize seasonal variability using ordinary kriging with an exponential model in addition the whole stream network of the catchment was divided into five tributaries and the main stream to evaluate the effect of tributaries on the main stream topographic indices of the subcatchment of each tributary e g stream length mean stream gradient area and mean slope gradient were obtained by spatial analysis using arcgis mixing models that rely on natural tracers allow the assessment of varying contributions of source water to stream network james and roulet 2006 end member mixing analysis emma has been widely used to integrate hydrological response along hydrologic flow paths at the catchment scale hooper 2003 scanlon et al 2001 end members must distinguish from each other and have lower variability than stream water hopper 2011 koh et al 2010 showed that sources of recharge and agricultural contaminants in groundwater were identified by major land uses and δ18o and cl concentration in this study groundwater samples were collected considering the major land uses and shallow groundwater from wells with total depths of 20 m or less was selected as end members that can represent the land uses in this study we defined three end members for groundwater mbd from mountainous area end member a contaminated groundwater from lowland recharge affected by agricultural activities end member b and paddy impounded water with evaporation and denitrification signatures end member c the isotopic composition and no3 concentration of the paddy impounded water is similar to those of irrigation return flow on paddy field reported in lee et al 2021 the three end members showed negligible seasonal variations of major ion compositions and isotopic compositions and similar to the end members reported in koh et al 2010 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of stream water and groundwater based on major ions water samples were classified into two water types ca hco3 and ca cl fig 2 groundwater adjacent to mountainous areas were ca hco3 type and the most of groundwater distributed in agricultural fields were predominantly ca cl type ca hco3 type groundwater had low mineral contents and was subdivided into those with the relatively low cl and no3 concentrations and the others considering that cl concentration in groundwater is about 5 mg l in natural area koh et al 2010 which is much lower than other anions the ca cl type water can be regarded as significantly contaminated water the water type of individual groundwater samples was invariant irrespective of seasons in the dry season stream water in tributaries was a mixture of ca cl and ca hco3 types whereas ca hco3 type was dominant in the main stream on the other hand ca hco3 type was dominant across the stream network during the rainy season groundwater showed a wide range of major ion concentrations with negligible seasonal variations fig 3 koh et al 2009 showed that elevated concentrations of cl and no3 in groundwater were strongly associated with agricultural land uses in the hilly terrains and plains of the study area in contrast stream water had a narrow range of major ion concentrations and showed relatively higher seasonal variability in the concentrations based on the mean values of stream water sio2 concentration was generally higher in the rainy season than in the dry season whereas opposite result was observed for cl and no3 concentrations chemistry of stream water in the study area seemed to be significantly influenced by land uses which is related to elevation groups stream water derived from the mountainous area had lower major ion concentrations than those in stream water in the lower area fig 3 cl and no3 concentrations in stream water were higher at the piedmont area where forest and agricultural fields are mixed in the lower plain area the highest cl and no3 concentrations were observed with the increase in the proportion of agricultural fields near the stream channels in the dry season the mean ec of stream water in the lower area 200 μs cm was approximately two fold higher than that in the upper area 93 μs cm in addition mean cl concentration was 0 18 mmol l in upper stream group 100 m while it was dramatically increased in lower stream group 50 m as 0 43 mmol l in the rainy season the spatial difference was similar to that in the dry season but the rate of increase in the lower area was lower than that in the dry season ca2 and so4 2 concentrations in stream water were gradually increased with the decrease in the elevation fig 4 for stream water rnw was 0 64 in the dry season and 0 54 in the rainy season which is a significant seasonal difference whereas rac was 0 48 irrespective of season fig 5 for groundwater rnw was 0 69 in the dry season and 0 66 in the rainy season with considerable scattering while rac was 0 43 and mostly around 0 5 irrespective of season 3 2 stable isotopic compositions of stream water and groundwater the mean values of δ18o and δ2h of stream water were 7 6 and 50 in the dry season and ranged from 8 5 to 6 6 and from 54 to 44 respectively the mean values of δ18o and δ2h of stream water in the rainy season were 8 3 and 58 and ranged from 9 1 to 7 4 and from 62 to 52 respectively fig 3 the stream water had the most depleted isotopic composition in the upper stream reaches in the mountainous area however the ranges and mean values of δ18o and d excess for stream water varied significantly between seasons fig 3 the mean values of δ18o and δ2h of groundwater were 7 5 and 51 in both dry and rainy seasons respectively in the dry season δ18o and δ2h of groundwater ranged from 9 2 to 5 3 and from 61 to 40 respectively in the rainy season the δ18o and δ2h of groundwater ranged from 9 0 to 5 2 and from 61 to 39 respectively fig 3 the δ18o and δ2h values of most groundwater samples were quite similar irrespective of season whereas those of stream water showed considerable seasonal variation in both seasons δ18o and δ2h of stream water were gradually enriched toward the downstream areas fig 6 in the dry season δ18o and δ2h of stream water in the upstream area were distributed between the local meteoric water lines lmwls for summer and winter with slopes of 7 16 and 7 98 respectively δ18o and δ2h of stream water in the downstream area were plotted near lmwl for summer in the rainy season all δ18o and δ2h of stream water were close to the lmwl for summer δ18o and δ2h of groundwater samples were also closely plotted near the lmwl for summer irrespective of season on the plot of δ18o and δ2h of stream water the slope is commonly used as a proxy to determine the evaporation effect stewart 1975 simpson and herczeg 1991 stream water in this study had a slope of 4 38 in the dry season and of 6 32 in the rainy season indicating that the degree of evaporation in stream water was dependent on seasonal change by contrast δ18o and δ2h of groundwater had a similar slope of 5 50 in the dry season and 5 91 in the rainy season these results suggest that the recharge or inflow of evaporated water is relatively constant in the groundwater flow system groundwater showed no difference in the slope of δ18o and δ2h depending on elevation not shown but stream water showed a clear difference table 1 the highest slope was observed for stream water in the mountainous area 100 m asl and the slope decreased significantly at the piedmont area 50 100 m asl irrespective of season based on the d excess of the elevation groups the seasonal difference in d excess of stream water adjacent to the mountainous area was larger than that of other stream water 3 3 spatial patterns and end member mixing analysis of environmental tracers the changes in water flow systems contributing to stream water can be evaluated by the spatial and temporal distributions of δ18o in the main stream and tributaries along the distance downstream fig 7 in order to visualize spatial distribution of δ18o of stream water it was plotted on the interpolation map for δ18o of groundwater fig 8 the upper stream of the five tributaries located near the mountainous region showed the most depleted δ18o which was gradually enriched with increasing distance downstream regardless of season fig 7 in particular δ18o of stream water in most of tributaries increased toward the downstream area in the dry season on the other hand δ18o of stream water in the main stream was either slightly enriched in the dry season or depleted in the rainy season with the increase in distance downstream which is likely to be the result of successive inflow from tributaries with more enriched dry season or more depleted rainy season isotopic compositions based on isotopic and hydrochemical compositions end member mixing analysis emma was conducted to determine the relative contributions of various groundwater sources to stream water fig 9 most of stream water samples were within the triangle of the three end members on δ18o and no3 rather than δ18o and cl concentration emma results on the plot of δ18o and no3 showed that end member a and end member c dominantly contributed to the stream network in the study area in the dry season the proportions of end members a and c were estimated by ranges from 20 to 75 and from 12 to 65 respectively fig 9 in the rainy season the proportion of end member a significantly increased up to 95 which was accompanied by the decreased contribution of end member c from 0 to 45 in both seasons the contribution of end member a to most of stream water in upper reaches is dominant with more than 75 by contrast contribution of end member b to stream water is much less compared to that of other end members the relative contribution of the water sources to stream water considerably varied with seasons fig 10 particularly changes in the relative contribution of water sources by season were evident in stream water in the piedmont area and lower reaches contribution of end member c to stream water in the piedmont area ranged from 25 to 56 in the dry season while the contribution decreased to less than 25 in the rainy season the main water source in the plain area was end member c with the proportion of 40 65 in the dry season while end member a was the most influential water source with the proportion of 55 95 in the rainy season 4 discussion 4 1 water sources of streamflow in the catchment groundwater in crystalline bedrocks is a major source of stream water and its isotopic compositions and water chemistry are dependent on the flow path flow depth land use and recharge elevation wassenaar et al 2011 liu and yamanaka 2012 wright and novakowski 2019 in terms of flow paths shallow groundwater flows through surficial sediments and weathered zones and deep groundwater through fractured zones underlain by massive non fractured rocks hassan et al 2014 pacheco 2015 the solute concentrations and isotopic compositions of stream water in the study area showed seasonal differences caused by precipitation patterns in particular d excess of stream water reflects seasonal variations depending on the asian monsoon climatic conditions fig s1 i e d excess of precipitation is highest in winter from december to february and lowest in summer from june to september in the korean peninsula lee et al 2003 jung et al 2020 seasonal variation of d excess in stream water indicated that the main sources of stream water quickly respond to precipitation and that their contributions are seasonally variable jung et al 2020 determined mean transit time of mbd in the mountainous area of the study area as 1 5 years using time series data of δ18o koh et al 2010 reported that average groundwater ages in the lowland was about 30 years using cfc contents in groundwater wells 50 m these previous results suggest that groundwater flow in the study area is dominated by annual mixing of precipitation which accounts for negligible seasonal variations of major ion compositions in individual groundwater samples in the study catchment tributaries showed a mixture of ca cl and ca hco3 types in the dry season whereas ca hco3 type was dominant in the whole tributaries in the rainy season jung et al 2016 reported that discharge of headwater streams was much less in the dry season than those in the rainy season lee et al 2021 reported that most of precipitation recharges into the subsurface and groundwater mainly sustains base flow of headwater streams in the dry season considering that agricultural land uses increase toward to the lowland area contaminated groundwater affected by agricultural activities can greatly contribute to stream water in tributaries with decreased contribution of mbd by contrast ca hco3 type water was dominant in the main stream irrespective of season indicating that streamflow in the main stream is derived from the tributaries with higher contribution of mbd kwon et al 2020 reported that elevated concentrations of ca and so4 in groundwater are indicative of agricultural contamination in the study area fig 4 therefore the increase in ca and so4 concentrations with the decrease in the elevation indicates that the inflow of groundwater affected by agricultural contaminations to the stream network increases toward the lowland area in the study area rac of stream water and groundwater was near 0 5 indicating that nitrate from agricultural activities can cause chemical weathering and has an effect on both stream water and groundwater in the study catchment fig 5 in the study area nitrogenous fertilizers have been widely used at a rate of 102 kg ha nonsan si 2018 which can cause soil acidification due to proton release during nitrification ehrlich and ehrlich 1990 numerous studies have reported that chemical fertilizers and manures adversely affect stream water and groundwater quality in agricultural areas lang et al 2006 perrin et al 2008 shin et al 2017 kwon et al 2020 in this regard oh et al 2021 reported that more groundwater inflow occurs in the upper stream reaches based on higher 222rn than lower stream reaches in the study catchment hence different slopes of δ18o and δ2h in stream water according to elevation groups can be attributed to diverse water flow systems contributing to stream water fig 6 and table 1 in particular the slope of δ18o and δ2h in the piedmont area was lower than those in other zones indicating that groundwater inflow containing agricultural contaminants increases in the piedmont area with thin alluvium in the study catchment alluvium is distributed with thicknesses exceeding 20 m on the plain area consisting of agricultural fields but poorly developed in the mountainous area kowaco 2002 in addition permeable sand point bars are generally developed around the lower part of the stream chae et al 2009 these conditions indicate that lateral flow through the sandy layer seems to be the dominant flow path that supplies evaporated water affected by agricultural activities to streams in the plain area considering gaining stream conditions in the dry season 4 2 identification of seasonal changes in the streamflow system heavy rainfall in the rainy season can lead to depleted isotopic composition by amount effect and dilution of solute concentrations lee and lee 1999 in addition dissolved sio2 concentration increases with the increase in depth of flow path in the crystalline bedrock uchida and asano 2010 in this study stream water was isotopically depleted with increased sio2 concentration and decreased cl concentration from dry season to rainy season indicating the increase in contribution of subsurface stormflow in response to higher precipitation the solute concentration and isotopic composition in soil water reflect a balance between precipitation infiltration and evaporation while those of groundwater in fractured aquifers are relatively constant hsieh et al 1998 jung et al 2020 kelly et al 1998 in the mountainous area soil moisture is closely related to infiltration and evaporation in soil layer and spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture plays a key role in controlling the flow paths that generate streamflow kim and jung 2014 penna et al 2011 also reported that main water source contributing to headwater generation is the saturated riparian zone in the dry season whereas subsurface stormflow in the hillslope area in the rainy season varies depending on the soil moisture threshold condition related to seasonal precipitation patterns therefore seasonal changes in solute concentrations and isotopic compositions in tributaries are likely to be mainly influenced by the hydrological condition of soil layer in the mountainous area these results suggest that the responses to precipitation recharge and runoff processes in the mountainous area have a considerable impact on the entire stream network three component mixing using δ18o and no3 revealed the three water sources of stream water as mbd from mountainous area contaminated groundwater from lowland recharge affected by agricultural activities and paddy impounded water with evaporation and denitrification signatures the predominant water source of stream water is mbd and its contribution varies according to seasonal precipitation patterns fig 9 the paddy impounded water is also one of the major water sources that contribute to stream water in the lower reaches in the dry season allen et al 2010 reported that groundwater in crystalline bedrock regions is generally recharged by precipitation and predominantly discharges to stream channel in the dry season chae et al 2010 reported that groundwater level in the mountainous area was more sensitive to precipitation events in this regard the level of shallow groundwater flowing through the weathered zone in mountainous area is sensitive to precipitation intensity uchida et al 2003 therefore precipitation runoff processes in the mountainous hillslope is considered to be a major factor influencing seasonal variations of the whole stream network fig 9 groundwater level in the plain area is affected by agricultural land uses in the study catchment cho et al 2012 the groundwater level in paddy field is higher than the stream water level from march to september however in the same period the groundwater level in dry farmland is lower than the stream water level due to heavy pumping during winter kwon et al 2020 considering the effects of these groundwater level conditions the influence of paddy impounded water on stream water is considered to be relatively higher than that of contaminated water from dry farmland though paddy field and dry farmland show similar spatial distributions fig 10 these indicate that groundwater stream water interactions dominantly impact on stream water around the piedmont area and plain area in the dry season thus groundwater level response and topographic gradient play key roles in stream water generation with various chemical and isotopic signatures in the study area environmental tracers are a useful tool to evaluate hydrological processes in the catchment unfortunately fundamental hydrological data such as stream discharge evapotranspiration and water usage are not available in the study catchment which imposed limitations on delineation of streamflow generation processes jeelani et al 2010 investigated the seasonal variation of isotopic composition along with discharge for spring water and stream water in a mountainous catchment and identified different contributions of snow melt rainfall and baseflow to springs and streams with three distinct periods dor et al 2011 combined a water balance model and isotope techniques to evaluate surface water groundwater interactions in irrigation canals in this aspect future researches are needed in the study catchment linking hydrological data with chemical and isotopic measurements to better understand hydrological functioning of the mountainous areas in the mesoscale stream network 5 conclusions seasonal changes in stable isotopic composition and solute concentration were much larger in stream water compared to groundwater indicating that relative proportions of water sources contributing streamflow were variable depending on the precipitation pattern headwater streams in the mountainous area showed lower solute concentrations and more depleted isotopic compositions than stream water in the downstream area irrespective of season the molar ratios of ca2 mg2 and hco3 no3 were similar for stream water and groundwater indicating that groundwater affected by chemical weathering and agricultural activities mainly contributes to stream water the slope of δ18o and δ2h of stream water decreased with increasing no3 and cl concentration in the piedmont area and plain area where agricultural land uses are dominant indicating that evaporated water from agricultural activities discharge to the stream through permeable alluvium irrespective of season the δ18o of tributaries in the study area became enriched with increasing flow distance due to local groundwater discharge from agricultural fields however the δ18o of the main stream showed different trends in the dry and rainy seasons these results indicate that the δ18o of the main stream is controlled mainly by tributary junctions rather than groundwater inflow from around the stream channel water sources were clearly identified by emma using δ18o and no3 which showed that mbd is a dominant source contributing to stream water across the whole stream network the effect of paddy impounded water generally increased in the dry season and the effect of groundwater in dry farmland where a low groundwater level was maintained due to heavy pumping in winter was not significant irrespective of season these results indicate that streamflow in the mesoscale catchment is significantly affected by the hydrological responses in the mountainous area and the use of groundwater in agricultural fields this study showed that water stable isotopes and solute concentrations can be useful for evaluating seasonal variability of streamflow generation processes in the larger catchment as well as headwater catchments our results revealed that the hydrological response in the mountainous area is a major factor influencing seasonal variations of the whole stream network in particular the decrease in concentration of contaminants from agricultural activities in the rainy season is due to the increased contribution of stream water originating from the mountainous area these findings suggest that mountainous headwater catchments and piedmont areas are crucial for management of water resources of the mesoscale

8089,study region this study is focused on 12 basins in mainland spain where monthly series longer than 30 years of near natural streamflow measurements are available it covers areas with different climate conditions study focus the potential impact of future climate change scenarios on water resources in the spanish basins is studied it takes into account uncertainties in the estimation of local climate conditions and the propagation of the impact due to the structural uncertainties related with the adopted conceptual numerical approach local climate scenarios are derived from available regional climate model rcm simulations after statistical downscaling the future scenarios have been generated assuming two hypotheses of future warming for two basins in mainland spain 1 5ºc and 3ºc in each of these basins the local climate scenarios have been propagated by using 4 hydrological models with sufficient capacity to reproduce the historical dynamic providing values of above 5 in a 0 9 range for the grading method used new hydrological insights the results show a significant spatial heterogeneity of the impact of climate change on the mean streamflow in spanish basins the highest reductions of flow appear in the wetter northern basins the seasonality of the impact is also significant with the highest reductions during autumn and the smallest changes in the summer months finally the highest uncertainties in this climate change impact assessment are due to the rcm projections with the influence of the hydrological models being significantly smaller graphical abstract

strategies to climate change and compare them for different scenarios note that the targets for climate change adaptation and mitigation have been set at levels of global mean temperature change relative to preindustrial levels donnelly et al 2017 a rational assessment of adaptation strategies for a sustainable planning and management of water resource systems requires the potential sources of uncertainties to be taken into account pulido velazquez et al 2018b in the literature we can find many classification schemes of sources of uncertainty and quantitative methods and tools for their assessment in integrated models matott et al 2009 the focus of this paper is to visualize the uncertainties related to the statistical correction techniques applied to the climate model simulations regional climate models rcm nested to general circulation models gcm and hydrological model structures we have used three correction techniques under two different approaches delta change and bias correction to downscale simulation from nine rcms four lumped conceptual hydrological models have been considered to incorporate model structure uncertainties in the novel methodology for visualizing monthly streamflow projections and uncertainty bounds hydrological models based on model equations have been used to propagate climate scenarios to perform impact studies about the availability of water resources in different systems they reconstruct computational features of water movement in the hydrological cycle abdollahi et al 2018 pedro monzonís et al 2015 and predict future ones ivezic et al 2017 these approaches are also known as mass balance models in which the total inflows in a watershed are equal to total outflows plus changes in storage systems in reservoirs and aquifers taking into account the spatial discretization of the watershed the hydrological balance models can be classified into distributed pseudo distributed and lumped the parametrization of the former is carried out at the cell level reaching thus a higher level of detail of the watershed furthermore the development of software tools has greatly increased providing more detailed distributed results senent aparicio et al 2018a taking into account the heterogeneities of the system this claimed advantage may become a significant inconvenience when the available information is scarce paudel et al 2011 decreasing its effectiveness viney et al 2005 that lumped conceptual models may be able to overcome croke et al 2004 they aggregate the parameters that describe the hydrological system namely the physical processes of the watershed are assumed as homogenous moreover lumped conceptual models are less time consuming they need less data and definition requirements are much lower frequently producing better performance compared to complex distributed ones vansteenkiste et al 2014 as well as a higher efficiency in calibration processes bomann et al 2009 indeed many studies have confirmed that lumped and distributed models provide similar accuracy lobligeois et al 2014 smith et al 2012 agip et al 2012 breuer et al 2009 zhang et al 2004 koren et al 2004 ajami et al 2004 reed et al 2004 boyle et al 2001 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 shah et al 1996 vansteenkiste et al 2014 and smith et al 2012 demonstrated that lumped conceptual models provided better performance than the distributed ones in the assessment of flow at the catchment outlet in belgium and the oklahoma region respectively in spain martínez santos and andreu 2010 evaluated lumped and distributed models in a semi arid aquifer recharge obtaining better agreement with the former ones likewise pérez sánchez et al 2019 carried out a comparative study of six lumped conceptual models in several basins with different climate conditions within spain with satisfactory results senent aparicio et al 2018b also used multiple monthly water balance models to evaluate gridded precipitation products in spain some of the latest research studies undertaken using lumped conceptual models have assessed catchment discharge kumar et al 2015 van esse et al 2013 velázquez et al 2010 have analyzed transferability within different climate conditions broderick et al 2016 bourgin et al 2015 or have evaluated the impact of climate change haque et al 2015 jiang et al 2007 in this study we propose a novel study of the potential impact of future climate change on water resources in spanish basins where near natural streamflow measurements are available the main objective is to assess the impact of climate change on the water balance of the selected basins we also aim to quantify the uncertainty of this impact we have considered different statistical correction techniques of climate models with two approaches delta change and bias correction nine rcms and four hydrological model structures it has allowed us to assess monthly streamflow projections and uncertainty bounds the selected drainage basins are located at the headwaters of the rivers analyzed they are considered to be in a natural regime since upstream of the gauging stations there are no significant anthropic alterations dams dykes pumping etc that could modify the natural flow regime of these rivers the study covers different climate conditions taking into account the uncertainties in the estimation related with the local climate conditions and the propagation of the impact due to the structural uncertainties related with the adopted conceptual numerical approach we have used different hypotheses and statistical techniques to define multiple local future scenarios in each basin where the impact is propagated by using different hydrological models with the ability to reproduce the historical natural dynamic we have also analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of climate changes based on the hydrological results in different spanish basins the generated series may also be useful in future studies to analyze the impact of climate change on drought collados lara et al 2021a which may be very relevant for identifying and analyzing potential adaptation strategies to minimize future issues related with the supply of water demands and or environmental impact 2 materials description of the study area and the available information the natural flow regime may be modified through different pressures such as dams the extraction of surface water aquifer overexploitation and land cover and land use lclu changes where the impact may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change streamflow data from gauging stations of unaltered basins provide relevant information about natural regime streamflow that in addition to watershed attributes allow the modeling of the hydrologic cycle and its use to predict the influence of anthropogenic or climate alterations thus to ensure the validity of the results carried in this study the 12 selected catchments fig 1 are situated in natural regimes 2 1 location climate and geological context spain presents a wide variety of climates due to both geographic and atmospheric features the iberian peninsula with an average altitude of 600 m above sea level m a s l has several mountainous terrains that are higher than 1000 m a s l which causes an average vertical temperature gradient of 0 65ºc every 100 m although in some higher alpine regions the theoretical climate gradient may change locally in a significant way collados lara et al 2021b 2018b furthermore the west east mountain disposal encourages the entry of the atlantic air masses but blocks meridian air masses north south moreover the linear coasts with few inbounds and coasted parallel reliefs contribute to most peninsular areas being isolated from the sea thus the inland regions show a marked continental climate with high variations of temperature between the summer and the winter whilst the coastal areas have only slight temperature variations all of these features mean that the iberian peninsula has a large disparity of climates within the mild one the 12 studied watersheds cover a major part of the iberian peninsula fig 1 ranging from 29 to 837 km2 of area and their altitudes vary from 342 to 1550 m a s l they represent the most common climates in the peninsula according to köppen s classification köppen 1884 1918 köppen and geiger 1936 csb warm summer mediterranean csa hot summer mediterranean climate cfb temperate oceanic and unep aridity index unep 1997 according the unep aridity index aiu measured as the ratio between the average annual precipitation p and the potential evapotranspiration pet all of the studied basins located in the north of spain pue beg tre cot lem and and are classified as humid aiu 1 00 as well as pri in the center of spain the gar seg and zum catchments are classified as humid sub humid 1 00 aiu 0 65 due to their altitude above 700 m a s l and the remaining two bol and jub may be considered as dry sub humid 0 50 aiu 0 65 no arid basin was taken into account in this study due to the unsatisfactory performance shown for the lumped conceptual models used pérez sánchez et al 2019 the 12 basins are located in the main lithology groups of the iberian peninsula siliceous and calcareous the beg pue and tre basins in north east and the gar in the west belong to the former group where granite gneiss quartz marble and slate are the main materials the bol jub seg y zum basins in the east and lem and pri and cot in the north are predominantly calcareous with limestone casts and loam rocks the snowmelt does not have a significant influence on the water resources in the selected basins eight of the basins pue beg tre cot lem and gar have a mean elevation below 700 m a s l and therefore snow rarely appears the seg 1418 m a s l and zum 1543 m a s l are located in southern spain where the snow at these altitudes is not significant due to the warm climate finally jub and pri located in central spain also have a moderate elevation 1150 and 1256 m a s l respectively and the influence of snow melt is not significant 2 2 historical climate and hydrological data temperature and precipitation data series in the historical studied period 1980 2010 have been obtained from the cedex centre of studies and experimentation of civil work for the spanish government álvarez et al 2004 at a spatial resolution of 500 500 m estrela and quintas 1996 the average temperatures range from 11 to 15ºc with a positive gradient to the south fig 2a precipitation disparities are much higher fig 2b varying between 1563 mm in the and basin and 510 mm in the jub basin with a marked rainfall gradient from the northwest to the southeast potential evapotranspiration was calculated by using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 this simple approach only requires minimum maximum and mean temperature and solar radiation we have used the solution proposed by samani 2000 which uses tabulated values depending on the latitude to calculate the solar radiation streamflow data come from the gauging stations of the official spanish network the average of completed data series in the period 1980 2010 for the studied basins is higher than 97 the basins located in the north of spain show the highest values around 70mm3 year whilst basins with the most severe climates such as bol have a monthly average streamflow lower than 1mm3 year fig 2d 2 3 climate model simulation data control and future scenarios we have used results obtained from the simulation of nine climate models see table 1 under the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 emission scenario it is the most pessimistic scenario included in the fifth assessment report ar5 ipcc 2014 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the ipcc is the united nations body for assessing the science related to climate change the climate model simulation data were taken from the website of the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment for the european domain euro cordex project 2018 the rcm simulations which include control historical simulations and future results up to2100 are nested to different gcm these nine climate models were randomly selected assuming that all the rcms included the euro cordex project are good enough to generate potential future scenarios we have also assumed that the nine climate models are enough to assess the uncertainty related to the rcms 2 4 calibrated hydrological balance models an assessment of four hydrological balance models abcd gr2m australian water balance model awbm and guo 5p in the historical studied period 1980 2010 was carried out in the twelve basins and six statistical indices the akaike information criterion aic the bayesian information criterion bic nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the relative error between the observed and simulated run off volumes rev were used to calibrate and validate them and their use in the propagation of the climate scenarios pérez sánchez et al 2019 demonstrated that regardless of the basin area these lumped conceptual hydrological models performed well in humid and sub humid watersheds according to moriasi et al 2007 the more humid the basin is the better the results that are obtained which indicates the strong influence of climate characteristics gr2m proved to be the model with the best performance whenever aiu is higher than 1 with nse values above 0 75 in a 95 confidence interval on the contrary the driest regions did not register satisfactory results but the estimation of total volumes with guo 5p showed differences below 12 or even lower in dry sub humid regions it was also evident that a set of goodness of fit measures should be used in order to provide accuracy and robustness to the application of the hydrological model and the use of a specific one largely depends on the aim of the research 3 method theory calculation the proposed methodology is summarized in fig 3 the first step of the methodology is the generation of local climate scenarios we considered two scenarios according to the two considered hypotheses of warming in spain 1 5 and 3 0ºc these constraints are used to select the series of the rcm simulations the outputs of these rcms are corrected and adapted to the local conditions by using three statistical techniques under two different approaches delta change and bias correction the local future meteorological scenarios are propagated with four hydrological balance models finally the impact of climate change was assessed by comparing the historical streamflow in the reference period with the future projections the different combinations of rcms statistical techniques and correction approaches and hydrological models allow us to quantify the uncertainty of the climate change signal 3 1 generation of future local climate change scenarios the future results have been selected from the rcm simulations under two different hypotheses of future levels of warming in spain 1 5ºc and 3ºc spain due to its location and hydro meteorological conditions is one of the most vulnerable countries within the eu the study covers areas with different climate conditions within spain the assessment of the impact of climate change s and its uncertainty under different scenarios 1 5 and 3 0ºc is a key task to be undertaken before the study of adaptation and mitigation strategies for each rcm we selected series simulated for two future 30 year periods which respectively fulfill the hypotheses of 1 5 and 3 0ºc of warming within spain for the scenario rcp 8 5 those increments in mean temperature were calculated with respect to the control simulation series of the rcms for the reference period 1976 2005 we obtained different 30 year future horizons for each rcm but these periods represent the same hypothesis of warming see table 2 the historical and control simulation series from rcms in the reference period 1976 2005 and the future simulations of rcms for the periods shown in table 2 were used to generate the potential future scenarios by applying the described statistical downscaling procedure for the selected rcms the mean temperature in the reference period varies from 10 5 to 12 6ºc for spain the maximum differences between the future horizons for the 1 5 and 3 0ºc warming hypotheses in the different rcms are for 6 years and 10 years respectively see table 2 the ground tool collados lara et al 2020b is used to generate multiple future local climate change scenarios by applying different statistical downscaling techniques first moment correction first and second moment correction and regression in the first moment correction technique the transformation function only tries to improve the approximation to the mean values pulido velazquez et al 2015 the second moment correction technique also tries to provide a good approximation for the standard deviation collados lara et al 2018a the regression technique defines the transformation function by adjusting a regression model chen et al 2014 these techniques are used under two different conceptual approaches delta change and bias correction räty et al 2014 in the delta change approach the transformation function is obtained by using the future and control rcm simulations it assumes that the changes described by this transformation function can be directly applied to the historical series to obtain potential future local series the bias correction approach defines the transformation function from the historical series and control simulation series the objective is to obtain a corrected control simulation series where the statistics are similar to the historical ones in the reference period this function can also be applied to correct the future rcm simulations to obtain potential future local series different correction techniques or statistical methods can be applied for each approach delta change and bias correction table 3 the combination of approach and correction technique give rise to six potential scenarios for each available rcm simulation nested to a gcm which produce a total number of 54 potential future climate change scenarios for each combination of basin which is the scale used to generate the potential future scenarios and warming scenarios in the case of the bias correction approach we also obtain corrected control simulation for the reference period the mean annual values of precipitation and temperature of the control simulations before and after correction and historical series in the reference period 1976 2005 are shown in appendix g of the supplementary material 3 2 propagation of climate scenarios with the selected hydrological balance models four lumped conceptual hydrological models abcd gr2m awbm and guo 5p defined by using different conceptual approaches fig 4 have been explored in each of the selected basins we assessed the ability of these lumped conceptual hydrological models to reproduce the historical dynamic of the resources this was assessed in accordance with different statistical indices aic akaike 1973 1974 bic fabozzi et al 2014 nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 pearson 1895 pbias gupta et al 1999 and rev karpouzos et al 2011 we agreed the selection of the four water balance models after a thorough literature review of the performance of these models in different climate regions in europe in fact pellicer martinez and martinez paz 2015 found that the abcd model had the best performance in southern spain wriedtand and bouraoiu 2009 used gr2m model and obtained high nse in the northern half of the iberian peninsula and in french and german basins awbm performed well in the french alps reaching a nse value of 0 79 yu and zhu 2015 guo 5p is particularly recommended in humid and semi humid regions guo 1995 the abcd 4 parameter model thomas jr 1981 is an example of simple hydrologic model for simulating streamflow it consists of two zones the non saturated zone nsz and the saturated zone sz precipitation p is divided into evapotranspiration et and drainage into aquifers or rivers and the excess becomes surface run off qs or drainage run off qg the gr2m model makhlouf and michel 1994 was developed by the cemagref centre of agricultural and environmental research of france p is divided into run off through two equations production and transfer functions and is distributed between s and g the latter is considered to have limited capacity the awbm model boughton 2009 has three surface storage tanks s1 s2 and s3 and the water balance is assessed separately qs is obtained from one part of the surplus of the tanks whilst the other part is drained to g which is converted into qg guo 5p xiong and guo 1999 is particularly used in humid and sub humid regions q is obtained adding qs qg and the subsurface run off qb the 4 models considered are satisfactory abcd gr2m awbm guo 5p in all the basins in accordance with the widely used criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 based on the nse r2 and pbias values and we also carried out an uncertainty analysis of their results the hydrological balance models were used to simulate the generated future local climate scenarios for each future projection the hydrological impact is assessed by comparing the output of the hydrological balance models obtained by simulating the observed historical climate in the reference period with the output generated with the future climate series it is the only way to perform these analyses when the delta change approach is applied because it does not generate corrected simulation series for the reference period for this reason in order to make the impact assessment comparable in both approaches delta change and bias correction we have also compared the future simulated flows with the historical simulated series nevertheless the differences between observed climate series and the corrected climate simulation for the reference period in the bias correction approaches are minimal see appendix g 3 3 analyses of climate change impacts and its uncertainties we used the propagation of the future potential local scenarios by using the hydrological models to analyze the hydrological impact of climate change taking into account the differences between the potential future hydrology and the historical ones the uncertainty of the impact of climate change was analyzed taking into account the component due to the considered potential local scenarios and due to the applied hydrological models structural uncertainty it was studied taking into account the variability of climate change impact results introduced by the scenarios and by their propagation we have used box whisker plots to summarize the impacts and their uncertainty it shows the mean and median values the upper and lower extremes and outliers the lower extremes are defined as q1 1 5icr and the upper extreme as q3 1 5icr where q1 and q3 are the first and third quartile and icr is the interquartile range which is calculated as the difference between q3 and q1 the values below or above the extreme values are considered outliers 4 results and discussion 4 1 local climate change scenarios from the selected simulations tables 1 and 2 we obtained the average change in monthly precipitation in see fig 5 and temperature in ºc see fig 6 within each basin in general the highest changes will appear in the southern basins the reduction in the precipitation moves from 3 2 lem basin to a maximum around 21 5 21 4 in seg basin and 21 3 in zum in the scenario of 3 0ºc in this 3ºc global warming scenario the increase in temperature goes from 2 5ºc beg and tre basins to 3 5ºc seg and zum basins the box whiskers of the monthly changes in precipitation and temperature fig 7 show the highest interquartile differences in the 3ºc warming scenario in both variables temperature and precipitation in all the basins the highest interquartile ranges in these 3ºc scenarios appear in the basins located in the humid western area pue beg tre and gar we have also analyzed the global seasonality of the changes in precipitation and temperature that correspond to the selected rcm simulations figs 8 and 9 in the 3ºc warming scenario all the months show a reduction of mean precipitation with the exception of february see fig 8 the percentages of reduction increase during the summer months this is consistent with previous studies which projected a future decrease in summer precipitation over southern europe matte et al 2019 the highest standard deviations of the monthly changes are also expected during the summer months the monthly mean changes in temperature are also higher in the 3ºc warming scenario with the maximum during the summer but also with significant increases in the autumn see fig 8 the highest standard deviations of the monthly changes are also observed during the summer and autumn in this paper we have considered different sources of uncertainty in the generation of local climate change scenarios climate model simulations including both different gcms and rcms nested to them and downscaling techniques including different statistical correction methods first moment second moment and regression under the delta change and the bias correction assumption section 4 3 as an example we show the multiple series generated in one of the basins seg taking into account the cited sources of uncertainties fig 9 the uncertainty related to the precipitation in the potential scenarios is higher than the uncertainty related to temperature we have also represented the ensemble series in the literature we can find many examples in which the assessment of future impact is limited to the propagation of some ensemble scenarios pulido velazquez et al 2018a escriva bou et al 2017 these ensemble scenarios are more representative of the potentially expected future conditions than the individual ones pulido velazquez et al 2015 aemet 2009 nevertheless their use rather than the use of the simulation of multiple individual scenarios will produce a loss of information about the uncertainty of the impact of future climate conditions in the seg basin for the warming scenarios 1 5 and 3 0ºc the mean reduction of mean monthly precipitation are respectively 10 3 and 15 7 mm and the increment of temperature is1 8 and 3 5ºc respectively see fig 9 4 2 propagation of climate scenarios with the selected hydrological balance models the hydrological models abcd gr2m awbm and guo 5p that are satisfactory table 4 will be employed to simulate the generated future local climate scenarios in each basin we assume that the parameters of the hydrological models which are calibrated and validated in the historical period to propagate the impact of climate change on hydrology will stay invariant in the future therefore we do not consider a potential retroaction of lclu due to climate change under this assumption those models with a good performance in the historical period will be also be good for simulating the hydrological impact in future climate scenarios according to moriasi et al 2007 a model gives a very good performance if the classification sum value is above 7 good if it is between 5 and 7 and satisfactory when it is above 3 an unsatisfactory model does not reach 3 values a detailed explanation of the goodness of fit tests used is shown in the supplementary material the best performances are reached in humid watersheds for all the models though there are marked changes between results in calibration can be observed 1980 1995 and validation 1995 2010 stages depending on the hydrological model selected each basin has at least one model with satisfactory results but the gar jub and zum provide lowest value in the abcd or and awbm models gr2m provides better results in nearly all the watersheds than previous models but guo 5p has greater stability on average with the highest grading 9 0 in several basins both humid and semi arid ones following the recommendations of arnold et al 2012 the selected calibration period includes dry and wet periods to ensure that it reflects the range of conditions under which the model is expected to operate furthermore an uncertainty analysis has been carried out with the values obtained differentiating between models and basins fig 10 the box whiskers in fig 10a assess the error in simulated streamflow concerning the hydrological model the results highlight the wide climatological variability in spain although the median and length of boxes are pretty similar for all the models except the gr2m the numerous outliers have some sort of normality effect as their extension in graphics is even greater than 50 of the sample these outliers can be explained because the models do not adequately represent the peak flows as can be seen in the supplementary material so the highest maximums of streamflow observed exceed simulated streamflow peaks in spite of these outliers total error in predicting streamflow fig 10b in calibration and validation periods is below 20 in the four models and it is usually negative except fortheguo5p model indicating a general over prediction furthermore the gr2m model shrinks its length by nearly 50 compared to the others and it is the only one that appears to show some over prediction though often much lower than the examples on the opposite side fig 10c represents the variation of nse both in calibration and validation for all the studied basins gar and jub show in general the worst results due to their aridity reaching values of below 0 15 with the abcd and awbm models only the gr2m provides satisfactory results in both stages of all the basins with nse values over 0 55 guo5p shows similar homogeneity with an average nse of 0 73 despite the 0 30 value in the gar basin for calibration no significant differences were found between the calibration and validation periods the results of these simulations will be used to analyze the hydrological impact of climate change and its uncertainties taking into account the differences between the potential future hydrology and the historical ones 4 3 analyses of climate change impact and its uncertainties the use of different hydrological models to propagate the scenarios will allow us to consider in climate change impact assessment the structural uncertainty coming from different conceptual hydrological models in addition to the uncertainty coming from the local climate scenarios mattots et al 2019 in this section we have analyzed the changes of future potential streamflow in mm compared to the historical values these mm units have allowed us to compare values without the influence of the basin size we have analyzed the variability by basin months of the year rcms and hydrological model used note that the influence of the correction approach or the statistical technique applied to rcms is low for example considering the and basin the hydrological model abcd and the scenario 1 5ºc the variation coefficient of the mean streamflow for each rcm with respect to the correction approach technique applied varies from 0 6 to 1 9 for the rest of cases these values are similar fig 11 summarises the monthly impact on the different basins that show a significant spatial heterogeneity as previous studies in spain have already indicated the magnitude of this impact will depend on the level of warming and the geographical characteristics of each basin rasilla et al 2013 the mean monthly historical streamflow in the basin covers a wide range of values between 2 6 mm in the jub basin and 140 7 mm in the pue basin fig 11b the highest reductions in mm appear in the wetter basins located in northern spain see fig 11b with a maximum of 15 0 mm in the pue basin for the 3 0ºc warming scenario with the minimum reduction being obtained in the southern basin 2 4 mm in zum the variability of the potential changes in mm is also clearly higher in the northern basins especially for the 3 0ºc scenario however the southern basins show the higher relative changes in as we have also shown for precipitation and temperature fig 12 summarises the results within the 12 basins derived from all the projections 54 projections and rainfall recharge models 4 propagations in terms of monthly changes in a mean year in general the higher mean reductions and variability of the monthly streamflow values are associated to the warming scenario of 3 0ºc fig 12a it gives us a global idea of the temporal distribution and or seasonality of the impact of climate change the maximum streamflow reductions appear in autumn it contributes to a more pronounced low water level period in the summer as indicated in previous studies in spain rasilla et al 2013 morán tejeda et al 2014 significant reductions are also observed during the spring with the smallest changes occurring in the summer months the highest values of changes in standard deviation are also obtained during the autumn months and the smallest in the summer months fig 12b the estimated impact will depend on the combined influence of the different selected rcms the approach delta change or bias correction and correction techniques applied to generate the local climate models and the hydrological models used to propagate the impact to the streamflow previous studies have shown that the variability in the climate variable due to rcms is higher than the variability due to correction approaches collados lara et al 2018a pardo igúzquiza et al 2019 in this study we have also tried to analyze the impact on the streamflow introduced by the selected rcms fig 13 and hydrological models fig 14 for the two considered warming scenarios 3ºc and 1 5ºc the discussion will be focused on the 3ºc scenarios in which the highest impact will be observed in all the cases fig 13 summarises the impact obtained for the 12 basins derived from all the correction techniques and rainfall recharge models 4 propagations when we fix a rcm model the differences between the estimated mean impacts depending on the selected rcm are significant with values that move from 4 4 mm rcm5 to 10 7 mm rcm 4 in the most pessimistic scenario the 3ºc warming scenario the interquartile range also shows significant differences with the smallest range of 3 7 mm rcm 5 and the greatest of a maximum of 10 3 mm rcm 1 these differences on the estimated impact depending on the hydrological models are significantly smaller they move from 8 0 to 9 1 mm for the warming scenario of 3 0ºc fig 14 the changes in the interquartile ranges are also significantly smaller and move from 6 5 mm in the smallest gr2m gr4 to 8 9 mm in the greatest abcd similar methodologies and consistent results were obtained in the assessment of climate change impact on precipitation matte et al 2019 and streamflow rasilla et al 2013 morán tejeda et al 2014 in previous studies in spanish basins the main novelty of this paper is that we also assess the uncertainty of the potential impact coming from different sources we have considered different statistical correction techniques of climate model simulations with two approaches delta change and bias correction results from nine rcm models and four hydrological model structures it has allowed us to assess monthly streamflow changes and uncertainty bounds for the two selected warming scenarios the uncertainty analysis showed that the highest variability and uncertainties related to climate change impact assessment on streamflow are due to the rcm projections with the influence of the employed downscaling techniques and hydrological models used being significantly smaller 5 conclusions in this study we have analyzed the impact of climate change on water resources in 12 spanish basins in which sufficiently long monthly historical streamflow measurements monthly series longer than 30 years are available to calibrate rainfall runoff models for near natural conditions the 12 basins have been selected to cover different climate conditions identified in spain with an aridity index of above 0 5 local climate scenarios have been generated in accordance with the available rcm simulations in agreement with the fifth rcp scenarios defined by the ipcc the future scenarios have been generated from the rcm simulations by assuming two hypotheses of future level of warming in spain 1 5ºc and 3ºc in each of these basins the local climate scenarios have been propagated by using 4 hydrological models abcd gr2m awbm and guo 5p with a sufficient ability to reproduce the historical dynamic in accordance with different statistical indices aic bic nse r2 pbias and rev the results have allowed us to assess the future potential impact on water resources taking into account different sources of uncertainties related with local scenarios and conceptual hydrological models applied to propagate them structural uncertainty the impact of climate change on streamflow shows a significant spatial heterogeneity with the highest reduction in mm of flow in the wetter northern basins the seasonality of the impact is also significant with the highest absolute reductions during autumn and the smallest changes in absolute values in the summer months the results also show that the highest variability and uncertainties related to the impact of these climate change s assessments are due to the rcm projections with the influence of the downscaling techniques and hydrological models used being significantly less credit authorship contribution statement d pulido velazquez conceptualization

8089,study region this study is focused on 12 basins in mainland spain where monthly series longer than 30 years of near natural streamflow measurements are available it covers areas with different climate conditions study focus the potential impact of future climate change scenarios on water resources in the spanish basins is studied it takes into account uncertainties in the estimation of local climate conditions and the propagation of the impact due to the structural uncertainties related with the adopted conceptual numerical approach local climate scenarios are derived from available regional climate model rcm simulations after statistical downscaling the future scenarios have been generated assuming two hypotheses of future warming for two basins in mainland spain 1 5ºc and 3ºc in each of these basins the local climate scenarios have been propagated by using 4 hydrological models with sufficient capacity to reproduce the historical dynamic providing values of above 5 in a 0 9 range for the grading method used new hydrological insights the results show a significant spatial heterogeneity of the impact of climate change on the mean streamflow in spanish basins the highest reductions of flow appear in the wetter northern basins the seasonality of the impact is also significant with the highest reductions during autumn and the smallest changes in the summer months finally the highest uncertainties in this climate change impact assessment are due to the rcm projections with the influence of the hydrological models being significantly smaller graphical abstract

areas especially sensitive to these climate changes is the mediterranean region cramer et al 2018 where frequent and intensive droughts occur and which will be exacerbated in the future tramblay et al 2020 hayes et al 2011 in particular in spain there are several research studies that have shown the significant potential impact of climate change at different scales of water resource systems aquifer pulido velazquez et al 2012 tigabu et al 2020 rupérez moreno et al 2017 pardo igúzquiza et al 2019 baena ruiz et al 2020 basin pulido velazquez et al 2011 molina navarro et al 2016 senent aparicio et al 2017 2019 2018 pérez sánchez et al 2020 those impact studies require the generation of potential local climate change scenarios by using bias correction and downscaling techniques collados lara et al 2018a 2020a and their propagation using different hydrological llopis albert and pulido velazquez 2015 pulido velazquez et al 2007a 2007b agronomical pulido velazquez et al 2018a and or management models pulido velazquez et al 2008 2006 several climate models have been used to simulate the rcp representative concentration pathway scenarios published by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in the ipcc ar5 assessment report nevertheless in order to make this information useful to assess the impact of climate change on specific water resources systems we need to correct downscale it by using local information we have to perform statistical corrections of the climate model simulations to adapt their values in accordance with the observed historical data available in the system pulido velazquez et al 2015 2011 in the literature we can find examples in which these local scenarios are defined for specific future horizons short term coming decades e g collados lara et al 2020a mid term e g escriba bou et al 2012 and or long term horizons referring to the last decades of this century pulido velazquez et al 2015 other recent research studies refer to a specific level of warming collados lara et al 2020b with the information coming from series of the climate model simulations in which the horizon is identified by using a constraint where a certain warming threshold is reached at a global scale or at a certain region area eg mediterranean region tramblay et al 2020 this what if approach is useful for assessing the impact and design of adaptation strategies to climate change and compare them for different scenarios note that the targets for climate change adaptation and mitigation have been set at levels of global mean temperature change relative to preindustrial levels donnelly et al 2017 a rational assessment of adaptation strategies for a sustainable planning and management of water resource systems requires the potential sources of uncertainties to be taken into account pulido velazquez et al 2018b in the literature we can find many classification schemes of sources of uncertainty and quantitative methods and tools for their assessment in integrated models matott et al 2009 the focus of this paper is to visualize the uncertainties related to the statistical correction techniques applied to the climate model simulations regional climate models rcm nested to general circulation models gcm and hydrological model structures we have used three correction techniques under two different approaches delta change and bias correction to downscale simulation from nine rcms four lumped conceptual hydrological models have been considered to incorporate model structure uncertainties in the novel methodology for visualizing monthly streamflow projections and uncertainty bounds hydrological models based on model equations have been used to propagate climate scenarios to perform impact studies about the availability of water resources in different systems they reconstruct computational features of water movement in the hydrological cycle abdollahi et al 2018 pedro monzonís et al 2015 and predict future ones ivezic et al 2017 these approaches are also known as mass balance models in which the total inflows in a watershed are equal to total outflows plus changes in storage systems in reservoirs and aquifers taking into account the spatial discretization of the watershed the hydrological balance models can be classified into distributed pseudo distributed and lumped the parametrization of the former is carried out at the cell level reaching thus a higher level of detail of the watershed furthermore the development of software tools has greatly increased providing more detailed distributed results senent aparicio et al 2018a taking into account the heterogeneities of the system this claimed advantage may become a significant inconvenience when the available information is scarce paudel et al 2011 decreasing its effectiveness viney et al 2005 that lumped conceptual models may be able to overcome croke et al 2004 they aggregate the parameters that describe the hydrological system namely the physical processes of the watershed are assumed as homogenous moreover lumped conceptual models are less time consuming they need less data and definition requirements are much lower frequently producing better performance compared to complex distributed ones vansteenkiste et al 2014 as well as a higher efficiency in calibration processes bomann et al 2009 indeed many studies have confirmed that lumped and distributed models provide similar accuracy lobligeois et al 2014 smith et al 2012 agip et al 2012 breuer et al 2009 zhang et al 2004 koren et al 2004 ajami et al 2004 reed et al 2004 boyle et al 2001 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 shah et al 1996 vansteenkiste et al 2014 and smith et al 2012 demonstrated that lumped conceptual models provided better performance than the distributed ones in the assessment of flow at the catchment outlet in belgium and the oklahoma region respectively in spain martínez santos and andreu 2010 evaluated lumped and distributed models in a semi arid aquifer recharge obtaining better agreement with the former ones likewise pérez sánchez et al 2019 carried out a comparative study of six lumped conceptual models in several basins with different climate conditions within spain with satisfactory results senent aparicio et al 2018b also used multiple monthly water balance models to evaluate gridded precipitation products in spain some of the latest research studies undertaken using lumped conceptual models have assessed catchment discharge kumar et al 2015 van esse et al 2013 velázquez et al 2010 have analyzed transferability within different climate conditions broderick et al 2016 bourgin et al 2015 or have evaluated the impact of climate change haque et al 2015 jiang et al 2007 in this study we propose a novel study of the potential impact of future climate change on water resources in spanish basins where near natural streamflow measurements are available the main objective is to assess the impact of climate change on the water balance of the selected basins we also aim to quantify the uncertainty of this impact we have considered different statistical correction techniques of climate models with two approaches delta change and bias correction nine rcms and four hydrological model structures it has allowed us to assess monthly streamflow projections and uncertainty bounds the selected drainage basins are located at the headwaters of the rivers analyzed they are considered to be in a natural regime since upstream of the gauging stations there are no significant anthropic alterations dams dykes pumping etc that could modify the natural flow regime of these rivers the study covers different climate conditions taking into account the uncertainties in the estimation related with the local climate conditions and the propagation of the impact due to the structural uncertainties related with the adopted conceptual numerical approach we have used different hypotheses and statistical techniques to define multiple local future scenarios in each basin where the impact is propagated by using different hydrological models with the ability to reproduce the historical natural dynamic we have also analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of climate changes based on the hydrological results in different spanish basins the generated series may also be useful in future studies to analyze the impact of climate change on drought collados lara et al 2021a which may be very relevant for identifying and analyzing potential adaptation strategies to minimize future issues related with the supply of water demands and or environmental impact 2 materials description of the study area and the available information the natural flow regime may be modified through different pressures such as dams the extraction of surface water aquifer overexploitation and land cover and land use lclu changes where the impact may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change streamflow data from gauging stations of unaltered basins provide relevant information about natural regime streamflow that in addition to watershed attributes allow the modeling of the hydrologic cycle and its use to predict the influence of anthropogenic or climate alterations thus to ensure the validity of the results carried in this study the 12 selected catchments fig 1 are situated in natural regimes 2 1 location climate and geological context spain presents a wide variety of climates due to both geographic and atmospheric features the iberian peninsula with an average altitude of 600 m above sea level m a s l has several mountainous terrains that are higher than 1000 m a s l which causes an average vertical temperature gradient of 0 65ºc every 100 m although in some higher alpine regions the theoretical climate gradient may change locally in a significant way collados lara et al 2021b 2018b furthermore the west east mountain disposal encourages the entry of the atlantic air masses but blocks meridian air masses north south moreover the linear coasts with few inbounds and coasted parallel reliefs contribute to most peninsular areas being isolated from the sea thus the inland regions show a marked continental climate with high variations of temperature between the summer and the winter whilst the coastal areas have only slight temperature variations all of these features mean that the iberian peninsula has a large disparity of climates within the mild one the 12 studied watersheds cover a major part of the iberian peninsula fig 1 ranging from 29 to 837 km2 of area and their altitudes vary from 342 to 1550 m a s l they represent the most common climates in the peninsula according to köppen s classification köppen 1884 1918 köppen and geiger 1936 csb warm summer mediterranean csa hot summer mediterranean climate cfb temperate oceanic and unep aridity index unep 1997 according the unep aridity index aiu measured as the ratio between the average annual precipitation p and the potential evapotranspiration pet all of the studied basins located in the north of spain pue beg tre cot lem and and are classified as humid aiu 1 00 as well as pri in the center of spain the gar seg and zum catchments are classified as humid sub humid 1 00 aiu 0 65 due to their altitude above 700 m a s l and the remaining two bol and jub may be considered as dry sub humid 0 50 aiu 0 65 no arid basin was taken into account in this study due to the unsatisfactory performance shown for the lumped conceptual models used pérez sánchez et al 2019 the 12 basins are located in the main lithology groups of the iberian peninsula siliceous and calcareous the beg pue and tre basins in north east and the gar in the west belong to the former group where granite gneiss quartz marble and slate are the main materials the bol jub seg y zum basins in the east and lem and pri and cot in the north are predominantly calcareous with limestone casts and loam rocks the snowmelt does not have a significant influence on the water resources in the selected basins eight of the basins pue beg tre cot lem and gar have a mean elevation below 700 m a s l and therefore snow rarely appears the seg 1418 m a s l and zum 1543 m a s l are located in southern spain where the snow at these altitudes is not significant due to the warm climate finally jub and pri located in central spain also have a moderate elevation 1150 and 1256 m a s l respectively and the influence of snow melt is not significant 2 2 historical climate and hydrological data temperature and precipitation data series in the historical studied period 1980 2010 have been obtained from the cedex centre of studies and experimentation of civil work for the spanish government álvarez et al 2004 at a spatial resolution of 500 500 m estrela and quintas 1996 the average temperatures range from 11 to 15ºc with a positive gradient to the south fig 2a precipitation disparities are much higher fig 2b varying between 1563 mm in the and basin and 510 mm in the jub basin with a marked rainfall gradient from the northwest to the southeast potential evapotranspiration was calculated by using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 this simple approach only requires minimum maximum and mean temperature and solar radiation we have used the solution proposed by samani 2000 which uses tabulated values depending on the latitude to calculate the solar radiation streamflow data come from the gauging stations of the official spanish network the average of completed data series in the period 1980 2010 for the studied basins is higher than 97 the basins located in the north of spain show the highest values around 70mm3 year whilst basins with the most severe climates such as bol have a monthly average streamflow lower than 1mm3 year fig 2d 2 3 climate model simulation data control and future scenarios we have used results obtained from the simulation of nine climate models see table 1 under the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 emission scenario it is the most pessimistic scenario included in the fifth assessment report ar5 ipcc 2014 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the ipcc is the united nations body for assessing the science related to climate change the climate model simulation data were taken from the website of the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment for the european domain euro cordex project 2018 the rcm simulations which include control historical simulations and future results up to2100 are nested to different gcm these nine climate models were randomly selected assuming that all the rcms included the euro cordex project are good enough to generate potential future scenarios we have also assumed that the nine climate models are enough to assess the uncertainty related to the rcms 2 4 calibrated hydrological balance models an assessment of four hydrological balance models abcd gr2m australian water balance model awbm and guo 5p in the historical studied period 1980 2010 was carried out in the twelve basins and six statistical indices the akaike information criterion aic the bayesian information criterion bic nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the relative error between the observed and simulated run off volumes rev were used to calibrate and validate them and their use in the propagation of the climate scenarios pérez sánchez et al 2019 demonstrated that regardless of the basin area these lumped conceptual hydrological models performed well in humid and sub humid watersheds according to moriasi et al 2007 the more humid the basin is the better the results that are obtained which indicates the strong influence of climate characteristics gr2m proved to be the model with the best performance whenever aiu is higher than 1 with nse values above 0 75 in a 95 confidence interval on the contrary the driest regions did not register satisfactory results but the estimation of total volumes with guo 5p showed differences below 12 or even lower in dry sub humid regions it was also evident that a set of goodness of fit measures should be used in order to provide accuracy and robustness to the application of the hydrological model and the use of a specific one largely depends on the aim of the research 3 method theory calculation the proposed methodology is summarized in fig 3 the first step of the methodology is the generation of local climate scenarios we considered two scenarios according to the two considered hypotheses of warming in spain 1 5 and 3 0ºc these constraints are used to select the series of the rcm simulations the outputs of these rcms are corrected and adapted to the local conditions by using three statistical techniques under two different approaches delta change and bias correction the local future meteorological scenarios are propagated with four hydrological balance models finally the impact of climate change was assessed by comparing the historical streamflow in the reference period with the future projections the different combinations of rcms statistical techniques and correction approaches and hydrological models allow us to quantify the uncertainty of the climate change signal 3 1 generation of future local climate change scenarios the future results have been selected from the rcm simulations under two different hypotheses of future levels of warming in spain 1 5ºc and 3ºc spain due to its location and hydro meteorological conditions is one of the most vulnerable countries within the eu the study covers areas with different climate conditions within spain the assessment of the impact of climate change s and its uncertainty under different scenarios 1 5 and 3 0ºc is a key task to be undertaken before the study of adaptation and mitigation strategies for each rcm we selected series simulated for two future 30 year periods which respectively fulfill the hypotheses of 1 5 and 3 0ºc of warming within spain for the scenario rcp 8 5 those increments in mean temperature were calculated with respect to the control simulation series of the rcms for the reference period 1976 2005 we obtained different 30 year future horizons for each rcm but these periods represent the same hypothesis of warming see table 2 the historical and control simulation series from rcms in the reference period 1976 2005 and the future simulations of rcms for the periods shown in table 2 were used to generate the potential future scenarios by applying the described statistical downscaling procedure for the selected rcms the mean temperature in the reference period varies from 10 5 to 12 6ºc for spain the maximum differences between the future horizons for the 1 5 and 3 0ºc warming hypotheses in the different rcms are for 6 years and 10 years respectively see table 2 the ground tool collados lara et al 2020b is used to generate multiple future local climate change scenarios by applying different statistical downscaling techniques first moment correction first and second moment correction and regression in the first moment correction technique the transformation function only tries to improve the approximation to the mean values pulido velazquez et al 2015 the second moment correction technique also tries to provide a good approximation for the standard deviation collados lara et al 2018a the regression technique defines the transformation function by adjusting a regression model chen et al 2014 these techniques are used under two different conceptual approaches delta change and bias correction räty et al 2014 in the delta change approach the transformation function is obtained by using the future and control rcm simulations it assumes that the changes described by this transformation function can be directly applied to the historical series to obtain potential future local series the bias correction approach defines the transformation function from the historical series and control simulation series the objective is to obtain a corrected control simulation series where the statistics are similar to the historical ones in the reference period this function can also be applied to correct the future rcm simulations to obtain potential future local series different correction techniques or statistical methods can be applied for each approach delta change and bias correction table 3 the combination of approach and correction technique give rise to six potential scenarios for each available rcm simulation nested to a gcm which produce a total number of 54 potential future climate change scenarios for each combination of basin which is the scale used to generate the potential future scenarios and warming scenarios in the case of the bias correction approach we also obtain corrected control simulation for the reference period the mean annual values of precipitation and temperature of the control simulations before and after correction and historical series in the reference period 1976 2005 are shown in appendix g of the supplementary material 3 2 propagation of climate scenarios with the selected hydrological balance models four lumped conceptual hydrological models abcd gr2m awbm and guo 5p defined by using different conceptual approaches fig 4 have been explored in each of the selected basins we assessed the ability of these lumped conceptual hydrological models to reproduce the historical dynamic of the resources this was assessed in accordance with different statistical indices aic akaike 1973 1974 bic fabozzi et al 2014 nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 pearson 1895 pbias gupta et al 1999 and rev karpouzos et al 2011 we agreed the selection of the four water balance models after a thorough literature review of the performance of these models in different climate regions in europe in fact pellicer martinez and martinez paz 2015 found that the abcd model had the best performance in southern spain wriedtand and bouraoiu 2009 used gr2m model and obtained high nse in the northern half of the iberian peninsula and in french and german basins awbm performed well in the french alps reaching a nse value of 0 79 yu and zhu 2015 guo 5p is particularly recommended in humid and semi humid regions guo 1995 the abcd 4 parameter model thomas jr 1981 is an example of simple hydrologic model for simulating streamflow it consists of two zones the non saturated zone nsz and the saturated zone sz precipitation p is divided into evapotranspiration et and drainage into aquifers or rivers and the excess becomes surface run off qs or drainage run off qg the gr2m model makhlouf and michel 1994 was developed by the cemagref centre of agricultural and environmental research of france p is divided into run off through two equations production and transfer functions and is distributed between s and g the latter is considered to have limited capacity the awbm model boughton 2009 has three surface storage tanks s1 s2 and s3 and the water balance is assessed separately qs is obtained from one part of the surplus of the tanks whilst the other part is drained to g which is converted into qg guo 5p xiong and guo 1999 is particularly used in humid and sub humid regions q is obtained adding qs qg and the subsurface run off qb the 4 models considered are satisfactory abcd gr2m awbm guo 5p in all the basins in accordance with the widely used criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 based on the nse r2 and pbias values and we also carried out an uncertainty analysis of their results the hydrological balance models were used to simulate the generated future local climate scenarios for each future projection the hydrological impact is assessed by comparing the output of the hydrological balance models obtained by simulating the observed historical climate in the reference period with the output generated with the future climate series it is the only way to perform these analyses when the delta change approach is applied because it does not generate corrected simulation series for the reference period for this reason in order to make the impact assessment comparable in both approaches delta change and bias correction we have also compared the future simulated flows with the historical simulated series nevertheless the differences between observed climate series and the corrected climate simulation for the reference period in the bias correction approaches are minimal see appendix g 3 3 analyses of climate change impacts and its uncertainties we used the propagation of the future potential local scenarios by using the hydrological models to analyze the hydrological impact of climate change taking into account the differences between the potential future hydrology and the historical ones the uncertainty of the impact of climate change was analyzed taking into account the component due to the considered potential local scenarios and due to the applied hydrological models structural uncertainty it was studied taking into account the variability of climate change impact results introduced by the scenarios and by their propagation we have used box whisker plots to summarize the impacts and their uncertainty it shows the mean and median values the upper and lower extremes and outliers the lower extremes are defined as q1 1 5icr and the upper extreme as q3 1 5icr where q1 and q3 are the first and third quartile and icr is the interquartile range which is calculated as the difference between q3 and q1 the values below or above the extreme values are considered outliers 4 results and discussion 4 1 local climate change scenarios from the selected simulations tables 1 and 2 we obtained the average change in monthly precipitation in see fig 5 and temperature in ºc see fig 6 within each basin in general the highest changes will appear in the southern basins the reduction in the precipitation moves from 3 2 lem basin to a maximum around 21 5 21 4 in seg basin and 21 3 in zum in the scenario of 3 0ºc in this 3ºc global warming scenario the increase in temperature goes from 2 5ºc beg and tre basins to 3 5ºc seg and zum basins the box whiskers of the monthly changes in precipitation and temperature fig 7 show the highest interquartile differences in the 3ºc warming scenario in both variables temperature and precipitation in all the basins the highest interquartile ranges in these 3ºc scenarios appear in the basins located in the humid western area pue beg tre and gar we have also analyzed the global seasonality of the changes in precipitation and temperature that correspond to the selected rcm simulations figs 8 and 9 in the 3ºc warming scenario all the months show a reduction of mean precipitation with the exception of february see fig 8 the percentages of reduction increase during the summer months this is consistent with previous studies which projected a future decrease in summer precipitation over southern europe matte et al 2019 the highest standard deviations of the monthly changes are also expected during the summer months the monthly mean changes in temperature are also higher in the 3ºc warming scenario with the maximum during the summer but also with significant increases in the autumn see fig 8 the highest standard deviations of the monthly changes are also observed during the summer and autumn in this paper we have considered different sources of uncertainty in the generation of local climate change scenarios climate model simulations including both different gcms and rcms nested to them and downscaling techniques including different statistical correction methods first moment second moment and regression under the delta change and the bias correction assumption section 4 3 as an example we show the multiple series generated in one of the basins seg taking into account the cited sources of uncertainties fig 9 the uncertainty related to the precipitation in the potential scenarios is higher than the uncertainty related to temperature we have also represented the ensemble series in the literature we can find many examples in which the assessment of future impact is limited to the propagation of some ensemble scenarios pulido velazquez et al 2018a escriva bou et al 2017 these ensemble scenarios are more representative of the potentially expected future conditions than the individual ones pulido velazquez et al 2015 aemet 2009 nevertheless their use rather than the use of the simulation of multiple individual scenarios will produce a loss of information about the uncertainty of the impact of future climate conditions in the seg basin for the warming scenarios 1 5 and 3 0ºc the mean reduction of mean monthly precipitation are respectively 10 3 and 15 7 mm and the increment of temperature is1 8 and 3 5ºc respectively see fig 9 4 2 propagation of climate scenarios with the selected hydrological balance models the hydrological models abcd gr2m awbm and guo 5p that are satisfactory table 4 will be employed to simulate the generated future local climate scenarios in each basin we assume that the parameters of the hydrological models which are calibrated and validated in the historical period to propagate the impact of climate change on hydrology will stay invariant in the future therefore we do not consider a potential retroaction of lclu due to climate change under this assumption those models with a good performance in the historical period will be also be good for simulating the hydrological impact in future climate scenarios according to moriasi et al 2007 a model gives a very good performance if the classification sum value is above 7 good if it is between 5 and 7 and satisfactory when it is above 3 an unsatisfactory model does not reach 3 values a detailed explanation of the goodness of fit tests used is shown in the supplementary material the best performances are reached in humid watersheds for all the models though there are marked changes between results in calibration can be observed 1980 1995 and validation 1995 2010 stages depending on the hydrological model selected each basin has at least one model with satisfactory results but the gar jub and zum provide lowest value in the abcd or and awbm models gr2m provides better results in nearly all the watersheds than previous models but guo 5p has greater stability on average with the highest grading 9 0 in several basins both humid and semi arid ones following the recommendations of arnold et al 2012 the selected calibration period includes dry and wet periods to ensure that it reflects the range of conditions under which the model is expected to operate furthermore an uncertainty analysis has been carried out with the values obtained differentiating between models and basins fig 10 the box whiskers in fig 10a assess the error in simulated streamflow concerning the hydrological model the results highlight the wide climatological variability in spain although the median and length of boxes are pretty similar for all the models except the gr2m the numerous outliers have some sort of normality effect as their extension in graphics is even greater than 50 of the sample these outliers can be explained because the models do not adequately represent the peak flows as can be seen in the supplementary material so the highest maximums of streamflow observed exceed simulated streamflow peaks in spite of these outliers total error in predicting streamflow fig 10b in calibration and validation periods is below 20 in the four models and it is usually negative except fortheguo5p model indicating a general over prediction furthermore the gr2m model shrinks its length by nearly 50 compared to the others and it is the only one that appears to show some over prediction though often much lower than the examples on the opposite side fig 10c represents the variation of nse both in calibration and validation for all the studied basins gar and jub show in general the worst results due to their aridity reaching values of below 0 15 with the abcd and awbm models only the gr2m provides satisfactory results in both stages of all the basins with nse values over 0 55 guo5p shows similar homogeneity with an average nse of 0 73 despite the 0 30 value in the gar basin for calibration no significant differences were found between the calibration and validation periods the results of these simulations will be used to analyze the hydrological impact of climate change and its uncertainties taking into account the differences between the potential future hydrology and the historical ones 4 3 analyses of climate change impact and its uncertainties the use of different hydrological models to propagate the scenarios will allow us to consider in climate change impact assessment the structural uncertainty coming from different conceptual hydrological models in addition to the uncertainty coming from the local climate scenarios mattots et al 2019 in this section we have analyzed the changes of future potential streamflow in mm compared to the historical values these mm units have allowed us to compare values without the influence of the basin size we have analyzed the variability by basin months of the year rcms and hydrological model used note that the influence of the correction approach or the statistical technique applied to rcms is low for example considering the and basin the hydrological model abcd and the scenario 1 5ºc the variation coefficient of the mean streamflow for each rcm with respect to the correction approach technique applied varies from 0 6 to 1 9 for the rest of cases these values are similar fig 11 summarises the monthly impact on the different basins that show a significant spatial heterogeneity as previous studies in spain have already indicated the magnitude of this impact will depend on the level of warming and the geographical characteristics of each basin rasilla et al 2013 the mean monthly historical streamflow in the basin covers a wide range of values between 2 6 mm in the jub basin and 140 7 mm in the pue basin fig 11b the highest reductions in mm appear in the wetter basins located in northern spain see fig 11b with a maximum of 15 0 mm in the pue basin for the 3 0ºc warming scenario with the minimum reduction being obtained in the southern basin 2 4 mm in zum the variability of the potential changes in mm is also clearly higher in the northern basins especially for the 3 0ºc scenario however the southern basins show the higher relative changes in as we have also shown for precipitation and temperature fig 12 summarises the results within the 12 basins derived from all the projections 54 projections and rainfall recharge models 4 propagations in terms of monthly changes in a mean year in general the higher mean reductions and variability of the monthly streamflow values are associated to the warming scenario of 3 0ºc fig 12a it gives us a global idea of the temporal distribution and or seasonality of the impact of climate change the maximum streamflow reductions appear in autumn it contributes to a more pronounced low water level period in the summer as indicated in previous studies in spain rasilla et al 2013 morán tejeda et al 2014 significant reductions are also observed during the spring with the smallest changes occurring in the summer months the highest values of changes in standard deviation are also obtained during the autumn months and the smallest in the summer months fig 12b the estimated impact will depend on the combined influence of the different selected rcms the approach delta change or bias correction and correction techniques applied to generate the local climate models and the hydrological models used to propagate the impact to the streamflow previous studies have shown that the variability in the climate variable due to rcms is higher than the variability due to correction approaches collados lara et al 2018a pardo igúzquiza et al 2019 in this study we have also tried to analyze the impact on the streamflow introduced by the selected rcms fig 13 and hydrological models fig 14 for the two considered warming scenarios 3ºc and 1 5ºc the discussion will be focused on the 3ºc scenarios in which the highest impact will be observed in all the cases fig 13 summarises the impact obtained for the 12 basins derived from all the correction techniques and rainfall recharge models 4 propagations when we fix a rcm model the differences between the estimated mean impacts depending on the selected rcm are significant with values that move from 4 4 mm rcm5 to 10 7 mm rcm 4 in the most pessimistic scenario the 3ºc warming scenario the interquartile range also shows significant differences with the smallest range of 3 7 mm rcm 5 and the greatest of a maximum of 10 3 mm rcm 1 these differences on the estimated impact depending on the hydrological models are significantly smaller they move from 8 0 to 9 1 mm for the warming scenario of 3 0ºc fig 14 the changes in the interquartile ranges are also significantly smaller and move from 6 5 mm in the smallest gr2m gr4 to 8 9 mm in the greatest abcd similar methodologies and consistent results were obtained in the assessment of climate change impact on precipitation matte et al 2019 and streamflow rasilla et al 2013 morán tejeda et al 2014 in previous studies in spanish basins the main novelty of this paper is that we also assess the uncertainty of the potential impact coming from different sources we have considered different statistical correction techniques of climate model simulations with two approaches delta change and bias correction results from nine rcm models and four hydrological model structures it has allowed us to assess monthly streamflow changes and uncertainty bounds for the two selected warming scenarios the uncertainty analysis showed that the highest variability and uncertainties related to climate change impact assessment on streamflow are due to the rcm projections with the influence of the employed downscaling techniques and hydrological models used being significantly smaller 5 conclusions in this study we have analyzed the impact of climate change on water resources in 12 spanish basins in which sufficiently long monthly historical streamflow measurements monthly series longer than 30 years are available to calibrate rainfall runoff models for near natural conditions the 12 basins have been selected to cover different climate conditions identified in spain with an aridity index of above 0 5 local climate scenarios have been generated in accordance with the available rcm simulations in agreement with the fifth rcp scenarios defined by the ipcc the future scenarios have been generated from the rcm simulations by assuming two hypotheses of future level of warming in spain 1 5ºc and 3ºc in each of these basins the local climate scenarios have been propagated by using 4 hydrological models abcd gr2m awbm and guo 5p with a sufficient ability to reproduce the historical dynamic in accordance with different statistical indices aic bic nse r2 pbias and rev the results have allowed us to assess the future potential impact on water resources taking into account different sources of uncertainties related with local scenarios and conceptual hydrological models applied to propagate them structural uncertainty the impact of climate change on streamflow shows a significant spatial heterogeneity with the highest reduction in mm of flow in the wetter northern basins the seasonality of the impact is also significant with the highest absolute reductions during autumn and the smallest changes in absolute values in the summer months the results also show that the highest variability and uncertainties related to the impact of these climate change s assessments are due to the rcm projections with the influence of the downscaling techniques and hydrological models used being significantly less credit authorship contribution statement d pulido velazquez conceptualization
