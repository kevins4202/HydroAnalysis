20415,tuna median fins including the first dorsal second dorsal and anal fins are capable of changing their area and shape because morphing fins can adjust the hydrodynamic forces they have the additional ability to affect the yaw and turning maneuvers based on the kinematic equations of c turn behavior and the numerical method of self propelled swimming the hydrodynamic analysis of the two tunas with erected and depressed median fins are carried out in this paper the results show that the morphology of the median fins has a great influence on hydrodynamics and flow field structure during c turn behaviors when the median fins are erected the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tuna are increased and the first dorsal fin contributes the most to the hydrodynamic increments the overall vortex strength in the erected morphology is also greater due to the participation of the first dorsal fin compared with the depressed morphology the erection of median fins can increase the yaw angle and reduce the turning radius to a certain extent which means that the tuna with erected fins has higher turning maneuverability moreover as the initial speed increases the erection of median fins is more helpful to turning maneuvers keywords morphing median fin c turn erected morphology depressed morphology self propulsion tuna 1 introduction pavlov et al 2017 pointed out that bluefin and yellowfin tunas have a unique bio hydraulic system at the base of the second dorsal and anal fins called median fins which can quickly change the area and shape of the median fins similar to the hydrofoils on the bottom of a hydrofoil ship median fins have the ability to generate lateral lift when there is an angle between the incoming flow direction and the fin plane according to different locomotion behaviors the morphing median fins are able to regulate their own hydrodynamics to better adapt to complex ocean environment during cruising behaviors the median fins are depressed to reduce swimming drag when frequent turning or yaw is required in predation and searching behaviors the median fins are erected under the control of the bio hydraulic system to improve maneuverability in a word tuna can achieve superior comprehensive swimming performance by adjusting the morphing median fins inspired by this finding triantafyllou et al 2020 developed a simple robotic fish with morphing dorsal fins the experimental and simulation results showed that erected dorsal fins are useful for rapid turning and the morphing fins can effectively alleviate the trade off between maneuverability and stability the tuna mainly relies on the flexible tail swing to generate thrust while the front part of its body is nearly rigid and generally stays stable as it swims the average speed of tuna is 30 50 km h and the daily swimming distance can reach 230 km it is almost the only large fish that can cruise very fast over long distances these advantages make tuna an ideal research object in the field of bionic design and numerical analysis bernal et al 2001 madigan et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 gleiss et al 2019 wainwright and lauder 2020 using tuna form shape barrett 1994 developed the first undersea bionic vehicle named robotuna which is propelled by an oscillating foil on the basis of the robotuna anderson and chhabra 2002 built a new robotic tuna by optimizing the kinematics of the body and tail and discussed its maneuvering and stability performance du et al 2019 designed a highly maneuverable tuna inspired robot with a peak forward speed of 1 52 bl s body length and a minimum turning radius of 0 3 bl zhu et al 2019 developed a tuna like robotic platform that can operate at high frequencies and generate swimming speeds of 3 4 bl s then white et al 2021 and thandiackal et al 2021 used this robotic platform to investigate the thrust generating mechanism during linear accelerations from rest and the impact of body flexibility on swimming performance in aspect of computational simulations wolfgang et al 1999 used numerical methods to visualize the near body and wake structure of fish swimming and compared the simulation results to the experimental data of the robotuna takagia et al 2013 carried out a numerical analysis to estimate the dynamic properties of bluefin tuna then proving that the glide and upward swimming mode can save energy wang et al 2020 studied the hydrodynamics of finlets in yellowfin tuna through a combination of experimental and numerical methods and pointed out that these finlets can affect propulsive performance during steady swimming moreover yang and su 2011 xia et al 2015 liet al 2017 xueet al 2020 and maciaset al 2020 had also discussed the hydrodynamic forces power and wake structure of tuna swimming under self propulsion in most of the above studies whether it is bionic development or numerical simulation the median fins of tuna have been ignored or simplified into a fixed structure and the functional mechanism of the morphing median fins have not been discussed in detail zhong et al 2019 used a tuna inspired model with variable fin sharpness to investigate the interaction between elongated dorsal anal fins and caudal fins and indicated that dorsal anal fin sharpness affects swimming speed and economy although zhong et al 2019 suggested that the shape and placement of median fins have some influence on the hydrodynamics and flow field structure the focus of their discussion was on the fin sharpness which is not the same as the morphing fins or variable sweep fins described in this paper pavlov et al 2017 constructed the erected and depressed models of the second dorsal and anal fins and used numerical methods to analyze the hydrodynamic forces of the two models under static conditions by comparison it is shown that the erected median fins have greater lift to drag ratios when the yaw angle is in the range of 1 8 which may be advantageous at turning maneuvers li 2021 also did similar work by numerical simulations discussing the hydrodynamics of tuna median fins in the erected and depressed forms but it needs to be pointed out that these simulations are carried out under quasi static conditions the median fin plays a slightly different role in different locomotor behaviors in this paper we focus on the hydrodynamics of the median fins during turning or yaw maneuvers fish can perform a variety of turning behaviors of which c start or c turn is the most widely studied one witt et al 2015 m√ºller et al 2008 used the digital particle image velocimetry dpiv technology to map the flow field structure around the larva fish during c start and found that the larvae fish shed two vortex pairs on the mid plane one in the preparation stage and the other in the subsequent propulsive stage then gazzola et al 2012 came to a similar conclusion after investigating the c start escape response of larval fish and pointed out that c starts maximize the escape distance li et al 2014 simulated self propelled swimming of a fish larvae and found that the fish produces a jet flow during preparation stage of the c start and interacted with it during propulsive stage voesenek et al 2019 discussed the reorientation and propulsion during c starts and indicated that zebrafish larvae produces most of the reorientation in preparation stage while propulsive stage generates most of the acceleration of the centre of mass another fish that is often used in c starting studies is bluegill sunfish tytell et al 2008 carried out an experimental hydrodynamic analysis of the c start escape response in sunfish and assessed the contribution of the median fins to escape momentum the results suggested that the size and placement of the median fins may be a key determinant of fast start performance borazjani et al 2011 elucidated the 3 d wake structure of sunfish during c starts by using numerical simulations and the results revealed that there are three primary jet flow patterns in the calculated flow fields and their momentum time series are in agreement with the experimental data after that borazjani 2013 also studied the role of the median fins of the sunfish during the c start and the results showed that the erection of the median fins increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult in addition to the sunfish witt et al 2015 found that the other two fishes can also produce three jet flows during c start two of which are formed by the tail and the third one appears in the mid body region bullgill sunfish also has a morphing dorsal fin but it is not exactly the same as tuna median fins in terms of structural morphology and deformation mode the dorsal fin of sunfish consists of spiny anterior and soft posterior parts during c starts it mainly relies on the swing of the soft part to improve maneuverability the tuna median fin is analogous to a morphing wing capable of changing its sweep angle therefore the hydrodynamic theory of bluegill dorsal fin cannot be applied directly to tuna feng et al 2020 studied the hydrodynamics of a tuna like body during c turn maneuvers and indicated that the tuna rotates rapidly in the preparation stage and rotates back gradually in the propulsive and glide stage this research focuses on the flow field of tuna swimming rather than the functional mechanism of morphing fins as we all know tuna has two dorsal fins and one anal fin in addition to the second dorsal and anal fins the first dorsal fin can also be regarded as a morphing fin because it is able to unfold out of groove or fold in the groove pavlov et al 2017 since the surface area of the first dorsal fin is relatively larger it is also important to discuss its hydrodynamics the aim of this paper is to clarify the mechanism of the three morphing median fins in the c turn behaviors and to compare the hydrodynamic performance and flow field structure between the erected and depressed morphology this study may provide a new idea for the design of robotic fish which is to adjust its yaw maneuverability and stability by means of morphing fins this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the two tuna models with erected and depressed median fins the kinematic equations of c turn behavior and the numerical method of 3 dof three degrees of freedom self propelled swimming in section 3 the numerical analysis of 3 dof self propelled swimming of the two tunas during c turns are carried out and the swimming velocity hydrodynamics yaw performance and flow field structure of the tunas are compared between the erected and depressed morphology then the conclusions are given in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 geometry model a real size prototype of yellowfin tuna is obtained by the reverse mould process we arrange an appropriate number of markers on the tuna prototype and scanned it into a point cloud using a handheld 3d scanner as shown in fig 1 there are many scattered fragments distributed in the point cloud which may cause a lot of trouble in the numerical simulations so it needs to be cleaned and reconstructed in the process of model reconstruction the local details of the tuna prototype can be appropriately simplified including the mouth gills pectoral fins and tail finlets these simplifications do not greatly affect the analysis results because we are concerned about the morphological changes of the tuna median fins and focus on the relative value of hydrodynamic forces between the erected and depressed fins rather than the absolute value the contour curves of the tuna model are shown in fig 2 which uses the fitting and reconstruction method of li 2021 the total length of the tuna model is about 1 17 m the erection and depression of the second dorsal and anal fins can be obtained by rotating their profile curves around points o d and o a respectively according to the observation data of pavlov et al 2017 when the first dorsal second dorsal and anal fins are all erected their sweep angles are about 35 58 and 61 respectively and if the three median fins are depressed the sweep angles become 0 76 and 79 respectively the geometric models of two tunas with erected and depressed median fins are shown in fig 3 the standard symmetrical airfoil naca0015 is taken as the cross section shape of each fin based on the measurement data of chord length and thickness anderson and chhabra 2002 2 2 c turn kinematics based on previous studies the c turn behavior can be divided into three kinematic stages weihs 1973 frith and blake 1990 domenici and blake 1997 leroyer and visonneau 2005 liu et al 2011 gazzola et al 2012 tokiƒá and yue 2012 witt et al 2015 jing et al 2004 feng et al 2020 in preparation stage the tuna s tail swings to one side the anterior part of the body changes little and the posterior part gradually bends into a c shape when the caudal fin moves to the maximum position the tuna starts the propulsive stage at this point the caudal fin swings back quickly until the posterior part returns to a stretched out straight position after that the tuna either resumes a normal swimming rhythm or enters into the glide stage in which the caudal fin does not oscillate much and the tuna mainly relies on inertial force to move forward in the process of c turn behavior the caudal fin determines the effect and efficiency of the turning while the median fins play an assisting role generally the self propelled swimming can be expressed by the kinematic equation of the midline of the fish body in other words the fish swimming is controlled by the motion law of the midline of the body leroyer and visonneau 2005 yeo et al 2010 gazzola et al 2012 borazjani 2013 feng et al 2020 this paper also uses the same approach for tuna to complete the c turn behaviors unlike other small fish the anterior part of the tuna has a high rigidity during cruising or c turn behaviors the oscillation and deformation of the anterior part is very small dewar and graham 1994 barrett 1994 wolfgang et al 1999 li et al 2017 and the propulsive force is mainly generated by the undulation of the flexible posterior part thus the kinematic equation of the anterior part of the tuna can be expressed as 1 x l t l z l t 0 l l s where l is the midline of the tuna body l s is starting coordinate of the flexible posterior part x l t and z l t are the deformation displacements of the body in the x and z directions of the coordinate system at time t it is assumed that the midline of the posterior part of the body is a circular arc with r t as the radius of curvature in the first two stages of the c turn r t is a transient function that varies with time t let r 0 be the minimum radius of curvature for c shape then r t is given by chen et al 2006 feng et al 2020 2 r t r 0 Œ∏ t where Œ∏ t is the curvature function of the tuna s midline l which is described as follows 3 Œ∏ t 1 2 1 10 a t 1 1 10 b t c where b is the duration coefficient of the whole c turn a and c is the duration coefficients of the preparation and propulsive stage respectively these parameters are shown in table 1 according to the geometric relationship of the c shape of the tuna body the kinematic function of its posterior part during the c turn can be expressed as 4 x l t l s r t s i n l l s r t z l t r t r t c o s l l s r t the motion trajectory of the midline l of the tuna during the preparation and propulsive stage are shown in fig 4 we define the duration of the first two stage as t0 1 0s of which the preparation stage is about t1 0 59s and the propulsive stage is t2 0 41s the ratio of the duration of the two stages is 1 44 which is close to the experiment and simulation data of other researchers tytell and lauder 2008 borazjani et al 2012 liu et al 2011 gazzola et al 2012 feng et al 2020 although the duration of the c turn is defined empirically it is generally in line with previous experimental observations 2 3 numerical method for self propulsion in this paper the numerical method which has been widely applied in the study of fish swimming is used to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of tuna and its median fins in order to realize self propulsion it is necessary to solve the fluid flow around the tuna and calculate the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the tuna xia et al 2015 the self propelled swimming of tuna is a fluid solid interaction problem yeo et al 2010 zhou and shu 2011 ramananarivo et al 2013 li et al 2017 which satisfies the 3d incompressible viscous navier stokes governing equations 5 u 0 u t u u 1 œÅ p Œº œÅ 2 u where u is the velocity vector of fluid field p is the pressure œÅ is fluid density and Œº is the dynamic viscosity to solve the governing equations the velocity vector u needs to be obtained first when no slip boundary condition is set on the tuna model gazzola et al 2011 xia et al 2015 li et al 2017 feng et al 2020 it can be considered 6 u v v t œâ r œÖ d where v is the velocity of the tuna and can be decomposed into three components xia et al 2015 li et al 2017 feng et al 2020 the translational velocity v t the rotational velocity œâ r and the deformation velocity œÖ d the velocity components v t and œâ r are computed according to the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tuna as it swims in self propulsion while the velocity œÖ d is derived from the kinematic equations of the swimming behaviors generally the function of the median fins is to maintain the balance of the body and prevent the tuna from yawing and rolling with different morphological structures the effect of the median fins on yaw and roll motion may be somewhat different however it is difficult to make tuna yaw and roll at the same time due to the limitation of simulation technology so only the yaw motion is considered in c turn behavior we define the yaw motion as the rotation around the y axis and the tuna only swims in the x z plane regardless of gravity and buoyancy then according to newton s law the velocity components v t and œâ r are expressed as yeo et al 2010 liu et al 2011 li et al 2012 2017 xia et al 2015 feng et al 2020 7 m d v x d t m a x f x m d v z d t m a z f z i y d œâ y d t i y Œ± y m y where m is the mass of the tuna v x and v z are the sub components of the translational velocity v t in the x and z directions respectively œâ y are the sub components of the rotational velocity œâ r around the y axis f x and f z are the hydrodynamic force components in the x and z directions m y are the yaw moments a x and a z are the transitional accelerations in the x and z directions Œ± y is the rotational accelerations around the y axis i y is the moments of inertia around the y axis it should be noted that the i y change periodically as the caudal fin oscillates but we assume that they are constant for simplification jing et al 2004 the hydrodynamic forces f x and f z acting on the tuna can be obtained by integrating the pressure and viscous forces of its surface elements borazjani and sotiropoulos 2010 borazjani et al 2011 xia et al 2015 feng et al 2020 8 f x s p n x œÑ x j n j d s f z s p n z œÑ z j n j d s where p is the pressure of the surface element ds n x and n z are the unit vectors in the x and z directions n j is the unit normal vector of the jth element œÑ xj and œÑ zj are the viscous stress tensors in x and z directions according to the hydrodynamic forces f x and f z that have been solved above it is easy to compute the yaw moment m y as 9 m y s r p n x œÑ x j n j n x p n z œÑ z j n j n z d s where r is the distance vector from the center of mass com the simulation of tuna swimming is a process of solving a series of nonlinear equations in order to improve the computational stability of numerical iteration the under relaxation method is used to smooth the forces or accelerations xia et al 2015 li et al 2017 10 a x n 1 Œª a x n 1 1 Œª a x n a z n 1 Œª a z n 1 1 Œª a z n Œ± y n 1 Œª Œ± y n 1 1 Œª Œ± y n where superscripts n 1 and n denote the number of iteration steps Œª is the under relaxation coefficient 0 Œª 1 a x n 1 a z n 1 Œ± y n 1 and a x n 1 a z n 1 Œ± y n 1 represent the translation and rotation accelerations before and after under relaxation at iteration step n 1 respectively based on the given acceleration the swimming velocities and displacements of tuna can be expressed as xia et al 2015 11 v x n 1 v x n a x n 1 Œ¥ t v z n 1 v z n a z n 1 Œ¥ t œâ y n 1 œâ y n Œ± y n 1 Œ¥ t 12 x n 1 x n Œ¥ t 2 v x n 1 v x n z n 1 z n Œ¥ t 2 v z n 1 v z n Œ∏ n 1 Œ∏ n Œ¥ t 2 œâ n 1 œâ n where Œ¥t is the time step x and z are the displacements in the x and z directions respectively Œ∏ is the yaw angle during self propelled swimming the position of tuna in the flow field is constantly changing so the volume grids of the computational domain need to be updated by dynamic mesh technology as previously mentioned tuna swimming is a combination of rigid motion and deformation motion li et al 2017 to reduce the load of mesh update the computational domain is divided into two zones as shown in fig 5 in the inner zone the dynamic mesh caused by the flexible deformation of tuna tail can be reconstructed through diffusion smoothing and remeshing methods the volume mesh in the outer zone does not need to be regenerated because the two zones are set together to follow the rigid motion of tuna so that there is no relative movement between them the outer zone is a cuboid with a size of 10 7 5 m which is discretized by hexahedral structured grid the unstructured grid is used in the inner zone because it can better fit to the complex surface of tuna and is beneficial to the reconstruction of dynamic mesh the mesh size of the tuna body is less than 0 007l while the mesh size of the median and caudal fins is about 0 0025l grid refinement is carried out around the tuna to ensure the mesh quality and computational accuracy when the computational domain is updated since the tuna is in self propelled swimming and there is no external inflow the inlet far field and outlet boundaries of the computational domain are all set to zero velocity and pressure gradient feng et al 2020 li 2021 no matter whether the median fins are erected or depressed the value of each simulation parameter should be the same including domain size turbulence model step time maximum number of iterations convergence criteria etc so as to ensure a reliable comparison between the two morphological structures 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity study and validation a mesh sensitivity study for the tuna with the erected median fins is conducted by using three groups of grids with different sizes the number of elements in each group is about 2 63 million coarse 4 45 million medium and 7 73 million fine respectively as can be seen from fig 6 a there is no significant difference in the time history of yaw angle Œ∏ under three different grids the errors of yaw angle among the three grids are within the allowable range and do not affect the correctness of the analysis results as shown in equation 12 the yaw angle Œ∏ is the integral of yaw velocity or the quadratic integral of yaw acceleration in general the cumulative error of yaw angle Œ∏ increases with the increase of time taking the simulation data of fine grid as a benchmark the errors of coarse grid and medium grid are about 1 43 and 0 3 at t 3 0s respectively similarly a sensitivity study of time step Œ¥t is also carried out by using three different time intervals of 0 005s 0 004s and 0 0025s it can be seen form fig 6 b that under different time steps the simulation results of yaw angle are close to each other therefore the time step Œ¥t does not influence the final conclusion in this paper the aim of this paper is to compare the effects of the erected and depressed median fins on the c turn performance of tuna in the simulation the surface mesh size of the two tunas is as the same as possible and the number of volume grids in the two computational domains is very close with the same time step the comparison results are reasonable and reliable in order to verify the correctness of the numerical method in this paper our simulation results are compared with the analysis data of feng et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 due to the differences of the tuna model and c turn kinematics the absolute values of swimming parameters are different however the variation trend of these parameters is nearly the same including swimming velocity hydrodynamic force yaw angle etc moreover some phenomena that appear in the c turn behaviors such as two vortex rings generated in the first two stages and counter rotate caused by the back swing of the caudal fin are similar to previous experimental observations and simulation studies of wolfgang et al 1999 mulleret al 2008 yeoet al 2010 gazzolaet al 2012 and fenget al 2020 for example gazzola et al 2012 reported that two vortex pairs fig 5 a are produced by larva fish during the c start which is consistent with the results of fig 17 in this paper this can further prove the reliability of our simulation analysis 3 2 swimming velocity when the tuna intends to turn or yaw the swimming speed generally does not directly drop to zero instead it slows down to a suitable speed to improve turning or yawing efficiency reinel and schuster 2014 assuming that the tuna swims in the negative direction of x axis and the initial speed of the c turn is v x0 1 0 m s the variation curves of the forward velocity v x lateral velocity v z and yaw angular velocity œâ y are shown in fig 8 where it is easy to compare the influence of the erected e and depressed d median fins on each swimming velocity for tuna swimming under 3 dof self propulsion all three velocity components need to be considered in order to better understand the complete function of the median fins the morphology of median fins does not change the overall variation trend of each swimming velocity in the preparation stage the forward velocity v x drops from 1 0 m s to about 0 65 m s in an instant due to the loss of the thrust force from the tail and then rapidly reduces to around 0 51 0 53 m s at t 0 85s after that the caudal fin produces a certain amount of thrust during the propulsive stage which leads to a brief rise of forward velocity v x one detail needs to be noticed the time period for the caudal fin to swing back is t 0 59 1 0s and the rising period of forward velocity v x is about t 0 85 1 38s there is a time lag between the two periods at the beginning of the propulsive stage the thrust generated by the caudal fin is not strong enough to overcome the drag and reverse the downward trend of forward velocity v x with the increase of thrust the v x is improved in the later of this stage finally the tuna loses the thrust once again during the glide stage and the v x slowly decreases due to fluid drag unlike the forward velocity v x the lateral velocity v z is generally a process of gradual increase in the period of t 0 0 85s the v z rapidly rises from 0 to about 0 28 0 31 m s after a short and small fall at t 0 85 1 45s it rises slowly again in these two rising periods the dominant driving forces are different the first increase in lateral velocity v z is mainly caused by the active bending of the caudal fin and the second is a passive increase due to the fluid flow the yaw angular velocity œâ y forms an inverted u curve in the early phase of c turn behavior and reaches the maximum value of 1 37 rad s at t 0 33s then decreases to the minimum value of 0 75 rad s at t 0 85s then the œâ y is stable near the zero axis after a v shaped rebound during the glide stage this rebound is a counter rotate of the tuna caused by the backswing of the caudal fin which conforms to the conservation of angular momentum and has been discussed by yeo et al 2010 and feng et al 2020 by the way the œâ y seems to play a dominant role during the c turn because it has the largest amplitude but the v x and v z are also important because they greatly affect the turning radius which will be discussed later the morphological changes of the median fins still have an important effect on swimming performance although the variation trend of swimming velocity is similar in the first stage the c bending of the caudal fin is the decisive force to control the tuna swimming while the median fins have limited influence during the propulsive and glide stages the median fins can assist in affecting the swimming performance when the median fins are erected the fluid drag is relatively large due to the expansion of upstream area resulting in a greater decline in the forward velocity v x at t 3s the v x value when the median fins are erected is reduced by 6 2 compared to when they are depressed similarly with the increase of the upstream area of the erected median fins the lateral lift also enhances correspondingly which leads to the increase of the lateral velocity v z the erected median fins can raise the v z by about 13 2 at t 3s this indicates that the erected fins are beneficial to turning and yaw maneuvers which is in agreement with the viewpoint of pavlov et al 2017 the morphology of the median fins also influences the yaw angular velocity œâ y to a certain extent though not very significantly for most of the time after t 0 8s the œâ y in the erected form of the median fins is higher than that in the depressed morphology moreover the œâ y of the erected morphology returns to the zero axis relatively faster this may mean that the erected fins can improve the stability of tuna while assisting in turning or yaw maneuverability tuna is one of the large fish with high cruising speed its maximum speed exceeds 20 m s walters and fierstein 1964 iosilevskii and weihs 2008 tuna may adopt different initial speeds to balance turning efficiency and energy consumption under different behaviors such as searching and predation w√∂hl and schuster 2006 2007 2007 schlegel and schuster 2008 reinel and schuster 2014 fig 9 shows the time history of the swimming velocities in the erected e and depressed d morphology when the initial speed v x0 is from 2 0 m s to 4 0 m s as the initial speed increases the yaw velocity œâ y and lateral velocity v z also increase and the forward velocity v x decreases faster and faster in the first stage all of these are more favorable for the tuna to yaw and turn according to hydrodynamic theory the fluid force is proportional to the square of swimming velocity the higher the initial speed the larger the force and moment acting on the tuna which results in a faster and earlier start of the backward motion when the v x0 is 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 m s the maximum œâ y of tuna with the erected median fins is 2 19 3 05 and 3 87 rad s respectively doubling the initial speed causes a 76 7 increase in yaw velocity œâ y which suggests that high initial speed can improve the turning efficiency of tuna from another perspective for the initial speed of 3 0 and 4 0 m s the v x of tuna with the erected median fins drops to zero at t 1 85s and t 0 85s respectively this also indicates that at high initial speed the tuna can move in the opposite direction earlier in order to investigate the influence of the morphology of median fins on the turning motion at the same initial speed we define the velocity increments Œ¥v and Œ¥œâ as the difference between the velocity of the tuna with the erected median fins and that with the depressed median fins 13 Œ¥ v x v x e v x d Œ¥ v z v z e v z d Œ¥ œâ y œâ y e œâ y d where v xe and v xd are the forward velocities when the median fins are erected e and depressed d respectively v ze and v zd are the lateral velocities in the erected and depressed morphology œâ ye and œâ yd are the yaw angular velocities in the two morphologies as can be seen from fig 10 with the increase of initial speed the velocity increments Œ¥v x Œ¥v z and Œ¥œâ y almost all increase especially in the preparation stage when the initial speed goes up from 1 m s to 4 m s the forward velocity increment Œ¥v x rises obviously which indicates that at high speed the erected fins have better braking effect and can make tuna turn earlier for example under the condition of v x0 4 0 m s the v x changes from a negative value to a positive value at t 0 85s when the median fins are erected and at t 1 92s when the median fins are depressed the time for the backward movement of the tuna with the erected median fins is much earlier than that in the depressed morphology this is one of the advantages of the erected fins there is a special situation in the lateral velocity increment Œ¥v z in the first stage the Œ¥v z increases with the increase of initial speed but it decreases in the last two stage when the v x0 is 3 0 and 4 0 m s at high speeds the tuna with the erected fins starts to move backward very early while the tuna with the depressed fins turn relatively slowly when they swim in opposite directions the flow direction and flow field structure are completely different resulting in the change of the Œ¥v z in general the Œ¥œâ y also increases with the increase of initial speed in the early phase and tends to zero at the end higher yaw velocity increment Œ¥œâ y means faster turning which is another advantage of the erected fins these two advantages complement each other and together improve the turning performance of the tuna in a word as the initial speed increases the morphology of median fins becomes more and more important to the turning movement 3 3 hydrodynamic force fig 11 shows the hydrodynamic forces and moment of tuna when the initial speed v x0 is 1 0 m s taken overall the hydrodynamic curves of the tuna are all v shaped or inverted v shaped trend in the first two stages as the caudal fin bents into a c shape the forward drag f x and lateral lift f z are increasing while the yaw moment m y is steadily decreasing at about 0 75s each hydrodynamic force reaches its maximum or minimum value it can be seen that the time for the force or acceleration to achieve the extremum is ahead of the corresponding velocity which is in line with the basic law of motion then the backswing of the caudal fin produces hydrodynamic forces in the opposite direction reversing the original trend during the gliding stage the hydrodynamic fluctuations are comparatively gentle and gradually stabilized most of the time the drag f x is positive which results in less and less forward velocity v x while the lift f z causes a steady increase in lateral velocity v z relatively the variation of yaw moment m y leads to great fluctuations of yaw velocity œâ y but it tends to be stable in the end in addition the drag f x fluctuates irregularly in the first stage probably because the bending process of the caudal fin is not at uniform speed the analysis results of hu et al 2004 and feng et al 2020 also show a similar phenomenon that the hydrodynamic forces fluctuate once around 0 axis at the beginning of the first stage there is a slight difference between the two results which may be due to the initial speed given in this paper when the tuna has initial speed its body and median fins can also generate hydrodynamic forces not just the caudal fin however because the initial speed of the tuna is not high enough the lateral lift f z mainly generated by the swing of the caudal fin is still the dominant thrust of tuna swimming which causes it to be much larger than the forward drag f x as the initial speed increases the f x will become more and more important to the c turn with the increase of initial speed the hydrodynamic forces and moment of the tuna also increase as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the overall trend of hydrodynamics is similar at different initial speeds when the initial speed goes up from 1 0 m s to 4 0 m s the maximum values of the drag f x lift f z and moment m y rise by about 15 2 6 and 2 1 times respectively the growth rate of the drag is the largest on the one hand due to the increase in the initial speed on the other hand due to the increase in the upstream surface area of the body and median fins caused by the raised yaw angle the lift and moment rise relatively slowly because a large part of them is produced by the caudal fin and this part increases less with the increase of initial speed the different growth rates among the three hydrodynamic components may cause the significant change of yaw and turning performance due to the rapid increase in the drag the tuna is able to brake more quickly and thus begin to move backwards earlier as previously stated and this may be related to the improvement of turning efficiency and the reduction of turning radius moreover the time for the maximum f x and f z to appear is advanced their extremum occurs at t 0 3 0 45s which is earlier than t 0 75s when the initial speed v x0 is 1 0 m s at high speeds the hydrodynamic force generated by the tuna s body and median fins cannot be ignored their hydrodynamic loss caused by the decrease of forward velocity v x is greater than the thrust produced by the caudal fin thus the maximum value occurs before the back swing of the caudal fin however the yaw moment m y is an exception no matter what the initial velocity is the variation trend of the m y and the time when its extremum appears are almost the same this may indicate that the caudal fin plays a decisive role in yaw moment m y obviously the moment it produces is much greater than that of the median fins because the caudal fin is farthest from the com it is only during the gliding stage when the caudal fin does not swing that the median fins have an important effect on the yaw motion the direct reason of the difference in swimming performance is the difference in the hydrodynamic forces between the two morphologies of median fins the hydrodynamic increments Œ¥f and Œ¥m in the erected morphology relative to the depressed morphology are defined as 14 Œ¥ f x f x e f x d Œ¥ f z f z e f z d Œ¥ m y m y e m y d where f xe and f xd are the forward drags when the median fins are erected and depressed respectively f ze and f zd are the lateral lifts in the erected and depressed morphology m ye and m yd are the yaw moments in the two morphologies fig 13 shows the hydrodynamic increments Œ¥f x Œ¥f z and Œ¥m y of the tuna in the erected morphology it can be seen that the performance of the hydrodynamic increment is somewhat different at different initial speeds when the v x0 is 1 0 m s the hydrodynamic increments are all positive for most of the time this indicates that the erected fins can improve the overall hydrodynamic performance one of the reasons for the raised hydrodynamic forces is the increase in the area of the median fins the surface areas of the second dorsal and caudal fins grow by 15 and 15 7 when they are erected more importantly the area of the first dorsal fin is about 1 75 times that of the second dorsal fin as the first dorsal fin unfolds out of groove the median fins as a whole are estimated to have increased hydrodynamic forces by about 104 when the v x0 is 4 0 m s the hydrodynamic increments fluctuate wildly in the early phase before t 0 3 0 4s the three increments rise rapidly and the erected median fins play a role in enhancing hydrodynamics but then the situation is changed the tuna with the erected median fins starts to move backwards at t 0 85s while the tuna with the depressed median fins continues to move forward in the period of t 0 85 1 92s they swim in opposite directions the different flow field conditions cause the irregular changes of hydrodynamic increments the contribution of each part of the tuna to the overall hydrodynamic increment including the body bd caudal fin cf first dorsal fin df1 second dorsal fin df2 and anal fin af is also shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the first dorsal fin contributes most to the hydrodynamic increment as mentioned above the main reason is that its area is the largest among the median fins the hydrodynamic increments contributed by the second dorsal and anal fins is negative and do not have a significant positive effect on the turning movement this is different from the viewpoint of pavlov et al 2017 who believes that the erected second dorsal and anal fins can improve turning maneuverability in addition the hydrodynamics of the body and caudal fin have also been changed correspondingly the hydrodynamic increment Œ¥f x and Œ¥f z of the body is second only to the first dorsal fin and larger than other fins the caudal fin has the largest moment increment Œ¥m y which is conducive to rapid yaw or turning of the tuna this shows that the parts of tuna are not independent of each other and the erections of the median fins not only change their own performance but also affect the hydrodynamics of the body and caudal fin one explanation for this phenomenon is that the morphology of the median fins can change the flow field distribution on the surface of the tuna body thereby influencing its drag and lift the body fin and fin fin interaction is another reason for the increased hydrodynamics of tuna liu et al 2017 came to a conclusion similar to this paper that the body fin and fin fin interaction could increase the swimming thrust of fish by the comparison of the body fin and body caudal fin models triantafyllou et al 2020 have pointed out that the median fin can enhance turning maneuverability only if it is located in front of the com as can be seen from fig 3 the first dorsal fin meets the above condition and is very helpful to improve the turning performance due to the different positions relative to the com the functions of the median fins are not exactly the same the first dorsal fin can promote yaw maneuvers while the second dorsal and anal fins tend to improve stability this mechanism may provide a new design idea for underwater bionic robot most existing robotic fishes only have fixed dorsal and anal fins without morphological structures if high yaw mobility is required a morphing dorsal fin can be added in front of the com to adjust the hydrodynamic performance compared to other conventional active methods such as increasing the oscillation amplitude and frequency of the caudal fin the morphing median fin is a passive way that can make better use of fluid flow thereby saving energy and improving efficiency noda et al 2016 the median fin of the tuna is analogous to the morphing wing of the airplane the advantage of the morphing wing is that the aerodynamics of the airplane can be improved by changing its sweep angle so that the flight performance can be optimized at both high and low speeds the median fin may also have a similar function which can balance the swimming performance in various locomotor behaviors 3 4 yaw performance the most important indicator for judging the turning performance is the yaw angle Œ∏ in the early phase of c turn behavior the tuna mainly relies on the c shaped bending of the caudal fin and the morphology of median fins has little effect on the yaw motion as shown in fig 13 no matter what the initial speed is there is only a slight difference in yaw angle between the erected and depressed morphology before t 0 5s it can be considered that when the caudal fin swings back the erected fins gradually perform the additional function facilitating the tuna s yaw or turn maneuvers according to fig 14 and table 2 we can further verify the two viewpoints made before one of the viewpoints is that the erected median fins can enhance the yaw and turning performance of the tuna at the same initial speed the yaw angle Œ∏ of the erected morphology is generally lager especially after t 1 2 1 5s the rising slope of yaw angle Œ∏ in the erected morphology is obviously greater than that in the depressed morphology in the period of t 0 8 3 0s the growth rate of yaw angle in the erected morphology is 1 57 12 7 when the v x0 is 1 0 m s and it is 9 20 20 4 if the v x0 is 4 0 m s during the gliding stage the erected median fins does help the tuna turn the other viewpoints is that high initial speed can also improve the turning efficiency of tuna we can clarify it from three aspects first with the increase of initial speed the yaw angle Œ∏ increases rapidly within a range of initial speeds from 1 0 m s to 4 0 m s the extremum of the yaw angle Œ∏ is 0 85 rad 1 42 rad 1 85 rad and 2 18 rad in the erected morphology respectively this indicates that compared with the initial speed of 1 0 m s the extremum is increased by about 67 117 and 156 respectively second the erected median fins play a greater role at high speeds taking t 2 0s as an example when the initial speed goes up from 1 0 m s to 4 0 m s the Œ∏ of the tuna with the erected fins rises by about 8 92 10 7 14 4 and 20 1 respectively it can be seen that the growth rate of yaw angle also increases as the initial speed increases higher growth rate means faster turning in the erected morphology the last with the increase of initial speed the time to reach the maximum growth rate is earlier when the initial speed is 1 0 m s the growth rate reaches the maximum of 12 7 at about t 3 0s while the maximum growth rate of 20 6 occurs at about t 1 5s if the initial speed is 4 0 m s the faster rise in growth rate also indicates the improvement of turning efficiency another important indicator is the turning radius r it can be seen from fig 15 that regardless of the initial speed the turning radius r in the erected morphology is smaller than that in the depressed morphology the reduction of the turning radius is mainly due to the reduction of the swimming distance along the x direction when the initial speed goes up from 1 0 m s to 4 0 m s the maximum displacement dx the tuna with the depressed fins swims along the x direction are 2 15 m 2 35 m 1 82 m and 1 60 m within the period of t 0 4 0s while it swims 2 06 m 1 94 m 1 31 m and 1 29 m in the erected morphology the displacement dx is reduced by 4 2 17 4 28 0 and 19 4 respectively however the swimming displacement dz along the z direction is 1 03 m 2 71 m 3 42 m and 3 44 m in the erected morphology with corresponding increase of 11 9 10 1 5 6 and 3 8 the increase in displacement dz may be a necessary sacrifice for rapid turning fig 16 is the c turn process of the tuna at the initial speed of 4 m s here we can clearly compare the turning sequence of the tuna with the erected and depressed fins moreover it needs to be noted that the turning radius r especially the displacement dx decreases as the initial speed increases in other words it is easier for tuna to turn at high speeds this is in line with the biological characteristics of tuna after all it swims at high speed throughout its life to summarize the erected median fins can help the tuna yaw or turn at a faster speed and with a smaller turning radius generally speaking large fish with rigid body like tuna has much less mobility than small fish with flexible body blake et al 1995 scaradozzia et al 2017 the erection of the median fins improves the efficiency of predation and searching which may be the evolutionary advantage of tuna in addition we also believe that the erected fins not only enhance yaw maneuverability but may also improve roll stability borazjani 2013 when the median fins are erected the anti rolling ability of the tuna is likely to increase due to the increased moment arm around the x direction it s like a tightrope walker who needs to carry a long stick to keep his balance although there is no rigorous discussion and analysis in this paper it is our opinion that during the c turn behavior the tuna can cleverly alleviate the trade off between maneuverability and stability by regulating the morphology of its median fins anderson and chhabra 2002 and achieve superior comprehensive locomotion performance with less energy consumption especially at high speeds 3 5 the flow field structure fig 17 shows the vorticity contours and velocity vectors on the xz plane when the tuna is in the erected morphology and the initial speed is 1 0 m s it can be seen that as the tail of the tuna quickly bends into a c shape a vortex is produced near the caudal fin this vortex gradually sheds from the tail at t 0 2s and simultaneously the other vortex in the opposite direction begins to appear and develop the two vortices form a vortex pair and then move away to the side of the tuna starting from t 0 8s another stronger vortex pair is also created and unlike the previous vortex it goes far behind the tuna muller et al 2008 yeoet al 2010 borazjaniet al 2012 gazzolaet al 2012 li et al 2012 and feng et al 2020 have all reported this finding that during the c turn behavior two vortex pairs are generated in each of preparation and propulsive stage accompanied by the vortex there are also two distinct jet flows in the flow field just as feng et al 2020 pointed out at about t 0 1s the bending of the caudal fin produces the first jet flow which is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the tuna s body because it is far from the com the reaction force of the jet creates a larger moment which makes the tuna turn quickly the second more powerful jet flow appears at about t 0 8s and its reaction force pushes the tuna to swim forward this may be the reason for the brief change in the trend of forward velocity at about t 0 8 1 4s borazjani et al 2011 and witt et al 2015 found that the bluegill sunfish produces three jet flows during c turn which is different from our results because the tuna body is more rigid or lack of flexibility it is difficult to form a third jet flow in the mid body region like a sunfish in the xz plane the two dimensional flow field distributions of erected and depressed morphology are similar but there are some differences in the vortex structure fig 18 shows the wake structures visualized using the q criterion when the initial speed is 1 0 m s it can be seen that the wake structure near the caudal fin is also similar between the two forms in the preparation stage the caudal fin creates a vortex ring muller et al 2008 gazzola et al 2011 and the jet flow is approximately at the center of the vortex ring li et al 2012 witt et al 2015 feng et al 2020 as the tuna swims the vortex ring detaches from the caudal fin and gradually dissipates the wake structure generated in the propulsive stage is more complex and it is not a regular ring like before however the difference is that in the erected morphology the first dorsal fin also produces a vortex which is not present in the depressed morphology at the beginning the vortex near the first dorsal fin is small and slender as the yaw angle increases the strength of the vortex gradually increases and extends to the second dorsal fin eventually the vortices of the two dorsal fins merge together near the tail the difference of vortex structure may affect the pressure distribution of the tuna and then influence the hydrodynamic performance borazjani and daghooghi 2013 bottom et al 2016 liu et al 2017 feng et al 2020 as mentioned earlier each part of the tuna is not independent and the vortex structure of the first dorsal fin changes the flow field distribution on the surface of the second dorsal fin df2 as shown in the fig 18 with the erection of the first dorsal fin the low pressure area on the downstream surface of the second dorsal fin and around it decreases significantly which may be the reason for the decrease in the hydrodynamic forces moreover the flow field of the tuna s body has also changed as shown in fig 19 when the median fins are depressed the pressure field around the body bd on the cut plane of y 0 12 m is relatively even as the first dorsal fin is erected the pressure on the upstream surface of the body increases while the pressure on the downstream surface decreases so the pressure difference between the two sides of the body is enlarged this is consistent with the previous conclusion that in the erected morphology the hydrodynamic force of the body is improved due to the increased pressure difference on its surface fig 20 shows the three dimensional wake structures in the erected and depressed morphology when the initial velocity is 4 0 m s with the increase of initial speed the wake structures change greatly the caudal fin cannot generate two vortex pairs in the first two stages and the vortex rings also disappear and become irregular shapes however the vortexes produced by the median fins develop and expand and they merge with the vortexes near the caudal fin to a certain extent which further changes the flow field distribution due to the participation of the first dorsal fin the vortex strength in the erected morphology is greater than that in the depressed morphology which may be one of the reasons for the hydrodynamic enhancement in the erected morphology relatively speaking at high speed the vortex strength of the first dorsal fin is higher and it has a greater influence on the entire flow field so the performance of the erected morphology is more superior fig 21 shows the pressure contours on the cut plane of y 0 12 m when the initial speed is 4 0 m s it can be seen that the low pressure area on the downstream side of the tuna expands greatly and it is in line with bernoulli principle we once again point out that in the erected morphology the pressure difference between the two sides of the tuna body is greater which improves the body s hydrodynamics and facilitates the tuna s rapid turning in addition it should be noted that at t 0 8s the pressure difference between the two sides of the caudal fin cf is larger in the depressed morphology which produces a greater reverse moment when the caudal fin swings back as we said before there is a counter rotate phenomenon due to the back swing it can be seen from fig 15 that during the period of t 0 8 1 1s the larger reverse moment in the depressed morphology results in the larger drop in the yaw angle this is also one of the reasons why the yaw or turn motion slows down in the depressed morphology 4 conclusions after a long period of evolution tuna has become a complex and sophisticated system any slight change in the morphological structure may cause a great change in the overall performance during the c turn behaviors the morphology of the median fins has a great influence on the swimming velocity hydrodynamic force yaw performance and flow field structure of the tuna by comparing the self propelled swimming between the erected and depressed morphology the results are summarized as followings 1 at the beginning of the c turn behaviors the median fins have a limited influence on the yaw or turning motion as the caudal fin swings back the morphology of the median fins begins to affect the turning performance of the tuna compared with the depressed morphology the erection of the median fins can increase the yaw angle and reduce the turning radius to a certain extent so that the tuna with erected fins has higher turning maneuverability 2 during the c turn behaviors the forward velocity is almost continuously reduced until the tuna swims in the opposite direction while the lateral velocity increases gradually the yaw angular velocity fluctuates wildly back and forth and finally stabilizes near the 0 axis in the erected morphology the forward velocity decreases faster which results in a shorter braking distance and earlier backward movement and the lateral velocity and yaw angular velocity are usually larger in the erected morphology than in the depressed morphology which may make the tuna turn more rapidly 3 when the median fins are erected the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tuna are increased and the first dorsal fin contributes the most to the hydrodynamic increments which plays a positive role in improving the turning performance the hydrodynamic increments of the second dorsal fin and anal fin are limited so their effect is small due to the body fin and fin fin interactions the hydrodynamics of the body and caudal fin have also changed correspondingly which further affects the hydrodynamic performance of the tuna 4 as the initial speed increases the erection of the median fins is more helpful to the yaw or turning motion when the initial speed goes up from 1 m s to 4 m s the growth rate of the yaw angle in the erected morphology increased from 12 7 to 20 5 at t 3 0s similarly the turning radius in the erected morphology especially the forward displacement is generally reduced more at high speeds this may be in line with the biological characteristics of tuna cruising at high speed throughout their lives 5 in the erected morphology the first dorsal fin also generates vortexes which gradually merge with the vortexes of the second dorsal fin near the tail due to the participation of the first dorsal fin the overall vortex strength in the erected morphology is greater than that in the depressed morphology which may be one of the reasons for the raised hydrodynamics at high speed the vortex strength of the first dorsal fin is higher and it has a greater influence on the entire flow field in addition with the erection of the first dorsal fin the pressure field around the body changes this may be the reason for the body fin interaction credit

20415,tuna median fins including the first dorsal second dorsal and anal fins are capable of changing their area and shape because morphing fins can adjust the hydrodynamic forces they have the additional ability to affect the yaw and turning maneuvers based on the kinematic equations of c turn behavior and the numerical method of self propelled swimming the hydrodynamic analysis of the two tunas with erected and depressed median fins are carried out in this paper the results show that the morphology of the median fins has a great influence on hydrodynamics and flow field structure during c turn behaviors when the median fins are erected the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tuna are increased and the first dorsal fin contributes the most to the hydrodynamic increments the overall vortex strength in the erected morphology is also greater due to the participation of the first dorsal fin compared with the depressed morphology the erection of median fins can increase the yaw angle and reduce the turning radius to a certain extent which means that the tuna with erected fins has higher turning maneuverability moreover as the initial speed increases the erection of median fins is more helpful to turning maneuvers keywords morphing median fin c turn erected morphology depressed morphology self propulsion tuna 1 introduction pavlov et al 2017 pointed out that bluefin and yellowfin tunas have a unique bio hydraulic system at the base of the second dorsal and anal fins called median fins which can quickly change the area and shape of the median fins similar to the hydrofoils on the bottom of a hydrofoil ship median fins have the ability to generate lateral lift when there is an angle between the incoming flow direction and the fin plane according to different locomotion behaviors the morphing median fins are able to regulate their own hydrodynamics to better adapt to complex ocean environment during cruising behaviors the median fins are depressed to reduce swimming drag when frequent turning or yaw is required in predation and searching behaviors the median fins are erected under the control of the bio hydraulic system to improve maneuverability in a word tuna can achieve superior comprehensive swimming performance by adjusting the morphing median fins inspired by this finding triantafyllou et al 2020 developed a simple robotic fish with morphing dorsal fins the experimental and simulation results showed that erected dorsal fins are useful for rapid turning and the morphing fins can effectively alleviate the trade off between maneuverability and stability the tuna mainly relies on the flexible tail swing to generate thrust while the front part of its body is nearly rigid and generally stays stable as it swims the average speed of tuna is 30 50 km h and the daily swimming distance can reach 230 km it is almost the only large fish that can cruise very fast over long distances these advantages make tuna an ideal research object in the field of bionic design and numerical analysis bernal et al 2001 madigan et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 gleiss et al 2019 wainwright and lauder 2020 using tuna form shape barrett 1994 developed the first undersea bionic vehicle named robotuna which is propelled by an oscillating foil on the basis of the robotuna anderson and chhabra 2002 built a new robotic tuna by optimizing the kinematics of the body and tail and discussed its maneuvering and stability performance du et al 2019 designed a highly maneuverable tuna inspired robot with a peak forward speed of 1 52 bl s body length and a minimum turning radius of 0 3 bl zhu et al 2019 developed a tuna like robotic platform that can operate at high frequencies and generate swimming speeds of 3 4 bl s then white et al 2021 and thandiackal et al 2021 used this robotic platform to investigate the thrust generating mechanism during linear accelerations from rest and the impact of body flexibility on swimming performance in aspect of computational simulations wolfgang et al 1999 used numerical methods to visualize the near body and wake structure of fish swimming and compared the simulation results to the experimental data of the robotuna takagia et al 2013 carried out a numerical analysis to estimate the dynamic properties of bluefin tuna then proving that the glide and upward swimming mode can save energy wang et al 2020 studied the hydrodynamics of finlets in yellowfin tuna through a combination of experimental and numerical methods and pointed out that these finlets can affect propulsive performance during steady swimming moreover yang and su 2011 xia et al 2015 liet al 2017 xueet al 2020 and maciaset al 2020 had also discussed the hydrodynamic forces power and wake structure of tuna swimming under self propulsion in most of the above studies whether it is bionic development or numerical simulation the median fins of tuna have been ignored or simplified into a fixed structure and the functional mechanism of the morphing median fins have not been discussed in detail zhong et al 2019 used a tuna inspired model with variable fin sharpness to investigate the interaction between elongated dorsal anal fins and caudal fins and indicated that dorsal anal fin sharpness affects swimming speed and economy although zhong et al 2019 suggested that the shape and placement of median fins have some influence on the hydrodynamics and flow field structure the focus of their discussion was on the fin sharpness which is not the same as the morphing fins or variable sweep fins described in this paper pavlov et al 2017 constructed the erected and depressed models of the second dorsal and anal fins and used numerical methods to analyze the hydrodynamic forces of the two models under static conditions by comparison it is shown that the erected median fins have greater lift to drag ratios when the yaw angle is in the range of 1 8 which may be advantageous at turning maneuvers li 2021 also did similar work by numerical simulations discussing the hydrodynamics of tuna median fins in the erected and depressed forms but it needs to be pointed out that these simulations are carried out under quasi static conditions the median fin plays a slightly different role in different locomotor behaviors in this paper we focus on the hydrodynamics of the median fins during turning or yaw maneuvers fish can perform a variety of turning behaviors of which c start or c turn is the most widely studied one witt et al 2015 m√ºller et al 2008 used the digital particle image velocimetry dpiv technology to map the flow field structure around the larva fish during c start and found that the larvae fish shed two vortex pairs on the mid plane one in the preparation stage and the other in the subsequent propulsive stage then gazzola et al 2012 came to a similar conclusion after investigating the c start escape response of larval fish and pointed out that c starts maximize the escape distance li et al 2014 simulated self propelled swimming of a fish larvae and found that the fish produces a jet flow during preparation stage of the c start and interacted with it during propulsive stage voesenek et al 2019 discussed the reorientation and propulsion during c starts and indicated that zebrafish larvae produces most of the reorientation in preparation stage while propulsive stage generates most of the acceleration of the centre of mass another fish that is often used in c starting studies is bluegill sunfish tytell et al 2008 carried out an experimental hydrodynamic analysis of the c start escape response in sunfish and assessed the contribution of the median fins to escape momentum the results suggested that the size and placement of the median fins may be a key determinant of fast start performance borazjani et al 2011 elucidated the 3 d wake structure of sunfish during c starts by using numerical simulations and the results revealed that there are three primary jet flow patterns in the calculated flow fields and their momentum time series are in agreement with the experimental data after that borazjani 2013 also studied the role of the median fins of the sunfish during the c start and the results showed that the erection of the median fins increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult in addition to the sunfish witt et al 2015 found that the other two fishes can also produce three jet flows during c start two of which are formed by the tail and the third one appears in the mid body region bullgill sunfish also has a morphing dorsal fin but it is not exactly the same as tuna median fins in terms of structural morphology and deformation mode the dorsal fin of sunfish consists of spiny anterior and soft posterior parts during c starts it mainly relies on the swing of the soft part to improve maneuverability the tuna median fin is analogous to a morphing wing capable of changing its sweep angle therefore the hydrodynamic theory of bluegill dorsal fin cannot be applied directly to tuna feng et al 2020 studied the hydrodynamics of a tuna like body during c turn maneuvers and indicated that the tuna rotates rapidly in the preparation stage and rotates back gradually in the propulsive and glide stage this research focuses on the flow field of tuna swimming rather than the functional mechanism of morphing fins as we all know tuna has two dorsal fins and one anal fin in addition to the second dorsal and anal fins the first dorsal fin can also be regarded as a morphing fin because it is able to unfold out of groove or fold in the groove pavlov et al 2017 since the surface area of the first dorsal fin is relatively larger it is also important to discuss its hydrodynamics the aim of this paper is to clarify the mechanism of the three morphing median fins in the c turn behaviors and to compare the hydrodynamic performance and flow field structure between the erected and depressed morphology this study may provide a new idea for the design of robotic fish which is to adjust its yaw maneuverability and stability by means of morphing fins this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the two tuna models with erected and depressed median fins the kinematic equations of c turn behavior and the numerical method of 3 dof three degrees of freedom self propelled swimming in section 3 the numerical analysis of 3 dof self propelled swimming of the two tunas during c turns are carried out and the swimming velocity hydrodynamics yaw performance and flow field structure of the tunas are compared between the erected and depressed morphology then the conclusions are given in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 geometry model a real size prototype of yellowfin tuna is obtained by the reverse mould process we arrange an appropriate number of markers on the tuna prototype and scanned it into a point cloud using a handheld 3d scanner as shown in fig 1 there are many scattered fragments distributed in the point cloud which may cause a lot of trouble in the numerical simulations so it needs to be cleaned and reconstructed in the process of model reconstruction the local details of the tuna prototype can be appropriately simplified including the mouth gills pectoral fins and tail finlets these simplifications do not greatly affect the analysis results because we are concerned about the morphological changes of the tuna median fins and focus on the relative value of hydrodynamic forces between the erected and depressed fins rather than the absolute value the contour curves of the tuna model are shown in fig 2 which uses the fitting and reconstruction method of li 2021 the total length of the tuna model is about 1 17 m the erection and depression of the second dorsal and anal fins can be obtained by rotating their profile curves around points o d and o a respectively according to the observation data of pavlov et al 2017 when the first dorsal second dorsal and anal fins are all erected their sweep angles are about 35 58 and 61 respectively and if the three median fins are depressed the sweep angles become 0 76 and 79 respectively the geometric models of two tunas with erected and depressed median fins are shown in fig 3 the standard symmetrical airfoil naca0015 is taken as the cross section shape of each fin based on the measurement data of chord length and thickness anderson and chhabra 2002 2 2 c turn kinematics based on previous studies the c turn behavior can be divided into three kinematic stages weihs 1973 frith and blake 1990 domenici and blake 1997 leroyer and visonneau 2005 liu et al 2011 gazzola et al 2012 tokiƒá and yue 2012 witt et al 2015 jing et al 2004 feng et al 2020 in preparation stage the tuna s tail swings to one side the anterior part of the body changes little and the posterior part gradually bends into a c shape when the caudal fin moves to the maximum position the tuna starts the propulsive stage at this point the caudal fin swings back quickly until the posterior part returns to a stretched out straight position after that the tuna either resumes a normal swimming rhythm or enters into the glide stage in which the caudal fin does not oscillate much and the tuna mainly relies on inertial force to move forward in the process of c turn behavior the caudal fin determines the effect and efficiency of the turning while the median fins play an assisting role generally the self propelled swimming can be expressed by the kinematic equation of the midline of the fish body in other words the fish swimming is controlled by the motion law of the midline of the body leroyer and visonneau 2005 yeo et al 2010 gazzola et al 2012 borazjani 2013 feng et al 2020 this paper also uses the same approach for tuna to complete the c turn behaviors unlike other small fish the anterior part of the tuna has a high rigidity during cruising or c turn behaviors the oscillation and deformation of the anterior part is very small dewar and graham 1994 barrett 1994 wolfgang et al 1999 li et al 2017 and the propulsive force is mainly generated by the undulation of the flexible posterior part thus the kinematic equation of the anterior part of the tuna can be expressed as 1 x l t l z l t 0 l l s where l is the midline of the tuna body l s is starting coordinate of the flexible posterior part x l t and z l t are the deformation displacements of the body in the x and z directions of the coordinate system at time t it is assumed that the midline of the posterior part of the body is a circular arc with r t as the radius of curvature in the first two stages of the c turn r t is a transient function that varies with time t let r 0 be the minimum radius of curvature for c shape then r t is given by chen et al 2006 feng et al 2020 2 r t r 0 Œ∏ t where Œ∏ t is the curvature function of the tuna s midline l which is described as follows 3 Œ∏ t 1 2 1 10 a t 1 1 10 b t c where b is the duration coefficient of the whole c turn a and c is the duration coefficients of the preparation and propulsive stage respectively these parameters are shown in table 1 according to the geometric relationship of the c shape of the tuna body the kinematic function of its posterior part during the c turn can be expressed as 4 x l t l s r t s i n l l s r t z l t r t r t c o s l l s r t the motion trajectory of the midline l of the tuna during the preparation and propulsive stage are shown in fig 4 we define the duration of the first two stage as t0 1 0s of which the preparation stage is about t1 0 59s and the propulsive stage is t2 0 41s the ratio of the duration of the two stages is 1 44 which is close to the experiment and simulation data of other researchers tytell and lauder 2008 borazjani et al 2012 liu et al 2011 gazzola et al 2012 feng et al 2020 although the duration of the c turn is defined empirically it is generally in line with previous experimental observations 2 3 numerical method for self propulsion in this paper the numerical method which has been widely applied in the study of fish swimming is used to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of tuna and its median fins in order to realize self propulsion it is necessary to solve the fluid flow around the tuna and calculate the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the tuna xia et al 2015 the self propelled swimming of tuna is a fluid solid interaction problem yeo et al 2010 zhou and shu 2011 ramananarivo et al 2013 li et al 2017 which satisfies the 3d incompressible viscous navier stokes governing equations 5 u 0 u t u u 1 œÅ p Œº œÅ 2 u where u is the velocity vector of fluid field p is the pressure œÅ is fluid density and Œº is the dynamic viscosity to solve the governing equations the velocity vector u needs to be obtained first when no slip boundary condition is set on the tuna model gazzola et al 2011 xia et al 2015 li et al 2017 feng et al 2020 it can be considered 6 u v v t œâ r œÖ d where v is the velocity of the tuna and can be decomposed into three components xia et al 2015 li et al 2017 feng et al 2020 the translational velocity v t the rotational velocity œâ r and the deformation velocity œÖ d the velocity components v t and œâ r are computed according to the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tuna as it swims in self propulsion while the velocity œÖ d is derived from the kinematic equations of the swimming behaviors generally the function of the median fins is to maintain the balance of the body and prevent the tuna from yawing and rolling with different morphological structures the effect of the median fins on yaw and roll motion may be somewhat different however it is difficult to make tuna yaw and roll at the same time due to the limitation of simulation technology so only the yaw motion is considered in c turn behavior we define the yaw motion as the rotation around the y axis and the tuna only swims in the x z plane regardless of gravity and buoyancy then according to newton s law the velocity components v t and œâ r are expressed as yeo et al 2010 liu et al 2011 li et al 2012 2017 xia et al 2015 feng et al 2020 7 m d v x d t m a x f x m d v z d t m a z f z i y d œâ y d t i y Œ± y m y where m is the mass of the tuna v x and v z are the sub components of the translational velocity v

are the yaw moments a x and a z are the transitional accelerations in the x and z directions Œ± y is the rotational accelerations around the y axis i y is the moments of inertia around the y axis it should be noted that the i y change periodically as the caudal fin oscillates but we assume that they are constant for simplification jing et al 2004 the hydrodynamic forces f x and f z acting on the tuna can be obtained by integrating the pressure and viscous forces of its surface elements borazjani and sotiropoulos 2010 borazjani et al 2011 xia et al 2015 feng et al 2020 8 f x s p n x œÑ x j n j d s f z s p n z œÑ z j n j d s where p is the pressure of the surface element ds n x and n z are the unit vectors in the x and z directions n j is the unit normal vector of the jth element œÑ xj and

j n j n x p n z œÑ z j n j n z d s where r is the distance vector from the center of mass com the simulation of tuna swimming is a process of solving a series of nonlinear equations in order to improve the computational stability of numerical iteration the under relaxation method is used to smooth the forces or accelerations xia et al 2015 li et al 2017 10 a x n 1 Œª a x n 1 1 Œª a x n a z n 1 Œª a z n 1 1 Œª a z n Œ± y n 1 Œª Œ± y n 1 1 Œª Œ± y n where superscripts n 1 and n denote the number of iteration steps Œª is the under relaxation coefficient 0 Œª 1 a x n 1 a z n 1 Œ± y n 1 and a x n 1 a z n 1 Œ± y n 1 represent the translation and rotation accelerations before and after under relaxation at iteration step n 1 respectively based on the given acceleration the swimming velocities and displacements of tuna can be expressed as xia et al 2015 11 v x n 1 v x n a x n 1 Œ¥ t v z n 1 v z n a z n 1 Œ¥ t œâ y n 1 œâ y n Œ± y n 1 Œ¥ t 12 x n 1 x n Œ¥ t 2 v x n 1 v x n z n 1 z n Œ¥ t 2 v z n 1 v z n Œ∏ n 1 Œ∏ n Œ¥ t 2 œâ n 1 œâ n where Œ¥t is the time step x and z are the displacements in the x and z directions respectively Œ∏ is the yaw angle during self propelled swimming the position of tuna in the flow field is constantly changing so the volume grids of the computational domain need to be updated by dynamic mesh technology as previously mentioned tuna swimming is a combination of rigid motion and deformation motion li et al 2017 to reduce the load of mesh update the computational domain is divided into two zones as shown in fig 5 in the inner zone the dynamic mesh caused by the flexible deformation of tuna tail can be reconstructed through diffusion smoothing and remeshing methods the volume mesh in the outer zone does not need to be regenerated because the two zones are set together to follow the rigid motion of tuna so that there is no relative movement between them the outer zone is a cuboid with a size of 10 7 5 m which is discretized by hexahedral structured grid the unstructured grid is used in the inner zone because it can better fit to the complex surface of tuna and is beneficial to the reconstruction of dynamic mesh the mesh size of the tuna body is less than 0 007l while the mesh size of the median and caudal fins is about 0 0025l grid refinement is carried out around the tuna to ensure the mesh quality and computational accuracy when the computational domain is updated since the tuna is in self propelled swimming and there is no external inflow the inlet far field and outlet boundaries of the computational domain are all set to zero velocity and pressure gradient feng et al 2020 li 2021 no matter whether the median fins are erected or depressed the value of each simulation parameter should be the same including domain size turbulence model step time maximum number of iterations convergence criteria etc so as to ensure a reliable comparison between the two morphological structures 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity study and validation a mesh sensitivity study for the tuna with the erected median fins is conducted by using three groups of grids with different sizes the number of elements in each group is about 2 63 million coarse 4 45 million medium and 7 73 million fine respectively as can be seen from fig 6 a there is no significant difference in the time history of yaw angle Œ∏ under three different grids the errors of yaw angle among the three grids are within the allowable range and do not affect the correctness of the analysis results as shown in equation 12 the yaw angle Œ∏ is the integral of yaw velocity or the quadratic integral of yaw acceleration in general the cumulative error of yaw angle Œ∏ increases with the increase of time taking the simulation data of fine grid as a benchmark the errors of coarse grid and medium grid are about 1 43 and 0 3 at t 3 0s respectively similarly a sensitivity study of time step Œ¥t is also carried out by using three different time intervals of 0 005s 0 004s and 0 0025s it can be seen form fig 6 b that under different time steps the simulation results of yaw angle are close to each other therefore the time step Œ¥t does not influence the final conclusion in this paper the aim of this paper is to compare the effects of the erected and depressed median fins on the c turn performance of tuna in the simulation the surface mesh size of the two tunas is as the same as possible and the number of volume grids in the two computational domains is very close with the same time step the comparison results are reasonable and reliable in order to verify the correctness of the numerical method in this paper our simulation results are compared with the analysis data of feng et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 due to the differences of the tuna model and c turn kinematics the absolute values of swimming parameters are different however the variation trend of these parameters is nearly the same including swimming velocity hydrodynamic force yaw angle etc moreover some phenomena that appear in the c turn behaviors such as two vortex rings generated in the first two stages and counter rotate caused by the back swing of the caudal fin are similar to previous experimental observations and simulation studies of wolfgang et al 1999 mulleret al 2008 yeoet al 2010 gazzolaet al 2012 and fenget al 2020 for example gazzola et al 2012 reported that two vortex pairs fig 5 a are produced by larva fish during the c start which is consistent with the results of fig 17 in this paper this can further prove the reliability of our simulation analysis 3 2 swimming velocity when the tuna intends to turn or yaw the swimming speed generally does not directly drop to zero instead it slows down to a suitable speed to improve turning or yawing efficiency reinel and schuster 2014 assuming that the tuna swims in the negative direction of x axis and the initial speed of the c turn is v x0 1 0 m s the variation curves of the forward velocity v x lateral velocity v z and yaw angular velocity œâ y are shown in fig 8 where it is easy to compare the influence of the erected e and depressed d median fins on each swimming velocity for tuna swimming under 3 dof self propulsion all three velocity components need to be considered in order to better understand the complete function of the median fins the morphology of median fins does not change the overall variation trend of each swimming velocity in the preparation stage the forward velocity v x drops from 1 0 m s to about 0 65 m s in an instant due to the loss of the thrust force from the tail and then rapidly reduces to around 0 51 0 53 m s at t 0 85s after that the caudal fin produces a certain amount of thrust during the propulsive stage which leads to a brief rise of forward velocity v x one detail needs to be noticed the time period for the caudal fin to swing back is t 0 59 1 0s and the rising period of forward velocity v x is about t 0 85 1 38s there is a time lag between the two periods at the beginning of the propulsive stage the thrust generated by the caudal fin is not strong enough to overcome the drag and reverse the downward trend of forward velocity v x with the increase of thrust the v x is improved in the later of this stage finally the tuna loses the thrust once again during the glide stage and the v x slowly decreases due to fluid drag unlike the forward velocity v x the lateral velocity v z is generally a process of gradual increase in the period of t 0 0 85s the v z rapidly rises from 0 to about 0 28 0 31 m s after a short and small fall at t 0 85 1 45s it rises slowly again in these two rising periods the dominant driving forces are different the first increase in lateral velocity v z is mainly caused by the active bending of the caudal fin and the second is a passive increase due to the fluid flow the yaw angular velocity œâ y forms an inverted u curve in the early phase of c turn behavior and reaches the maximum value of 1 37 rad s at t 0 33s then decreases to the minimum value of 0 75 rad s at t 0 85s then the œâ y is stable near the zero axis after a v shaped rebound during the glide stage this rebound is a counter rotate of the tuna caused by the backswing of the caudal fin which conforms to the conservation of angular momentum and has been discussed by yeo et al 2010 and feng et al 2020 by the way the œâ y seems to play a dominant role during the c turn because it has the largest amplitude but the v x and v z are also important because they greatly affect the turning radius which will be discussed later the morphological changes of the median fins still have an important effect on swimming performance although the variation trend of swimming velocity is similar in the first stage the c bending of the caudal fin is the decisive force to control the tuna swimming while the median fins have limited influence during the propulsive and glide stages the median fins can assist in affecting the swimming performance when the median fins are erected the fluid drag is relatively large due to the expansion of upstream area resulting in a greater decline in the forward velocity v x at t 3s the v x value when the median fins are erected is reduced by 6 2 compared to when they are depressed similarly with the increase of the upstream area of the erected median fins the lateral lift also enhances correspondingly which leads to the increase of the lateral velocity v z the erected median fins can raise the v z by about 13 2 at t 3s this indicates that the erected fins are beneficial to turning and yaw maneuvers which is in agreement with the viewpoint of pavlov et al 2017 the morphology of the median fins also influences the yaw angular velocity œâ y to a certain extent though not very significantly for most of the time after t 0 8s the œâ y in the erected form of the median fins is higher than that in the depressed morphology moreover the œâ y of the erected morphology returns to the zero axis relatively faster this may mean that the erected fins can improve the stability of tuna while assisting in turning or yaw maneuverability tuna is one of the large fish with high cruising speed its maximum speed exceeds 20 m s walters and fierstein 1964 iosilevskii and weihs 2008 tuna may adopt different initial speeds to balance turning efficiency and energy consumption under different behaviors such as searching and predation w√∂hl and schuster 2006 2007 2007 schlegel and schuster 2008 reinel and schuster 2014 fig 9 shows the time history of the swimming velocities in the erected e and depressed d morphology when the initial speed v x0 is from 2 0 m s to 4 0 m s as the initial speed increases the yaw velocity œâ y and lateral velocity v z also increase and the forward velocity v x decreases faster and faster in the first stage all of these are more favorable for the tuna to yaw and turn according to hydrodynamic theory the fluid force is proportional to the square of swimming velocity the higher the initial speed the larger the force and moment acting on the tuna which results in a faster and earlier start of the backward motion when the v x0 is 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 m s the maximum œâ y of tuna with the erected median fins is 2 19 3 05 and 3 87 rad s respectively doubling the initial speed causes a 76 7 increase in yaw velocity œâ y which suggests that high initial speed can improve the turning efficiency of tuna from another perspective for the initial speed of 3 0 and 4 0 m s the v x of tuna with the erected median fins drops to zero at t 1 85s and t 0 85s respectively this also indicates that at high initial speed the tuna can move in the opposite direction earlier in order to investigate the influence of the morphology of median fins on the turning motion at the same initial speed we define the velocity increments Œ¥v and Œ¥œâ as the difference between the velocity of the tuna with the erected median fins and that with the depressed median fins 13 Œ¥ v x v x e v x d Œ¥ v z v z e v z d Œ¥ œâ y œâ y e œâ y d where v xe and v xd are the forward velocities when the median fins are erected e and depressed d respectively v ze and v zd are the lateral velocities in the erected and depressed morphology œâ ye and œâ yd are the yaw angular velocities in the two morphologies as can be seen from fig 10 with the increase of initial speed the velocity increments Œ¥v x Œ¥v z and Œ¥œâ y almost all increase especially in the preparation stage when the initial speed goes up from 1 m s to 4 m s the forward velocity increment Œ¥v x rises obviously which indicates that at high speed the erected fins have better braking effect and can make tuna turn earlier for example under the condition of v x0 4 0 m s the v x changes from a negative value to a positive value at t 0 85s when the median fins are erected and at t 1 92s when the median fins are depressed the time for the backward movement of the tuna with the erected median fins is much earlier than that in the depressed morphology this is one of the advantages of the erected fins there is a special situation in the lateral velocity increment Œ¥v z in the first stage the Œ¥v z increases with the increase of initial speed but it decreases in the last two stage when the v x0 is 3 0 and 4 0 m s at high speeds the tuna with the erected fins starts to move backward very early while the tuna with the depressed fins turn relatively slowly when they swim in opposite directions the flow direction and flow field structure are completely different resulting in the change of the Œ¥v z in general the Œ¥œâ y also increases with the increase of initial speed in the early phase and tends to zero at the end higher yaw velocity increment Œ¥œâ y means faster turning which is another advantage of the erected fins these two advantages complement each other and together improve the turning performance of the tuna in a word as the initial speed increases the morphology of median fins becomes more and more important to the turning movement 3 3 hydrodynamic force fig 11 shows the hydrodynamic forces and moment of tuna when the initial speed v x0 is 1 0 m s taken overall the hydrodynamic curves of the tuna are all v shaped or inverted v shaped trend in the first two stages as the caudal fin bents into a c shape the forward drag f x and lateral lift f z are increasing while the yaw moment m y is steadily decreasing at about 0 75s each hydrodynamic force reaches its maximum or minimum value it can be seen that the time for the force or acceleration to achieve the extremum is ahead of the corresponding velocity which is in line with the basic law of motion then the backswing of the caudal fin produces hydrodynamic forces in the opposite direction reversing the original trend during the gliding stage the hydrodynamic fluctuations are comparatively gentle and gradually stabilized most of the time the drag f x is positive which results in less and less forward velocity v x while the lift f z causes a steady increase in lateral velocity v z relatively the variation of yaw moment m y leads to great fluctuations of yaw velocity œâ y but it tends to be stable in the end in addition the drag f x fluctuates irregularly in the first stage probably because the bending process of the caudal fin is not at uniform speed the analysis results of hu et al 2004 and feng et al 2020 also show a similar phenomenon that the hydrodynamic forces fluctuate once around 0 axis at the beginning of the first stage there is a slight difference between the two results which may be due to the initial speed given in this paper when the tuna has initial speed its body and median fins can also generate hydrodynamic forces not just the caudal fin however because the initial speed of the tuna is not high enough the lateral lift f z mainly generated by the swing of the caudal fin is still the dominant thrust of tuna swimming which causes it to be much larger than the forward drag f x as the initial speed increases the f x will become more and more important to the c turn with the increase of initial speed the hydrodynamic forces and moment of the tuna also increase as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the overall trend of hydrodynamics is similar at different initial speeds when the initial speed goes up from 1 0 m s to 4 0 m s the maximum values of the drag f x lift f z and moment m y rise by about 15 2 6 and 2 1 times respectively the growth rate of the drag is the largest on the one hand due to the increase in the initial speed on the other hand due to the increase in the upstream surface area of the body and median fins caused by the raised yaw angle the lift and moment rise relatively slowly because a large part of them is produced by the caudal fin and this part increases less with the increase of initial speed the different growth rates among the three hydrodynamic components may cause the significant change of yaw and turning performance due to the rapid increase in the drag the tuna is able to brake more quickly and thus begin to move backwards earlier as previously stated and this may be related to the improvement of turning efficiency and the reduction of turning radius moreover the time for the maximum f x and f z to appear is advanced their extremum occurs at t 0 3 0 45s which is earlier than t 0 75s when the initial speed v x0 is 1 0 m s at high speeds the hydrodynamic force generated by the tuna s body and median fins cannot be ignored their hydrodynamic loss caused by the decrease of forward velocity v x is greater than the thrust produced by the caudal fin thus the maximum value occurs before the back swing of the caudal fin however the yaw moment m y is an exception no matter what the initial velocity is the variation trend of the m y and the time when its extremum appears are almost the same this may indicate that the caudal fin plays a decisive role in yaw moment m y obviously the moment it produces is much greater than that of the median fins because the caudal fin is farthest from the com it is only during the gliding stage when the caudal fin does not swing that the median fins have an important effect on the yaw motion the direct reason of the difference in swimming performance is the difference in the hydrodynamic forces between the two morphologies of median fins the hydrodynamic increments Œ¥f and Œ¥m in the erected morphology relative to the depressed morphology are defined as 14 Œ¥ f x f x e f x d Œ¥ f z f z e f z d Œ¥ m y m y e m y d where f xe and f xd are the forward drags when the median fins are erected and depressed respectively f ze and f zd are the lateral lifts in the erected and depressed morphology m ye and m yd are the yaw moments in the two morphologies fig 13 shows the hydrodynamic increments Œ¥f x Œ¥f z and Œ¥m y of the tuna in the erected morphology it can be seen that the performance of the hydrodynamic increment is somewhat different at different initial speeds when the v x0 is 1 0 m s the hydrodynamic increments are all positive for most of the time this indicates that the erected fins can improve the overall hydrodynamic performance one of the reasons for the raised hydrodynamic forces is the increase in the area of the median fins the surface areas of the second dorsal and caudal fins grow by 15 and 15 7 when they are erected more importantly the area of the first dorsal fin is about 1 75 times that of the second dorsal fin as the first dorsal fin unfolds out of groove the median fins as a whole are estimated to have increased hydrodynamic forces by about 104 when the v x0 is 4 0 m s the hydrodynamic increments fluctuate wildly in the early phase before t 0 3 0 4s the three increments rise rapidly and the erected median fins play a role in enhancing hydrodynamics but then the situation is changed the tuna with the erected median fins starts to move backwards at t 0 85s while the tuna with the depressed median fins continues to move forward in the period of t 0 85 1 92s they swim in opposite directions the different flow field conditions cause the irregular changes of hydrodynamic increments the contribution of each part of the tuna to the overall hydrodynamic increment including the body bd caudal fin cf first dorsal fin df1 second dorsal fin df2 and anal fin af is also shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the first dorsal fin contributes most to the hydrodynamic increment as mentioned above the main reason is that its area is the largest among the median fins the hydrodynamic increments contributed by the second dorsal and anal fins is negative and do not have a significant positive effect on the turning movement this is different from the viewpoint of pavlov et al 2017 who believes that the erected second dorsal and anal fins can improve turning maneuverability in addition the hydrodynamics of the body and caudal fin have also been changed correspondingly the hydrodynamic increment Œ¥f x and Œ¥f z of the body is second only to the first dorsal fin and larger than other fins the caudal fin has the largest moment increment Œ¥m y which is conducive to rapid yaw or turning of the tuna this shows that the parts of tuna are not independent of each other and the erections of the median fins not only change their own performance but also affect the hydrodynamics of the body and caudal fin one explanation for this phenomenon is that the morphology of the median fins can change the flow field distribution on the surface of the tuna body thereby influencing its drag and lift the body fin and fin fin interaction is another reason for the increased hydrodynamics of tuna liu et al 2017 came to a conclusion similar to this paper that the body fin and fin fin interaction could increase the swimming thrust of fish by the comparison of the body fin and body caudal fin models triantafyllou et al 2020 have pointed out that the median fin can enhance turning maneuverability only if it is located in front of the com as can be seen from fig 3 the first dorsal fin meets the above condition and is very helpful to improve the turning performance due to the different positions relative to the com the functions of the median fins are not exactly the same the first dorsal fin can promote yaw maneuvers while the second dorsal and anal fins tend to improve stability this mechanism may provide a new design idea for underwater bionic robot most existing robotic fishes only have fixed dorsal and anal fins without morphological structures if high yaw mobility is required a morphing dorsal fin can be added in front of the com to adjust the hydrodynamic performance compared to other conventional active methods such as increasing the oscillation amplitude and frequency of the caudal fin the morphing median fin is a passive way that can make better use of fluid flow thereby saving energy and improving efficiency noda et al 2016 the median fin of the tuna is analogous to the morphing wing of the airplane the advantage of the morphing wing is that the aerodynamics of the airplane can be improved by changing its sweep angle so that the flight performance can be optimized at both high and low speeds the median fin may also have a similar function which can balance the swimming performance in various locomotor behaviors 3 4 yaw performance the most important indicator for judging the turning performance is the yaw angle Œ∏ in the early phase of c turn behavior the tuna mainly relies on the c shaped bending of the caudal fin and the morphology of median fins has little effect on the yaw motion as shown in fig 13 no matter what the initial speed is there is only a slight difference in yaw angle between the erected and depressed morphology before t 0 5s it can be considered that when the caudal fin swings back the erected fins gradually perform the additional function facilitating the tuna s yaw or turn maneuvers according to fig 14 and table 2 we can further verify the two viewpoints made before one of the viewpoints is that the erected median fins can enhance the yaw and turning performance of the tuna at the same initial speed the yaw angle Œ∏ of the erected morphology is generally lager especially after t 1 2 1 5s the rising slope of yaw angle Œ∏ in the erected morphology is obviously greater than that in the depressed morphology in the period of t 0 8 3 0s the growth rate of yaw angle in the erected morphology is 1 57 12 7 when the v x0 is 1 0 m s and it is 9 20 20 4 if the v x0 is 4 0 m s during the gliding stage the erected median fins does help the tuna turn the other viewpoints is that high initial speed can also improve the turning efficiency of tuna we can clarify it from three aspects first with the increase of initial speed the yaw angle Œ∏ increases rapidly within a range of initial speeds from 1 0 m s to 4 0 m s the extremum of the yaw angle Œ∏ is 0 85 rad 1 42 rad 1 85 rad and 2 18 rad in the erected morphology respectively this indicates that compared with the initial speed of 1 0 m s the extremum is increased by about 67 117 and 156 respectively second the erected median fins play a greater role at high speeds taking t 2 0s as an example when the initial speed goes up from 1 0 m s to 4 0 m s the Œ∏ of the tuna with the erected fins rises by about 8 92 10 7 14 4 and 20 1 respectively it can be seen that the growth rate of yaw angle also increases as the initial speed increases higher growth rate means faster turning in the erected morphology the last with the increase of initial speed the time to reach the maximum growth rate is earlier when the initial speed is 1 0 m s the growth rate reaches the maximum of 12 7 at about t 3 0s while the maximum growth rate of 20 6 occurs at about t 1 5s if the initial speed is 4 0 m s the faster rise in growth rate also indicates the improvement of turning efficiency another important indicator is the turning radius r it can be seen from fig 15 that regardless of the initial speed the turning radius r in the erected morphology is smaller than that in the depressed morphology the reduction of the turning radius is mainly due to the reduction of the swimming distance along the x direction when the initial speed goes up from 1 0 m s to 4 0 m s the maximum displacement dx the tuna with the depressed fins swims along the x direction are 2 15 m 2 35 m 1 82 m and 1 60 m within the period of t 0 4 0s while it swims 2 06 m 1 94 m 1 31 m and 1 29 m in the erected morphology the displacement dx is reduced by 4 2 17 4 28 0 and 19 4 respectively however the swimming displacement dz along the z direction is 1 03 m 2 71 m 3 42 m and 3 44 m in the erected morphology with corresponding increase of 11 9 10 1 5 6 and 3 8 the increase in displacement dz may be a necessary sacrifice for rapid turning fig 16 is the c turn process of the tuna at the initial speed of 4 m s here we can clearly compare the turning sequence of the tuna with the erected and depressed fins moreover it needs to be noted that the turning radius r especially the displacement dx decreases as the initial speed increases in other words it is easier for tuna to turn at high speeds this is in line with the biological characteristics of tuna after all it swims at high speed throughout its life to summarize the erected median fins can help the tuna yaw or turn at a faster speed and with a smaller turning radius generally speaking large fish with rigid body like tuna has much less mobility than small fish with flexible body blake et al 1995 scaradozzia et al 2017 the erection of the median fins improves the efficiency of predation and searching which may be the evolutionary advantage of tuna in addition we also believe that the erected fins not only enhance yaw maneuverability but may also improve roll stability borazjani 2013 when the median fins are erected the anti rolling ability of the tuna is likely to increase due to the increased moment arm around the x direction it s like a tightrope walker who needs to carry a long stick to keep his balance although there is no rigorous discussion and analysis in this paper it is our opinion that during the c turn behavior the tuna can cleverly alleviate the trade off between maneuverability and stability by regulating the morphology of its median fins anderson and chhabra 2002 and achieve superior comprehensive locomotion performance with less energy consumption especially at high speeds 3 5 the flow field structure fig 17 shows the vorticity contours and velocity vectors on the xz plane when the tuna is in the erected morphology and the initial speed is 1 0 m s it can be seen that as the tail of the tuna quickly bends into a c shape a vortex is produced near the caudal fin this vortex gradually sheds from the tail at t 0 2s and simultaneously the other vortex in the opposite direction begins to appear and develop the two vortices form a vortex pair and then move away to the side of the tuna starting from t 0 8s another stronger vortex pair is also created and unlike the previous vortex it goes far behind the tuna muller et al 2008 yeoet al 2010 borazjaniet al 2012 gazzolaet al 2012 li et al 2012 and feng et al 2020 have all reported this finding that during the c turn behavior two vortex pairs are generated in each of preparation and propulsive stage accompanied by the vortex there are also two distinct jet flows in the flow field just as feng et al 2020 pointed out at about t 0 1s the bending of the caudal fin produces the first jet flow which is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the tuna s body because it is far from the com the reaction force of the jet creates a larger moment which makes the tuna turn quickly the second more powerful jet flow appears at about t 0 8s and its reaction force pushes the tuna to swim forward this may be the reason for the brief change in the trend of forward velocity at about t 0 8 1 4s borazjani et al 2011 and witt et al 2015 found that the bluegill sunfish produces three jet flows during c turn which is different from our results because the tuna body is more rigid or lack of flexibility it is difficult to form a third jet flow in the mid body region like a sunfish in the xz plane the two dimensional flow field distributions of erected and depressed morphology are similar but there are some differences in the vortex structure fig 18 shows the wake structures visualized using the q criterion when the initial speed is 1 0 m s it can be seen that the wake structure near the caudal fin is also similar between the two forms in the preparation stage the caudal fin creates a vortex ring muller et al 2008 gazzola et al 2011 and the jet flow is approximately at the center of the vortex ring li et al 2012 witt et al 2015 feng et al 2020 as the tuna swims the vortex ring detaches from the caudal fin and gradually dissipates the wake structure generated in the propulsive stage is more complex and it is not a regular ring like before however the difference is that in the erected morphology the first dorsal fin also produces a vortex which is not present in the depressed morphology at the beginning the vortex near the first dorsal fin is small and slender as the yaw angle increases the strength of the vortex gradually increases and extends to the second dorsal fin eventually the vortices of the two dorsal fins merge together near the tail the difference of vortex structure may affect the pressure distribution of the tuna and then influence the hydrodynamic performance borazjani and daghooghi 2013 bottom et al 2016 liu et al 2017 feng et al 2020 as mentioned earlier each part of the tuna is not independent and the vortex structure of the first dorsal fin changes the flow field distribution on the surface of the second dorsal fin df2 as shown in the fig 18 with the erection of the first dorsal fin the low pressure area on the downstream surface of the second dorsal fin and around it decreases significantly which may be the reason for the decrease in the hydrodynamic forces moreover the flow field of the tuna s body has also changed as shown in fig 19 when the median fins are depressed the pressure field around the body bd on the cut plane of y 0 12 m is relatively even as the first dorsal fin is erected the pressure on the upstream surface of the body increases while the pressure on the downstream surface decreases so the pressure difference between the two sides of the body is enlarged this is consistent with the previous conclusion that in the erected morphology the hydrodynamic force of the body is improved due to the increased pressure difference on its surface fig 20 shows the three dimensional wake structures in the erected and depressed morphology when the initial velocity is 4 0 m s with the increase of initial speed the wake structures change greatly the caudal fin cannot generate two vortex pairs in the first two stages and the vortex rings also disappear and become irregular shapes however the vortexes produced by the median fins develop and expand and they merge with the vortexes near the caudal fin to a certain extent which further changes the flow field distribution due to the participation of the first dorsal fin the vortex strength in the erected morphology is greater than that in the depressed morphology which may be one of the reasons for the hydrodynamic enhancement in the erected morphology relatively speaking at high speed the vortex strength of the first dorsal fin is higher and it has a greater influence on the entire flow field so the performance of the erected morphology is more superior fig 21 shows the pressure contours on the cut plane of y 0 12 m when the initial speed is 4 0 m s it can be seen that the low pressure area on the downstream side of the tuna expands greatly and it is in line with bernoulli principle we once again point out that in the erected morphology the pressure difference between the two sides of the tuna body is greater which improves the body s hydrodynamics and facilitates the tuna s rapid turning in addition it should be noted that at t 0 8s the pressure difference between the two sides of the caudal fin cf is larger in the depressed morphology which produces a greater reverse moment when the caudal fin swings back as we said before there is a counter rotate phenomenon due to the back swing it can be seen from fig 15 that during the period of t 0 8 1 1s the larger reverse moment in the depressed morphology results in the larger drop in the yaw angle this is also one of the reasons why the yaw or turn motion slows down in the depressed morphology 4 conclusions after a long period of evolution tuna has become a complex and sophisticated system any slight change in the morphological structure may cause a great change in the overall performance during the c turn behaviors the morphology of the median fins has a great influence on the swimming velocity hydrodynamic force yaw performance and flow field structure of the tuna by comparing the self propelled swimming between the erected and depressed morphology the results are summarized as followings 1 at the beginning of the c turn behaviors the median fins have a limited influence on the yaw or turning motion as the caudal fin swings back the morphology of the median fins begins to affect the turning performance of the tuna compared with the depressed morphology the erection of the median fins can increase the yaw angle and reduce the turning radius to a certain extent so that the tuna with erected fins has higher turning maneuverability 2 during the c turn behaviors the forward velocity is almost continuously reduced until the tuna swims in the opposite direction while the lateral velocity increases gradually the yaw angular velocity fluctuates wildly back and forth and finally stabilizes near the 0 axis in the erected morphology the forward velocity decreases faster which results in a shorter braking distance and earlier backward movement and the lateral velocity and yaw angular velocity are usually larger in the erected morphology than in the depressed morphology which may make the tuna turn more rapidly 3 when the median fins are erected the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tuna are increased and the first dorsal fin contributes the most to the hydrodynamic increments which plays a positive role in improving the turning performance the hydrodynamic increments of the second dorsal fin and anal fin are limited so their effect is small due to the body fin and fin fin interactions the hydrodynamics of the body and caudal fin have also changed correspondingly which further affects the hydrodynamic performance of the tuna 4 as the initial speed increases the erection of the median fins is more helpful to the yaw or turning motion when the initial speed goes up from 1 m s to 4 m s the growth rate of the yaw angle in the erected morphology increased from 12 7 to 20 5 at t 3 0s similarly the turning radius in the erected morphology especially the forward displacement is generally reduced more at high speeds this may be in line with the biological characteristics of tuna cruising at high speed throughout their lives 5 in the erected morphology the first dorsal fin also generates vortexes which gradually merge with the vortexes of the second dorsal fin near the tail due to the participation of the first dorsal fin the overall vortex strength in the erected morphology is greater than that in the depressed morphology which may be one of the reasons for the raised hydrodynamics at high speed the vortex strength of the first dorsal fin is higher and it has a greater influence on the entire flow field in addition with the erection of the first dorsal fin the pressure field around the body changes this may be the reason for the body fin interaction credit

20416,nearshore wave prediction is an area of research which still demands continuous developments and the accuracy of wave models in the nearshore regions is known to be limited in this work we focus on an improved coastal prediction across east coast of india and this is one step forward to achieve accurate nearshore predictions using nested wave models the study used two modelling setups swan and swan swash with boundary conditions from deep water model wavewatch iii the comparison of wave hindcasts over the east coast of india with buoy measurements at four nearshore locations represents a higher accuracy in simulating significant wave height hs with a high correlation and high index of agreement using nested swan swash in comparison to swan only further the accuracy of the models was also evaluated during an extreme event such as hudhud cyclone which showed a better match using swash than swan at the visakhapatnam coastal location the sensitivity of the swash model with different grid resolutions was also tested to arrive at the best grid resolutions for achieving accurate nearshore predictions hence a nested swan swash setup should be adopted to locally advance the wave prediction in the nearshore regions reducing the underestimation of wave estimates with swan only setup keywords swash swan wavewatch nearshore prediction cyclone hudhud nested wave model 1 introduction the knowledge of wind waves is crucial for numerous practical and scientific applications such as forecasting of the ocean waves studies dealing with climate naval architecture marine structure operations and other coastal engineering purposes numerical models are used by coastal engineers in designing of coastal structures and thereby to predict the prevailing coastal currents and waves smit et al 2013 and suzuki et al 2017 the advancement in numerical modelling of waves over the past decades caires and sterl 2005 have resulted in various hindcasts globally and regionally which in turn is extensively chawla et al 2013 used to evaluate statistics of the extreme waves guo and sheng 2015 and to analyze climatic wave variability nonetheless the efficiency of hindcast wind waves depends basically on the accuracy of wind fields dissipation parameterization physics bidlot et al 2007 involved and the numerical methods engaged in solving ardhuin et al 2012 the balance equation in terms of wave energy the main source of energy in the generation of waves is the transfer of momentum to the surface of ocean by wind hence uncertainty in the wave model predictions cavaleri 2009 results mainly from the built in errors in the forcing wind fields which in fact is one of the major reasons such that the atmospheric wind quality and its resolution spatial turns out to be the key elements which influences the modelling results various numerical models phase resolving and phase averaged have evolved in the past for varied applications with each model having its own robustness and shortcomings based cavaleri et al 2007 on the wind wave physics and parameterizations adopted in the model vyzikas and greaves 2018 it is to be noted that those models which take into account the entire range of frequencies of the nearshore waves are computationally challenging but observed to be highly efficient in terms of accuracy in the coastal regions different types of numerical models are applied to predict waves which have their own limitations the choice of an apt wave model for any application demands significant investigation and extensive analysis fringer et al 2019 hence in this context an integration of available models has been reported by many researchers in the past which produced commendable progress in wave modelling warner et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011 bhaskaran et al 2013 parvathy and bhaskaran 2019 allahdadi et al 2019 and parvathy 2019 the various physical assumptions and numerics physics is applied in many different numerical models to simulate the processes in surface waves the ocean wave models can be classified as i deterministic models phase resolving and ii stochastic spectral models phase averaged the phase resolving models are defined with respect to the elementary equations of waves with precise approximation the transformation of the surface phenomena is grid computed with resolutions refined than the corresponding wavelengths as such these models are impractical for performing hindcast simulations for large model domains and long durations 5 10 years because of the high computational requirements based on the wave energy equation the phase averaged models statistically defines the wave scenario in time and space and thereby calculates the wave energy distribution in terms of directions and frequency and its transformation at every grid point in time third generation 3g spectral models solve the spectral equation by komen et al 1994 tolman et al 2014 resolving non linear interaction and allow the simulation of sea states ranging from normal conditions to extreme storm conditions e g hurricanes popular 3g phase averaged wave models include swan booij et al 1999 wavewatch iii ww iii ww3dg 2016 wam wamdi group 1988 mike21 sw dhi 2014 tomawac benoit et al 1996 and stwave smith et al 2001 these 3g wave models is also divided into structured and unstructured grid models the first 3g wave model wam was produced by the wamdi group 1988 it solves numerically the action density equation which also includes wave wave interactions non linear as similar to swan and wwiii it is a well tested model and is applied widely by the european wave modelers wwiii solves action density equation for wave number direction spectra under various conditions wwiii uses explicit schemes to advance the solution in time and space and recently a newly implemented implicit numerical solver was introduced abdolali et al 2020 in wwiii while swan uses implicit schemes in recent times wwiii has also been used extensively in nearshore wave prediction abdolali et al 2020 moghimi et al 2020 swan booij et al 1999 amarouche et al 2019 and alizadeh et al 2020 and wwiii tolman et al 2014 lee 2015 yang et al 2017 margarita et al 2018 umesh and behera 2020 and beyramzadeh et al 2021 are well documented and are the most widely used models among all the 3g spectral wave models the fundamental difference among swan and wwiii is in terms of the numerical schemes used to solve the balance spectral equation swan is a phase averaged nearshore wave model swan team 2018 that uses implicit numerical schemes to solve action balance equation and to predict the statistics of waves within the model domain at individual grid point cells these implicit schemes allow larger time steps than models using explicit schemes which allow computationally efficient simulations of cell grid sizes less than 1 km the swan model predicts nearshore wave processes such as refraction non linear wave interactions depth induced breaking white capping and shoaling as a result of bathymetry currents in stationary mode the swan model is capable of solving the balance equation which can help in reducing computing run times the choice is most appropriate whenever the domain of the model is sufficiently small 100 km although unstructured grid models provide advantages in computational efficiency and flexibility for simulating wave climates near complex geometries they are still relatively new compared to structured grid models and are not well vetted swash non hydrostatic wave flow model was developed in the delft university zijlema et al 2011a for coastal waters to predict the surface wave transformation the model is efficient in producing currents and surface elevation over the swash and surf zones with reliable accuracy the model achieves accurate wave energy dissipation thereby accounting for breaking of waves hence swash is considered to be a functional engineering application to be used in extensive areas of prediction cases both in intermediate and shallow waters zijlema et al 2011a in a recent study by zijlema 2020 for a stable local grid improvement it is reported the extension of swash model to unstructured triangular grids numerous wave modelling studies have been reported in the past using nearshore model swan in the world oceans thereby verifying the competency of swan in coastal wave prediction gorrell et al 2011 rogers et al 2012 alomar et al 2014 aijaz et al 2016 ph van vledder et al 2016 ponce de le√≥n et al 2018 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 rusu et al 2018 allahdadi et al 2019 lavidas and polinder 2019 moghimi et al 2005 rusu et al 2008 and bhowmick et al 2011 genseberger donners 2020 and yang et al 2020 the swan model has been applied and validated in the northwest european shelf seas by neill and hashemi 2013 lewis et al 2014 2017 2019 and hashemi et al 2015 model calibration studies for achieving efficient accuracy in simulation of wave height and period was also reported by various researchers such as allahdadi et al 2017 siadatmousavi et al 2011 2012 and niroomandi et al 2018 wu et al 2018 has used swan model in the nearshore regions for simulating typhoons in the south china seas in a study by xu et al 2020 sensitivity of swan model wave heights was assessed during typhoon periods over the china east coast the nested wam swan breivik et al 2009 and wwiii swan anselmi molina et al 2012 setup is reported widely for an improved nearshore wave hindcasting in a study by sandhya et al 2014 using the wwiii swan model set up at the location puducherry in the east coast of india the performances of the models were identified as best during the northeast monsoon the seasonal analysis of wave heights at four locations along the east coast of india gopalpur vishakhapatnam puducherry and tuticorin using unstructured swan model revealed highest correlations during the post monsoon season 0 78 0 96 as reported in sandhya et al 2018 the swash model was also extensively used in the past and its applicability was evaluated using numerical and physical experiments suzuki et al 2011 dusseljee et al 2014 sandra 2017 joao 2014 mardones 2011 tas 2016 van eeden 2017 tas 2016 klein et al 2017 sous et al 2019 idier et al 2020 and fiedler et al 2020 suzuki et al 2012 reported the validation of mike21 bw model and swash with measurements which shows prediction of wave heights with reasonable accuracy the study by attman and thesis 2017 had reported on the accurate prediction of variation in wave heights by swash by validation with measurements in laboratory enr√≠quez et al 2017 have applied a swan swash set up in the western mediterranean to evaluate wave processes from the deep waters to swash zone correlation of 0 9 with measurements and the study reported that the beaches would encounter a coastal retreat from 7 to 50 m alari and kouts 2012 used swan model in the baltic sea to simulate wave conditions during the cyclone gudrun january 8 9 2005 and therefore to provide boundary data as input to the swash model for calculating inundation and setup alari 2013 phung et al 2020 in a recent study has reported on the coupling of swash model with a sediment transport model and the validation results using laboratory measurements showed reasonable comparison in a study by buckley et al 2014 it reports the evaluation of the models swan swash and xbeach in a reef environment where the sea swell wave heights have been predicted with accuracy within reasonable limits guimaraes et al 2015 have demonstrated the use of combining the models wavewatch iii swan and swash as an effective tool in coastal management for evaluating floods and run up during extreme conditions in a recent study by ryu et al 2020 in the coastal region of namhangjin the swan swash model setup could reproduce the spectral shapes with respect to the measurements at the study location the study points to the fact that the swash model is streamlined enough in the replication of irregular waves and finds wide applications in coastal engineering ryu et al 2020 in the context of hydro metrological events that occurred in the french atlantic coast idier et al 2020 used the swash model to evaluate the stochastic behavior of waves on coastal flooding based on various flood regimes in another recent study by saprykina et al 2020 the swash model was applied in the kerala coast and the modelling results identified that the downshifting of frequency can be considered as a feasible technique for the mudbank formation application of the swan model with extensive validation by various researchers across the north indian ocean in the past is evident from the literatures sandhya et al 2014 parvathy et al 2017 umesh and swain 2018 umesh et al 2019 but there are hardly any studies reported on any attempt for an improvement in nearshore prediction using the nested swan swash set up in the coastal regions in an abruptly alternating bathymetry the phase averaged models application is limited as they may not completely consider the reflection and diffraction by a wave in this context we have the phase resolving model such as swash working in time domain and based on non hydrostatic equations and consider all transformation effects however the swash model involves substantial time for computation based on accurate prediction of the sea surface in space and time hence phase resolving models are not applicable for larger domains and hence we have applied nesting of models in this study the selection of this composition swan swash is mainly due to the fact that the nearshore model swan is efficient in producing spectral wave boundary conditions to be used as input for swash model alari 2013 guimaraes et al 2015 van eeden 2017 and ryu et al 2020 the study is of its first kind in the east coast of india that reports and recommends a modelling setup that can be used to improve the current prediction system in nearshore regions the study aims to demonstrate a new modelling build up and further its extended application to a region i e a specific site viz the east coast of india it highlights how well the model reproduces the wave characteristics in a nearshore location by comparison with wave measurements and also makes available a reproducible mode set up which can be utilized in future coastal wave modelling studies whilst a more rooted investigation of the processes in the nearshore regions will be addressed in future studies this study is mainly concentrated on verifying the nested swan swash set up of the model section 2 describes prevailing study area and section 3 provides a brief knowledge of the wave models used section 4 describes the data used and the methodology adopted section 5 presents the results followed by discussions a short summary and conclusions are formulated and presented at the end in section 6 2 study area bay of bengal the bay of bengal which occupies an area of 2 173 000 sq km is representative of the northeastern indian ocean which lies in the longitudes 80 90 e and latitudes 5 22 n the bay has an average depth of 2600 m and it is 1600 km wide surrounded by india and sri lanka on the western side in the north by bangladesh and in the east the malay peninsula northern region the bay holds a large number of rivers flowing namely kaveri krishna mahanadi and godavari in the west brahmaputra and ganges in the north sarma et al 2000 in the north indian ocean the head bay of bengal with a coastline i e funnel shaped is unique with its characteristics such as very high tidal range 6 7 m rose and bhaskaran 2017 and highly proned to flooding topography with low lying characteristics huge deposits of sediments mohanty et al 2008 tidal creeks mangrove ecosystems ghosh et al 2015 with diverse river systems and the existence of a vast deltaic system kuehl et al 1989 rogers and goodbred 2014 three contrasting weather conditions glejin et al 2013 prevail in the bay of bengal namely a pre monsoon fair weather february to may b south west monsoon summer monsoon june to september and north east monsoon post monsoon october to january during the north east monsoon november april in the northern part of the bay a high pressure continental system leads potemra et al 1991 to the generation of north east winds which is a unique feature of the season namely winter schott and mccreary 2001 schott et al 2009 during the south west monsoon june to september across the landmass a low pressure is created due to the intense heat and also the flow of air advancing the land from ocean which leads to the rain producing monsoons the wind and wave climate in the bay of bengal hastenrath and lamb 1979 young and holland 1996 indicates that during the rough weather season the wind and wave activity is essentially determined by the southwest monsoon prevailing in the tropical indian ocean the southwesterly winds sweeps across the southern central bay of bengal during july and august with the wind speeds reaching 9 15 m s which is considered as the southwest monsoon peak in the fair weather season calm seas are observed with swell domination in the nearshore region glejin et al 2013 along with waves generated locally in a lesser extent during july and august the mean wave heights over the central bay of bengal ranges up to 2 5 and 2 5 m swain 1997 the occurrence of cyclones dube et al 2009 dube 2012 wang et al 2020 is also noted in the bay during the months of april to may spring and in the fall time of october to november with strong winds of high magnitude and abounding downpours 3 wave models theoretical aspects in the context of wave modelling the basic physics and its different aspects have been examined in the past but a brief update is presented here 3 1 numerical approach and selection of the model the approach adopted in this study is to utilize the models wavewatch iii swan and swash to define the nearshore waves along with the characteristic surf zone the two models namely swan and swash are united to represent the wave mechanisms till the swash zone starting from the very deep waters booij et al 1999 and zijlema et al 2011b the hindcast experiments are performed using two nesting procedures to predict the waves along shore from the offshore regions the third generation model swan simulates the wave spectra by solving the spectral equation action balance and it produces a more accurate and reliable estimation of waves in larger areas which is also computationally achievable while at the same time swash is considered as a phase resolving model which is non hydrostatic driven by the shallow water non linear equations the momentum vertical equation and momentum horizontal equation i e non hydrostatic pressure taking into consideration its cost of computation the application of swash is restricted to small areas the combination of both models allows for high resolution and accurate results enr√≠quez et al 2017 with less computational cost swan version 41 20 was chosen as it is a widely used model fitting the coastal shelf seas and nearshore areas whereas wwiii was originally designed and is generally used for wave modelling on ocean scales spatial scales 500 km model domains 105 km2 swan is designed to run on coastal scales shelf seas with model domains 105 km2 the elemental concept is to utilize the hindcasts boundary conditions from wavewatch iii for accurate nesting with swan than applying it first in swash the accepted capability of the model swan in producing accurate wave spectra for swash in the shallow conditions is a main reasoning for this thus in this direction on very fine scale we accomplish an acceptable depiction of the wave phenomenon and its associated processes further we provide here a brief on the features of the models and the implementations executed for this study the focus is provided on the model swash in comparison to wavewatch iii and swan as it is not widely used 3 2 wavewatch iii model amongst the third generation deep water spectral wave models wavewatch iii is a popular model which is updated with the developments in numerical modelling and the physics of ocean waves tolman et al 2014 in this study we have used the 5 16 ww3dg 2016 version of wavewatch iii which is a phase averaged model

whitecapping respectively the sbot defined as the wave bottom interaction is the most notable process shemdin et al 1978 in shallow waters while triad wave wave interactions str and depth induced

et al 2013 casas prat et al 2018 umesh and behera 2020 in many earlier studies in a study by stopa et al 2016 the st4 physics was validated extensively and proved to be achieving acceptable agreement with the observations while considering the non linear interaction the dia scheme by hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 is used 3 3 swan model the phase averaged model swan represents the transformation

study region 3 4 swash model swash simulating waves till shore is a phase resolving non hydrostatic numerical wave flow model developed by the delft university of technology this model is used in predicting wave transformation in coastal waters complex scenarios dealing with varied flows such as coastal flooding dike breaking circulation in the oceans on larger scales and flows driven by density swash team 2017 it is also efficient in simulating flows such as irrotational and transport aspects in 1 2 and 3 dimensions the layers in the fluids considered can be multi layered or averaged in terms of depth the main fact that the model swash is non hydrostatic prepares itself unique which can be applied till the shore in coastal regions zijlema et al 2011b the main equation s that governs the model are the non hydrostatic pressure term and the non linear shallow water equations defined as shown below in equations 5 8 equations 5 and 8 represent global and local equation of

assumption of hydrostatic pressure is valid at offshore depths while at the nearshore swash applies the momentum equation vertical in context of the pressure term non hydrostatic being required it is also to be noted that swash has the capability in improving its dispersion of frequency by expanding the vertical layers in number which makes the model much rapid and more powerful as compared to other models fundamentally the model is capable in capturing the flow features on scales spatially centimetres kilometres and temporally seconds hours since the model adopts the approach of phase resolving it is quite demanding in terms of computation as well as time consuming the swash version 5 01 is used in the present study swash team 2017 4 data used and methodology 4 1 model input data the study utilized ncep fnl final winds over a 0 25 0 25 grid resolution which is available operationally every 6 h the winds over the years 2014 and 2016 were extracted and used to force the wave models in the hindcast experiments the fnl winds are produced using the ncep gfs global forecast system model in the past there are many reported studies utilizing ncep fnl winds for wave modelling bhaskaran et al 2013 li feng et al 2017 chen et al 2020 which produced accurate results in wwiii bathymetry data has been derived from etopo2 national geophysical data center ngdc 2006 for the grid generation and in the nearshore simulations using swan and swash the bathymetry used is the modified etopo2 0 033 deg database as described in sindhu et al 2007 this dataset represents improved bathymetry at the shelfs in the indian ocean which is achieved from the nho naval hydrographic office charts to generate the tidal input the updated version of the global inverse tide model tpxo9 is used egbert et al 2018 and the variations in water level during the years 2014 and 2016 is utilized as inputs in the nearshore model swan it is reported in a study by shum et al 1997 that the nearshore regions are in fact very challenging in the context of tide models however the continuous advancement in models dealing with bathymetry observations and the algorithms has brought out considerable progress stammer et al 2014 in the latest available tide models especially in the near coastal regions 4 2 wave data the measured wave data from the directional wave rider buoy

depth induced breaking the numerical simulations in this study used ncep winds as the forcing input wind field the wave model has the capability in interpolating the wind fields to desired model grids with the magnitudes preferred during the deep water wavewatch run two dimensional energy density spectra wave height peak period and peak direction are extracted along the boundary of the nested grid sd2 which serves as the boundary conditions for the nearshore swan run the model simulations are carried out for the years 2014 and 2016 and wave characteristics were generated model run was started 20 days prior to the considered period providing initial spin up period the outputs of the swan swash model are processed from the domains sd3 sd4 sd5 and sd6 as shown in fig 2 which is the innermost

results and discussion the performance evaluation of swan and swash models is determined by analyzing with buoy measurements along four coastal locations puducherry krishnapatnam visakhapatnam and gopalpur in the east coast of india in this study in addition validation during an extreme weather event is also attempted qualitatively the performances of the models were evaluated with the aid of different statistical indicators namely r correlation coefficient b bias rmse root mean square error and ia index of agreement the correlation coefficient r defines the closeness among the observations o and the predictions by the model p it represents the linear correlation among the observations and model values and it varies of the order 1 to 1 in this context a very high correlation value which is positive suggests the limit to which prediction reproduces the trend in observations the mean difference among the model predictions and observations is defined as the bias and the differences in the standard deviation amongst the model predictions and observations is described as the rmse the ia is defined as a standard estimate of the extent in error of model predictions which was defined by willmott 1981 and it ranges from 0 to 1 the value 0 represents no match and the value 1 indicates a perfect agreement the ia value is 1 for a model that perfectly captures the observations while it remains 0 for ideal differences if the variance in the model error is bigger than the variance in the observations it is likely to represents a negative skill that happens only if model earnestly differs from the observations the above statistical estimates are used for the assessment of the hindcast experiments results and the different error estimates defined statistically are shown as follows 9 b i a s 1 n i 1 n p i o i 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where n is the number of data points pi defines the model estimates oi is the data from observations and 11 r i 1 n p i

model validation is a fundamental step in determining the accuracy of wave hindcasts forecasts in the east coast of india the investigation attempts to validate the estimated swan and swash hs at four costal locations the results from performances evaluation of the models during the years 2014 and 2016 using ncep fnl winds are presented in the following sections where model performance or model skill is defined as the ability of the model to simulate the parameter hs derived from measurements at the coastal locations model skill is analyzed by comparing the time series plots of hs two types of nesting s are used in this study namely wwiii swan and wwiii swan swash the wwiii model simulations were used to provide the boundary conditions at the swan nearshore grids and hence the successful implementation of the nested grid approach can be seen from the results discussed below smooth distributions of the significant wave height specifically the absence of any discontinuities across the nested grid boundaries demonstrates the successful implementation of the nested grid approach the simulation results using swan and nested swan swash models were validated in the time domain by comparison with wave measurements at four locations in the east coast of india the following results discussed below are on the simulated wave hindcasts in the innermost swan swash sd3 sd4 sd5 sd6 domains fig 2 fine grids for four locations namely puducherry krishnapatnam visakhapatnam and gopalpur the model results time series are compared at each locations with measurements of significant wave parameter such as significant wave height hs the validation results are indicated in figs 3 7 the measurements are indicated in continuous red lines the swan results in dotted blue lines and swash results in dotted green lines by and large the simulated model results were promising and acceptable nevertheless higher deviations were shown by the swan results while at the same time the nested swan swash setup mimicked the shape of the measurements thereby providing a fairly acceptable comparison with the buoy hs the comparison statistics of swan and swash hindcasts is as indicated in table 2 and fig 4 a comparison of the significant wave height time series predicted using swan swash in the present study and wave rider buoy measurements at puducherry location is shown in fig 3 for the period 06 january to december 31 2016 it is observed from fig 3 that both swan and swash is capable in capturing the trend of hs at the location off puducherry with a better prediction represented by nested swan swash at the puducherry location the swan model represented better predictions during the south west monsoon season can be attributed to the prevailing strong monsoon winds as compared to the other months of the year the swan hindcasts showed a correlation of 0 62 and rmse 0 27 m significant over predictions in higher hs ranges was noted at the location with a bias value of 0 18 m the predicted time series for hs using the nested swan swash model is in agreement with buoy measurements fig 3 and likewise provides confidence in the nested model settings while at the same time the hindcasts using swash showed a bias value of 0 08 m indicating slight underestimations and a very high correlation r 0 93 the ia estimate of 0 95 for hs showed close agreements with swash hindcasts and the buoy measurements overall the results showed closed match as well as improved accuracy using swash fig 4 however there are noticeable improvements due to the increased grid resolution in predicting the peaks in the wave height time series this improvement albeit for only the parameter of wave height provides confidence that this nested set up offers better improved accuracy in prediction fig 5 shows the comparison of hs simulated by swan swash models between 07 april to december 31 2016 at the krishnapatanam location the comparison shows moderate correlation between predictions and measurements with r 0 68 using swan the rmse is 0 26 m which denotes deviations from the measurements with an ia value of 0 76 the swan model shows underpredicton of hs during the south west monsoon as similar to the puducherry location and over prediction during the rest of the period with a bias of 0 22 m it is to be noted that at this location overprediction by both swan and swash was seen in the higher hs ranges during the fair weather seasons although both models could reproduce the trend in hs at the krishnapatanam location swash exhibits the best model skill for hs with an ia value of 0 97 the correlation is noted to be high of 0 95 with low bias value of 0 07 m indicating slight underestimations comparisons were also carried out at the location off vishakaptanam during the period 01 january to march 21 2014 as shown in fig 6 the overpredictions by swan were higher in this location with a b 0 36 m and represented a lower correlation of r 0 69 the ia value 0 65 denoted the deviation in capturing the hs at the buoy location the predictions were better represented using swash with slighter underestimations with a high correlation of 0 96 and ia 0 93 fig 4 which again provides better confidence in the nested setup at the coastal location analogous trends in comparison were noted in the period from january 01 to august 26 2014 at the gopalpur location as shown in fig 7 the comparisons revealed correlations of 0 78 and 0 89 using swan and swash models respectively the swan model showed under predictions and over estimations with bias value of 0 39 m at the same time the swash hindcasts were more promising with a lower rmse 0 23 m and ia value of 0 88 as compared to swan hindcasts fig 4 the noticeable aspect in the simulated hs during this period was that the models fairly performed better and more accurate in picking up the peaks in the nearshore location with a better prediction using swash the above results are also comparable with the results reported by sandhya et al 2018 along the east coast of india for the year 2014 using unstructured swan model in this study at the gopalpur location the wave heights less than 0 5 m are overestimated slightly and underestimations are noted for wave heights above 1 5 m the seasonal analysis showed that the rmse at visakhapatnam was 0 25 m for all seasons but it was noted to be the lowest at puducherry 0 12 m and gopalpur 0 17 m locations during pre monsoon periods further the seasonal analysis revealed correlations ranging from 0 67 to 0 96 0 66 to 0 93 and 0 64 to 0 91 for gopalpur visakhapatnam and puducherry locations respectively similarly the bias values ranged from 0 16 to 0 13 m 0 15 to 0 21 m and 0 11 to 0 05 m for gopalpur visakhapatnam and puducherry locations respectively indicating underestimations and overestimations of wave heights using the wwiii swan set up at the puducherry location for june 2007 to july 2009 sandhya et al 2014 had also reported seasonal model performances for wave heights with rmse ranging from 0 15 m to 0 24 m with the performance signified as the best during the northeast monsoon season from the above analysis it is evident that both models showed either underestimation or overestimation of peak wave heights at all four locations considered by the application of other wind products sirisha et al 2019 with high temporal and spatial resolution additionally including land and sea breeze effects can lead to more accurate predictions by the models an evaluation based on seasons however is not in the scope of the present study as it needs long term validation and this study is only a preliminary step in defining an improved nearshore model set up by and large the comparison between measured and simulated hs is observed to be reasonably consistent mainly in reproducing differences in hs at the study location with an acceptable extent of reliability in order to compare the model performances in the coastal location the taylor diagram karl taylor 2001 was also prepared as indicated in fig 8 the taylor diagram is described depending upon three skill evaluators such as root mean square deviation correlation coefficient and standard deviation by validating the simulated model results with measurements at the four coastal locations it is noted from fig 8a b that at puducherry and krishnapatnam locations the standard deviations were similar range of 0 2 0 3 with high correlations r 0 9 using the swash model as compared to swan at the visakhapatnam location fig 8c the standard deviations were lower in the range 0 1 0 2 but it was higher at gopalpur location 0 3 0 4 using swash model fig 8d as compared to swan the root mean square deviation rmsd was lesser than 0 1 in all locations using swash except gopalpur while at the same time deviations rmsd was higher than 0 2 in all locations using swan the highest correlations by swan and swash were shown at locations gopalpur r 0 76 and visakhapatnam r 0 95 respectively the lowest correlations by swan and swash were shown at locations puducherry r 0 65 and gopalpur r 0 9 respectively overall the taylor diagram gives a clear picture on the deviations in both the model performances at the four coastal locations and thereby highlights the applicability of the swash model to have a better understanding the study also attempted to compare the model simulated 1d spectra with buoy spectra of selected months for the locations visakhapatnam and gopalpur to evaluate the spectral characteristics the monthly averaged spectra during 2014 is used for the months of january and february for the visakhapatnam location and january march may and july for the gopalpur location figs 9 and 10 shows the validation of wave spectra simulated by swan and swan swash setup with the buoy spectra average at the locations visakhapatnam and gopalpur respectively the measurements are indicated as continuous red lines the swan results by blue lines and the swash results by green lines as evident from fig 9 the validation of wave spectra for the months of january and february 2014 at the visakhapatnam location produced promising results with the application of swash it is noted from fig 9 that during january and february 2014 at the coastal location the peak frequencies were reproduced efficiently with peak energies observed to be underestimated by swash and overestimated by swan the prevailing weak winds throughout the fair weather months of january and february could be a possible reason for this the simulated wave spectra were overestimated by swan and slightly underestimated by swash during january 2014 it is evident from fig 9a that in the prediction of the double peaks a better estimate in terms of energy was reproduced by swash with slighter underestimation as compared to swan the swan swash spectra comparisons showed a correlation 0 77 0 94 a bias of 0 06 0 007 and an rmse 0 07 0 01 the peak energies as simulated by swan and swash in january 2014 are 0 35 and 0 27 m2 hz as compared to buoy value of 0 30 m2 hz similar performances were seen during the month of february 2014 fig 9b with a correlation of 0 73 using swan and 0 89 using swash the swan simulation of wave spectra was overestimated at the location with a bias of 0 04 while swash showed a better match with slight underestimation b 0 015 the peak energies as simulated by swan and swash in february 2014 are 0 42 and 0 33 m2 hz as compared to buoy value of 0 37 m2 hz both the months being a fair weather season in the study area long swells are prevalent and the distinct ways in which the physics of propagation of swell is treated in the model can be a likely cause of the deviations the comparison between 1d predicted frequency spectra and measured data for the coastal gopalpur location during january march may and july 2014 is as shown in fig 10 a d as evident from the validation it shows that the peak frequencies are simulated well while peak energies are underestimated by swan and swash during january and march 2014 the swan swash spectra comparisons during january 2014 fig 10a showed a correlation 0 74 0 88 with a bias of 0 014 0 004 and an rmse 0 07 0 01 the peak energies as simulated by swan swash in january 2014 are 0 20 and 0 25 m2 hz as compared to buoy value of 0 29 m2 hz the swan swash spectra comparisons during february 2014 fig 10b showed a correlation 0 76 0 90 with a bias of 0 019 0 008 and an rmse 0 05 0 02 in march 2014 the swash swan model could capture a peak energies of 0 32 0 28 m2 hz as compared to the buoy value of 0 38 m2 hz the deviations can be attributed to the prevailing feeble winds in the fair weather season of the month of january and march during may 2014 the swash model fig 10c shows an acceptable comparison r 0 95 with a slight overestimation a bias of 0 02 having an rmse 0 03 the swan comparisons r 0 71 revealed underestimations with a bias 0 05 and rmse 0 08 the peak energies as simulated by swash 1 31 m2 hz was promising w r t buoy energies of 1 21 m2 hz while swan showed a peak energy of 0 94 m2 hz the comparison for the month of july 2014 fig 10d showed correlations of 0 78 and 0 93 using swan and swash respectively swash revealed underestimations with a bias 0 026 and swan overestimated the peak energies with a bias 0 03 the rmse were 0 04 and 0 08 using swash and swan respectively the month of july 2014 also showed a better skill in simulating the peak energies of 1 14 m2 hz by swash in comparison to buoy energies of 1 25 m2 hz while swan showed a higher estimation of 1 39 m2 hz on the whole the deviations underestimation or overestimation of peak energies in the comparison of the spectra at the study locations can be dependent on the fact that the discretization of frequency of both buoy and model are dissimilar and can lead to smoothening of the model spectra in general the overall best model performance was attained by swash model but required higher computational cost in comparison to swan results table 3 summaries the errors of mean wave height and the computational time based on the swan and swash model simulations 3 m 3 m grid resolution for all the locations considered along the east coast of india the average error is expressed in percentage and calculated as the absolute value of the quantity the mean absolute percentage error mape is the mean or average of the absolute percentage errors of predictions 13 m a p e 1 n i 1 n o i p i o i 100 where n is the number of data points pi defines the model estimates oi is the data from observations from table 3 it is notable that overall average absolute error for all the locations ranged from 7 to 16 for swash simulations at the same time the swan simulation results along all the coastal locations showed absolute errors ranging from 15 to 23 although both models have shown under estimation and over estimation of measurements at the study locations the swash model was capable in simulating wave heights with better accuracy in comparison to swan model in the context of practical applications of coastal models the computational cost involved in the model performances is significantly important table 3 also provides the computational times involved in the simulations over the period of study a 16 core cluster computation facility was used for executing the simulations as available at the research lab and the swash model required a very large computational time typically of several hours per simulation in comparison to swan simulations being very few hours but then this is quite expected as swash is a computationally expensive model and hence an increase in the number of computational cores can help in reducing the computational time in swash which was one of the limitations of this study in a recent study by gruwez et al 2020 it is reported the inter comparison of three numerical models namely openfoam dualsphysics and swash to evaluate the wave transformations effects across the foreshore and mainly the wave structure interactions though all three models were efficient in the performances the swash model proved to show the highest computational efficiency based on the computational facility overall it is noted that both the wave models swan and swash reproduces the trends in hs but with varied accuracies these deviations can be due to many reasons and can also be attributed to the model limitations the model errors can be caused by several factors including the accuracy of bathymetry and wind forcing though it is noted that a model reproduces the fundamental physics such as generation of wave and growth mechanisms dissipation effects currents induced effects and non linear interactions an accurate prediction is based ultimately on choosing the model selected source terms in the phase averaged wave models specification of model inputs wind data sources proper model calibration and validation challenges resulting from many calibration parameters use of different metrics for evaluating model performance the dependency of spatial and temporal model resolutions and the frequency and direction resolutions of wave spectra these same models generally over predict significant wave heights during normal seas which has been attributed to failure to accurately model swell dissipation effects ardhuin et al 2009 and an over bias in dallman et al 2014 wind forcing used to drive the wave models in relation to wave physics more frequent underestimates cavaleri 2009 of higher surface wind speeds low pass filtering of high wind speeds smoothing due to insufficient spatial resolution failure to capture gusts failure to capture wave shoaling effects of currents and the breakdown of wave generation whitecapping breaking and discrete interaction approximation dia models at high wind speeds those related to numerics i e numerical diffusion caused by low order numerical schemes and spatial temporal and spectral frequency and direction resolution and those related to modelling model tuning or calibration can also lead to underestimations by the models a high resolution of the spectrum in terms of direction and frequency is important to accurately model the energy advection generated by swells propagating from far away distances which is relevant in this study specifically the complexity in geometry and the shallow water bathymetry in these coastal locations will affect the waves by modifying the features of approaching waves in terms of direction and frequency nonetheless the time involved in computation increases proportionately as the resolution of the spectra is increases in terms of direction and frequency hence an evaluation of the accuracy in prediction by wave models and the equivalent cost in computations involved is utmost importance another two related parameters are the predefined directional sector within which waves travel shoreward and a frequency band with fixed low frequency and high frequency cutoffs narrowing the directional section and frequency band and maintaining the number of frequency and direction bins may increase model accuracy and computational efficiency model skills for predicting hs improve by modelling swell dissipation this supports claims by ardhuin et al 2009 which claims that proper improvements in the swell dissipation leads to reduction in the overestimation of hs swash is a time domain model while the model output quantities such as height period and direction are spectral ones so they require spectral energy densities which cannot be computed by swash the significant wave height on the other hand can also be computed by the variance in elevation of the surface this is the one that has been implemented in swash so we need to apply fourier transformation on the surface elevation to obtain spectra and subsequently we can derive from these spectra wave periods including peak wave direction etc a comparison of wave periods which is not attempted in this study but shall be taken up in a future study 5 2 hindcast experiments under an extreme weather event at any nearshore location it is of immense importance to predict the cyclone characteristics with high accuracy which is not achieved by all wave models the study also attempted to evaluate the model performances in the east coast of india under an extreme weather scenario namely cyclone hudhud the cyclone hudhud is observed to be the second most strongest system that passed the visakhapatnam coast and created expanded damage samiksha et al 2017 the cyclone in its track crossed the islands of andaman on october 8 2014 around ist 09 30 h and further it made its track west of north west and on october 10 2014 it intensified itself as a severe cyclonic storm the storm intensification imd report 2014 continued with winds speeds tending to a maximum of 180 km h and thereby crossing the coast of visakhapatnam at ist 13 00 h on october 12 fig 11 a show the track of hudhud with the corresponding wave rider buoy at the visakhapatnam location that has captured the cyclone fig 11b shows the comparison of swan and swash hindcasts at the time of cyclone hudhud as captured by the in situ measurements for the period 07 to october 14 2014 at the location very close to visakhapatnam a peak hs of 8 1 m was recorded by the buoy fig 11b while the peak hs given by the model is 5 9 m and 6 8 m using swan and swash respectively the comparison shows that swash model was capable r 0 87 in better simulating the peak hs as recorded by the buoy at the visakhapatnam location with underestimations both models were capable in reproducing the general trends at the location with underestimations of peak hs the swan model was found to be underestimated in the lower ranges of hs r 0 72 the swan model showed underestimation of hs with a bias 0 34 m and higher rmse 0 46 m the ia values were comparatively lower such as 0 75 the swash model gave a better and improved estimation of hs during the cyclone with lower bias 0 16 m showing slight underestimation and least rmse 0 19 m and very high index of agreement of the order 0 91 the swan simulated results in present study were found to be in close agreement in comparison with findings described in the study by samiksha et al 2017 where the swan model predicted peak hs value was 6 2 m during the hudhud cyclone also in another study by sirisha et al 2015 during the cyclone period the mike 21 sw model forecasted hs was 5 91 m overall limitation of most 3g wave models in accounting for swell dissipation over long distances has been cited as one of the likely dominant causes for deviations in significant wave height ardhuin et al 2009 it is noted that a high resolution of the spectrum in terms of direction and frequency is extremely important to accurately model the advection of energy from over long distance wherein from the swells evolve the complexities in the bathymetry as well as the geometry along the nearshore regions in particular can modulate the waves incoming in terms of their characteristic directions and frequencies wave dynamics along nearshore zone include more complex phenomena than offshore regions and the number of phenomena to be modeled generally increases across the surf zone towards the shoreline when the waves propagate into the shallow waters from the deep waters they attain more non linear characteristics thereby leading to the transport of energy amongst the highest and lowest frequencies from the spectrum peaks ultimately wave breaking is induced by the closeness of the sea bottom which raises the turbulence in the marine environment thereby causing various currents extending far ahead surf zones it is therefore prudent to assess the efficiency of nearshore model predictions at extreme shallower depths as well where more complex wave dynamics are occurring 5 3 sensitivity of swash model with different grid resolutions the swash model is not like swan where we have the freedom to modify the source term parameters this is because the source terms in swan are empirical whereas swash is a first principle model so there is hardly no any parameter where you can freely adapt for the purpose of sensitivity study except perhaps the bottom friction from a physical point of view the bottom friction term does not contain enough information concerning the roughness and the type of bottom topography so this implies that we may adapt the value of 0 019 manning formulation which is implemented in the present study swash team 2017 wave breaking in swash is not empirical and the breaking parameters Œ± 0 6 Œ≤ 0 3 are supposed to be universal which is used in the present study smit et al 2014 to have a study with change of values we do not have any background literatures in this bay of bengal region using swash model to choose a range of values and the physical driving mechanism for wind differs in the models wind in swash is simply a friction condition to be applied for tidal waves hence a detailed sensitivity study in swash at this point can t be attempted while we have many reported performance evaluation studies using swan bhowmick et al 2011 nayak et al 2013 prasad et al 2013 sandhya et al 2014 swain et al 2019 in the bay of bengal the possible parameters to change for a more accurate model results might be the grid and time steps it is actually not a sensitivity analysis but rather a convergence analysis hence in this section the study attempts to test the sensitivity of the swash model with respect to three different grid resolutions namely 5 m 3 m and 1 m respectively the model setup is retained as the same as shown in figs 1 and 2 except that in the innermost swash domains sd3 sd4 sd5 sd6 two more grid resolutions 5 m 5 m and 1 m 1 m is tested to compare with 3 m 3 m grid resolution which is already used as the initial set up fig 12 shows the comparison of swash hindcasts with nearshore wave observations off puducherry for three different grid resolutions the statistics of the comparison of sensitivity of different grid resolutions in simulating swash hindcast hs along the east coast of india is as shown in table 4 and fig 13 at the puducherry location the swash performance in simulating hs was the best with 1 m resolution with a correlation of 0 98 the bias ranged in the order of 0 02 to 0 27 m for the hs values the 3 m and 1 m resolution comparisons were reasonable with a slightly better estimate using 1 m as compared to 5 m analysis the ia values in this location varied from 0 63 to 0 96 revealing a better accuracy in simulating hs using 1 m resolution at the gopalpur location the performances were more or less same using 3 m and 1 m grid resolutions with correlations of 0 89 and 0 94 respectively the comparisons of gopalpur buoy observations and hindcasted swash hs for different grid resolutions is as shown in fig 14 the rmse were 0 36 0 23 and 0 17 using 5 m 3 m and 1 m grid resolutions respectively with the 5 m grid resolution the gopalpur location showed an underestimation for hs with a bias value of 0 31 m and rmse 0 36 m the 1 m grid resolutions showed a lower rmse 0 17 m and an ia 0 96 which shows that swash results are definitely promising which needs further extensive sensitivity experiments and long term validations a further sensitivity analysis using swash is not in the scope of the present study as it needs detailed experimental setups preferably in a wave tank the numerical sensitivity experiments are carried out to study the impacts of different spatial resolutions on the model results the validation of the model results against the measured data revealed the ideal model resolution which can be used for the study area to obtain an accurate nearshore wave prediction this part of the study involves lot of scope for further research the wave flume experiments would be beneficial to further explore and improve the model parameterization however it does not fall in the scope of this study as it only examines the use of this model in the nearshore regions of east coast of india both the 3 m and 1 m resolutions gave best results hence this study can be further extended to understand the effect of smaller grid resolutions however it is not included in the present study owing to the computational cost the unique technique in integrating the models wavewatch iii swan and swash to accomplish high resolution accurate prediction of waves from the deep water formation processes to complete dissipation of energy in the swash zone is thereby recommended in this study 6 summary and conclusions the simulation skill and the applicability of the state of the art wave models namely swan and swash has been investigated in this study the hindcast experiments carried out in east coast of india at four coastal locations namely puducherry krishnapatnam visakhapatnam and gopalpur for the years 2014 and 2016 attempts to confirm the capability of the above models in reproducing wave characteristics along the nearshore areas a larger computational time is required for the swash model much effort was dedicated in validating the chosen set up of the wave models and thereby to establish that combination of chosen swan swash wave models is competent in capturing the characteristics of nearshore waves with acceptable skill although it is noted that the simulations by swash model are extensive nesting of swan and swash brings out the suitability of the model swash as an efficient and accurate estimation tool the present investigation comprises the following outcomes in all the four locations considered modeled and measured hs available from the nearshore buoys were shown to be in excellent match with high correlations r 0 9 using nested swan swash this raises our determination in using the model swash for nearshore modelling as seen from the comparison of hs the overall shapes agree with each other overall the hs are noted to be high in outputs of swash as compared to swan which is one of the main features that stand out swan prediction is notably lesser from swash predictions in another way swan overestimates underestimates the values expected during different seasons in the context where our interest falls in the applications such as the design of coastal structures along the shoreline such underestimations or overestimations will not be helpful in using this model as a tool to estimate the significant wave parameters wherein the accuracy in the predicted values is significantly important swash correctly predicts the wave height variations confirms the suggestions reported in janssen 2016 in which it is directed the use of a model which is phase resolving to facilitate significant applications such as evaluation of flood risks it is noted until a particular point swan can be applied efficiently and from there on to regions further foreshore swash is used which gives best predictions it is evidently noted from this study that swash estimates hs more efficiently in foreshore regions it is also accepted that swash physics tas 2016 do not comprise wind and wave evolution computations hence it would be best in adding it is the model swan such that it will be efficient in nearshore transformations and thereby predict waves at locations offshore till the region at point of breaking further the combination of this nested model application will yield better results leading to a faster evaluation of nearshore wave characteristic s and thereby achieving improved efficiency in computation the comparison of 1d frequency spectra revealed that the simulated spectra follow the variational trend of measured spectra showing a reasonable comparison and the swash model setup was efficient in reproducing well the measured double peak spectra analysis considers average spectra at visakhapatnam and gopalpur coastal locations as compared to swan it is also observed that the nested swan swash model was efficient in capturing the peak wave heights during an extreme event such a hudhud cyclone thereby proving its capability in simulating a rough weather scenario the sensitivity of swash model with different grid resolutions proved similar performances using 3 m and 1 m grid resolutions but higher accuracy was achieved using 1 m grid resolution and hence the same can be adopted in the future model set up although the swash model is computationally expensive when compared to swan the level of detail that can be obtained from a validated swash model is difficult to achieve using numerical experiments alone however this requires the proper calibration of the coefficients in the swash model here an initial study with swash shows satisfactory results nonetheless extensive wave tank experiments have to be conducted to determine the optimal coefficients for the swash model which is not in the scope of the present study and will be taken up in future studies future investigations should include the benefits of unstructured grids zijlema 2020 over a large model domain of interest a sensitivity study of model parameter settings a comparison of the predicted and measured wave spectra for evaluating model performance assessment on performance evaluation of models along shallow and nearshore regions large wave predictions and considering a longer simulation period the non availability of field data or measurements to validate such experiments is mostly one among the major limitations in these forms of investigations hence there is a need for better datasets in the shallow foreshore regions which can bring out nearshore applications for the benefits of various coastal activities and for the coastal community it is to be noted that a distinctly dynamic region of the ocean is the surf zone and from a coastal engineering perspective it is basically demanding in numerically simulating the interactive processes in this extremely dynamic region hence more investigations are required in this context so that an accurate simulation of nearshore processes will help a coastal engineer to include appropriate assumptions w r t design variables thereby leading to a stable and better designs in a cost efficient way the wave evolution in surf zone going through deep water involving processes such as shoaling breaking and dissipation in the swash zone needs extensive analysis and its knowledge is extremely important for coastal engineering designs in a broader sense the implication of present study points out to the applicability of swash model though computationally it is demanding inspite the limitation it will help practicing engineers in achieving

20416,nearshore wave prediction is an area of research which still demands continuous developments and the accuracy of wave models in the nearshore regions is known to be limited in this work we focus on an improved coastal prediction across east coast of india and this is one step forward to achieve accurate nearshore predictions using nested wave models the study used two modelling setups swan and swan swash with boundary conditions from deep water model wavewatch iii the comparison of wave hindcasts over the east coast of india with buoy measurements at four nearshore locations represents a higher accuracy in simulating significant wave height hs with a high correlation and high index of agreement using nested swan swash in comparison to swan only further the accuracy of the models was also evaluated during an extreme event such as hudhud cyclone which showed a better match using swash than swan at the visakhapatnam coastal location the sensitivity of the swash model with different grid resolutions was also tested to arrive at the best grid resolutions for achieving accurate nearshore predictions hence a nested swan swash setup should be adopted to locally advance the wave prediction in the nearshore regions reducing the underestimation of wave estimates with swan only setup keywords swash swan wavewatch nearshore prediction cyclone hudhud nested wave model 1 introduction the knowledge of wind waves is crucial for numerous practical and scientific applications such as forecasting of the ocean waves studies dealing with climate naval architecture marine structure operations and other coastal engineering purposes numerical models are used by coastal engineers in designing of coastal structures and thereby to predict the prevailing coastal currents and waves smit et al 2013 and suzuki et al 2017 the advancement in numerical modelling of waves over the past decades caires and sterl 2005 have resulted in various hindcasts globally and regionally which in turn is extensively chawla et al 2013 used to evaluate statistics of the extreme waves guo and sheng 2015 and to analyze climatic wave variability nonetheless the efficiency of hindcast wind waves depends basically on the accuracy of wind fields dissipation parameterization physics bidlot et al 2007 involved and the numerical methods engaged in solving ardhuin et al 2012 the balance equation in terms of wave energy the main source of energy in the generation of waves is the transfer of momentum to the surface of ocean by wind hence uncertainty in the wave model predictions cavaleri 2009 results mainly from the built in errors in the forcing wind fields which in fact is one of the major reasons such that the atmospheric wind quality and its resolution spatial turns out to be the key elements which influences the modelling results various numerical models phase resolving and phase averaged have evolved in the past for varied applications with each model having its own robustness and shortcomings based cavaleri et al 2007 on the wind wave physics and parameterizations adopted in the model vyzikas and greaves 2018 it is to be noted that those models which take into account the entire range of frequencies of the nearshore waves are computationally challenging but observed to be highly efficient in terms of accuracy in the coastal regions different types of numerical models are applied to predict waves which have their own limitations the choice of an apt wave model for any application demands significant investigation and extensive analysis fringer et al 2019 hence in this context an integration of available models has been reported by many researchers in the past which produced commendable progress in wave modelling warner et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011 bhaskaran et al 2013 parvathy and bhaskaran 2019 allahdadi et al 2019 and parvathy 2019 the various physical assumptions and numerics physics is applied in many different numerical models to simulate the processes in surface waves the ocean wave models can be classified as i deterministic models phase resolving and ii stochastic spectral models phase averaged the phase resolving models are defined with respect to the elementary equations of waves with precise approximation the transformation of the surface phenomena is grid computed with resolutions refined than the corresponding wavelengths as such these models are impractical for performing hindcast simulations for large model domains and long durations 5 10 years because of the high computational requirements based on the wave energy equation the phase averaged models statistically defines the wave scenario in time and space and thereby calculates the wave energy distribution in terms of directions and frequency and its transformation at every grid point in time third generation 3g spectral models solve the spectral equation by komen et al 1994 tolman et al 2014 resolving non linear interaction and allow the simulation of sea states ranging from normal conditions to extreme storm conditions e g hurricanes popular 3g phase averaged wave models include swan booij et al 1999 wavewatch iii ww iii ww3dg 2016 wam wamdi group 1988 mike21 sw dhi 2014 tomawac benoit et al 1996 and stwave smith et al 2001 these 3g wave models is also divided into structured and unstructured grid models the first 3g wave model wam was produced by the wamdi group 1988 it solves numerically the action density equation which also includes wave wave interactions non linear as similar to swan and wwiii it is a well tested model and is applied widely by the european wave modelers wwiii solves action density equation for wave number direction spectra under various conditions wwiii uses explicit schemes to advance the solution in time and space and recently a newly implemented implicit numerical solver was introduced abdolali et al 2020 in wwiii while swan uses implicit schemes in recent times wwiii has also been used extensively in nearshore wave prediction abdolali et al 2020 moghimi et al 2020 swan booij et al 1999 amarouche et al 2019 and alizadeh et al 2020 and wwiii tolman et al 2014 lee 2015 yang et al 2017 margarita et al 2018 umesh and behera 2020 and beyramzadeh et al 2021 are well documented and are the most widely used models among all the 3g spectral wave models the fundamental difference among swan and wwiii is in terms of the numerical schemes used to solve the balance spectral equation swan is a phase averaged nearshore wave model swan team 2018 that uses implicit numerical schemes to solve action balance equation and to predict the statistics of waves within the model domain at individual grid point cells these implicit schemes allow larger time steps than models using explicit schemes which allow computationally efficient simulations of cell grid sizes less than 1 km the swan model predicts nearshore wave processes such as refraction non linear wave interactions depth induced breaking white capping and shoaling as a result of bathymetry currents in stationary mode the swan model is capable of solving the balance equation which can help in reducing computing run times the choice is most appropriate whenever the domain of the model is sufficiently small 100 km although unstructured grid models provide advantages in computational efficiency and flexibility for simulating wave climates near complex geometries they are still relatively new compared to structured grid models and are not well vetted swash non hydrostatic wave flow model was developed in the delft university zijlema et al 2011a for coastal waters to predict the surface wave transformation the model is efficient in producing currents and surface elevation over the swash and surf zones with reliable accuracy the model achieves accurate wave energy dissipation thereby accounting for breaking of waves hence swash is considered to be a functional engineering application to be used in extensive areas of prediction cases both in intermediate and shallow waters zijlema et al 2011a in a recent study by zijlema 2020 for a stable local grid improvement it is reported the extension of swash model to unstructured triangular grids numerous wave modelling studies have been reported in the past using nearshore model swan in the world oceans thereby verifying the competency of swan in coastal wave prediction gorrell et al 2011 rogers et al 2012 alomar et al 2014 aijaz et al 2016 ph van vledder et al 2016 ponce de le√≥n et al 2018 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 rusu et al 2018

the northwest european shelf seas by neill and hashemi 2013 lewis et al 2014 2017 2019 and hashemi et al 2015 model calibration studies for achieving efficient accuracy in simulation of wave height and period was also reported by various researchers such as allahdadi et al 2017 siadatmousavi et al 2011 2012 and niroomandi et al 2018 wu et al 2018 has used swan model in the nearshore regions for simulating typhoons in the south china seas in a study by xu et al 2020 sensitivity of swan model wave heights was assessed during typhoon periods over the china east coast the nested wam swan breivik et al 2009 and wwiii swan anselmi molina et al 2012 setup is reported widely for an improved nearshore wave hindcasting in a study by sandhya et al 2014 using the wwiii swan model set up at the location puducherry in the east coast of india the performances of the models were identified as best during the northeast monsoon the seasonal analysis of wave heights at four locations along the east coast of india gopalpur vishakhapatnam puducherry and tuticorin using unstructured swan model revealed highest correlations during the post monsoon season 0 78 0 96 as reported in sandhya et al 2018 the swash model was also extensively used in the past and its applicability was evaluated using numerical and physical experiments suzuki et al 2011 dusseljee et al 2014 sandra 2017 joao 2014 mardones 2011 tas 2016 van eeden 2017 tas 2016 klein et al 2017 sous et al 2019 idier et al 2020 and fiedler et al 2020 suzuki et al 2012 reported the validation of mike21 bw model and swash with measurements which shows prediction of wave heights with reasonable accuracy the study by attman and thesis 2017 had reported on the accurate prediction of variation in wave heights by swash by validation with measurements in laboratory enr√≠quez et al 2017 have applied a swan swash set up in the western mediterranean to evaluate wave processes from the deep waters to swash zone correlation of 0 9 with measurements and the study reported that the beaches would encounter a coastal retreat from 7 to 50 m alari and kouts 2012 used swan model in the baltic sea to simulate wave conditions during the cyclone gudrun january 8 9 2005 and therefore to provide boundary data as input to the swash model for calculating inundation and setup alari 2013 phung et al 2020 in a recent study has reported on the coupling of swash model with a sediment transport model and the validation results using laboratory measurements showed reasonable comparison in a study by buckley et al 2014 it reports the evaluation of the models swan swash and xbeach in a reef environment where the sea swell wave heights have been predicted with accuracy within reasonable limits guimaraes et al 2015 have demonstrated the use of combining the models wavewatch iii swan and swash as an effective tool in coastal management for evaluating floods and run up during extreme conditions in a recent study by ryu et al 2020 in the coastal region of namhangjin the swan swash model setup could reproduce the spectral shapes with respect to the measurements at the study location the study points to the fact that the swash model is streamlined enough in the replication of irregular waves and finds wide applications in coastal engineering ryu et al 2020 in the context of hydro metrological events that occurred in the french atlantic coast idier et al 2020 used the swash model to evaluate the stochastic behavior of waves on coastal flooding based on various flood regimes in another recent study by saprykina et al 2020 the swash model was applied in the kerala coast and the modelling results identified that the downshifting of frequency can be considered as a feasible technique for the mudbank formation application of the swan model with extensive validation by various researchers across the north indian ocean in the past is evident from the literatures sandhya et al 2014 parvathy et al 2017 umesh and swain 2018 umesh et al 2019 but there are hardly any studies reported on any attempt for an improvement in nearshore prediction using the nested swan swash set up in the coastal regions in an abruptly alternating bathymetry the phase averaged models application is limited as they may not completely consider the reflection and diffraction by a wave in this context we have the phase resolving model such as swash working in time domain and based on non hydrostatic equations and consider all transformation effects however the swash model involves substantial time for computation based on accurate prediction of the sea surface in space and time hence phase resolving models are not applicable for larger domains and hence we have applied nesting of models in this study the selection of this composition swan swash is mainly due to the fact that the nearshore model swan is efficient in producing spectral wave boundary conditions to be used as input for swash model alari 2013 guimaraes et al 2015 van eeden 2017 and ryu et al 2020 the study is of its first kind in the east coast of india that reports and recommends a modelling setup that can be used to improve the current prediction system in nearshore regions the study aims to demonstrate a new modelling build up and further its extended application to a region i e a specific site viz the east coast of india it highlights how well the model reproduces the wave characteristics in a nearshore location by comparison with wave measurements and also makes available a reproducible mode set up which can be utilized in future coastal wave modelling studies whilst a more rooted investigation of the processes in the nearshore regions will be addressed in future studies this study is mainly concentrated on verifying the nested swan swash set up of the model section 2 describes prevailing study area and section 3 provides a brief knowledge of the wave models used section 4 describes the data used and the methodology adopted section 5 presents the results followed by discussions a short summary and conclusions are formulated and presented at the end in section 6 2 study area bay of bengal the bay of bengal which occupies an area of 2 173 000 sq km is representative of the northeastern indian ocean which lies in the longitudes 80 90 e and latitudes 5 22 n the bay has an average depth of 2600 m and it is 1600 km wide surrounded by india and sri lanka on the western side in the north by bangladesh and in the east the malay peninsula northern region the bay holds a large number of rivers flowing namely kaveri krishna mahanadi and godavari in the west brahmaputra and ganges in the north sarma et al 2000 in the north indian ocean the head bay of bengal with a coastline i e funnel shaped is unique with its characteristics such as very high tidal range 6 7 m rose and bhaskaran 2017 and highly proned to flooding topography with low lying characteristics huge deposits of sediments mohanty et al 2008 tidal creeks mangrove ecosystems ghosh et al 2015 with diverse river systems and the existence of a vast deltaic system kuehl et al 1989 rogers and goodbred 2014 three contrasting weather conditions glejin et al 2013 prevail in the bay of bengal namely a pre monsoon fair weather february to may b south west monsoon summer monsoon june to september and north east monsoon post monsoon october to january during the north east monsoon november april in the northern part of the bay a high pressure continental system leads potemra et al 1991 to the generation of north east winds which is a unique feature of the season namely winter schott and mccreary 2001 schott et al 2009 during the south west monsoon june to september across the landmass a low pressure is created due to the intense heat and also the flow of air advancing the land from ocean which leads to the rain producing monsoons the wind and wave climate in the bay of bengal hastenrath and lamb 1979 young and holland 1996 indicates that during the rough weather season the wind and wave activity is essentially determined by the southwest monsoon prevailing in the tropical indian ocean the southwesterly winds sweeps across the southern central bay of bengal during july and august with the wind speeds reaching 9 15 m s which is considered as the southwest monsoon peak in the fair weather season calm seas are observed with swell domination in the nearshore region glejin et al 2013 along with waves generated locally in a lesser extent during july and august the mean wave heights over the central bay of bengal ranges up to 2 5 and 2 5 m swain 1997 the occurrence of cyclones dube et al 2009 dube 2012 wang et al 2020 is also noted in the bay during the months of april to may spring and in the fall time of october to november with strong winds of high magnitude and abounding downpours 3 wave models theoretical aspects in the context of wave modelling the basic physics and its different aspects have been examined in the past but a brief update is presented here 3 1 numerical approach and selection of the model the approach adopted in this study is to utilize the models wavewatch iii swan and swash to define the nearshore waves along with the characteristic surf zone the two models namely swan and swash are united to represent the wave mechanisms till the swash zone starting from the very deep waters booij et al 1999 and zijlema et al 2011b the hindcast experiments are performed using two nesting procedures to predict the waves along shore from the offshore regions the third generation model swan simulates the wave spectra by solving the spectral equation action balance and it produces a more accurate and reliable estimation of waves in larger areas which is also computationally achievable while at the same time swash is considered as a phase resolving model which is non hydrostatic driven by the shallow water non linear equations the momentum vertical equation and momentum horizontal equation i e non hydrostatic pressure taking into consideration its cost of computation the application of swash is restricted to small areas the combination of both models allows for high resolution and accurate results enr√≠quez et al 2017 with less computational cost swan version 41 20 was chosen as it is a widely used model fitting the coastal shelf seas and nearshore areas whereas wwiii was originally designed and is generally used for wave modelling on ocean scales spatial scales 500 km model domains 105 km2 swan is designed to run on coastal scales shelf seas with model domains 105 km2 the elemental concept is to utilize the hindcasts boundary conditions from wavewatch iii for accurate nesting with swan than applying it first in swash the accepted capability of the model swan in producing accurate wave spectra for swash in the shallow conditions is a main reasoning for this thus in this direction on very fine scale we accomplish an acceptable depiction of the wave phenomenon and its associated processes further we provide here a brief on the features of the models and the implementations executed for this study the focus is provided on the model swash in comparison to wavewatch iii and swan as it is not widely used 3 2 wavewatch iii model amongst the third generation deep water spectral wave models wavewatch iii is a popular model which is updated with the developments in numerical modelling and the physics of ocean waves tolman et al 2014 in this study we have used the 5 16 ww3dg 2016 version of wavewatch iii which is a phase averaged model

whitecapping respectively the sbot defined as the wave bottom interaction is the most notable process shemdin et al 1978 in shallow waters while triad wave wave interactions str and depth induced

with the observations while considering the non linear interaction the dia scheme by hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 is used 3 3 swan model the phase averaged model swan represents the transformation

study region 3 4 swash model swash simulating waves till shore is a phase resolving non hydrostatic numerical wave flow model developed by the delft university of technology this model is used in predicting wave transformation in coastal waters complex scenarios dealing with varied flows such as coastal flooding dike breaking circulation in the oceans on larger scales and flows driven by density swash team 2017 it is also efficient in simulating flows such as irrotational and transport aspects in 1 2 and 3 dimensions the layers in the fluids considered can be multi layered or averaged in terms of depth the main fact that the model swash is non hydrostatic prepares itself unique which can be applied till the shore in coastal regions zijlema et al 2011b the main equation s that governs the model are the non hydrostatic pressure term and the non linear shallow water equations defined as shown below in equations 5 8 equations 5 and 8 represent global and local equation of

assumption of hydrostatic pressure is valid at offshore depths while at the nearshore swash applies the momentum equation vertical in context of the pressure term non hydrostatic being required it is also to be noted that swash has the capability in improving its dispersion of frequency by expanding the vertical layers in number which makes the model much rapid and more powerful as compared to other models fundamentally the model is capable in capturing the flow features on scales spatially centimetres kilometres and temporally seconds hours since the model adopts the approach of phase resolving it is quite demanding in terms of computation as well as time consuming the swash version 5 01 is used in the present study swash team 2017 4 data used and methodology 4 1 model input data the study utilized ncep fnl final winds over a 0 25 0 25 grid resolution which is available operationally every 6 h the winds over the years 2014 and 2016 were extracted and used to force the wave models in the hindcast experiments the fnl winds are produced using the ncep gfs global forecast system model in the past there are many reported studies utilizing ncep fnl winds for wave modelling bhaskaran et al 2013 li feng et al 2017 chen et al 2020 which produced accurate results in wwiii bathymetry data has been derived from etopo2 national geophysical data center ngdc 2006 for the grid generation and in the nearshore simulations using swan and swash the bathymetry used is the modified etopo2 0 033 deg database as described in sindhu et al 2007 this dataset represents improved bathymetry at the shelfs in the indian ocean which is achieved from the nho naval hydrographic office charts to generate the tidal input the updated version of the global inverse tide model tpxo9 is used egbert et al 2018 and the variations in water level during the years 2014 and 2016 is utilized as inputs in the nearshore model swan it is reported in a study by shum et al 1997 that the nearshore regions are in fact very challenging in the context of tide models however the continuous advancement in models dealing with bathymetry observations and the algorithms has brought out considerable progress stammer et al 2014 in the latest available tide models especially in the near coastal regions 4 2 wave data the measured wave data from the directional wave rider buoy

depth induced breaking the numerical simulations in this study used ncep winds as the forcing input wind field the wave model has the capability in interpolating the wind fields to desired model grids with the magnitudes preferred during the deep water wavewatch run two dimensional energy density spectra wave height peak period and peak direction are extracted along the boundary of the nested grid

results and discussion the performance evaluation of swan and swash models is determined by analyzing with buoy measurements along four coastal locations puducherry krishnapatnam visakhapatnam and gopalpur in the east coast of india in this study in addition validation during an extreme weather event is also attempted qualitatively the performances of the models were evaluated with the aid of different statistical indicators namely r correlation coefficient b bias rmse root mean square error and ia index of agreement the correlation coefficient r defines the closeness among the observations o and the predictions by the model p it represents the linear correlation among the observations and model values and it varies of the order 1 to 1 in this context a very high correlation value which is positive suggests the limit to which prediction reproduces the trend in observations the mean difference among the model predictions and observations is defined as the bias and the differences in the standard deviation amongst the model predictions and observations is described as the rmse the ia is defined as a standard estimate of the extent in error of model predictions which was defined by willmott 1981 and it ranges from 0 to 1 the value 0 represents no match and the value 1 indicates a perfect agreement the ia value is 1 for a model that perfectly captures the observations while it remains 0 for ideal differences if the variance in the model error is bigger than the variance in the observations it is likely to represents a negative skill that happens only if model earnestly differs from the observations the above statistical estimates are used for the assessment of the hindcast experiments results and the different error estimates defined statistically are shown as follows 9 b i a s 1 n i 1 n p i o i 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where n is the number of data points pi defines the model estimates oi is the data from observations and 11 r i 1 n p i

model validation is a fundamental step in determining the accuracy of wave hindcasts forecasts in the east coast of india the investigation attempts to validate the estimated swan and swash hs at four costal locations the results from performances evaluation of the models during the years 2014 and 2016 using ncep fnl winds are presented in the following sections where model performance or model skill is defined as the ability of the model to simulate the parameter hs derived from measurements at the coastal locations model skill is analyzed by comparing the time series plots of hs two types of nesting s are used in this study namely wwiii swan and wwiii swan swash the wwiii model simulations were used to provide the boundary conditions at the swan nearshore grids and hence the successful implementation of the nested grid approach can be seen from the results discussed below smooth distributions of the significant wave height specifically the absence of any discontinuities across the nested grid boundaries demonstrates the successful implementation of the nested grid approach the simulation results using swan and nested swan swash models were validated in the time domain by comparison with wave measurements at four locations in the east coast of india the following results discussed below are on the simulated wave hindcasts in the innermost swan swash sd3 sd4 sd5 sd6 domains fig 2 fine grids for four locations namely puducherry krishnapatnam visakhapatnam and gopalpur the model results time series are compared at each locations with measurements of significant wave parameter such as significant wave height hs the validation results are indicated in figs 3 7 the measurements are indicated in continuous red lines the swan results in dotted blue lines and swash results in dotted green lines by and large the simulated model results were promising and acceptable nevertheless higher deviations were shown by the swan results while at the same time the nested swan swash setup mimicked the shape of the measurements thereby providing a fairly acceptable comparison with the buoy hs the comparison statistics of swan and swash hindcasts is as indicated in table 2 and fig 4 a comparison of the significant wave height time series predicted using swan swash in the present study and wave rider buoy measurements at puducherry location is shown in fig 3 for the period 06 january to december 31 2016 it is observed from fig 3 that both swan and swash is capable in capturing the trend of hs at the location off puducherry with a better prediction represented by nested swan swash at the puducherry location the swan model represented better predictions during the south west monsoon season can be attributed to the prevailing strong monsoon winds as compared to the other months of the year the swan hindcasts showed a correlation of 0 62 and rmse 0 27 m significant over predictions in higher hs ranges was noted at the location with a bias value of 0 18 m the predicted time series for hs using the nested swan swash model is in agreement with buoy measurements fig 3 and likewise provides confidence in the nested model settings while at the same time the hindcasts using swash showed a bias value of 0 08 m indicating slight underestimations and a very high correlation r 0 93 the ia estimate of 0 95 for hs showed close agreements with swash hindcasts and the buoy measurements overall the results showed closed match as well as improved accuracy using swash fig 4 however there are noticeable improvements due to the increased grid resolution in predicting the peaks in the wave height time series this improvement albeit for only the parameter of wave height provides confidence that this nested set up offers better improved accuracy in prediction fig 5 shows the comparison of hs simulated by swan swash models between 07 april to december 31 2016 at the krishnapatanam location the comparison shows moderate correlation between predictions and measurements with r 0 68 using swan the rmse is 0 26 m which denotes deviations from the measurements with an ia value of 0 76 the swan model shows underpredicton of hs during the south west monsoon as similar to the puducherry location and over prediction during the rest of the period with a bias of 0 22 m it is to be noted that at this location overprediction by both swan and swash was seen in the higher hs ranges during the fair weather seasons although both models could reproduce the trend in hs at the krishnapatanam location swash exhibits the best model skill for hs with an ia value of 0 97 the correlation is noted to be high of 0 95 with low bias value of 0 07 m indicating slight underestimations comparisons were also carried out at the location off vishakaptanam during the period 01 january to march 21 2014 as shown in fig 6 the overpredictions by swan were higher in this location with a b 0 36 m and represented a lower correlation of r 0 69 the ia value 0 65 denoted the deviation in capturing the hs at the buoy location the predictions were better represented using swash with slighter underestimations with a high correlation of 0 96 and ia 0 93 fig 4 which again provides better confidence in the nested setup at the coastal location analogous trends in comparison were noted in the period from january 01 to august 26 2014 at the gopalpur location as shown in fig 7 the comparisons revealed correlations of 0 78 and 0 89 using swan and swash models respectively the swan model showed under predictions and over estimations with bias value of 0 39 m at the same time the swash hindcasts were more promising with a lower rmse 0 23 m and ia value of 0 88 as compared to swan hindcasts fig 4 the noticeable aspect in the simulated hs during this period was that the models fairly performed better and more accurate in picking up the peaks in the nearshore location with a better prediction using swash the above results are also comparable with the results reported by sandhya et al 2018 along the east coast of india for the year 2014 using unstructured swan model in this study at the gopalpur location the wave heights less than 0 5 m are overestimated slightly and underestimations are noted for wave heights above 1 5 m the seasonal analysis showed that the rmse at visakhapatnam was 0 25 m for all seasons but it was noted to be the lowest at puducherry 0 12 m and gopalpur 0 17 m locations during pre monsoon periods further the seasonal analysis revealed correlations ranging from 0 67 to 0 96 0 66 to 0 93 and 0 64 to 0 91 for gopalpur visakhapatnam and puducherry locations respectively similarly the bias values ranged from 0 16 to 0 13 m 0 15 to 0 21 m and 0 11 to 0 05 m for gopalpur visakhapatnam and puducherry locations respectively indicating underestimations and overestimations of wave heights using the wwiii swan set up at the puducherry location for june 2007 to july 2009 sandhya et al 2014 had also reported seasonal model performances for wave heights with rmse ranging from 0 15 m to 0 24 m with the performance signified as the best during the northeast monsoon season from the above analysis it is evident that both models showed either underestimation or overestimation of peak wave heights at all four locations considered by the application of other wind products sirisha et al 2019 with high temporal and spatial resolution additionally including land and sea breeze effects can lead to more accurate predictions by the models an evaluation based on seasons however is not in the scope of the present study as it needs long term validation and this study is only a preliminary step in defining an improved nearshore model set up by and large the comparison between measured and simulated hs is observed to be reasonably consistent mainly in reproducing differences in hs at the study location with an acceptable extent of reliability in order to compare the model performances in the coastal location the taylor diagram karl taylor 2001 was also prepared as indicated in fig 8 the taylor diagram is described depending upon three skill evaluators such as root mean square deviation correlation coefficient and standard deviation by validating the simulated model results with measurements at the four coastal locations it is noted from fig 8a b that at puducherry and krishnapatnam locations the standard deviations were similar range of 0 2 0 3 with high correlations r 0 9 using the swash model as compared to swan at the visakhapatnam location fig 8c the standard deviations were lower in the range 0 1 0 2 but it was higher at gopalpur location 0 3 0 4 using swash model fig 8d as compared to swan the root mean square deviation rmsd was lesser than 0 1 in all locations using swash except gopalpur while at the same time deviations rmsd was higher than 0 2 in all locations using swan the highest correlations by swan and swash were shown at locations gopalpur r 0 76 and visakhapatnam r 0 95 respectively the lowest correlations by swan and swash were shown at locations puducherry r 0 65 and gopalpur r 0 9 respectively overall the taylor diagram gives a clear picture on the deviations in both the model performances at the four coastal locations and thereby highlights the applicability of the swash model to have a better understanding the study also attempted to compare the model simulated 1d spectra with buoy spectra of selected months for the locations visakhapatnam and gopalpur to evaluate the spectral characteristics the monthly averaged spectra during 2014 is used for the months of january and february for the visakhapatnam location and january march may and july for the gopalpur location figs 9 and 10 shows the validation of wave spectra simulated by swan and swan swash setup with the buoy spectra average at the locations visakhapatnam and gopalpur respectively the measurements are indicated as continuous red lines the swan results by blue lines and the swash results by green lines as evident from fig 9 the validation of wave spectra for the months of january and february 2014 at the visakhapatnam location produced promising results with the application of swash it is noted from fig 9 that during january and february 2014 at the coastal location the peak frequencies were reproduced efficiently with peak energies observed to be underestimated by swash and overestimated by swan the prevailing weak winds throughout the fair weather months of january and february could be a possible reason for this the simulated wave spectra were overestimated by swan and slightly underestimated by swash during january 2014 it is evident from fig 9a that in the prediction of the double peaks a better estimate in terms of energy was reproduced by swash with slighter underestimation as compared to swan the swan swash spectra comparisons showed a correlation 0 77 0 94 a bias of 0 06 0 007 and an rmse 0 07 0 01 the peak energies as simulated by swan and swash in january 2014 are 0 35 and 0 27 m2 hz as compared to buoy value of 0 30 m2 hz similar performances were seen during the month of february 2014 fig 9b with a correlation of 0 73 using swan and 0 89 using swash the swan simulation of wave spectra was overestimated at the location with a bias of 0 04 while swash showed a better match with slight underestimation b 0 015 the peak energies as simulated by swan and swash in february 2014 are 0 42 and 0 33 m2 hz as compared to buoy value of 0 37 m2 hz both the months being a fair weather season in the study area long swells are prevalent and the distinct ways in which the physics of propagation of swell is treated in the model can be a likely cause of the deviations the comparison between 1d predicted frequency spectra and measured data for the coastal gopalpur location during january march may and july 2014 is as shown in fig 10 a d as evident from the validation it shows that the peak frequencies are simulated well while peak energies are underestimated by swan and swash during january and march 2014 the swan swash spectra comparisons during january 2014 fig 10a showed a correlation 0 74 0 88 with a bias of 0 014 0 004 and an rmse 0 07 0 01 the peak energies as simulated by swan swash in january 2014 are 0 20 and 0 25 m2 hz as compared to buoy value of 0 29 m2 hz the swan swash spectra comparisons during february 2014 fig 10b showed a correlation 0 76 0 90 with a bias of 0 019 0 008 and an rmse 0 05 0 02 in march 2014 the swash swan model could capture a peak energies of 0 32 0 28 m2 hz as compared to the buoy value of 0 38 m2 hz the deviations can be attributed to the prevailing feeble winds in the fair weather season of the month of january and march during may 2014 the swash model fig 10c shows an acceptable comparison r 0 95 with a slight overestimation a bias of 0 02 having an rmse 0 03 the swan comparisons r 0 71 revealed underestimations with a bias 0 05 and rmse 0 08 the peak energies as simulated by swash 1 31 m2 hz was promising w r t buoy energies of 1 21 m2 hz while swan showed a peak energy of 0 94 m2 hz the comparison for the month of july 2014 fig 10d showed correlations of 0 78 and 0 93 using swan and swash respectively swash revealed underestimations with a bias 0 026 and swan overestimated the peak energies with a bias 0 03 the rmse were 0 04 and 0 08 using swash and swan respectively the month of july 2014 also showed a better skill in simulating the peak energies of 1 14 m2 hz by swash in comparison to buoy energies of 1 25 m2 hz while swan showed a higher estimation of 1 39 m2 hz on the whole the deviations underestimation or overestimation of peak energies in the comparison of the spectra at the study locations can be dependent on the fact that the discretization of frequency of both buoy and model are dissimilar and can lead to smoothening of the model spectra in general the overall best model performance was attained by swash model but required higher computational cost in comparison to swan results table 3 summaries the errors of mean wave height and the computational time based on the swan and swash model simulations 3 m 3 m grid resolution for all the locations considered along the east coast of india the average error is expressed in percentage and calculated as the absolute value of the quantity the mean absolute percentage error mape is the mean or average of the absolute percentage errors of predictions 13 m a p e 1 n i 1 n o i p i o i 100 where n is the number of data points pi defines the model estimates oi is the data from observations from table 3 it is notable that overall average absolute error for all the locations ranged from 7 to 16 for swash simulations at the same time the swan simulation results along all the coastal locations showed absolute errors ranging from 15 to 23 although both models have shown under estimation and over estimation of measurements at the study locations the swash model was capable in simulating wave heights with better accuracy in comparison to swan model in the context of practical applications of coastal models the computational cost involved in the model performances is significantly important table 3 also provides the computational times involved in the simulations over the period of study a 16 core cluster computation facility was used for executing the simulations as available at the research lab and the swash model required a very large computational time typically of several hours per simulation in comparison to swan simulations being very few hours but then this is quite expected as swash is a computationally expensive model and hence an increase in the number of computational cores can help in reducing the computational time in swash which was one of the limitations of this study in a recent study by gruwez et al 2020 it is reported the inter comparison of three numerical models namely openfoam dualsphysics and swash to evaluate the wave transformations effects across the foreshore and mainly the wave structure interactions though all three models were efficient in the performances the swash model proved to show the highest computational efficiency based on the computational facility overall it is noted that both the wave models swan and swash reproduces the trends in hs but with varied accuracies these deviations can be due to many reasons and can also be attributed to the model limitations the model errors can be caused by several factors including the accuracy of bathymetry and wind forcing though it is noted that a model reproduces the fundamental physics such as generation of wave and growth mechanisms dissipation effects currents induced effects and non linear interactions an accurate prediction is based ultimately on choosing the model selected source terms in the phase averaged wave models specification of model inputs wind data sources proper model calibration and validation challenges resulting from many calibration parameters use of different metrics for evaluating model performance the dependency of spatial and temporal model resolutions and the frequency and direction resolutions of wave spectra these same models generally over predict significant wave heights during normal seas which has been attributed to failure to accurately model swell dissipation effects ardhuin et al 2009 and an over bias in dallman et al 2014 wind forcing used to drive the wave models in relation to wave physics more frequent underestimates cavaleri 2009 of higher surface wind speeds low pass filtering of high wind speeds smoothing due to insufficient spatial resolution failure to capture gusts failure to capture wave shoaling effects of currents and the breakdown of wave generation whitecapping breaking and discrete interaction approximation dia models at high wind speeds those related to numerics i e numerical diffusion caused by low order numerical schemes and spatial temporal and spectral frequency and direction resolution and those related to modelling model tuning or calibration can also lead to underestimations by the models a high resolution of the spectrum in terms of direction and frequency is important to accurately model the energy advection generated by swells propagating from far away distances which is relevant in this study specifically the complexity in geometry and the shallow water bathymetry in these coastal locations will affect the waves by modifying the features of approaching waves in terms of direction and frequency nonetheless the time involved in computation increases proportionately as the resolution of the spectra is increases in terms of direction and frequency hence an evaluation of the accuracy in prediction by wave models and the equivalent cost in computations involved is utmost importance another two related parameters are the predefined directional sector within which waves travel shoreward and a frequency band with fixed low frequency and high frequency cutoffs narrowing the directional section and frequency band and maintaining the number of frequency and direction bins may increase model accuracy and computational efficiency model skills for predicting hs improve by modelling swell dissipation this supports claims by ardhuin et al 2009 which claims that proper improvements in the swell dissipation leads to reduction in the overestimation of hs swash is a time domain model while the model output quantities such as height period and direction are spectral ones so they require spectral energy densities which cannot be computed by swash the significant wave height on the other hand can also be computed by the variance in elevation of the surface this is the one that has been implemented in swash so we need to apply fourier transformation on the surface elevation to obtain spectra and subsequently we can derive from these spectra wave periods including peak wave direction etc a comparison of wave periods which is not attempted in this study but shall be taken up in a future study 5 2 hindcast experiments under an extreme weather event at any nearshore location it is of immense importance to predict the cyclone characteristics with high accuracy which is not achieved by all wave models the study also attempted to evaluate the model performances in the east coast of india under an extreme weather scenario namely cyclone hudhud the cyclone hudhud is observed to be the second most strongest system that passed the visakhapatnam coast and created expanded damage samiksha et al 2017 the cyclone in its track crossed the islands of andaman on october 8 2014 around ist 09 30 h and further it made its track west of north west and on october 10 2014 it intensified itself as a severe cyclonic storm the storm intensification imd report 2014 continued with winds speeds tending to a maximum of 180 km h and thereby crossing the coast of visakhapatnam at ist 13 00 h on october 12 fig 11 a show the track of hudhud with the corresponding wave rider buoy at the visakhapatnam location that has captured the cyclone fig 11b shows the comparison of swan and swash hindcasts at the time of cyclone hudhud as captured by the in situ measurements for the period 07 to october 14 2014 at the location very close to visakhapatnam a peak hs of 8 1 m was recorded by the buoy fig 11b while the peak hs given by the model is 5 9 m and 6 8 m using swan and swash respectively the comparison shows that swash model was capable r 0 87 in better simulating the peak hs as recorded by the buoy at the visakhapatnam location with underestimations both models were capable in reproducing the general trends at the location with underestimations of peak hs the swan model was found to be underestimated in the lower ranges of hs r 0 72 the swan model showed underestimation of hs with a bias 0 34 m and higher rmse 0 46 m the ia values were comparatively lower such as 0 75 the swash model gave a better and improved estimation of hs during the cyclone with lower bias 0 16 m showing slight underestimation and least rmse 0 19 m and very high index of agreement of the order 0 91 the swan simulated results in present study were found to be in close agreement in comparison with findings described in the study by samiksha et al 2017 where the swan model predicted peak hs value was 6 2 m during the hudhud cyclone also in another study by sirisha et al 2015 during the cyclone period the mike 21 sw model forecasted hs was 5 91 m overall limitation of most 3g wave models in accounting for swell dissipation over long distances has been cited as one of the likely dominant causes for deviations in significant wave height ardhuin et al 2009 it is noted that a high resolution of the spectrum in terms of direction and frequency is extremely important to accurately model the advection of energy from over long distance wherein from the swells evolve the complexities in the bathymetry as well as the geometry along the nearshore regions in particular can modulate the waves incoming in terms of their characteristic directions and frequencies wave dynamics along nearshore zone include more complex phenomena than offshore regions and the number of phenomena to be modeled generally increases across the surf zone towards the shoreline when the waves propagate into the shallow waters from the deep waters they attain more non linear characteristics thereby leading to the transport of energy amongst the highest and lowest frequencies from the spectrum peaks ultimately wave breaking is induced by the closeness of the sea bottom which raises the turbulence in the marine environment thereby causing various currents extending far ahead surf zones it is therefore prudent to assess the efficiency of nearshore model predictions at extreme shallower depths as well where more complex wave dynamics are occurring 5 3 sensitivity of swash model with different grid resolutions the swash model is not like swan where we have the freedom to modify the source term parameters this is because the source terms in swan are empirical whereas swash is a first principle model so there is hardly no any parameter where you can freely adapt for the purpose of sensitivity study except perhaps the bottom friction from a physical point of view the bottom friction term does not contain enough information concerning the roughness and the type of bottom topography so this implies that we may adapt the value of 0 019 manning formulation which is implemented in the present study swash team 2017 wave breaking in swash is not empirical and the breaking parameters Œ± 0 6 Œ≤ 0 3 are supposed to be universal which is used in the present study smit et al 2014 to have a study with change of values we do not have any background literatures in this bay of bengal region using swash model to choose a range of values and the physical driving mechanism for wind differs in the models wind in swash is simply a friction condition to be applied for tidal waves hence a detailed sensitivity study in swash at this point can t be attempted while we have many reported performance evaluation studies using swan bhowmick et al 2011 nayak et al 2013 prasad et al 2013 sandhya et al 2014 swain et al 2019 in the bay of bengal the possible parameters to change for a more accurate model results might be the grid and time steps it is actually not a sensitivity analysis but rather a convergence analysis hence in this section the study attempts to test the sensitivity of the swash model with respect to three different grid resolutions namely 5 m 3 m and 1 m respectively the model setup is retained as the same as shown in figs 1 and 2 except that in the innermost swash domains sd3 sd4 sd5 sd6 two more grid resolutions 5 m 5 m and 1 m 1 m is tested to compare with 3 m 3 m grid resolution which is already used as the initial set up fig 12 shows the comparison of swash hindcasts with nearshore wave observations off puducherry for three different grid resolutions the statistics of the comparison of sensitivity of different grid resolutions in simulating swash hindcast hs along the east coast of india is as shown in table 4 and fig 13 at the puducherry location the swash performance in simulating hs was the best with 1 m resolution with a correlation of 0 98 the bias ranged in the order of 0 02 to 0 27 m for the hs values the 3 m and 1 m resolution comparisons were reasonable with a slightly better estimate using 1 m as compared to 5 m analysis the ia values in this location varied from 0 63 to 0 96 revealing a better accuracy in simulating hs using 1 m resolution at the gopalpur location the performances were more or less same using 3 m and 1 m grid resolutions with correlations of 0 89 and 0 94 respectively the comparisons of gopalpur buoy observations and hindcasted swash hs for different grid resolutions is as shown in fig 14 the rmse were 0 36 0 23 and 0 17 using 5 m 3 m and 1 m grid resolutions respectively with the 5 m grid resolution the gopalpur location showed an underestimation for hs with a bias value of 0 31 m and rmse 0 36 m the 1 m grid resolutions showed a lower rmse 0 17 m and an ia 0 96 which shows that swash results are definitely promising which needs further extensive sensitivity experiments and long term validations a further sensitivity analysis using swash is not in the scope of the present study as it needs detailed experimental setups preferably in a wave tank the numerical sensitivity experiments are carried out to study the impacts of different spatial resolutions on the model results the validation of the model results against the measured data revealed the ideal model resolution which can be used for the study area to obtain an accurate nearshore wave prediction this part of the study involves lot of scope for further research the wave flume experiments would be beneficial to further explore and improve the model parameterization however it does not fall in the scope of this study as it only examines the use of this model in the nearshore regions of east coast of india both the 3 m and 1 m resolutions gave best results hence this study can be further extended to understand the effect of smaller grid resolutions however it is not included in the present study owing to the computational cost the unique technique in integrating the models wavewatch iii swan and swash to accomplish high resolution accurate prediction of waves from the deep water formation processes to complete dissipation of energy in the swash zone is thereby recommended in this study 6 summary and conclusions the simulation skill and the applicability of the state of the art wave models namely swan and swash has been investigated in this study the hindcast experiments carried out in east coast of india at four coastal locations namely puducherry krishnapatnam visakhapatnam and gopalpur for the years 2014 and 2016 attempts to confirm the capability of the above models in reproducing wave characteristics along the nearshore areas a larger computational time is required for the swash model much effort was dedicated in validating the chosen set up of the wave models and thereby to establish that combination of chosen swan swash wave models is competent in capturing the characteristics of nearshore waves with acceptable skill although it is noted that the simulations by swash model are extensive nesting of swan and swash brings out the suitability of the model swash as an efficient and accurate estimation tool the present investigation comprises the following outcomes in all the four locations considered modeled and measured hs available from the nearshore buoys were shown to be in excellent match with high correlations r 0 9 using nested swan swash this raises our determination in using the model swash for nearshore modelling as seen from the comparison of hs the overall shapes agree with each other overall the hs are noted to be high in outputs of swash as compared to swan which is one of the main features that stand out swan prediction is notably lesser from swash predictions in another way swan overestimates underestimates the values expected during different seasons in the context where our interest falls in the applications such as the design of coastal structures along the shoreline such underestimations or overestimations will not be helpful in using this model as a tool to estimate the significant wave parameters wherein the accuracy in the predicted values is significantly important swash correctly predicts the wave height variations confirms the suggestions reported in janssen 2016 in which it is directed the use of a model which is phase resolving to facilitate significant applications such as evaluation of flood risks it is noted until a particular point swan can be applied efficiently and from there on to regions further foreshore swash is used which gives best predictions it is evidently noted from this study that swash estimates hs more efficiently in foreshore regions it is also accepted that swash physics tas 2016 do not comprise wind and wave evolution computations hence it would be best in adding it is the model swan such that it will be efficient in nearshore transformations and thereby predict waves at locations offshore till the region at point of breaking further the combination of this nested model application will yield better results leading to a faster evaluation of nearshore wave characteristic s and thereby achieving improved efficiency in computation the comparison of 1d frequency spectra revealed that the simulated spectra follow the variational trend of measured spectra showing a reasonable comparison and the swash model setup was efficient in reproducing well the measured double peak spectra analysis considers average spectra at visakhapatnam and gopalpur coastal locations as compared to swan it is also observed that the nested swan swash model was efficient in capturing the peak wave heights during an extreme event such a hudhud cyclone thereby proving its capability in simulating a rough weather scenario the sensitivity of swash model with different grid resolutions proved similar performances using 3 m and 1 m grid resolutions but higher accuracy was achieved using 1 m grid resolution and hence the same can be adopted in the future model set up although the swash model is computationally expensive when compared to swan the level of detail that can be obtained from a validated swash model is difficult to achieve using numerical experiments alone however this requires the proper calibration of the coefficients in the swash model here an initial study with swash shows satisfactory results nonetheless extensive wave tank experiments have to be conducted to determine the optimal coefficients for the swash model which is not in the scope of the present study and will be taken up in future studies future investigations should include the benefits of unstructured grids zijlema 2020 over a large model domain of interest a sensitivity study of model parameter settings a comparison of the predicted and measured wave spectra for evaluating model performance assessment on performance evaluation of models along shallow and nearshore regions large wave predictions and considering a longer simulation period the non availability of field data or measurements to validate such experiments is mostly one among the major limitations in these forms of investigations hence there is a need for better datasets in the shallow foreshore regions which can bring out nearshore applications for the benefits of various coastal activities and for the coastal community it is to be noted that a distinctly dynamic region of the ocean is the surf zone and from a coastal engineering perspective it is basically demanding in numerically simulating the interactive processes in this extremely dynamic region hence more investigations are required in this context so that an accurate simulation of nearshore processes will help a coastal engineer to include appropriate assumptions w r t design variables thereby leading to a stable and better designs in a cost efficient way the wave evolution in surf zone going through deep water involving processes such as shoaling breaking and dissipation in the swash zone needs extensive analysis and its knowledge is extremely important for coastal engineering designs in a broader sense the implication of present study points out to the applicability of swash model though computationally it is demanding inspite the limitation it will help practicing engineers in achieving

20417,this paper presents a comparative study of wave induced motion responses and the added resistance of a ship four representative types of ships are adopted as test models lng carrier tanker containership and bulk carrier two experimental techniques captive and free running model tests are conducted under regular head and oblique wave conditions to create benchmark data several numerical computation methods asymptotic formula 2d strip theory 3d panel method and cfd are applied to perform the seakeeping analysis the comparison results indicate that the accuracy and reliability of each analysis technique are validated and its characteristics and limitations are investigated with respect to the physical aspects of the added resistance caused by a wave the analysis results are compared based on how steady flow induced coupling effects are considered further the sensitivities of seakeeping quantities with respect to wave steepness were examined based on the results of linear and fully nonlinear computations the overall tendency of the added resistance in accordance with the incident direction of a wave is discussed keywords added resistance captive and free running test comparative study eedi efd vs cfd 1 introduction two recent issues of the international maritime organization imo regulation state that 1 it is necessary to evaluate the operational performance of ships in an actual sea state where wind and waves exist therefore the weather factor f w which denotes the reduction in ship speed because of environmental loads is included in the energy efficiency design index eedi regulation 2 the minimum power to ensure the operational safety and maneuvering performance of ships under adverse ocean conditions should be required in both regulations there is a need for an accurate prediction of the added resistance increased by the waves to this end studies on added resistance analysis using experimental and numerical techniques have been conducted actively one of the most reliable methods for analyzing the added resistance caused by waves is the model test there are two experimental approaches to perform the model test the first approach is a captive model test wherein the ship model is restrained by a towing carriage in the horizontal plane and the added resistance is evaluated through the discrepancies between the measured resistances in still water and in waves lee et al 2017a sigmund and el moctar 2018 the second approach is a free running model test wherein the thrust of a propeller is measured and the resistance is evaluated based on self propulsion characteristics such as the thrust deduction coefficient sanada et al 2020 in a free running test rudder control should be performed to maintain the operation course of a ship and the incident direction of the wave model testing is the best approach to reproduce real phenomena however it is expensive and time consuming further uncertainties exist in experimental implementation especially in the realization of given wave conditions and the measurement of resistances park et al 2015 theoretically the added resistance is represented by the second order mean drift force in the longitudinal direction initially the far field method based on momentum conservation was applied maruo 1960 newman 1967 in this approach the added resistance is numerically computed based on the change in momentum at the far field by using the velocity potential at the body surface kochin function combining this method with slender body theories such as the strip based method salvesen 1978 and unified theory kashiwagi 1992 it is possible to analyze the added resistance very efficiently the slender body theory has limitations in evaluating the resistance induced by a short wave in which the effects of diffracted waves are dominant to overcome the limitations of the diffraction components short wave added resistance can be corrected by applying empirical and asymptotic formulae several empirical approaches were developed based on existing experimental data by introducing complementary coefficients for the effects of a ship s draught trim and forward speed kuroda et al 2008 liu and papanikolaou 2016 recently from the original asymptotic formula of faltinsen et al 1980 attempts have been made to consider various hull geometries and operation conditions yang et al 2018 developed an enhanced asymptotic approach was by adopting modifications for the effects of finite draught local steady velocity and hull geometry above the mean water level on the other hand liu and papanikolaou 2020 improved their semi empirical formula for arbitrary heading angles by reflecting the hull form effects this regression formula is based on a vast experimental database for about 130 ships of different speeds heading angles and loading conditions both formulae consider partial reflection due to a finite draught and are applicable for arbitrary wavelengths by combining the added resistance due to wave diffractions and ship motions using a specific blending function liu 2020 the 3d panel method one of the main seakeeping analysis techniques has been widely used in the prediction of added resistance in general two types of singularities are distributed to a problem domain forward speed wave green function hong et al 2016a 2016b and rankine source joncquez 2009 kim and kim 2011 recently a hybrid singularity distribution rankine source in the inner domain and transient green function in the outer domain has been applied for more efficient computations yang et al 2019 compared to the 2d methods the 3d panel method can consider the three dimensional effects along with the ship s longitudinal direction and also does not require the assumption regarding the relationship between the encounter frequency of a wave and the forward speed of a ship furthermore not only the far field method liu et al 2011 but also the middle field method i e momentum conservation for a specific control volume pan et al 2016 and the near field method i e direct pressure integration along hull surfaces soding et al 2014 can be utilized in evaluating the added resistance especially the near field method can be extended to the weakly nonlinear computation where the froude krylov and restoring forces at actual wetted surfaces are taken into account lee et al 2017b riesner and el moctar 2018 however the sensitivity to 3d numerical panels should be strictly considered because the derivatives of physical variables on hull surfaces are used in the near field method zhang and el moctar 2019 efficient computations are possible using the 3d panel method under a linear assumption however the results vary based on how the steady flow induced by the forward speed is approximated for the linearization of the boundary value problem that is the coupling effects of steady flow on unsteady solutions is an important issue that needs to be considered three representative approaches are used for approximating the steady flow uniform flow neumann kelvin linearization double body flow double body linearization and steady flow steady wave linearization several comparative studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of steady flow approximations linearization schemes on the predictions of ship motion wave distribution and added resistance bunnik 1999 kim and shin 2007 lee et al 2017c chen et al 2018a the more realistic the approximated steady flow the better is the accuracy of the seakeeping computation especially for a blunt ship with a high forward speed from earlier studies orihara and miyata 2003 guo et al 2012 sadat hosseini et al 2013 computational fluid dynamics cfd has been the most popular approach for added resistance analysis with the improvement of computing power kim et al 2017a liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 the biggest advantage of using cfd is that the nonlinearities of seakeeping quantities can be considered for example by examining the variation in the added resistance based on the bow shape above the mean water level the cfd technique can be used in hull form design for the operational efficiency in real sea states yang and kim 2017 further by analyzing the higher harmonic components of ship motion wave elevation and wave induced force the sensitivities of seakeeping quantities with respect to wave steepness can be investigated chen et al 2018b kim et al 2019a hizir et al 2019 however a large computational resource is still required and the sensitivity of the numerical grid system need to be strictly considered several comparative studies have been conducted to verify various experimental and numerical techniques for the added resistance analysis the first is a comparative study of cooperative research ships a group of companies that have interests in ship hydrodynamics bunnik et al 2010 the major numerical approaches include the 3d panel method and cfd the effects of forward speed on the prediction of added resistance were examined based on the comparisons of the results for a containership and a ferry under head wave conditions the second is a benchmark study conducted in the eu funded project the energy efficiency safe ship operation shopera shigunov et al 2018 this study was conducted to evaluate the availability and reliability of numerical methods for the time averaged wave induced force which can be used to establish maneuverability criteria for ships in adverse ocean conditions thus not only the added resistance caused by a head wave but also the drift sway force and yaw moment for various incident directions of waves are investigated for the well known kvlcc2 tanker and dtc containership a total of 16 independent institutes participated in the comparative study using various numerical techniques empirical formula strip theory 3d panel method and cfd the 3d panel method produced the most accurate and consistent results with moderate computational resources further the application of various cfd programs to the prediction of added resistance can be found by larsson et al 2013 and hino et al 2017 recently a research project investigating ship operation performance in real sea states was conducted from 2016 to 2019 with the support of the korean government this project was conducted by seven research institutes that comprised universities shipbuilding companies and classification societies the main objectives of this project are to enhance the analysis techniques for added resistance and the construction of a database for the weather factor to this end the comparative studies were performed for the four main types of commercial ships year after year lng carrier 1st year kim et al 2019b tanker 2nd year park et al 2019a containership 3rd year park et al 2019b and bulk carrier 4th year lee et al 2020 in these studies numerical computations based on programs owned by participating institutes were implemented to validate their accuracy and reliability by comparison with model test results comparative study results on wave induced added resistance are presented two types of experimental approaches i e captive and free running model tests were adopted to construct reference data for various regular wave conditions of different wavelengths amplitudes and directions subsequently several numerical techniques were used for seakeeping computations through comparisons between the results the characteristics of each analysis technique such as accuracy and reliability were investigated comparisons are conducted for the physical aspects of the added resistance 1 steady flow induced coupling effects 2 sensitivity with respect to wave steepness nonlinearities of seakeeping quantities and 3 effects of the incident direction of a wave 2 outline of comparative study 2 1 coordinate system and definitions for the analysis of wave induced ship motions and added resistance coordinate o x y z translating with a constant operation velocity u 0 u 0 0 is defined as shown in fig 1 this coordinate system corresponds to the mean position of the ship in the numerical analysis the coordinate is right handed with the x axis forward y axis portside and z axis upward for numerical computations the problem domain is decamped into the body and free surfaces s b and s f respectively the free surface is described by wave elevation Œ∂ an incident wave is defined by amplitude a frequency œâ and direction œá heading angle the ship which is assumed to be a rigid body has six degrees of freedom dof motions due to the waves translational motions Œæ t Œæ 1 Œæ 2 Œæ 3 surge sway and heave and rotational motions Œæ r Œæ 4 Œæ 5 Œæ 6 roll pitch and yaw the added resistance r a w is defined as the mean drift force induced by a wave in the longitudinal direction in the negative x direction 2 2 ship models four representative types of commercial ships were adopted in this study the principal dimensions of the ship models are summarized in table 1 the hull geometries and body plans are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively the test models were designed by korean shipbuilding companies that employ the latest concepts of ship design a 175 k twin skeg gas carrier s lngc and a single screw tanker s vlcc were designed by samsung heavy industries the containership h cntr was designed by hyundai heavy industries based on the hull shape of current large containerships finally a 66 k bulk carrier developed by daewoo shipbuilding marine engineering called k supramax is used for bow hull form optimization yu et al 2017 the test models can be classified into two groups according to the hull shape characteristics 1 slender ship group s lngc and h cntr these ships have a relatively small block coefficient and operate at a high design speed owing to the geometries of the high nose bulbous bow and overhanging transom the wetted surface varies significantly according to the wave elevation 2 the blunt ship group includes s vlcc and k supramax the hull forms have a large block coefficient and are almost wall sided the transom is submerged for the design draught the wave induced seakeeping quantities depend on the hull form characteristics 2 3 test wave conditions the present studies focused on regular wave conditions as summarized in table 2 model tests and numerical computations were conducted for various heading angles with 30 0 intervals for the blunt ship group s vlcc and k supramax to investigate the characteristics of seakeeping quantities for the different incident direction of waves the wave steepness was set differently depending on the wavelength for short waves wave height of at least a certain magnitude should be introduced to facilitate the evaluation of the added resistance through experiments or nonlinear computations for long waves the wave steepness should be small to prevent excessive ship motions and severe nonlinear phenomena such as green water therefore a large wave steepness was adopted for the short wave conditions and a relatively small steepness for the long waves for s lngc two different wave height conditions h Œª 1 40 h l 1 100 were introduced to examine the nonlinearities of wave induced motions and added resistances a total of 10 different wavelength ratios were set in the range of 0 3 2 0 for the region of Œª l 1 0 1 2 finely resolved ratios were adopted to capture the resonant motion 2 4 experiments two types of experimental approaches captive and free running model tests were performed to create the benchmark data the captive test was conducted only for the head wave conditions in the seoul national university towing tank snutt and the free running tests for various incident wave directions in the seakeeping basin of sspa sweden ab the experimental facilities and measuring systems are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively 2 4 1 captive model test the snutt is 110 0 m in length 8 0 m in width and 3 5 m depth equipped with a box girder type towing carriage that can run with a speed range of 0 0 4 5 m s the plunger type wave maker at one end was used to generate a certain regular wave whereas the wave beach was installed at the other end movable wave absorbers are utilized to damp waves disturbed by a ship more efficiently two sonar type wave gauges were set up to confirm the incident wave generation one at the forepart of the towing carriage and the other near the wave maker to verify the quality of incident waves the preliminary wave generation tests without a ship model are done through the measurements by wave probe 1 furthermore the uncertainty analysis for wave amplitude park et al 2015 is carried out by using the time history of wave elevation obtained by wave probe 2 during each test run the uncertainty level is generally within 5 for various wave conditions the ship model of a bare hull was adopted for the towing tank testing as shown in fig 6 a according to the guidelines of ittc 2014a the scale ratio is determined to prevent the tank wall effects considering the dimensions of the towing tank and test conditions such as forward speed and wavelength at the same time as meeting the criteria the test model should be as large as possible in 3 0 4 0 m to ensure the accuracy of the experimental measurement as listed in table 3 an additional bulwark is installed at the top of the bow to prevent green water because of resonant ship motions the captive test is performed only for the head wave condition with the guidance of three dofs surge heave and pitch which is directly connected to the center of gravity of a ship model the ship is fixed in the sway roll and yaw directions while the surge motion is weakly constrained by soft springs the wave induced motions were measured using high precision potentiometers surge motion sub carriage heave rod and pitch gimbal further a strain gauge type load cell was adopted between the heave rod and pitch gimbal to measure the longitudinal force acting on a ship all results were gathered using an 8 channel data acquisition device the transfer functions of seakeeping quantities are evaluated by extracting the data of a quasi steady state for the range of approximately 60 0 m the signal at least 20 periods of data is analyzed based on ittc 2014b the added resistance due to a wave is assessed by the difference between the still water resistance and the time averaged total resistance in a wave r a w r w a v e r s t i l l for the normalization of seakeeping quantities the measured wave amplitude of each test run is used 2 4 2 free running model test the seakeeping basin of sspa sweden ab is 88 0 in length 39 0 m in width and 3 0 m depth with a multi motion carriage that can move up to 3 5 m s in both the x and y directions the flap type wave makers are installed at both the longitudinal and transverse sides while the wave beaches are on opposite sides the walls at regular intervals are located at the wave beach adjacent to the wave maker to generate an incident wave more accurately three capacitance type wave probes were used one was installed at the center of the basin to calibrate wave generation before the seakeeping test the other two probes at the front of the motion carriage and at a fixed location near the wave maker were utilized to measure wave elevations during the free running test for self propulsion the ship model was equipped with a propeller and rudder as shown in fig 6 b the size of the ship model 4 75 m refer to table 3 is determined based on the following two conditions the test model should be as large as possible to accurately measure thrust for long wavelength ratios the ship model should be sufficiently small to prevent reflected waves from the side walls of the basin and the finite depth effects at the beginning of a free running test the ship model was accelerated and then released as it reached a constant forward speed the revolution speed of the propeller is determined such that the model can advance at the target speed in still water or in a wave for oblique wave conditions the ship navigates diagonally and an incident wave propagating along the longitudinal direction of the basin is generated an autopilot based on proportional derivative pd control is applied to the rudder angle for maintaining the incident wave direction during self propulsion the six dof ship motions were measured by a lightweight measuring arm the data acquisition and power supply can be performed using soft cables between the model and the carriage thrusts were measured in still water and in a wave to evaluate the added resistance then the wave induced resistance is derived from the difference between the thrusts and the thrust deduction coefficient based on the assumption that the change in the coefficient induced by a wave can be regarded as negligible r a w t w a v e t s t i l l 1 t 2 5 computational methods several research institutes participated in the present comparative studies using their own numerical techniques for seakeeping analysis the computation programs for wave induced ship motions and loads can be largely grouped into potential and cfd based methods the former is based on a linear analysis with respect to the mean body position of a ship where the wave steepness and ship motions are assumed to be infinitely small the potential methods can be again classified in accordance with the problem domain type of singularity and linearization scheme as summarized in table 4 the cfd technique which is a fully nonlinear computation can consider the nonlinearities of seakeeping quantities related to hull geometries and disturbed waves two cfd programs were used in this study as presented in table 5 the in house code of seoul national university named snu mhl cfd and the commercial software star ccm 2 5 1 snu slender in the snu slender program developed by seoul

other techniques such as experiments and cfd kim et al 2017b 2 5 4 wish wave induced ship hydrodynamics wish was developed by seoul national university for the analysis of linear and nonlinear wave induced ship motions and structural loads kim et al 2011 the steady flow caused by a forward speed is approximated by a double body flow double body linearization db the linearized bvp is solved by the 3d time domain rankine panel method based on a b spline basis function table 6 summarizes the main features of each version of wish and it can be distinguished based on how steady flow induced coupling effects are considered for version 3 x the bvp is defined with respect to an inertial coordinate the body boundary condition includes a m j term that represents the coupling effects of steady flow on unsteady solutions in version 3 1 the m j term is evaluated using only first order derivatives of the double body potential based on the stokes theorem based on the wall sided assumption nakos 1990 while the second order derivatives are computed directly by solving a dirichlet type equation for an arbitrary body chen and malenica 1998 in version 3 2 on the other hand in version 4 0 the bvp is derived with respect to a body fixed coordinate moving according to ship motions that leads to stable and accurate seakeeping computations without the m j term shao and faltinsen 2012 further wave induced added resistance was evaluated using the near field method direct pressure integration with respect to the inertial coordinate the mathematical formulation for the second order pressure contains the second order derivatives of potentials whereas that of the body fixed coordinate does not the details of the applications of the wish program to the added resistance problem can be found in kim and kim 2011 and seo et al 2013 2 5 5 nload3d the time domain nonlinear wave body interaction analysis program nload3d was developed by the american bureau of shipping for the hull strength assessment of large commercial ships this is a dynamic loading approach dla kim et al 2006 the seakeeping analysis of nload3d is based on the time domain 3d rankine panel method the boundary value problem is linearized by a db flow with a formulation similar to that of the wish program the added resistance was evaluated through the near field method considering the nonlinear wave induced loads the froude krylov and hydrostatic restoring forces are evaluated on the actual wetted hull surface weakly nonlinear approach approximate body nonlinear method 2 5 6 snu mhl cfd snu mhl cfd seoul national university marine hydrodynamics laboratory cfd is an in house code for calculating ship motion responses and added resistances caused by head waves yang et al 2015 in this program the governing equation for a flow field is the euler equation instead of the navier stokes equation which denotes that it focuses only on inertia dominant features rather than viscous flow related phenomena a cartesian grid system which is easy to generate is adopted for the level set based immersed boundary method ibm as shown in fig 7 a the evolution of the free surface is captured by the tangent of the hyperbola for the interface capture scheme thinc xiao et al 2005 finally an incident wave is generated based on the second order stokes wave potential forcing zones to damp the waves are imposed on all sides of the problem domain 2 5 7 star ccm in general applications of the star ssm for seakeeping analysis a fluid field is computed by solving the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equation and the continuity equation based on the semi implicit method for the pressure linked equations simple technique the overall grid system is divided into the background domain

hull domain body fitted meshes were adopted to impose the body boundary condition moreover the vof method was used to capture the multiphase flows near the free surface finally the euler overlay method kim et al 2012 was applied to generate and damp waves accurately and efficiently at the boundaries of the problem domain 2 6 participants information on the research institutes that submit

pitch Œæ 5 k a and added resistance r a w 1 2 œÅ g a 2 b 2 l and n indicates the number of computation results in a specific group through the standard deviation it is possible to evaluate the extent to which each computation result is scattered with respect to a certain mean value 3 1 head wave conditions 3 1 1 s lngc for the twin skeg gas carrier the captive model tests were performed for the two different wave height conditions as shown in fig 8 h l 1 100 and h Œª 1 40 experimental data for the small wave height h l 1 100 can act as a reference value for the results of the linear potential methods the nonlinear computation results can be directly compared with experimental data for large wave steepness h Œª 1 40 1 motion responses for potential methods the heave motions of some results 3dpm1 and 3dpm4 are overestimated at the resonant region in the wavelength range of Œª l 1 0 1 2 this tendency is a typical characteristic of nk linearization based computation caused by invalid hydrodynamic coefficients such as added mass and damping coefficient kim and shin 2007 in other words steady flow approximation based on a uniform flow has a limitation in predicting the resonant heave response for the pitch motion all potential methods provide considerably accurate results compared to the experimental data the model test results for the two wave height conditions confirmed that the motion responses are not significantly affected by the wave height only for the resonant region the non dimensionalized heave motion is reduced slightly as the wave height increases overall cfd based computations can capture this nonlinear trend of ship motion 2 added resistance compared to motion responses added resistances obtained by the potential methods show relatively larger deviations with respect to the mean value computation results vary significantly according to how the effects of steady flow are approximated all of the potential methods produce underestimated values except 3dpm3 1 in particular the nk linearization based computation 3dpm1 significantly under predicts the added resistance despite the overestimated heave motions which is a counterintuitive result this is because the simple uniform flow approximation cannot strictly consider the steady flow induced coupling effects on unsteady hydrodynamic pressure on the other hand 3dpm3 1 stably reflects the effects of steady flow through the double body linearization with respect to a body fixed coordinate which leads to an accurate prediction the computed added resistances are similar to the model test results for the small wave height h l 1 100 especially at the resonant region which is consistent with the theoretical basis of the linear analysis studies on the steady flow approximation in wave drift force analysis can be found in lee et al 2017c and lee and kim 2020 it should be noted that the ship motions the global and integrated quantity are not enough for the assessment of numerical method regarding the added resistance analysis the added resistance is the second order quantity and significantly sensitive to the local geometries and flows near the bow and stern regions therefore the validation for primitive and local physical quantity such as the pressure distribution on hull surfaces should be validated in order to strictly investigate the reliability and accuracy of each numerical technique waskito et al 2020 according to the model test results strong sensitivities of the added resistance to the wave height can be confirmed compared to the case of motion response as the wave height increases the added resistance at the resonant region is reduced significantly while the results for short and long waves vary slightly further it can be inferred that this sensitivity is attributed to nonlinear wave radiation rather than nonlinear ship motions or wave diffractions cfd computation results show good agreement with the experimental data for h Œª 1 40 by capturing the nonlinearities of the added resistance fig 9 shows the standard deviations for seakeeping quantities the results of the potential method are more scattered for both the motion responses and the added resistance compared to those of the cfd based computations for the resonant region where the coupling effects of the steady flow on ship motions intensify relatively large standard deviations for heave and pitch motions are confirmed for added resistances obtained by potential methods statistical values are derived considering only the linear analysis results except for 3dpm4 weakly nonlinear method wn the overall tendency of the standard deviations in accordance with wavelength follows the magnitude of the non dimensionalized added resistance further variances are more prominent for short waves Œª l 0 5 compared to long waves Œª l 1 5 because of the underestimated predictions of potential methods the cfd computation methods provide converged results of relatively small standard deviations especially for the added resistance this denotes reliable and consistent predictions despite different programs and grid systems 3 1 2 s vlcc as shown in fig 10 for the s vlcc the two different wave steepness conditions are adopted depending on the wavelength h Œª 1 50 for Œª l 1 0 and h Œª 1 100 for Œª l 1 0 both captive and free running model tests were conducted for the wave conditions nonlinear computations such as the wn method and cfd were also carried out for the given wave steepness the results were compared with those of linear analyses under the assumption that the wave slopes were in the range of the linear domain h Œª 1 1 motion responses the two experimental data for motion responses show some discrepancies especially for long waves the results of free running tests are somewhat over measured considering the physical basis that non dimensionalized pitch motion by k a converges to 1 0 as the wavelength increases surf riding along wave elevation for long wave conditions the reflected waves from the side walls of the basin seem to affect incident wave generation among the potential methods the overestimated heave resonant motions for Œª l 1 2 1 4 are given by 3dpm2 based on nk linearization and 3dpm4 the results of 3dpm3 2 and 3dmpm3 3 obtained by the same program were almost identical despite the different users moreover 3dpm3 1 produces motion responses that are most similar to those of captive model testing for cfd based analyses some computations are conducted for different wave height conditions cfd2 2 for h Œª 1 40 and cfd2 3 for h l 1 75 therefore a direct comparison of these results is unavailable considering the overall trends all computation results based on the same cfd program are relatively consistent with the experimental data although there are some differences that are attributed to different wave heights and computational settings 2 added resistance the predictions of the potential based methods show significant deviations and the computed added resistances are somewhat underestimated compared to the experimental data this trend is intensified for short and resonant waves rather than for long waves underestimation by the nk linearization based 3dpm2 is prominent in general a uniform flow based steady flow approximation is appropriate for a slender body therefore for the blunt body s vlcc the steady flow induced coupling effects on the added resistance cannot be considered strictly by nk linearization furthermore unlike motion responses the added resistances of 3dpm3 2 and 3dmpm3 3 were remarkably different even though they were obtained by the same program this is because the grid systems in the two computations are significantly different table 8 which indicates that the evaluation of added resistance has a high sensitivity to numerical panels despite the different wave height conditions all cfd results were relatively consistent in general smaller added resistances are computed for a larger wave height because of the intensified nonlinearities 3 1 3 h cntr like for s vlcc two types of experiments and numerical computations were performed for the two wave steepness conditions depending on the wavelength the results were compared the wetted surface of the h cntr containership varies significantly according to the wave elevation caused by the geometries of the large flare angles and overhanging transom further among the ship models h cntr operates at the fastest design speed therefore seakeeping analysis on h cntr can be regarded as the most challenging case in the present study because of the strong nonlinearities of the hull form and intensified effects of steady flow due to the high forward speed 1 motion responses as shown in fig 11 all potential methods provide overestimated heave motions especially at the resonant region Œª l 1 0 1 2 this tendency intensifies in the results of 3dpm2 and 3dpm4 because of the strong nonlinearities of heave motion in accordance with ship geometry there seem to be difficulties in predicting the resonant response based on a linear potential analysis for pitch motion the results of 3dpm3 3 wish version 3 1 were significantly over predicted for long waves compared to 3dpm3 1 and 3dpm3 2 other versions of the wish program this discrepancy is attributed to the inaccurate coupling effects of steady flow as shown in table 6 in version 3 1 the m j term is evaluated through the stokes theorem based on the assumption that the hull form is wall sided at the mean water level this assumption is not valid for h cntr because of its overhanging transom when the m j term is computed in the other way direct computation by solving the dirichlet type equation version 3 2 or when the bvp is defined with respect to the body fixed coordinate without the m j term version 4 1 the long wave pitch motion can be obtained accurately compared with the model test results for 2dst the only 2d method in this comparative study there are some discrepancies in predicting the heave motion whereas the pitch motion seems to be reasonable compared to the experimental data the discrepancies in the heave response may be caused by limitations of the 2d method in considering steady flow effects induced by a high forward speed the cfd computations that can capture the forward speed and nonlinear effects without any assumptions produce accurate motion responses 2 added resistance overall trends of the two model test results for added resistance are similar however some discrepancies between the two experimental data are confirmed for short wave and resonant regions in particular for a resonant wave the discrepancies are intensified because of the uncertainties regarding the incident wave generation and resulting resonant ship motions furthermore because of the relatively high forward speed the added resistances of the 3d panel methods are more scattered according to how the effects of steady flow are considered in each method the variance intensifies for short wave and resonant regions the underestimated added resistances in the short wave region indicate that there are limitations in predicting the diffraction component of the added resistance by the potential methods for the resonant region the added resistance is significantly overestimated by 3dpm3 2 wish version 3 2 this discrepancy is attributed to the unstable numerical evaluation of the second order derivatives of potentials in direct pressure integration with respect to the inertial coordinate for 3dpm3 1 wish version 4 1 the overestimation mitigates because the near field method derived with respect to the body fixed coordinate does not contain second order derivatives as described in table 6 the somewhat larger peak value of 3dpm3 1 compared to the experimental data can be considered reasonable since the results of the linear analysis based on the assumption that the wave slope is infinitely small can be larger than those of the model test for a finite wave steepness other potential methods somewhat underestimated the added resistances in the resonant region despite the excessive heave responses for 2dst when considering a short wave Œª l 0 5 the added resistance corrected by the asymptotic formula for wave reflection is in good agreement with the experimental data for the cfd computations cfd2 3 is performed for a different wave height condition h l 1 75 hence direct comparison with other results is impossible all predictions for added resistance based on cfd show good correspondence despite different wave height conditions and program computational settings similar results of the two different cfd techniques snu mhl cfd based on the euler equation and star ccm based on the navier stokes equation indicate that the effects of fluid viscosity on the added resistance analysis are negligible 3 1 4 k supramax for the last model k supramax a comparative study on wave induced ship motions and added resistance was conducted based on captive and free running model tests and numerical computations as shown in fig 12 the test wave conditions for wavelengths and wave heights were the same as those for the s vlcc 1 motion responses the 3d panel methods produce accurate motion responses in comparison with model test results except for the overestimated resonant heave motions Œª l 1 2 1 4 obtained by 3dpm4 three different versions of the wish program 3dpm3 1 3dpm3 2 and 3dpm3 3 yield similar results regardless of how the coupling effects of steady flow were considered through the comparison it is confirmed that the m j term can be evaluated in any way for the bulk carrier for which the hull shape is almost wall sided further the solutions of the two types of bvp defined with respect to different coordinate systems inertial and body fixed coordinates are equivalent motion response prediction results obtained using 2dst have a similar trend to that of the other blunt ship model s vlcc the heave motions show good correspondence with the experimental data for the entire range of wavelengths whereas the pitch motions are underestimated especially for long waves all computational results based on cfd converge within a certain range which is similar to the model test results 2 added resistance overall the added resistances obtained by the free running model test are slightly underestimated compared to those of the captive model test and the differences between the two results intensify for short waves according to the uncertainty analysis for added resistance experiment park et al 2015 for a short wave the major sources of uncertainty are related to the calibration and measurement of resistance the measured resistance and thrust in the captive and free running model tests respectively are remarkably small for a given wave steepness which may lead to significant uncertainties in the evaluation of added resistance in contrast to the case of a slender ship h cntr all potential methods provide accurate added resistance in the short wave region this indicates that the under prediction for short wave added resistance mitigates the blunt ship model in the resonant and long wave regions the added resistances are underestimated significantly by 3dpm3 2 and 3dpm3 3 because of the unstably evaluated second order derivatives of potentials in the near field method when the body fixed coordinate based direct pressure integration was applied 3dpm3 1 the computed added resistances showed good agreement with the model test results as with the case of s vlcc the added resistance obtained by 2dst is considerably similar to the experimental data although the peak value occurs at a slightly longer wave in general the typical 2d strip method is appropriate for a slender body because of its limitation in considering the effects of 3d hull form and forward speed for the blunt ship model with a large block coefficient the prediction of motion and added resistance can be improved through advanced modeling for example the enhanced unified theory eut based on matching between the inner and outer solutions and considerations for x component of normal vector of hull surfaces and ship s surge motion however the slender body theories still have difficulties in considering the wave diffraction especially near the bow when the forward speed of a ship exists therefore an additional correction should be adopted analytically or empirically a related discussion can be found in kashiwagi et al 2009 and park et al 2019a 2dst in the present study also yields high accuracy added resistance for entire wavelength region including short waves through the correction based on the asymptotic formula for the cfd analysis even though all computations were conducted using the same program star ccm some discrepancies between the results are confirmed the deviation is much greater than in the case of motion responses these user dependencies of cfd program related to numerical grids and parameters can also be found in the comparative study of shigunov et al 2018 among the computational settings the grid system was found to be the most important factor that causes variance comparing the results of cfd2 3 and cfd2 6 with a large number of meshes cfd2 3 yields the most consistent added resistance with the model test results while cfd2 6 produces the overestimated prediction as shown in table 10 not only the total number of meshes but the number of meshes per length and height of an incident wave are also different in each computation in other words the computation of added resistance is remarkably sensitive to the local characteristics of a grid system the correlation between the adopted numerical meshes and the computation accuracy should be investigated in the future fig 13 shows the standard deviations of the computation results for two types of ship models a slender ship with a relatively high forward speed h cntr and a blunt ship with a relatively low forward speed k supramax for h cntr the standard deviations for motion responses have the maximum values at wavelengths longer than the resonant region in particular the longer the wavelength the greater is the sd value of the pitch motion these remarkable variances are attributed to differences in how steady flow effects and nonlinearities are considered in each computation method for k supramax the maximum motion response values are located in the resonant region Œª l 1 2 1 4 furthermore according to accurate predictions based on both the potential and cfd based computations the overall s d values are less than those of the slender ship for the s d of the added resistance values for both ship models the maximum values are given at the resonant wave region where significant ship motions and added resistance occur further the variance of predictions for short wave added resistances are also prominent because of the difficulties in analyzing diffracted waves with very short wavelengths 3 2 oblique wave conditions for the oblique wave conditions only the free running model tests for the blunt ship models s vlcc and k supramax were conducted in the rectangular basin whereas only the potential methods were utilized as numerical analysis techniques the wavelength and wave steepness were set to be the same as those for the head wave conditions 3 2 1 s vlcc 1 motion responses in oblique waves six dof ship motions are induced by a wave and among them the heave roll and pitch motions are directly related to the added resistance fig 14 shows the motion responses of the tanker s vlcc for different heading angles the resonant frequency or wavelength is shifted to a shorter wavelength region as the heading angle decreases from a head wave to the following wave œá 180 0 0 0 deg because of the reduced encounter wave frequency œâ e œâ k u cos œá for both results of the free running model tests and numerical computations especially 3dpm3 1 it can be confirmed that the change in resonant frequency and the resulting ship motions in accordance with the direction of an incident wave are consistent furthermore the results show similar tendencies to those of the existing seakeeping analysis for oblique wave conditions takahashi 1988 for heave and pitch motions similar tendencies were identified as those for the head wave conditions the predictions obtained by numerical methods are in good agreement with the experimental data except for 3dpm2 which overestimates the peak resonant heave motion for each heading angle because of the simple approximation for a steady flow nk linearization in the case of roll response the peak value is located at a longer wave region because the resonant frequency for roll motion is lower than that for heave and pitch motions however potential based numerical analyses have limitations in strictly evaluating the magnitude of resonant roll motion the resonant response varies according to how a viscous roll moment is modeled in each numerical method linear or quadratic damping coefficient for 2dst and 3dpm3 1 the 3 of critical damping is used for an equivalent linear coefficient which is determined based on a free roll decay test on the other hand for 3dpm2 the viscous roll damping moment estimated by its own procedure is applied it can be confirmed that the overall trends with respect to the heading angle are consistent in all computation results despite the different modelings 2 added resistance overall trends of the experimental and computational results show good agreements for all heading angles the peak value of added resistance is located according to the resonant frequencies for the heave and pith responses as shown in fig 15 for a more quantitative comparison the transfer functions for each heading angle are compared in fig 16 from the bow quartering and beam waves œá 150 0 90 0 deg the distribution of the added resistance values was well predicted by the cross check validation especially between the experiment and 3dpm3 1 however for the blunt ship model s vlcc 3dpm2 based on the nk linearization underestimated the magnitude of the added resistance compared to the model test results in the range from the stern quartering and following waves œá 60 0 0 0 deg uncertainties of the measurement in the free running model test intensify due to the significant wave induced drifting in horizontal directions surge sway and yaw which makes it difficult to control the route and heading angle of a ship moreover because of the low encounter frequency of data it is difficult to obtain data in the quasi steady state with a certain amplitude effects of uncertainties are more significant for the added resistance the very small second order quantity than for the motion responses furthermore there are also difficulties in numerical computations for the heading angles for example the strip method is based on the high frequency assumption regarding the relationship between the encounter frequency of a wave and the forward speed of a ship to derive the 2d bvp therefore the reliability of computation results of 2dst in the low frequency region may be questioned in particular the overestimated added resistance is confirmed for the œÑ œâ e u g 0 25 condition where the numerical solution is unstable 3 2 2 k supramax 1 motion responses for the bulk carrier k supramax the overall tendencies of ship motions are considerably similar to those of s vlcc as shown in fig 17 the results of all potential methods showed good agreement with the free running model test results 3dpm3 1 and 3dpm3 3 different versions of the wish program produced consistent results for all motion responses this indicates that for the blunt ship model and the db linearization based 3d panel method can predict accurately regardless of the evaluation method for steady flow induced coupling effects m j term for the roll response larger resonant motions occur compared to those of s vlcc because of the relatively lower vertical center of gravity larger gm value for 2dst and 3dpm3 1 2 7 of critical damping is used to model the viscous damping moment this led to a similar magnitude of resonant response to the experimental data 2 added resistance all potential methods provide a consistent distribution of added resistance values compared to the free running model test results as shown in fig 18 3dmp3 1 slightly overestimates the peak value of the added resistance for each heading angle because the nonlinearities of the added resistance reflected in the experiment are not considered in the linear computation the results of 3dpm3 3 are underestimated because the second order derivatives of potentials in the near field method are evaluated numerically unstable as in the head wave condition in the model test results for a beam wave œá 90 0 deg the peak value of the added resistance occurs Œª l 1 0 even though the resonant regions for the heave and pitch motions are located in a shorter wave region because a significant roll response is confirmed for the wave of Œª l 1 0 it can be inferred that the maximum resistance is caused by the resonant roll motion a very large roll motion can have a direct effect on the magnitude of the oblique wave induced resistance this phenomenon based on the relationship between resonant roll motion and added resistance was reproduced only through 3dpm3 1 4 summary and conclusions in this comparative study the wave induced ship motions and added resistance obtained by various analysis techniques are compared to validate their reliabilities and limitations by comparing the results for the four representative types of ships the following conclusions are drawn the overall trends of the two experimental data captive and free running model tests are similar however some discrepancies between the two results are confirmed especially for short wave and resonant regions due to the uncertainties regarding the measurements of resistance and thrust and the incident wave generation respectively further for oblique wave conditions the reliability of the free running measurement decreases because of the uncertainties regarding the low encounter wave frequency of data and the wave induced drifting of a ship the 2d strip method provides some discrepancies with model test results especially for a blunt ship and for a high forward speed because of its limitation considering the effects of forward speed and 3d hull form when the short wave added resistance is corrected by the asymptotic formula the overall trend of the computed added resistance in good agreement with the experimental data the accuracy of the 3d panel method depends on the consideration of the effects of steady flow induced by the forward speed the simple uniform flow approximation nk linearization overestimates the resonant heave response and underestimates the added resistance for a blunt ship furthermore even for the double body linearization the reliability of the computation results varies according to the evaluation method for the second order derivatives of potential this leads to the under prediction of the added resistance of various 3d panel methods the body fixed coordinate based formulation allows for stable and accurate numerical computations the added resistance showed some sensitivity to wave steepness whereas motion responses varied slightly as the wave height increased this sensitivity intensified for the resonant region because of nonlinear wave radiation the cfd technique a fully nonlinear computation can capture the nonlinearities of the added resistance despite its user dependency regarding the numerical grid system for oblique wave conditions the overall tendencies of the seakeeping quantities are considerably similar to those for the head waves which are determined according to the resonant frequencies of the motion responses for each heading angle not only the heave and pitch motions but also the resonant roll motion can also affect the magnitude of the added resistance the trend of the analysis results on added resistance varies according to the ship type potential methods yield relatively accurate results for a blunt ship with low speed however they show some limitations in the strict prediction for a slender body with a high speed an appropriate choice of the analysis technique suitable for specific hull form and forward speed conditions is required

20417,this paper presents a comparative study of wave induced motion responses and the added resistance of a ship four representative types of ships are adopted as test models lng carrier tanker containership and bulk carrier two experimental techniques captive and free running model tests are conducted under regular head and oblique wave conditions to create benchmark data several numerical computation methods asymptotic formula 2d strip theory 3d panel method and cfd are applied to perform the seakeeping analysis the comparison results indicate that the accuracy and reliability of each analysis technique are validated and its characteristics and limitations are investigated with respect to the physical aspects of the added resistance caused by a wave the analysis results are compared based on how steady flow induced coupling effects are considered further the sensitivities of seakeeping quantities with respect to wave steepness were examined based on the results of linear and fully nonlinear computations the overall tendency of the added resistance in accordance with the incident direction of a wave is discussed keywords added resistance captive and free running test comparative study eedi efd vs cfd 1 introduction two recent issues of the international maritime organization imo regulation state that 1 it is necessary to evaluate the operational performance of ships in an actual sea state where wind and waves exist therefore the weather factor f w which denotes the reduction in ship speed because of environmental loads is included in the energy efficiency design index eedi regulation 2 the minimum power to ensure the operational safety and maneuvering performance of ships under adverse ocean conditions should be required in both regulations there is a need for an accurate prediction of the added resistance increased by the waves to this end studies on added resistance analysis using experimental and numerical techniques have been conducted actively one of the most reliable methods for analyzing the added resistance caused by waves is the model test there are two experimental approaches to perform the model test the first approach is a captive model test wherein the ship model is restrained by a towing carriage in the horizontal plane and the added resistance is evaluated through the discrepancies between the measured resistances in still water and in waves lee et al 2017a sigmund and el moctar 2018 the second approach is a free running model test wherein the thrust of a propeller is measured and the resistance is evaluated based on self propulsion characteristics such as the thrust deduction coefficient sanada et al 2020 in a free running test rudder control should be performed to maintain the operation course of a ship and the incident direction of the wave model testing is the best approach to reproduce real phenomena however it is expensive and time consuming further uncertainties exist in experimental implementation especially in the realization of given wave conditions and the measurement of resistances park et al 2015 theoretically the added resistance is represented by the second order mean drift force in the longitudinal direction initially the far field method based on momentum conservation was applied maruo 1960 newman 1967 in this approach the added resistance is numerically computed based on the change in momentum at the far field by using the velocity potential at the body surface kochin function combining this method with slender body theories such as the strip based method salvesen 1978 and unified theory kashiwagi 1992 it is possible to analyze the added resistance very efficiently the slender body theory has limitations in evaluating the resistance induced by a short wave in which the effects of diffracted waves are dominant to overcome the limitations of the diffraction components short wave added resistance can be corrected by applying empirical and asymptotic formulae several empirical approaches were developed based on existing experimental data by introducing complementary coefficients for the effects of a ship s draught trim and forward speed kuroda et al 2008 liu and papanikolaou 2016 recently from the original asymptotic formula of faltinsen et al 1980 attempts have been made to consider various hull geometries and operation conditions yang et al 2018 developed an enhanced asymptotic approach was by adopting modifications for the effects of finite draught local steady velocity and hull geometry above the mean water level on the other hand liu and papanikolaou 2020 improved their semi empirical formula for arbitrary heading angles by reflecting the hull form effects this regression formula is based on a vast experimental database for about 130 ships of different speeds heading angles and loading conditions both formulae consider partial reflection due to a finite draught and are applicable for arbitrary wavelengths by combining the added resistance due to wave diffractions and ship motions using a specific blending function liu 2020 the 3d panel method one of the main seakeeping analysis techniques has been widely used in the prediction of added resistance in general two types of singularities are distributed to a problem domain forward speed wave green function hong et al 2016a 2016b and rankine source joncquez 2009 kim and kim 2011 recently a hybrid singularity distribution rankine source in the inner domain and transient green function in the outer domain has been applied for more efficient computations yang et al 2019 compared to the 2d methods the 3d panel method can consider the three dimensional effects along with the ship s longitudinal direction and also does not require the assumption regarding the relationship between the encounter frequency of a wave and the forward speed of a ship furthermore not only the far field method liu et al 2011 but also the middle field method i e momentum conservation for a specific control volume pan et al 2016 and the near field method i e direct pressure integration along hull surfaces soding et al 2014 can be utilized in evaluating the added resistance especially the near field method can be extended to the weakly nonlinear computation where the froude krylov and restoring forces at actual wetted surfaces are taken into account lee et al 2017b riesner and el moctar 2018 however the sensitivity to 3d numerical panels should be strictly considered because the derivatives of physical variables on hull surfaces are used in the near field method zhang and el moctar 2019 efficient computations are possible using the 3d panel method under a linear assumption however the results vary based on how the steady flow induced by the forward speed is approximated for the linearization of the boundary value problem that is the coupling effects of steady flow on unsteady solutions is an important issue that needs to be considered three representative approaches are used for approximating the steady flow uniform flow neumann kelvin linearization double body flow double body linearization and steady flow steady wave linearization several comparative studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of steady flow approximations linearization schemes on the predictions of ship motion wave distribution and added resistance bunnik 1999 kim and shin 2007 lee et al 2017c chen et al 2018a the more realistic the approximated steady flow the better is the accuracy of the seakeeping computation especially for a blunt ship with a high forward speed from earlier studies orihara and miyata 2003 guo et al 2012 sadat hosseini et al 2013 computational fluid dynamics cfd has been the most popular approach for added resistance analysis with the improvement of computing power kim et al 2017a liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 the biggest advantage of using cfd is that the nonlinearities of seakeeping quantities can be considered for example by examining the variation in the added resistance based on the bow shape above the mean water level the cfd technique can be used in hull form design for the operational efficiency in real sea states yang and kim 2017 further by analyzing the higher harmonic components of ship motion wave elevation and wave induced force the sensitivities of seakeeping quantities with respect to wave steepness can be investigated chen et al 2018b kim et al 2019a hizir et al 2019 however a large computational resource is still required and the sensitivity of the numerical grid system need to be strictly considered several comparative studies have been conducted to verify various experimental and numerical techniques for the added resistance analysis the first is a comparative study of cooperative research ships a group of companies that have interests in ship hydrodynamics bunnik et al 2010 the major numerical approaches include the 3d panel method and cfd the effects of forward speed on the prediction of added resistance were examined based on the comparisons of the results for a containership and a ferry under head wave conditions the second is a benchmark study conducted in the eu funded project the energy efficiency safe ship operation shopera shigunov et al 2018 this study was conducted to evaluate the availability and reliability of numerical methods for the time averaged wave induced force which can be used to establish maneuverability criteria for ships in adverse ocean conditions thus not only the added resistance caused by a head wave but also the drift sway force and yaw moment for various incident directions of waves are investigated for the well known kvlcc2 tanker and dtc containership a total of 16 independent institutes participated in the comparative study using various numerical techniques empirical formula strip theory 3d panel method and cfd the 3d panel method produced the most accurate and consistent results with moderate computational resources further the application of various cfd programs to the prediction of added resistance can be found by larsson et al 2013 and hino et al 2017 recently a research project investigating ship operation performance in real sea states was conducted from 2016 to 2019 with the support of the korean government this project was conducted by seven research institutes that comprised universities shipbuilding companies and classification societies the main objectives of this project are to enhance the analysis techniques for added resistance and the construction of a database for the weather factor to this end the comparative studies were performed for the four main types of commercial ships year after year lng carrier 1st year kim et al 2019b tanker 2nd year park et al 2019a containership 3rd year park et al 2019b and bulk carrier 4th year lee et al 2020 in these studies numerical computations based on programs owned by participating institutes were implemented to validate their accuracy and reliability by comparison with model test results comparative study results on wave induced added resistance are presented two types of experimental approaches i e captive and free running model tests were adopted to construct reference data for various regular wave conditions of different wavelengths amplitudes and directions subsequently several numerical techniques were used for seakeeping computations through comparisons between the results the characteristics of each analysis technique such as accuracy and reliability were investigated comparisons are conducted for the physical aspects of the added resistance 1 steady flow induced coupling effects 2 sensitivity with respect to wave steepness nonlinearities of seakeeping quantities and 3 effects of the incident direction of a wave 2 outline of comparative study 2 1 coordinate system and definitions for the analysis of wave induced ship motions and added resistance coordinate o x y z translating with a constant operation velocity u 0 u 0 0 is defined as shown in fig 1 this coordinate system corresponds to the mean position of the ship in the numerical analysis the coordinate is right handed with the x axis forward y axis portside and z axis upward for numerical computations the problem domain is decamped into the body and free surfaces s b and s f respectively the free surface is described by wave elevation Œ∂ an incident wave is defined by amplitude a frequency œâ and direction œá heading angle the ship which is assumed to be a rigid body has six degrees of freedom dof motions due to the waves translational motions Œæ t Œæ 1 Œæ 2 Œæ 3 surge sway and heave and rotational motions Œæ r Œæ 4 Œæ 5 Œæ 6 roll pitch and yaw the added resistance r a w is defined as the mean drift force induced by a wave in the longitudinal direction in the negative x direction 2 2 ship models four representative types of commercial ships were adopted in this study the principal dimensions of the ship models are summarized in table 1 the hull geometries and body plans are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively the test models were designed by korean shipbuilding companies that employ the latest concepts of ship design a 175 k twin skeg gas carrier s lngc and a single screw tanker s vlcc were designed by samsung heavy industries the containership h cntr was designed by hyundai heavy industries based on the hull shape of current large containerships finally a 66 k bulk carrier developed by daewoo shipbuilding marine engineering called k supramax is used for bow hull form optimization yu et al 2017 the test models can be classified into two groups according to the hull shape characteristics 1 slender ship group s lngc and h cntr these ships have a relatively small block coefficient and operate at a high design speed owing to the geometries of the high nose bulbous bow and overhanging transom the wetted surface varies significantly according to the wave elevation 2 the blunt ship group includes s vlcc and k supramax the hull forms have a large block coefficient and are almost wall sided the transom is submerged for the design draught the wave induced seakeeping quantities depend on the hull form characteristics 2 3 test wave conditions the present studies focused on regular wave conditions as summarized in table 2 model tests and numerical computations were conducted for various heading angles with 30 0 intervals for the blunt ship group s vlcc and k supramax to investigate the characteristics of seakeeping quantities for the different incident direction of waves the wave steepness was set differently depending on the wavelength for short waves wave height of at least a certain magnitude should be introduced to facilitate the evaluation of the added resistance through experiments or nonlinear computations for long waves the wave steepness should be small to prevent excessive ship motions and severe nonlinear phenomena such as green water therefore a large wave steepness was adopted for the short wave conditions and a relatively small steepness for the long waves for s lngc two different wave height conditions h Œª 1 40 h l 1 100 were introduced to examine the nonlinearities of wave induced motions and added resistances a total of 10 different wavelength ratios were set in the range of 0 3 2 0 for the region of Œª l 1 0 1 2 finely resolved ratios were adopted to capture the resonant motion 2 4 experiments two types of experimental approaches captive and free running model tests were performed to create the benchmark data the captive test was conducted only for the head wave conditions in the seoul national university towing tank snutt and the free running tests for various incident wave directions in the seakeeping basin of sspa sweden ab the experimental facilities and measuring systems are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively 2 4 1 captive model test the snutt is 110 0 m in length 8 0 m in width and 3 5 m depth equipped with a box girder type towing carriage that can run with a speed range of 0 0 4 5 m s the plunger type wave maker at one end was used to generate a certain regular wave whereas the wave beach was installed at the other end movable wave absorbers are utilized to damp waves disturbed by a ship more efficiently two sonar type wave gauges were set up to confirm the incident wave generation one at the forepart of the towing carriage and the other near the wave maker to verify the quality of incident waves the preliminary wave generation tests without a ship model are done through the measurements by wave probe 1 furthermore the uncertainty analysis for wave amplitude park et al 2015 is carried out by using the time history of wave elevation obtained by wave probe 2 during each test run the uncertainty level is generally within 5 for various wave conditions the ship model of a bare hull was adopted for the towing tank testing as shown in fig 6 a according to the guidelines of ittc 2014a the scale ratio is determined to prevent the tank wall effects considering the dimensions of the towing tank and test conditions such as forward speed and wavelength at the same time as meeting the criteria the test model should be as large as possible in 3 0 4 0 m to ensure the accuracy of the experimental measurement as listed in table 3 an additional bulwark is installed at the top of the bow to prevent green water because of resonant ship motions the captive test is performed only for the head wave condition with the guidance of three dofs surge heave and pitch which is directly connected to the center of gravity of a ship model the ship is fixed in the sway roll and yaw directions while the surge motion is weakly constrained by soft springs the wave induced motions were measured using high precision potentiometers surge motion sub carriage heave rod and pitch gimbal further a strain gauge type load cell was adopted between the heave rod and pitch gimbal to measure the longitudinal force acting on a ship all results were gathered using an 8 channel data acquisition device the transfer functions of seakeeping quantities are evaluated by extracting the data of a quasi steady state for the range of approximately 60 0 m the signal at least 20 periods of data is analyzed based on ittc 2014b the added resistance due to a wave is assessed by the difference between the still water resistance and the time averaged total resistance in a wave r a w r w a v e r s t i l l for the normalization of seakeeping quantities the measured wave amplitude of each test run is used 2 4 2 free running model test the seakeeping basin of sspa sweden ab is 88 0 in length 39 0 m in width and 3 0 m depth with a multi motion carriage that can move up to 3 5 m s in both the x and y directions the flap type wave makers are installed at both the longitudinal and transverse sides while the wave beaches are on opposite sides the walls at regular intervals are located at the wave beach adjacent to the wave maker to generate an incident wave more accurately three capacitance type wave probes were used one was installed at the center of the basin to calibrate wave generation before the seakeeping test the other two probes at the front of the motion carriage and at a fixed location near the wave maker were utilized to measure wave elevations during the free running test for self propulsion the ship model was equipped with a propeller and rudder as shown in fig 6 b the size of the ship model 4 75 m refer to table 3 is determined based on the following two conditions the test model should be as large as possible to accurately measure thrust for long wavelength ratios the ship model should be sufficiently small to prevent reflected waves from the side walls of the basin and the finite depth effects at the beginning of a free running test the ship model was accelerated and then released as it reached a constant forward speed the revolution speed of the propeller is determined such that the model can advance at the target speed in still water or in a wave for oblique wave conditions the ship navigates diagonally and an incident wave propagating along the longitudinal direction of the basin is generated an autopilot based on proportional derivative pd control is applied to the rudder angle for maintaining the incident wave direction during self propulsion the six dof ship motions were measured by a lightweight measuring arm the data acquisition and power supply can be performed using soft cables between the model and the carriage thrusts were measured in still water and in a wave to evaluate the added resistance then the wave induced resistance is derived from the difference between the thrusts and the thrust deduction coefficient based on the assumption that the change in the coefficient induced by a wave can be regarded as negligible r a w t w a v e t s t i l l 1 t 2 5 computational methods several research institutes participated in the present comparative studies using their own numerical techniques for seakeeping analysis the computation programs for wave induced ship motions and loads can be largely grouped into potential and cfd based methods the former is based on a linear analysis with respect to the mean body position of a ship where the wave steepness and ship motions are assumed to be infinitely small the potential methods can be again classified in accordance with the problem domain type of singularity and linearization scheme as summarized in table 4 the cfd technique which is a fully nonlinear computation can consider the nonlinearities of seakeeping quantities related to hull geometries and disturbed waves two cfd programs were used in this study as presented in table 5 the in house code of seoul national university named snu mhl cfd and the commercial software star ccm 2 5 1 snu slender in the snu slender program developed by seoul national university the 2d boundary value problems bvp for radiation and diffraction potentials are defined with respect to a hull section and solved in the frequency domain by applying the 2d zero

slender are reported in park et al 2019a 2 5 2 kr3d the kr3d of the korean register of shipping is a frequency domain 3d panel method based on the forward speed wave green function for a linearized bvp with a uniform flow nk the improved green integral equation is solved with an exact line integral along the waterline of a ship for stable computations without irregular frequency effects hong

are used to calculate the kochin function in maruo s far field method examples of added resistance computations using the kr3d program can be found in hong et al 2016b 2 5 3 precal precal pressure calculation program is a 3d potential flow based program developed by the maritime research institute netherlands marin its accuracy and reliability were validated by the international consortium of the cooperative research ships crs van t veer 2009 seakeeping quantities are computed in the frequency domain based on the constant panel method planar panel approach in this comparative study the approximate forward speed approach afs approach using the zero speed wave green function which is a type of uniform flow approximation nk is applied for efficient seakeeping computation the added resistance caused by a wave was evaluated through direct pressure integration near field method computation results by precal have been used as reference data for added resistance analysis through other techniques such as experiments and cfd kim et al 2017b 2 5 4 wish wave induced ship hydrodynamics wish was developed by seoul national university for the analysis of linear and nonlinear wave induced ship motions and structural loads kim et al 2011 the steady flow caused by a forward speed is approximated by a double body flow double body linearization db the linearized bvp is solved by the 3d time domain rankine panel method based on a b spline basis function table 6 summarizes the main features of each version of wish and it can be distinguished based on how steady flow induced coupling effects are considered for version 3 x the bvp is defined with respect to an inertial coordinate the body boundary condition includes a m j term that represents the coupling effects of steady flow on unsteady solutions in version 3 1 the m j term is evaluated using only first order derivatives of the double body potential based on the stokes theorem based on the wall sided assumption nakos 1990 while the second order derivatives are computed directly by solving a dirichlet type equation for an arbitrary body chen and malenica 1998 in version 3 2 on the other hand in version 4 0 the bvp is derived with respect to a body fixed coordinate moving according to ship motions that leads to stable and accurate seakeeping computations without the m j term shao and faltinsen 2012 further wave induced added resistance was evaluated using the near field method direct pressure integration with respect to the inertial coordinate the mathematical formulation for the second order pressure contains the second order derivatives of potentials whereas that of the body fixed coordinate does not the details of the applications of the wish program to the added resistance problem can be found in kim and kim 2011 and seo et al 2013 2 5 5 nload3d the time domain nonlinear wave body interaction analysis program nload3d was developed by the american bureau of shipping for the hull strength assessment of large commercial ships this is a dynamic loading approach dla kim et al 2006 the seakeeping analysis of nload3d is based on the time domain 3d rankine panel method the boundary value problem is linearized by a db flow with a formulation similar to that of the wish program the added resistance was evaluated through the near field method considering the nonlinear wave induced loads the froude krylov and hydrostatic restoring forces are evaluated on the actual wetted hull surface weakly nonlinear approach approximate body nonlinear method 2 5 6 snu mhl cfd snu mhl cfd seoul national university marine hydrodynamics laboratory cfd is an in house code for calculating ship motion responses and added resistances caused by head waves yang et al 2015 in this program the governing equation for a flow field is the euler equation instead of the navier stokes equation which denotes that it focuses only on inertia dominant features rather than viscous flow related phenomena a cartesian grid system which is easy to generate is adopted for the level set based immersed boundary method ibm as shown in fig 7 a the evolution of the free surface is captured by the tangent of the hyperbola for the interface capture scheme thinc xiao et al 2005 finally an incident wave is generated based on the second order stokes wave potential forcing zones to damp the waves are imposed on all sides of the problem domain 2 5 7 star ccm in general applications of the star ssm for seakeeping analysis a fluid field is computed by solving the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equation and the continuity equation based on the semi implicit method for the pressure linked equations simple technique the overall grid system is divided into the background domain that remains constant throughout the simulation and the hull domain that moves following ship motions overset grid system with the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi this is shown in fig 7 b in the hull domain body fitted meshes were adopted to impose the body boundary condition moreover the vof method was used to capture the multiphase flows near the free surface finally the euler overlay method kim et al 2012 was applied to generate and damp waves accurately and efficiently at the boundaries of the problem domain 2 6 participants information on the research institutes that submit numerical computation results are listed in tables 7 10 a total of seven different institutes participated in this comparative study seoul national university snu inha university iu samsung heavy industries shi hyundai heavy industries hhi korean register of shipping kr american bureau of shipping abs and llyod s register asia lr the id of a participant is set in accordance with the computation method 2dst 2d strip theory 3dpm 3d panel method and cfd in addition the digits in the id represent specific information about the program and the participating institute furthermore the number of grids are presented in the tables to identify the grid system in each computation panels for the body and free surfaces are distinguished in the case of potential methods for the cfd computations the number of meshes introduced for an incident wave the number of meshes per wavelength Œª d x and per wave height h d z and the total number of meshes are summarized several institutes use the same program of different versions or with different computational settings e g grid systems therefore through the comparison results both the individual characteristics of each program and the user dependency on the same program can be investigated 3 results of comparative study the submitted computation results are divided into two groups potential and cfd based methods for a clear comparison between the numerical methods the results of each group were separately plotted and compared with the experimental data in addition statistical values such as the mean and standard deviation s d are used to assess the overall tendencies of the results as follows 2 m e a n i 1 n x i n 3 s d i 1 n x i m e a n 2 n where x i denotes the non dimensionalized variables heave Œæ 3 a pitch Œæ 5 k a and added resistance r a w 1 2 œÅ g a 2 b 2 l and n indicates the number of computation results in a specific group through the standard deviation it is possible to evaluate the extent to which each computation result is scattered with respect to a certain mean value 3 1 head wave conditions 3 1 1 s lngc for the twin skeg gas carrier the captive model tests were performed for the two different wave height conditions as shown in fig 8 h l 1 100 and h Œª 1 40 experimental data for the small wave height h l 1 100 can act as a reference value for the results of the linear potential methods the nonlinear computation results can be directly compared with experimental data for large wave steepness h Œª 1 40 1 motion responses for potential methods the heave motions of some results 3dpm1 and 3dpm4 are overestimated at the resonant region in the wavelength range of Œª l 1 0 1 2 this tendency is a typical characteristic of nk linearization based computation caused by invalid hydrodynamic coefficients such as added mass and damping coefficient kim and shin 2007 in other words steady flow approximation based on a uniform flow has a limitation in predicting the resonant heave response for the pitch motion all potential methods provide considerably accurate results compared to the experimental data the model test results for the two wave height conditions confirmed that the motion responses are not significantly affected by the wave height only for the resonant region the non dimensionalized heave motion is reduced slightly as the wave height increases overall cfd based computations can capture this nonlinear trend of ship motion 2 added resistance compared to motion responses added resistances obtained by the potential methods show relatively larger deviations with respect to the mean value computation results vary significantly according to how the effects of steady flow are approximated all of the potential methods produce underestimated values except 3dpm3 1 in particular the nk linearization based computation 3dpm1 significantly under predicts the added resistance despite the overestimated heave motions which is a counterintuitive result this is because the simple uniform flow approximation cannot strictly consider the steady flow induced coupling effects on unsteady hydrodynamic pressure on the other hand 3dpm3 1 stably reflects the effects of steady flow through the double body linearization with respect to a body fixed coordinate which leads to an accurate prediction the computed added resistances are similar to the model test results for the small wave height h l 1 100 especially at the resonant region which is consistent with the theoretical basis of the linear analysis studies on the steady flow approximation in wave drift force analysis can be found in lee et al 2017c and lee and kim 2020 it should be noted that the ship motions the global and integrated quantity are not enough for the assessment of numerical method regarding the added resistance analysis the added resistance is the second order quantity and significantly sensitive to the local geometries and flows near the bow and stern regions therefore the validation for primitive and local physical quantity such as the pressure distribution on hull surfaces should be validated in order to strictly investigate the reliability and accuracy of each numerical technique waskito et al 2020 according to the model test results strong sensitivities of the added resistance to the wave height can be confirmed compared to the case of motion response as the wave height increases the added resistance at the resonant region is reduced significantly while the results for short and long waves vary slightly further it can be inferred that this sensitivity is attributed to nonlinear wave radiation rather than nonlinear ship motions or wave diffractions cfd computation results show good agreement with the experimental data for h Œª 1 40 by capturing the nonlinearities of the added resistance fig 9 shows the standard deviations for seakeeping quantities the results of the potential method are more scattered for both the motion responses and the added resistance compared to those of the cfd based computations for the resonant region where the coupling effects of the steady flow on ship motions intensify relatively large standard deviations for heave and pitch motions are confirmed for added resistances obtained by potential methods statistical values are derived considering only the linear analysis results except for 3dpm4 weakly nonlinear method wn the overall tendency of the standard deviations in accordance with wavelength follows the magnitude of the non dimensionalized added resistance further variances are more prominent for short waves Œª l 0 5 compared to long waves Œª l 1 5 because of the underestimated predictions of potential methods the cfd computation methods provide converged results of relatively small standard deviations especially for the added resistance this denotes reliable and consistent predictions despite different programs and grid systems 3 1 2 s vlcc as shown in fig 10 for the s vlcc the two different wave steepness conditions are adopted depending on the wavelength h Œª 1 50 for Œª l 1 0 and h Œª 1 100 for Œª l 1 0 both captive and free running model tests were conducted for the wave conditions nonlinear computations such as the wn method and cfd were also carried out for the given wave steepness the results were compared with those of linear analyses under the assumption that the wave slopes were in the range of the linear domain h Œª 1 1 motion responses the two experimental data for motion responses show some discrepancies especially for long waves the results of free running tests are somewhat over measured considering the physical basis that non dimensionalized pitch motion by k a converges to 1 0 as the wavelength increases surf riding along wave elevation for long wave conditions the reflected waves from the side walls of the basin seem to affect incident wave generation among the potential methods the overestimated heave resonant motions for Œª l 1 2 1 4 are given by 3dpm2 based on nk linearization and 3dpm4 the results of 3dpm3 2 and 3dmpm3 3 obtained by the same program were almost identical despite the different users moreover 3dpm3 1 produces motion responses that are most similar to those of captive model testing for cfd based analyses some computations are conducted for different wave height conditions cfd2 2 for h Œª 1 40 and cfd2 3 for h l 1 75 therefore a direct comparison of these results is unavailable considering the overall trends all computation results based on the same cfd program are relatively consistent with the experimental data although there are some differences that are attributed to different wave heights and computational settings 2 added resistance the predictions of the potential based methods show significant deviations and the computed added resistances are somewhat underestimated compared to the experimental data this trend is intensified for short and resonant waves rather than for long waves underestimation by the nk linearization based 3dpm2 is prominent in general a uniform flow based steady flow approximation is appropriate for a slender body therefore for the blunt body s vlcc the steady flow induced coupling effects on the added resistance cannot be considered strictly by nk linearization furthermore unlike motion responses the added resistances of 3dpm3 2 and 3dmpm3 3 were remarkably different even though they were obtained by the same program this is because the grid systems in the two computations are significantly different table 8 which indicates that the evaluation of added resistance has a high sensitivity to numerical panels despite the different wave height conditions all cfd results were relatively consistent in general smaller added resistances are computed for a larger wave height because of the intensified nonlinearities 3 1 3 h cntr like for s vlcc two types of experiments and numerical computations were performed for the two wave steepness conditions depending on the wavelength the results were compared the wetted surface of the h cntr containership varies significantly according to the wave elevation caused by the geometries of the large flare angles and overhanging transom further among the ship models h cntr operates at the fastest design speed therefore seakeeping analysis on h cntr can be regarded as the most challenging case in the present study because of the strong nonlinearities of the hull form and intensified effects of steady flow due to the high forward speed 1 motion responses as shown in fig 11 all potential methods provide overestimated heave motions especially at the resonant region Œª l 1 0 1 2 this tendency intensifies in the results of 3dpm2 and 3dpm4 because of the strong nonlinearities of heave motion in accordance with ship geometry there seem to be difficulties in predicting the resonant response based on a linear potential analysis for pitch motion the results of 3dpm3 3 wish version 3 1 were significantly over predicted for long waves compared to 3dpm3 1 and 3dpm3 2 other versions of the wish program this discrepancy is attributed to the inaccurate coupling effects of steady flow as shown in table 6 in version 3 1 the m j term is evaluated through the stokes theorem based on the assumption that the hull form is wall sided at the mean water level this assumption is not valid for h cntr because of its overhanging transom when the m j term is computed in the other way direct computation by solving the dirichlet type equation version 3 2 or when the bvp is defined with respect to the body fixed coordinate without the m j term version 4 1 the long wave pitch motion can be obtained accurately compared with the model test results for 2dst the only 2d method in this comparative study there are some discrepancies in predicting the heave motion whereas the pitch motion seems to be reasonable compared to the experimental data the discrepancies in the heave response may be caused by limitations of the 2d method in considering steady flow effects induced by a high forward speed the cfd computations that can capture the forward speed and nonlinear effects without any assumptions produce accurate motion responses 2 added resistance overall trends of the two model test results for added resistance are similar however some discrepancies between the two experimental data are confirmed for short wave and resonant regions in particular for a resonant wave the discrepancies are intensified because of the uncertainties regarding the incident wave generation and resulting resonant ship motions furthermore because of the relatively high forward speed the added resistances of the 3d panel methods are more scattered according to how the effects of steady flow are considered in each method the variance intensifies for short wave and resonant regions the underestimated added resistances in the short wave region indicate that there are limitations in predicting the diffraction component of the added resistance by the potential methods for the resonant region the added resistance is significantly overestimated by 3dpm3 2 wish version 3 2 this discrepancy is attributed to the unstable numerical evaluation of the second order derivatives of potentials in direct pressure integration with respect to the inertial coordinate for 3dpm3 1 wish version 4 1 the overestimation mitigates because the near field method derived with respect to the body fixed coordinate does not contain second order derivatives as described in table 6 the somewhat larger peak value of 3dpm3 1 compared to the experimental data can be considered reasonable since the results of the linear analysis based on the assumption that the wave slope is infinitely small can be larger than those of the model test for a finite wave steepness other potential methods somewhat underestimated the added resistances in the resonant region despite the excessive heave responses for 2dst when considering a short wave Œª l 0 5 the added resistance corrected by the asymptotic formula for wave reflection is in good agreement with the experimental data for the cfd computations cfd2 3 is performed for a different wave height condition h l 1 75 hence direct comparison with other results is impossible all predictions for added resistance based on cfd show good correspondence despite different wave height conditions and program computational settings similar results of the two different cfd techniques snu mhl cfd based on the euler equation and star ccm based on the navier stokes equation indicate that the effects of fluid viscosity on the added resistance analysis are negligible 3 1 4 k supramax for the last model k supramax a comparative study on wave induced ship motions and added resistance was conducted based on captive and free running model tests and numerical computations as shown in fig 12 the test wave conditions for wavelengths and wave heights were the same as those for the s vlcc 1 motion responses the 3d panel methods produce accurate motion responses in comparison with model test results except for the overestimated resonant heave motions Œª l 1 2 1 4 obtained by 3dpm4 three different versions of the wish program 3dpm3 1 3dpm3 2 and 3dpm3 3 yield similar results regardless of how the coupling effects of steady flow were considered through the comparison it is confirmed that the m j term can be evaluated in any way for the bulk carrier for which the hull shape is almost wall sided further the solutions of the two types of bvp defined with respect to different coordinate systems inertial and body fixed coordinates are equivalent motion response prediction results obtained using 2dst have a similar trend to that of the other blunt ship model s vlcc the heave motions show good correspondence with the experimental data for the entire range of wavelengths whereas the pitch motions are underestimated especially for long waves all computational results based on cfd converge within a certain range which is similar to the model test results 2 added resistance overall the added resistances obtained by the free running model test are slightly underestimated compared to those of the captive model test and the differences between the two results intensify for short waves according to the uncertainty analysis for added resistance experiment park et al 2015 for a short wave the major sources of uncertainty are related to the calibration and measurement of resistance the measured resistance and thrust in the captive and free running model tests respectively are remarkably small for a given wave steepness which may lead to significant uncertainties in the evaluation of added resistance in contrast to the case of a slender ship h cntr all potential methods provide accurate added resistance in the short wave region this indicates that the under prediction for short wave added resistance mitigates the blunt ship model in the resonant and long wave regions the added resistances are underestimated significantly by 3dpm3 2 and 3dpm3 3 because of the unstably evaluated second order derivatives of potentials in the near field method when the body fixed coordinate based direct pressure integration was applied 3dpm3 1 the computed added resistances showed good agreement with the model test results as with the case of s vlcc the added resistance obtained by 2dst is considerably similar to the experimental data although the peak value occurs at a slightly longer wave in general the typical 2d strip method is appropriate for a slender body because of its limitation in considering the effects of 3d hull form and forward speed for the blunt ship model with a large block coefficient the prediction of motion and added resistance can be improved through advanced modeling for example the enhanced unified theory eut based on matching between the inner and outer solutions and considerations for x component of normal vector of hull surfaces and ship s surge motion however the slender body theories still have difficulties in considering the wave diffraction especially near the bow when the forward speed of a ship exists therefore an additional correction should be adopted analytically or empirically a related discussion can be found in kashiwagi et al 2009 and park et al 2019a 2dst in the present study also yields high accuracy added resistance for entire wavelength region including short waves through the correction based on the asymptotic formula for the cfd analysis even though all computations were conducted using the same program star ccm some discrepancies between the results are confirmed the deviation is much greater than in the case of motion responses these user dependencies of cfd program related to numerical grids and parameters can also be found in the comparative study of shigunov et al 2018 among the computational settings the grid system was found to be the most important factor that causes variance comparing the results of cfd2 3 and cfd2 6 with a large number of meshes cfd2 3 yields the most consistent added resistance with the model test results while cfd2 6 produces the overestimated prediction as shown in table 10 not only the total number of meshes but the number of meshes per length and height of an incident wave are also different in each computation in other words the computation of added resistance is remarkably sensitive to the local characteristics of a grid system the correlation between the adopted numerical meshes and the computation accuracy should be investigated in the future fig 13 shows the standard deviations of the computation results for two types of ship models a slender ship with a relatively high forward speed h cntr and a blunt ship with a relatively low forward speed k supramax for h cntr the standard deviations for motion responses have the maximum values at wavelengths longer than the resonant region in particular the longer the wavelength the greater is the sd value of the pitch motion these remarkable variances are attributed to differences in how steady flow effects and nonlinearities are considered in each computation method for k supramax the maximum motion response values are located in the resonant region Œª l 1 2 1 4 furthermore according to accurate predictions based on both the potential and cfd based computations the overall s d values are less than those of the slender ship for the s d of the added resistance values for both ship models the maximum values are given at the resonant wave region where significant ship motions and added resistance occur further the variance of predictions for short wave added resistances are also prominent because of the difficulties in analyzing diffracted waves with very short wavelengths 3 2 oblique wave conditions for the oblique wave conditions only the free running model tests for the blunt ship models s vlcc and k supramax were conducted in the rectangular basin whereas only the potential methods were utilized as numerical analysis techniques the wavelength and wave steepness were set to be the same as those for the head wave conditions 3 2 1 s vlcc 1 motion responses in oblique waves six dof ship motions are induced by a wave and among them the heave roll and pitch motions are directly related to the added resistance fig 14 shows the motion responses of the tanker s vlcc for different heading angles the resonant frequency or wavelength is shifted to a shorter wavelength region as the heading angle decreases from a head wave to the following wave œá 180 0 0 0 deg because of the reduced encounter wave frequency œâ e œâ k u cos œá for both results of the free running model tests and numerical computations especially 3dpm3 1 it can be confirmed that the change in resonant frequency and the resulting ship motions in accordance with the direction of an incident wave are consistent furthermore the results show similar tendencies to those of the existing seakeeping analysis for oblique wave conditions takahashi 1988 for heave and pitch motions similar tendencies were identified as those for the head wave conditions the predictions obtained by numerical methods are in good agreement with the experimental data except for 3dpm2 which overestimates the peak resonant heave motion for each heading angle because of the simple approximation for a steady flow nk linearization in the case of roll response the peak value is located at a longer wave region because the resonant frequency for roll motion is lower than that for heave and pitch motions however potential based numerical analyses have limitations in strictly evaluating the magnitude of resonant roll motion the resonant response varies according to how a viscous roll moment is modeled in each numerical method linear or quadratic damping coefficient for 2dst and 3dpm3 1 the 3 of critical damping is used for an equivalent linear coefficient which is determined based on a free roll decay test on the other hand for 3dpm2 the viscous roll damping moment estimated by its own procedure is applied it can be confirmed that the overall trends with respect to the heading angle are consistent in all computation results despite the different modelings 2 added resistance overall trends of the experimental and computational results show good agreements for all heading angles the peak value of added resistance is located according to the resonant frequencies for the heave and pith responses as shown in fig 15 for a more quantitative comparison the transfer functions for each heading angle are compared in fig 16 from the bow quartering and beam waves œá 150 0 90 0 deg the distribution of the added resistance values was well predicted by the cross check validation especially between the experiment and 3dpm3 1 however for the blunt ship model s vlcc 3dpm2 based on the nk linearization underestimated the magnitude of the added resistance compared to the model test results in the range from the stern quartering and following waves œá 60 0 0 0 deg uncertainties of the measurement in the free running model test intensify due to the significant wave induced drifting in horizontal directions surge sway and yaw which makes it difficult to control the route and heading angle of a ship moreover because of the low encounter frequency of data it is difficult to obtain data in the quasi steady state with a certain amplitude effects of uncertainties are more significant for the added resistance the very small second order quantity than for the motion responses furthermore there are also difficulties in numerical computations for the heading angles for example the strip method is based on the high frequency assumption regarding the relationship between the encounter frequency of a wave and the forward speed of a ship to derive the 2d bvp therefore the reliability of computation results of 2dst in the low frequency region may be questioned in particular the overestimated added resistance is confirmed for the œÑ œâ e u g 0 25 condition where the numerical solution is unstable 3 2 2 k supramax 1 motion responses for the bulk carrier k supramax the overall tendencies of ship motions are considerably similar to those of s vlcc as shown in fig 17 the results of all potential methods showed good agreement with the free running model test results 3dpm3 1 and 3dpm3 3 different versions of the wish program produced consistent results for all motion responses this indicates that for the blunt ship model and the db linearization based 3d panel method can predict accurately regardless of the evaluation method for steady flow induced coupling effects m j term for the roll response larger resonant motions occur compared to those of s vlcc because of the relatively lower vertical center of gravity larger gm value for 2dst and 3dpm3 1 2 7 of critical damping is used to model the viscous damping moment this led to a similar magnitude of resonant response to the experimental data 2 added resistance all potential methods provide a consistent distribution of added resistance values compared to the free running model test results as shown in fig 18 3dmp3 1 slightly overestimates the peak value of the added resistance for each heading angle because the nonlinearities of the added resistance reflected in the experiment are not considered in the linear computation the results of 3dpm3 3 are underestimated because the second order derivatives of potentials in the near field method are evaluated numerically unstable as in the head wave condition in the model test results for a beam wave œá 90 0 deg the peak value of the added resistance occurs Œª l 1 0 even though the resonant regions for the heave and pitch motions are located in a shorter wave region because a significant roll response is confirmed for the wave of Œª l 1 0 it can be inferred that the maximum resistance is caused by the resonant roll motion a very large roll motion can have a direct effect on the magnitude of the oblique wave induced resistance this phenomenon based on the relationship between resonant roll motion and added resistance was reproduced only through 3dpm3 1 4 summary and conclusions in this comparative study the wave induced ship motions and added resistance obtained by various analysis techniques are compared to validate their reliabilities and limitations by comparing the results for the four representative types of ships the following conclusions are drawn the overall trends of the two experimental data captive and free running model tests are similar however some discrepancies between the two results are confirmed especially for short wave and resonant regions due to the uncertainties regarding the measurements of resistance and thrust and the incident wave generation respectively further for oblique wave conditions the reliability of the free running measurement decreases because of the uncertainties regarding the low encounter wave frequency of data and the wave induced drifting of a ship the 2d strip method provides some discrepancies with model test results especially for a blunt ship and for a high forward speed because of its limitation considering the effects of forward speed and 3d hull form when the short wave added resistance is corrected by the asymptotic formula the overall trend of the computed added resistance in good agreement with the experimental data the accuracy of the 3d panel method depends on the consideration of the effects of steady flow induced by the forward speed the simple uniform flow approximation nk linearization overestimates the resonant heave response and underestimates the added resistance for a blunt ship furthermore even for the double body linearization the reliability of the computation results varies according to the evaluation method for the second order derivatives of potential this leads to the under prediction of the added resistance of various 3d panel methods the body fixed coordinate based formulation allows for stable and accurate numerical computations the added resistance showed some sensitivity to wave steepness whereas motion responses varied slightly as the wave height increased this sensitivity intensified for the resonant region because of nonlinear wave radiation the cfd technique a fully nonlinear computation can capture the nonlinearities of the added resistance despite its user dependency regarding the numerical grid system for oblique wave conditions the overall tendencies of the seakeeping quantities are considerably similar to those for the head waves which are determined according to the resonant frequencies of the motion responses for each heading angle not only the heave and pitch motions but also the resonant roll motion can also affect the magnitude of the added resistance the trend of the analysis results on added resistance varies according to the ship type potential methods yield relatively accurate results for a blunt ship with low speed however they show some limitations in the strict prediction for a slender body with a high speed an appropriate choice of the analysis technique suitable for specific hull form and forward speed conditions is required

20418,experimental study on the local scour around tandem square porous piles in steady current has been carried out in the live bed flow condition the influence of the porosity p of both front and rear piles in the tandem configuration p 0 38 5 and the gap ratios g d 2 12 are quantified based on the measurement of the development of the local scour time scale three dimensional scour profiles and the scour characteristics were analysed three regimes are identified regarding on the porosity distributions of the front and rear pile the distinct features were found at the porosity of the front was small than its counterpart of the rear the global scour can be recognized at g d 4 the dimensions of the scour hole for the rear pile decrease first as a trade off is observed between the sediment deposit landed around the rear pile and its weak erosion a critical gap ratio at which the minimum scour dimensions were observed is strongly depend on the difference of the porosity between the front and rear piles keywords local scour sediment transport pile porous horseshoe vortex tandem pile 1 introduction as one of the top topics in the coastal and offshore engineering local scour around a vertical pile placed on the erodible seabed attracts substantial interest in the past decades breusers et al 1977 roulund et al 2005 whitehouse et al 2011 melville et al 2015 ahmad et al 2017 karimi et al 2017 sumer and fredsoe 2002 concluded that as the vertical pile is placed on the seabed the following mechanisms that governs the flow structures which are 1 flow deceleration induced by a downflow in the upstream leads to presence of the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile 2 contraction streamlines at two sides 3 vortex shedding in the lee wake of the pile the mechanisms lead to a dramatical increase of the sediment transport resulting in the local scour around pile through the above empirical functions the scour depth around a vertical pile at any time can be predicted for designing and assessment of the bridge piers abutments as well as the subsea structures the key variables in the empirical functions are the equilibrium scour depth s 0 and the time scale of scour t melville and chiew 1999 found that the equilibrium time scale was a function of the flow intensify the flow depth and the sediment coarseness for the clear water scour dey and raikar 2007 applied the acoustic doppler velocimetry adv to analyse the evolution of the turbulent flow characteristics of the horseshoe vortex and observed strong turbulence within the developing scour hole breusers nicollet et al 1977 melville and sutherland 1988 and richardson and davis 1995 summarized a general design method for estimation of the equilibrium scour depth considering multiple factors which are the factors of flow intensity k i flow depth k y influence of sediment size k d sediment gradation k œÉ shape of the cross section k s alignment factor k Œ± the height to diameter ratio k h the pile groups are widely used to support the subsea structures regarding to the practice in the coastal and offshore engineering due to the interference of the flow around the individual pile member the flow structure could be significantly changed and the local scour around pile group may differ largely comparing with the scour around a single pile due to the significance in the practice the local scour of pile groups has been investigated through amounts of researchers on two pile system three pile system and multiple pile system amini and solaimani 2017 karimi et al 2017 yagci et al 2017 yilmaz et al 2017 liu et al 2018 memar et al 2018 qi et al 2019 for the two pile system which is normally applied as the prototype in the offshore engineering there are three kinds of configurations the side by side the tandem and the staggered arrangement zdravkovich 1987 concluded that the interference effect for both the lee wake vortex shedding and the horseshoe vortex in the upstream will strongly depended on the pile group configurations zdravkovich 1997a b reported the lee wake has a slightly larger width due to the increased size of the lee wake vortices this induces a relatively larger adverse pressure gradient and further leads to a larger horseshoe vortex as for the measurement of the local scour around a tandem two pile group breusers et al 1977 concluded that the scour of the front pile increased with increasing g d first g d 2 and then decreased till the scour depth reaches its single pile values at g d 10 the increase can be attributed to the reason that the strengthening of the horseshoe vortex for the scour in the rear pile it is reported that the scour depth is always smaller than the single pile case which can be ascribed to the relatively smaller horseshoe vortex in the rear and the scour depth of the rear pile decreases as g d 3 which is validated by the flow structures that the horseshoe vortex in the downstream pile begins to form arneson zevenbergen et al 2012 and gosselin and sheppard 2014 summarized the prediction of the scour development around the tandem cylinders yilmaz yanmaz et al 2017 explored the local scour around two pile system at the clear water flow condition and found that the shape of the scour hole of the front pile remained almost constant through the experiments and scour depth decreases with the spacing between piles decreases in the range of g d 4 2 liu tang et al 2018 reported that in the clear water flow condition the scour depth in the rear pile shows four regions based on different velocity and spacing memar zounemat kermani et al 2018 summarized the influence of skew angles on the local scour around two pile group it was found that as the increase of the skew angle the influence of the sheltering effects of the front pile is decreased and the scour depth around the rear pile increases qi li et al 2019 however launched a series of experimental investigations on the local scour around two pile group under combine wave and current flow condition for subsea structures in the coastal and offshore engineering complex configurations are always equipped with horizontal and vertical beams inside the structure porosity is one of the key factors that largely influences the flow structures and sediment transport whilst the previous study always applied solid piles as a simplification due to the very limited work conducted before the pioneering work of dhi snamprogetti 1992 defined the structure porosity p by 1 p a p a c r o s s in which a p is the total area of permeable parts in the longitudinal vertical section surface and a c r o s s is the area of the longitudinal vertical section of the cubic caisson porosity p was denoted as the ability that the water passes through the subsea structures yang tang et al 2020 introduced a correcting parameter k p to illustrate the influence of porosity on the equilibrium scour depth and time scale for the local scour around the porous structures barbe cruise et al 1992 concluded that the dominant influence factor of sediment transport is the momentum transfer due to the fluid sediment interactions and two paths was reported as the vertical mixing with fluid and the vertical motion of grains keeping interaction with surrounding fluid the vertical momentum transfers in the upper recirculating cells moves the bed sediment into the upper layer and the movement of sediment particles is not significantly active in the lower layer yang tang et al 2020 indicated that the incoming flow rate is divergent into two different paths which are through inside and outside of the porous structures and the weakening of the momentum transfer through the presence of the structure further weakened the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and this physical mechanism induces the observations that the increase of the porosity leads to a decrease of the scour depth in line with the framework above the investigations on the scouring process of the tandem pile with structure porosity are quite essential based on the widely application of the prototype of the certain subsea structure supports motivated by this goal the present work focuses on quantifying 1 the influence of porosity on the local scour of tandem piles group 2 the interference effect of the lee wake vortex street and horseshoe vortex in the upstream induced by the porosity the major study is to quantify the influence of the gap ratio g d and the porosity p on the development of the scour depth as well as the scour profiles and scour features for designing purpose the remainder of the present work is organized as follows section 2 4 describe the test facility experimental setup and scour measurements section 5 6 then present the main results and discussions for the influence of porosity on the local scour around the tandem square porous piles conclusions are given in section 7 2 test facility the experimental tests in the present work were conducted in the o tube facility at dalian university of technology in china o tube facility can be regarded as an impeller driven fully enclosed circulating water channel the dimension of working section is 20m 1 5m 1 6 m in length width depth in the middle the testing section is with 0 4 m deep sand and 6 0 m in length extending to cover the whole test section as the schematic drawing shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the streamwise direction is defined as y direction which is along the flow direction z direction is referred as the vertical direction and the x direction is defined by the spanwise direction in the present experiments only the steady current condition was carried out the water depth was always kept 1 0 m for all cases a supply area in the upstream with the sand depth of 0 1 m was prepared to provide sand material to the test section the supply area is around 10 m away from the test section and can provide enough sand supply in the test area and this method was also used by zhao et al 2010 3 model setup square porous model piles were made of acrylic material which is also applied in yang et al 2021 the dimension of the mode pile has a width of d 120 mm in square shape cross section and a height of l 1600 mm this leads to a blockage ratio of 8 in the horizontal direction which can be neglected in the following analysis breusers et al 1977 melville and sutherland 1988 kothyari et al 1992 to ensure the stability during the test a base plate with dimensions of 0 4m 0 4 m is installed deeply in the sand bed as shown in fig 2 the structure porosity is realized by applying the porous holes in the front and rear surfaces of the model pile in the x directions a variety of porosity were considered ranging from p 0 to p 38 5 table 1 shows the experiments performed in the present work the tandem arrangement is setup by the two model piles placed in the front and rear sides through variations of gap ratios and the porosity of the front and rear piles the local scour around the tandem two pile group was investigated the measurements on the scour features of a single pile fp0 with p 0 and fp4 with p 26 3 are set as the reference to illustrate the influence of the gap ration on the tandem piles group a consists of a series of tests with fp4 in the front and fp0 in the rear whilst group b turns this around it should be noted that the major aim of the current investigation is to quantify the influence of the porosity of the front and rear piles on the local scour together with the influence of the gap ratio group a and group b are set as two boundary cases with p front 26 3 p rear 0 and p front 0 p rear 26 3 correspondingly group c were carried out as the supplementary tests with the porosity ranging from p 0 38 5 the following discussions focuses on the results of group a and group b whilst group c will be briefly discussed to support the findings due to the very similar observation observed the information of sediment used in the present experiments are summarized in table 2 the non cohesive uniform silica was used with the median particle size of d 50 0 378 mm and the geometric standard deviation of d 84 d 50 1 18 and the specific gravity s of 2 67 in the present work the steady current was generated at u 0 38 m s corresponding to Œ∏ s Œ∏ cr 1 28 of live bed flow conditions the detailed calculation of the shields number can be referred in yang et al 2021 4 measurement setup velocity profiles across the water depth in the vertical direction were measured at the location where the model pipe was set without the presence of the model pile a nortek vectrino acoustic doppler velocimetry adv was applied with sampling frequency of 20 hz and sampling time of 180s for each sampling point it should be noted the measurement of the velocity was ongoing after 10 min of generating flow to avoid disturbances from the pump which is similar to the measurement setup in zhao et al 2012 the distributions of velocity profile across the water depth are shown in fig 3 a the results of uniformity test were shown in fig 3 b through applying measurements of the velocity profiles at two locations along the transverse direction it can be seen from fig 3 b that the good uniformity of the velocity is achieved in the transverse direction in the present work as a key parameter indicating the quality of the data the snr correlation of the signal is always monitoring during the test it was found that the 35 points in the middle range normally have correlation values higher than 95 and the correlation values drop with the increase of the distance to the probe for the other 10 points in the analysis the samples with correlation lower than 95 were removed a fitted curve according to the measured velocities below z 0 32 m was also plotted in fig 3 the fitted curve follows the logarithmic law as follows 2 u z u f t Œ∫ ln z z 0 t where u f t is the friction velocity associated with the total shear stress z 0 t is the total roughness the total shear stress is the shear stress due to the combined effect of skin friction and friction due to bedforms such as bed ripples soulsby 1997 according to the fitted curve the velocity generated by the steady current is u 0 38 m s the boundary layer thickness is around 0 32 m through the velocity profile in this study the durations of the scour tests were set in the range of 6 h 8 h at each test performed a adv was always set in the upstream to measure the freestream velocity the location is 1 5 m away from the model location in the upstream and 50 mm above the sand bed out of the seabed boundary layer an ultrasound doppler velocimetry udv probes were adopted on the single pile to record the development of the scour depth at the upstream corner where the maximum scour depth is expected to be located the schematic drawing of the udv setup is shown in fig 4 udv can transmit and receive the reflected ultrasonic waves and usually the position with the strongest reflected signal is exactly on the sand surface therefore the development of the scour depth can be inferred from the change of the sand surface the sampling rate on the recording depth variations is set us 20hz which proves to be effectively and accurate range as indicated by yang et al 2018 a three dimensional infrared scour scanner was applied to capture the three dimensional scour features covering a range of 2 m 2 m with resolution of 1 mm the similar setup has been used by yao et al 2018 and zhao et al 2010 the general procedure for experiments performed was as follows i install the model pile steadily in the test section of the o tube ii level the sand bed iii fill water into the o tube and slow down the filling speed to avoid any disturbances to the sand surface iv after starting to record data through adv udv and video run the pump of o tube until the equilibrium stage of local scour is reached v ramp down the pump and drain the water out of the o tube vi scan the final scour profile with a 3d laser scanner 5 results 5 1 development of local scour the influence of the porosity on the local scour of the single vertical pile has been investigated systematically by yang et al 2021 the existence of the porosity on the structures leads to the flow imping on the front surface of the pile diverted from paths of the inside and outside of the pile the flow structures lead to a weak adverse pressure gradient and horseshoe vortex and this mechanism leads to a weak sediment transport and a small scour depth around the porous pile the temporal evolution of developments of the scour depth at the upstream corners of the front and rear piles are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 for group a and group b respectively it should be noted that the developments of the single state of front and rear piles are measured in the same flow conditions as references in fig 5 for group a as the pile of fp4 with p 26 3 is at the front its corresponding scour developments share very similar results of the counterpart of the single pile of fp4 with slightly smaller value this phenomenon can be observed from g d 2 to g d 12 which indicates the independency of the gap ratio g d for the front pile this also coincides with sumer and fredsoe 2002 s work that the solid front pile is almost independent of the gap ratio and the slight reduction of the values implies the small blockage of the rear pile however as shown in fig 5 the development of the scour of fp0 pile with p 0 is significantly smaller than the results of the single fp0 pile even at the largest gap ratio of g d 12 in the present study the scour of fp0 pile with p 0 is still lower than the counterpart of the single fp0 pile the differences decrease dramatically from 160 at g d 2 28 at g d 12 it is ascribed to that the shielding effect of the front pile of fp4 weakens the horseshoe vortex of the rear pile of fp0 which leads to a smaller scour depth as shown in fig 5 sumer and fredsoe 2002 and zdravkovich 1997a b supposed that the horseshoe vortex could be destructed at g d 3 in the present work development of the scour at fp0 pile however shows that the influence of horseshoe vortex is weak but still exists and governs the sediment transport in the front as reported by breusers et al 1977 the scour of the rear pile is heading to the scour of the single pile at g d 10 however the scour of the rear pile still significantly lower at g d 12 the observation probably attributed to the fact the due to the existence of the porosity on the front pile of fp4 the binary vortex street is further weakened with two weakened vortices and this leads to a higher sand deposit located in the middle of the front and rear piles which results in smaller scour depth of the rear pile fp0 comparing with the result of the single fp0 pile as shown in fig 6 for the development of the local scour at the upstream corner for group b the time histories show the distinct characteristics comparing with results of group a similar with results of the scour development of the front pile fp4 in group a the temporal evolution of the front fp0 pile in group b show strong independency of the gap ratio effect however the scour development of the rear pile fp4 shares the exactly different features at g d 2 the scour development of the rear fp4 pile is very close to the results of the single pile as the gap ratio increases g d 4 a distinct phenomenon is observed the scour depth at the upstream corner increases sharply as the scour initials and then drops to a very low values at around t 1 4 h following with the dramatical increase till the equilibrium state is reached as g d further increases to 6 the observation still exists with a late timing at t 1 9 h with the gap ratio increases to g d 8 the trend still can be captured but with smaller reductions from the initial scour even at g d 10 the trend still can be found at around t 4 5 h comparing with the scour depth of the single pile results of the rear fp4 pile shows dramatical reductions with increase of the gap ratio the difference of the results of single pile and the rear fp4 pile decreases from the minimum value of 9 at g d 2 to the maximum value of 294 at g d 8 as g d 8 the value increases slightly back during the tests performed the corresponding observation is that the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile extends dramatically as the scour initials and then at a certain instant a backfill is found at the scour hole of the rear pile it is observed that after the scour initials the co existence of the suspended load and bed load leads the water very murky large volume of the sediment eroded from the front fp0 pile deposited in the wake with variations of the gap ratio the depositing location is exactly the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile where the backfill occurs with the test continuing the volume of the depositing suspended sediments reduced significantly and then the scour hole re extends till the equilibrium state is reached it should be noted that during the tests a few cases were stopped before the equilibrium state was reached as opposed to a direct observation the fitted equilibrium scour depth can be regarded as an approximation this approximation will be reliable provided that the experiments were run close to the equilibrium state and the development of the scour is self similar and well approximated by the fitted mathematical expression which appears to be true as discussed in the next section baker 1979 and baker 1980 concluded that as the incoming flow is impinged on the vertical pile on the ersosion seabed the adverse pressure gradient is produced in the vicinity and leads to the boundary layer separation around the pile surface the separated boundary layers roll up towards the downstream to form a horseshoe vortex the main vortex rotating in the junction futher results in the streamline contraction at two sides and vortex shedding in the wake region the flow velocity acceleration is observed to be induced by the streamline contraction and the momentum transfer at the junction of the pile surface and the seabed boundary for a cylinder with a square cross section the momentum transfer with the pile surface contributes to the development of the vertical velocity profile and strong turbulence at the junction as indicated by yang et al 2021 the existence of the structure porosity diverted the fluid impinged on the structure for two paths which are the flow through the structure and flow across the structure this mecanims leads to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and further results in the reduction of the scour depth the pile with large porosity can be regarded as the object with the weak sediment transport which futher results in the minimized dimensions of the scour hole and the sand deposits landing in the wake in the present work it is apparent that the results of group a and group b represent two different scenarios for the influence of the gap ratio on the local scour around the tandem cylinders it can be concluded that due to the influence of the structure porosity the behaviors of the interefence of horsehoe vortex and lee wake vortex for the tandem pile group configuration would be largely influenced in group a the porosity of the front fp4 pile is significantly larger than the counterpart of the rear fp0 pile corresponding to the fact that the sediment transport for the rear pile is much stronger at this scenario the erosion at the junction of the rear fp0 pile is believed to be stronger than deposits from the upstream of the front fp4 pile the intereferce effect of the horseshoe vortex and the vortex shedding in the lee wake leads to a smaller scour depth at smaller gap ratio and as the inference effect is weakening the scour depth of the rear fp0 pile increases monotonically with the increase of the gap ratio as for group b the structure porosity of the front fp0 pile is smaller than the porosity of the rear fp4 pile the sediment transport of the rear fp4 pile is much weaker during the process that the sediment is eroded from the junction of the rear pile the suspended sediments from the upstream of the front pile are continuously depositing this is the reason that the backfill of the sediment to the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile is observed as shown in fig 6 the presence of the backfill would lead the diminished scour hole of the rear pile 5 2 time scale many researchers focused on the prediction of the development of local scour around a vertical pile through empirical functions melville and sutherland 1988 whitehouse 1998 sumer and fredsoe 2002 sumer and fredsoe 2002 introduced an exponential function eq 3 to describe the development of the scour depth 3 s t s 0 1 e x p t t where s is the scour depth s 0 is the equilibrium scour depth t is the time and t is defined as the time scale of scour whitehouse 1998 employed a modified exponential term of eq 3 with an exponential factor of i 4 s t s 0 1 e x p t t i briaud et al 1999 proposed a hyperbolic function 5 s t s 0 t t t 0 in which t 0 is the non dimensional time scale as sumer and fredsoe 2002 whitehouse 1998 and briaud et al 1999 dervied a series of equations to predict the development of the local scour aound the vertical pile as show in eq 9 11 fig 7 shows the comparision of the curve fittings to measured temporal evolution of the scour depth it can be seen that the exponential equation eq 5 with modified form by whitehouse 1998 matches better with the dotted data for the front fp4 pile of group a and the front fp0 pile of group b the rear fp0 pile of group a also shows good agreement as for the rear fp4 pile of group b due to the existence of sediment backfill as discussed in fig 6 the curve doesn t follow the exponential or hyperbolic fittings the fittings in fig 7 d are fitted through the stable part of the temporal evolution through eq 3 5 which is regarded as less affected by the backfill the curve fitting shows eq 4 of whitehouse 1998 fits better with the present data shown the square of correlation coefficient r 2 of the fitted curves from eq 3 5 is shown in table 3 as generally larger values the summary of r 2 for eq 4 shows reasonable application in the present work on the other hand the equilibrium scour depths fitted from the exponential equations eq 5 with modified form are more conservative than the exponential equations eq 4 and hyperbolic equations eq 5 therefore exponential equation eq 4 is applied to the predictions of the equilibrium scour depth and time scale in the present work it should be noted that the development of the scour is self similar and well approximated by the modified exponential eq 10 some cases in the present work stopped before the equilibrium state achieved and the fitted equilibrium scour depth can be regarded as the reliable approximation rather than the direct observations the summary of the equilibrium scour depth for all cases is presented in table 4 which will be discussed in detailed in the following sections fig 8 presents the non dimensional time scale t for tandem porous piles and the trend lines have been draw approximating the data for the front piles of group a and group b the time scale t has no obvious correlation with the gap ratio which is corresponding that the rear pile has very limited impact on front as disused in figs 5 and 6 as for the rear pile both the time scale t are observed to decline with the increase of the gap ratio it is suspected that horseshoe vortex is heading stronger resulting in a large sediment transport rate and a smaller time scale both melville and chiew 1999 and yao et al 2018 present an increasing time scale t as the influence of the horseshoe vortex is weakened which can be reasonable supports for the observation as yao an et al 2018 demonstrated that the time scale t is proportional to the equilibrium scour depth this indicates a larger scour holes require longer to extend and the scour depth is inversely proportional to the local transport rate which means as the local transport rate increases scour happens more quickly as shown in eq 6 6 g s 1 d 50 3 1 2 d 2 t 0 t s 0 2 d 2 1 œÜ l in which œÜ l is the dimensionless local transport rate it can be seen that in eq 7 7 t 2 t s 0 d 2 1 œÜ l removing the influence of the equilibrium scour depth in the time scale t the non dimensional time scale t 2 drops with the increase of the gap ratio corresponding to the increase of the local transport rate for the two rear piles as shown in fig 9 this can be attributed the reason that the rear pile gradually behaves like the single state as the further increase of the gap ratio as g d increases from 2 to 12 t 2 increases more than 12 times the value which is corresponding to less than 1 12 of the local transport rate 5 3 scour profiles fig 10 presents the three dimensional scour profiles at the final stage of the scouring process for group a with difference gap ratios it should be noted that variations of z direction represent the variations of the sand level during the test as z 0 this corresponds to the seabed level without scour or accumulations as z 0 this means the depth is lower than the initial seabed level which corresponds to the occurrence of the scour and as z 0 this means the sediment accumulate themselves at the certain locations which corresponds to the sand accumulation or pile up the descriptions were frequently used by many previous researchers at the smallest gap ratio of g d 2 the maximum scour depth is observed located at the upstream of the front fp4 pile the radius of the scour hole is around 290 to 290 mm in x direction a slight two leg scour trace is found at the wake of the rear fp0 pile which is results of the vortex street for the front and rear piles a large sand deposit is formed in the wake region which is directly from the suspended sediments washed from the upstream the height of the sand deposit is up to around 140 mm and the location is at around 1000 mm to the center of the front fp4 pile the scour hole of the rear fp0 pile still exists but with very small range of around 200 to 200 mm near the pile surface fig 10 a shows that global scour seems to be not obvious for both the front and rear piles at g d 2 different from the observations of the global scour for solid piles as indicated by sumer and fredsoe 2002 the local scour in the upstream is observed for the rear fp0 pile at g d 2 with increase of the gap ratio to g d 4 the scour hole of the rear fp0 pile is expanding quickly the scour depth is found to be larger in the upstream the radius of scour hole for the rear pile is around 100 to 100 mm in x direction whilst the counterpart of the front fp4 pile has almost no change comparing the results of fig 10 b for g d 2 the two leg scour traces can be observed for both front and rear piles but the sand deposits still collapse together with slightly far location at around 1200 mm and the lower height of around 130 mm this observation indicates the shielding effect is weakening with increase of the gap ratio with further increase of the gap ratio of g d 6 in fig 10 c the above observations are strengthened the radius of the rear fp0 pile is further widened from around 230 to 230 mm in x direction the sand deposit is moved far downstream at the location of 1500 mm to the center of the front pile center with the smaller height of around 120 mm a small accumulation of the sediment is found in the middle of both piles with a height of around 30 mm it is believed that this small accumulation in the middle is from by the deposit of eroded sediments from the front fp4 pile and the large sand deposit in the wake is combination results of the sediment transporting from both the front and rear piles as the gap ratio further increases to g d 8 the accumulation in the middle of the front and rear piles is further increased with a height of up to 100 mm with further increase of the gap ratio to g d 8 this accumulation grows fast corresponding to the sand deposit formed by the erosion from the front pile the scour hole extends larger radius of around 280 to 280 mm which is almost similar with the results of the front fp4 pile this indicates the presence of the horseshoe vortex in the rear pile play the key role on the local scour however due to the large sand deposit formed exactly at the upstream of the rear pile from the front fp4 pile it is expected that the more sediment needs to be eroded from the upstream by the horseshoe vortex which is the reason that the scour depth of the rear fp0 pile is smaller than its counterpart of the single fp0 pile fig 11 summarizes the y z cross section of the three dimensional scour profiles to illustrate scour features for group a in fig 11 the maximum scour depth is observed to located at the upstream of the front fp4 pile with the slope angles ranging from 30 to 32 which is very similar to the internal friction angle based on the sediment features this corresponds to the equilibrium state in the final stage of the front pile the sand deposit in the wake region is pushed further downstream as the gap ratio increases with slight reductions of the height in the middle of the front and rear piles the sediments are observed to be accumulated with increase of the gap ratio it is apparent that the suspended sediments from the front pile locate in the middle and accumulate to form a large pile up due to this observation and the weakening of the horseshoe vortex on the rear pile the scour hole of the rear fp0 pile is minimized at g d 4 the back scour hole is observed to initial at g d 8 and this ascribed to the presence of the horseshoe vortex and contraction streamlines in the wake regarding the results of group a in figs 10 and 11 it is clear that as the porosity of the front pile is larger than the counterpart of the rear pile the sediment transport and erosion ability for the front pile is weak due to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex by the porosity together with weakening feature of the sediment deposit at this scenario the erosion of the rear pile is believed to be stronger than the deposit this results in the facts that the global scour for both front and rear piles is hard to capture even at g d 2 the local scour of the rear pile is growing fast to form a large scour hole as well as the sand deposit in the wake the accumulation in the middle is also expected to be weak as shown in fig 11 fig 12 shows the distinct features of the three dimensional scour profiles for group b the maximum scour depth is observed located in the upstream of the front fp0 pile the radius of the scour hole and the scour depth seems to keep almost constant with variations of gap ratios implying the independency of the gap ratio for the front pile comparing with the smaller scour hole of the front fp4 pile in group a the observation shows the strong sediment transport for the front fp0 pile in group b at g d 2 the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile is observed to merge with the counterpart of the front fp0 pile it is quite hard to distinguish the boundaries of the two scour holes which can be treated as the global scour two leg scour traces are observed in the wake of the rear pile the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile can be recognized at g d 4 with a smaller radius and scour depth and keeps at the small dimensions as the gap ratio increases this indicates that the weak sediment transport of the rear fp4 pile induced by the porosity effect the structure porosity on the surface of fp4 pile is believed to weaken the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and further leads to a weak erosion the sand deposit in the wake is quite similar to the counterpart of group a which is reduced sharply as the gap ratio increases along with the increased location to the center of the front pile the dimension is decreased dramatically as the more suspended sediments eroded from the front pile are located in the middle of two plies and the small sand deposit in the wake is largely from the erosion of the rear fp4 pile as shown in fig 12 e the accumulation in the middle of the front and rear pile is first captured at g d 6 in fig 12 c and increases dramatically in dimensions with further increase of the gap ratio the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile can be identified locating on the foundation of the accumulation as g d 10 the dimensions of the accumulation don t increase and keep almost constant with the observation that the scour hole of rear fp4 pile is completely formed in the wake region fig 13 shows the cross views of y z direction with slope angles similar with the results of group a the maximum scour depth always occurs in the upstream of the front pile with the slope angles ranging from 32 to 35 the values near the internal friction angle correspond to the equilibrium state achieved for the front pile implying the fact that the local scour of the front pile is independent of the gap ratio effect the sand deposits in the wake region are further pushed toward the downstream with increase of the gap ratios the height is also observed to be reduced in the middle of the front and rear piles the accumulation cannot be seen at g d 4 which indicates the suspended sediment from the front pile is mainly deposited in the wake rather in the middle with increase of the gap ratio to g d 6 the accumulation in the middle starts to formed with the slope angle of 32 35 the large volume of the sediment deposited from the front pile is just located at the upstream of the rear fp0 pile and leads to the smaller scour depth the scour hole is observed to be always above the seabed level even at g d 12 implying the strong influence of the deposit from the front pile at this scenario the structure porosity of the front pile is smaller than it of the rear pile this indicates that the sediment transport of the rear pile is weaker with a weak horseshoe vortex by the large porosity as demonstrated by yang et al 2021 and dhi snamprogetti 1992 for the tandem pile as the gap ratio g d g is the gap length between the front and rear pile d is the width of the pile which is the length between the two pile g d 0 15 the two piles act as a single body with only one vortex street in the wake as g d 3 a binary vortex street is formed in the vortex street behind the downstream pile it is observed that each vortex consisted of two vortices one is formed behind the upstream pile and the other is behind the downstream pile for the mechanism of horseshoe vortex in the upstream the horseshoe vortex of the rear pile is reported to exist at g d 3 and the size and strength are relatively small due to the shielding effect of the front pile and for the horseshoe vortex in the front pile it is observed a slightly influence different from the tandem of the solid piles the erosion for the rear fp4 pile is expected to be smaller than the sediment deposit from the upstream of the front fp0 pile this mechanism leads to the observation in figs 12 and 13 that the global scour for both piles is at g d 2 the scour hole of the rear pile is much diminished with an increase of the gap ratio in the range of g d 8 two observations are observed during this scenario which are the erosions and sediment transport of the rear fp4 pile and larger volume of the suspended sediment depositing from the upstream front fp0 piles a trade off between the two observations leads to the formatting of the scour hole of the rear pile as the sediment transport of the rear fp0 pile is much weak the volume of the suspended sediments depositing is larger than the erosion which is the reason of the backfill illustrated in fig 6 as g d 8 the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile gradually moves downstream away from the location of the depositing and the local scour starts to extend and the influence of the sand deposit is gradually less affected the scour features extracted from the three dimensional scour profiles are summarized in the following discussion fig 14 and fig 15 summarized the slope angles for fp0 pile and fp4 pile for group a and group b Œ± u and Œ± d are denoted as the slope angles at the upstream and downstream sides as shown in the schematical drawing of fig 14 for group a Œ± u for rear fp0 pile shows almost constant values at 31 35 which is near the internal friction angle whilst Œ± d increases with increases of the gap ratio indicating the shielding effect is weakening and the horseshoe vortex in front of the rear fp0 pile governs the scour process gradually as for group b Œ± u and Œ± d for the front fp0 pile show independency of the gap ratios this observation can be ascribed to the fact that due to the strong sediment transport the scour hole of the front fp0 pile show minor influence by the rear pile which agrees well with the temporal evolution results in fig 5 for the slope angles of fp4 pile in group a Œ± u shows the independency of the gap ratio which is similar to the counterpart of fp0 pile the increase of Œ± d however increases dramatically with increase of the gap ratio corresponding to the transition from the global scour to the local scour this indicates that though the horseshoe vortex in the upstream of front fp4 pile plays the key role on the scour development during the tests the strong sediment transport of the rear fp0 pile can significantly influence the scour hole at the back of the front fp4 pile in group b the slope angles of Œ± u 32 35 shows the presence of the scour hole around fp4 pile the low value of Œ± u equalling 11 indicates the global scour of both front fp0 and rear fp4 piles where the scour at the back is diminished as shown in fig 13 the increase of Œ± u from 10 at g d 2 28 at g d 10 is corresponding to the trade off between the local scour of fp4 pile and the suspended sediments from the front fp0 pile at g d 12 the scour hole at the back of fp4 pile is first lower the seabed level as shown in fig 13 indicating the shielding effect of the front fp0 pile is suppressed and the horseshoe vortex effect governs the scour process for the rear fp4 pile fig 16 summarized the radius of the scour hole around the front and rear piles for group a and group b respectively the values are referenced by the corresponding radius values of the single pile here are the major findings 1 for group a in fig 16 a the radius of the scour hole of the front fp4 pile is almost independent of the gap ratio the referenced value is around 1 which indicates the local scour of the front fp4 pile is similar to the counterpart of the single pile state on the other hand the radius for the rear fp0 pile increases dramatically with increase of the gap ratio indicating that the shielding effect of the front pile is diminished till the referenced value equals around 0 93 at g d 12 2 similar with the above observations with the front pile in group a the radius of the front fp0 pile in group b keeps almost constant with variations of g d however the radius of the rear fp4 pile shows very interesting phenomenon the referenced value decreases from around 0 9 at g d 2 to the minimum value of 0 55 at g d 6 and then increases sharply till the referenced value achieves at around 0 85 at g d 12 as discussed in figs 12 and 13 the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile is highly depends on the development of the scour hole of the front fp0 pile which is the global scour this is the reason why the referenced value of radius is larger at small gap ratio as the transition from the global scour of both the front and rear piles to the local scour of the front pile occurs the referenced values show a decline at g d 6 3 the minimum referenced value at g d 6 corresponds to the scenario that the weak erosion of the rear fp4 pile in the influence of large volume of suspended sediments transported from the front pile at g d 6 a trade off is observed between small volume of sediments transported from the rear fp4 pile to the further downstream and the large volume of suspended sediments from the front fp0 pile g d 6 is denoted as the critical gap ratio that the transition from global scour the local scour the referenced scour depths for group a and group b are summarized in fig 17 breusers et al 1977 explored that the scour depth of the front pile increased dramatically to around 30 higher than its counterpart of a single pile at g d 2 and then decreases to its single pile value for g d 10 zdravkovich 1987 indicated that the horseshoe vortex of the front pile was strengthened as g d 3 and the horseshoe vortex of the rear pile was destructed as the small value of the pile spacing the influence of the lee wake flow dominates the scour development at this scenario the downstream horseshoe vortex was observed to exist as g d 3 the major findings are very similar to the discussions in fig 16 however the critical gap ratio for the transition is observed at g d 8 for the rear fp4 pile in group b it is not contradictive that the critical value for the referenced radius value is at g d 6 that the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile covers a certain area it was observed that the scour depth of the rear pile was always smaller than its counterpart of the single pile case the scour depth experienced an obvious reduction as g d 3 and kept around 20 smaller than it of the single pile case 6 discussions in the offshore engineering the complex configurations such as the supporting structures comprising of horizonal and vertical beams are usually not the solid surfaces but with structure porosity this implies that for piles with a tandem arrangement the porosity of the front and rear piles has significantly effect on the development of local scour along with the influence of the gap ratio through the observations in the present work three regimes are classified in the influence of the porosity and the gap ratio which are regime i the porosities of the front and rear pile are equal which is p front p rear at this scenario the sediment transport of the front and rear pile is independent of the influence of the porosity and behaves like the solid tandem piles case c9 c13 explored the local scour for the tandem group with p front p rear 26 3 the results are quite similar to the results of local scour around the tandem sold piles reported by breusers et al 1977 and sumer and fredsoe 2002 the global scour for the group is observed at g d 2 and the local scour occurs at g d 10 the dimensions of the scour hole including scour depth and radius increase monotonically with the increase of the gap ratio till the rear pile behaves like singe pile state regime ii the porosity of the front pile is larger than the counterpart of the rear p front p rear as demonstrated by group a the influence of the large porosity weakens the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and the vortex shedding in the lee wake region and further minimizes the sediment transport and depositing of the suspended sediment from the front pile the erosion at the rear pile is expected to be stronger than the deposits this results in the facts that the global scour cannot even recognized at small gap i e g d 2 in the present work the rear pile shows strong single pile features on the development of the local scour regime iii the porosity of the rear pile is larger than the porosity of the front pile p front p rear during this scenario the erosion at the rear pile is significantly weakened due to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex the depositing of sediment from the front pile landed at the vicinity of the rear pile and is significantly larger than the sediment transport of the rear pile this leads to the observations as shown in group b that the global scour for both piles is expected to be at g d 2 the trade off between the erosion and depositing always continues till the rear pile behaves like a single pile state minimum values of dimensions of the scour hole for the rear pile is observed to be happened at g d 6 8 as the gap ratio further increases the scour depth of the rear pile increases monotonically the gap ratio at g d 6 8 based on the minimum values of the scour depth and radius of the scour hole is regarded as a critical gap ratio g d cr which could be important for the scour designing in the application of the offshore engineering case c1 c18 were carried out for the supplementary tests with group a and group b to quantify the influence of the porosity on the local scour around the tandem piles the characteristics of the local scour for case c1 c18 are summarized in table 4 which would not be detailed discussed in the present work due to its similar trends with group a and group b fig 18 presents the summary of the critical gap ratio g d cr with variations of the porosity difference between the front and rear plies p dif p rear p front for both the minimum values of the scour depth and the radius of the scour hole it can be seen that g d cr decreases with the increase of p dif and g d cr 0 indicates that regime iii no longer exists it should be noted that the critical gap ratio g d cr is probably strongly depend on the influence of the flow intensity Œ∏ s Œ∏ c r and the water depth for the flow intensity Œ∏ s Œ∏ c r yao et al 2018 and sumer et al 2001 reported that the scour depth didn t vary monotonically with the flow intensity a local maximum value of the scour depth was observed at Œ∏ s Œ∏ c r 1 which is expected to due to the influence of the upstream sediment transport and the bed ripples with further increase of Œ∏ s Œ∏ c r to around 1 5 the scour depth decreases dramatically and then increases again to a certain level as the critical gap ratio g d cr is largely due to the trade off between the erosion and depositing the influence of the flow intensity would have significant impact on the other hand the influence of the water depth plays key role in the development of the local scour though it is not systematically studied yet melville and sutherland 1988 concluded that the scour depth would be reduced largely at the shallow water whose depth is smaller than 2 6 times of the effectiveness diameter the influence of the flow intensity and water depth could be potential research target in the future study 7 conclusion the local scour around tandem porous pies in steady current has been investigated in the present work experimentally as a simplified by a certain supporting structures of the subsea objects the influence of porosity on the development of the local scour at front and rear piles is quantify with regards to the influence of the gap ratio the structure porosity of the tandem piles is ranging from p 0 38 5 the gap ratio between front and rear piles is in the range of g d 2 12 the temporal evolution of the scour development time scale three dimensional scour profiles as well as the scour characteristics have been systematically studied the following conclusions are summarized as below 1 the existence of the structure porosity leads to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex and further results in the small scour dimensions at the junction of the pile based on this feature three different regimes are identified based on the different scour characteristics in the influence of porosity and gap ratios 2 at regime i p front p rear the sediment transport for the front pile equals to its counterpart of the rear pile the global scour is observed at g d 2 and the scour development for the rear pile behaves like a single pile at g d 10 3 at regime ii with p front p rear the sediment transport for the rear pile is stronger and leads to the global scour cannot even be captured at g d 2 the scour depth of the rear pile increases monotonically with the increase of the gap ratio till the state of the single pile is achieved 4 at regime iii with p front p rear the distinct scour features are found due to the inference effect of the porosity the weak horseshoe vortex of the rear pile leads to the minimized the erosion at the junction whilst the sediment transport of the front pile is relatively stronger the global scour can be recognized at even g d 4 the dimensions of the scour hole for the rear pile decrease first as a trade off is observed between the sediment deposit landed around the rear pile and its weak erosion at a certain gap ratio which is referred as the critical gap ratio g d cr the deposit is significantly larger than the erosion and minimum dimensions of the scour hole around the rear pile is achieved at g d g d cr the scour depth of the rear increases monotonically with the increase of the gap ratio till the single state is presented 5 the critical gap ratio g d cr for the minimum scour depth and radius of the scour hole for the rear pile is expected to be strongly depends on the difference of the porosity of the rear and front piles p dif p rear p front with the increase of p dif g d cr increases credit authorship contribution statement fan yang conceptualization data curation writing original draft writing review

20418,experimental study on the local scour around tandem square porous piles in steady current has been carried out in the live bed flow condition the influence of the porosity p of both front and rear piles in the tandem configuration p 0 38 5 and the gap ratios g d 2 12 are quantified based on the measurement of the development of the local scour time scale three dimensional scour profiles and the scour characteristics were analysed three regimes are identified regarding on the porosity distributions of the front and rear pile the distinct features were found at the porosity of the front was small than its counterpart of the rear the global scour can be recognized at g d 4 the dimensions of the scour hole for the rear pile decrease first as a trade off is observed between the sediment deposit landed around the rear pile and its weak erosion a critical gap ratio at which the minimum scour dimensions were observed is strongly depend on the difference of the porosity between the front and rear piles keywords local scour sediment transport pile porous horseshoe vortex tandem pile 1 introduction as one of the top topics in the coastal and offshore engineering local scour around a vertical pile placed on the erodible seabed attracts substantial interest in the past decades breusers et al 1977 roulund et al 2005 whitehouse et al 2011 melville et al 2015 ahmad et al 2017 karimi et al 2017 sumer and fredsoe 2002 concluded that as the vertical pile is placed on the seabed the following mechanisms that governs the flow structures which are 1 flow deceleration induced by a downflow in the upstream leads to presence of the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile 2 contraction streamlines at two sides 3 vortex shedding in the lee wake of the pile the mechanisms lead to a dramatical increase of the sediment transport resulting in the local scour around pile through the above empirical functions the scour depth around a vertical pile at any time can be predicted for designing and assessment of the bridge piers abutments as well as the subsea structures the key variables in the empirical functions are the equilibrium scour depth s 0 and the time scale of scour t melville and chiew 1999 found that the equilibrium time scale was a function of the flow intensify the flow depth and the sediment coarseness for the clear water scour dey and raikar 2007 applied the acoustic doppler velocimetry adv to analyse the evolution of the turbulent flow characteristics of the horseshoe vortex and observed strong turbulence within the developing scour hole breusers nicollet et al 1977 melville and sutherland 1988 and richardson and davis 1995 summarized a general design method for estimation of the equilibrium scour depth considering multiple factors which are the factors of flow intensity k i flow depth k y influence of sediment size k d sediment gradation k œÉ shape of the cross section k s alignment factor k Œ± the height to diameter ratio k h the pile groups are widely used to support the subsea structures regarding to the practice in the coastal and offshore engineering due to the interference of the flow around the individual pile member the flow structure could be significantly changed and the local scour around pile group may differ largely comparing with the scour around a single pile due to the significance in the practice the local scour of pile groups has been investigated through amounts of researchers on two pile system three pile system and multiple pile system amini and solaimani 2017 karimi et al 2017 yagci et al 2017 yilmaz et al 2017 liu et al 2018 memar et al 2018 qi et al 2019 for the two pile system which is normally applied as the prototype in the offshore engineering there are three kinds of configurations the side by side the tandem and the staggered arrangement zdravkovich 1987 concluded that the interference effect for both the lee wake vortex shedding and the horseshoe vortex in the upstream will strongly depended on the pile group configurations zdravkovich 1997a b reported the lee wake has a slightly larger width due to the increased size of the lee wake vortices this induces a relatively larger adverse pressure gradient and further leads to a larger horseshoe vortex as for the measurement of the local scour around a tandem two pile group breusers et al 1977 concluded that the scour of the front pile increased with increasing g d first g d 2 and then decreased till the scour depth reaches its single pile values at g d 10 the increase can be attributed to the reason that the strengthening of the horseshoe vortex for the scour in the rear pile it is reported that the scour depth is always smaller than the single pile case which can be ascribed to the relatively smaller horseshoe vortex in the rear and the scour depth of the rear pile decreases as g d 3 which is validated by the flow structures that the horseshoe vortex in the downstream pile begins to form arneson zevenbergen et al 2012 and gosselin and sheppard 2014 summarized the prediction of the scour development around the tandem cylinders yilmaz yanmaz et al 2017 explored the local scour around two pile system at the clear water flow condition and found that the shape of the scour hole of the front pile remained almost constant through the experiments and scour depth decreases with the spacing between piles decreases in the range of g d 4 2 liu tang et al 2018 reported that in the clear water flow condition the scour depth in the rear pile shows four regions based on different velocity and spacing memar zounemat kermani et al 2018 summarized the influence of skew angles on the local scour around two pile group it was found that as the increase of the skew angle the influence of the sheltering effects of the front pile is decreased and the scour depth around the rear pile increases qi li et al 2019 however launched a series of experimental investigations on the local scour around two pile group under combine wave and current flow condition for subsea structures in the coastal and offshore engineering complex configurations are always equipped with horizontal and vertical beams inside the structure porosity is one of the key factors that largely influences the flow structures and sediment transport whilst the previous study always applied solid piles as a simplification due to the very limited work conducted before the pioneering work of dhi snamprogetti 1992 defined the structure porosity p by 1 p a p a c r o s s in which a p is the total area of permeable parts in the longitudinal vertical section surface and a c r o s s is the area of the longitudinal vertical section of the cubic caisson porosity p was denoted as the ability that the water passes through the subsea structures yang tang et al 2020 introduced a correcting parameter k p to illustrate the influence of porosity on the equilibrium scour depth and time scale for the local scour around the porous structures barbe cruise et al 1992 concluded that the dominant influence factor of sediment transport is the momentum transfer due to the fluid sediment interactions and two paths was reported as the vertical mixing with fluid and the vertical motion of grains keeping interaction with surrounding fluid the vertical momentum transfers in the upper recirculating cells moves the bed sediment into the upper layer and the movement of sediment particles is not significantly active in the lower layer yang tang et al 2020 indicated that the incoming flow rate is divergent into two different paths which are through inside and outside of the porous structures and the weakening of the momentum transfer through the presence of the structure further weakened the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and this physical mechanism induces the observations that the increase of the porosity leads to a decrease of the scour depth in line with the framework above the investigations on the scouring process of the tandem pile with structure porosity are quite essential based on the widely application of the prototype of the certain subsea structure supports motivated by this goal the present work focuses on quantifying 1 the influence of porosity on the local scour of tandem piles group 2 the interference effect of the lee wake vortex street and horseshoe vortex in the upstream induced by the porosity the major study is to quantify the influence of the gap ratio g d and the porosity p on the development of the scour depth as well as the scour profiles and scour features for designing purpose the remainder of the present work is organized as follows section 2 4 describe the test facility experimental setup and scour measurements section 5 6 then present the main results and discussions for the influence of porosity on the local scour around the tandem square porous piles conclusions are given in section 7 2 test facility the experimental tests in the present work were conducted in the o tube facility at dalian university of technology in china o tube facility can be regarded as an impeller driven fully enclosed circulating water channel the dimension of working section is 20m 1 5m 1 6 m in length width depth in the middle the testing section is with 0 4 m deep sand and 6 0 m in length extending to cover the whole test section as the schematic drawing shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the streamwise direction is defined as y direction which is along the flow direction z direction is referred as the vertical direction and the x direction is defined by the spanwise direction in the present experiments only the steady current condition was carried out the water depth was always kept 1 0 m for all cases a supply area in the upstream with the sand depth of 0 1 m was prepared to provide sand material to the test section the supply area is around 10 m away from the test section and can provide enough sand supply in the test area and this method was also used by zhao et al 2010 3 model setup square porous model piles were made of acrylic material which is also applied in yang et al 2021 the dimension of the mode pile has a width of d 120 mm in square shape cross section and a height of l 1600 mm this leads to a blockage ratio of 8 in the horizontal direction which can be neglected in the following analysis breusers et al 1977 melville and sutherland 1988 kothyari et al 1992 to ensure the stability during the test a base plate with dimensions of 0 4m 0 4 m is installed deeply in the sand bed as shown in fig 2 the structure porosity is realized by applying the porous holes in the front and rear surfaces of the model pile in the x directions a variety of porosity were considered ranging from p 0 to p 38 5 table 1 shows the experiments performed in the present work the tandem arrangement is setup by the two model piles placed in the front and rear sides through variations of gap ratios and the porosity of the front and rear piles the local scour around the tandem two pile group was investigated the measurements on the scour features of a single pile fp0 with p 0 and fp4 with p 26 3 are set as the reference to illustrate the influence of the gap ration on the tandem piles group a consists of a series of tests with fp4 in the front and fp0 in the rear whilst group b turns this around it should be noted that the major aim of the current investigation is to quantify the influence of the porosity of the front and rear piles on the local scour together with the influence of the gap ratio group a and group b are set as two boundary cases with p front 26 3 p rear 0 and p front 0 p rear 26 3 correspondingly group c were carried out as the supplementary tests with the porosity ranging from p 0 38 5 the following discussions focuses on the results of group a and group b whilst group c will be briefly discussed to support the findings due to the very similar observation observed the information of sediment used in the present experiments are summarized in table 2 the non cohesive uniform silica was used with the median particle size of d 50 0 378 mm and the geometric standard deviation of d 84 d 50 1 18 and the specific gravity s of 2 67 in the present work the steady current was generated at u 0 38 m s corresponding to Œ∏ s Œ∏ cr 1 28 of live bed flow conditions the detailed calculation of the shields number can be referred in yang et al 2021 4 measurement setup velocity profiles across the water depth in the vertical direction were measured at the location where the model pipe was set without the presence of the model pile a nortek vectrino acoustic doppler velocimetry adv was applied with sampling frequency of 20 hz and sampling time of 180s for each sampling point it should be noted the measurement of the velocity was ongoing after 10 min of generating flow to avoid disturbances from the pump which is similar to the measurement setup in zhao et al 2012 the distributions of velocity profile across the water depth are shown in fig 3 a the results of uniformity test were shown in fig 3 b through applying measurements of the velocity profiles at two locations along the transverse direction it can be seen from fig 3 b that the good uniformity of the velocity is achieved in the transverse direction in the present work as a key parameter indicating the quality of the data the snr correlation of the signal is always monitoring during the test it was found that the 35 points in the middle range normally have correlation values higher than 95 and the correlation values drop with the increase of the distance to the probe for the other 10 points in the analysis the samples with correlation lower than 95 were removed a fitted curve according to the measured velocities below z 0 32 m was also plotted in fig 3 the fitted curve follows the logarithmic law as follows 2 u z u f t Œ∫ ln z z 0 t where u f t is the friction velocity associated with the total shear stress z 0 t is the total roughness the total shear stress is the shear stress due to the combined effect of skin friction and friction due to bedforms such as bed ripples soulsby 1997 according to the fitted curve the velocity generated by the steady current is u 0 38 m s the boundary layer thickness is around 0 32 m through the velocity profile in this study the durations of the scour tests were set in the range of 6 h 8 h at each test performed a adv was always set in the upstream to measure the freestream velocity the location is 1 5 m away from the model location in the upstream and 50 mm above the sand bed out of the seabed boundary layer an ultrasound doppler velocimetry udv probes were adopted on the single pile to record the development of the scour depth at the upstream corner where the maximum scour depth is expected to be located the schematic drawing of the udv setup is shown in fig 4 udv can transmit and receive the reflected ultrasonic waves and usually the position with the strongest reflected signal is exactly on the sand surface therefore the development of the scour depth can be inferred from the change of the sand surface the sampling rate on the recording depth variations is set us 20hz which proves to be effectively and accurate range as indicated by yang et al 2018 a three dimensional infrared scour scanner was applied to capture the three dimensional scour features covering a range of 2 m 2 m with resolution of 1 mm the similar setup has been used by yao et al 2018 and zhao et al 2010 the general procedure for experiments performed was as follows i install the model pile steadily in the test section of the o tube ii level the sand bed iii fill water into the o tube and slow down the filling speed to avoid any disturbances to the sand surface iv after starting to record data through adv udv and video run the pump of o tube until the equilibrium stage of local scour is reached v ramp down the pump and drain the water out of the o tube vi scan the final scour profile with a 3d laser scanner 5 results 5 1 development of local scour the influence of the porosity on the local scour of the single vertical pile has been investigated systematically by yang et al 2021 the existence of the porosity on the structures leads to the flow imping on the front surface of the pile diverted from paths of the inside and outside of the pile the flow structures lead to a weak adverse pressure gradient and horseshoe vortex and this mechanism leads to a weak sediment transport and a small scour depth around the porous pile the temporal evolution of developments of the scour depth at the upstream corners of the front and rear piles are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 for group a and group b respectively it should be noted that the developments of the single state of front and rear piles are measured in the same flow conditions as references in fig 5 for group a as the pile of fp4 with p 26 3 is at the front its corresponding scour developments share very similar results of the counterpart of the single pile of fp4 with slightly smaller value this phenomenon can be observed from g d 2 to g d 12 which indicates the independency of the gap ratio g d for the front pile this also coincides with sumer and fredsoe 2002 s work that the solid front pile is almost independent of the gap ratio and the slight reduction of the values implies the small blockage of the rear pile however as shown in fig 5 the development of the scour of fp0 pile with p 0 is significantly smaller than the results of the single fp0 pile even at the largest gap ratio of g d 12 in the present study the scour of fp0 pile with p 0 is still lower than the counterpart of the single fp0 pile the differences decrease dramatically from 160 at g d 2 28 at g d 12 it is ascribed to that the shielding effect of the front pile of fp4 weakens the horseshoe vortex of the rear pile of fp0 which leads to a smaller scour depth as shown in fig 5 sumer and fredsoe 2002 and zdravkovich 1997a b supposed that the horseshoe vortex could be destructed at g d 3 in the present work development of the scour at fp0 pile however shows that the influence of horseshoe vortex is weak but still exists and governs the sediment transport in the front as reported by breusers et al 1977 the scour of the rear pile is heading to the scour of the single pile at g d 10 however the scour of the rear pile still significantly lower at g d 12 the observation probably attributed to the fact the due to the existence of the porosity on the front pile of fp4 the binary vortex street is further weakened with two weakened vortices and this leads to a higher sand deposit located in the middle of the front and rear piles which results in smaller scour depth of the rear pile fp0 comparing with the result of the single fp0 pile as shown in fig 6 for the development of the local scour at the upstream corner for group b the time histories show the distinct characteristics comparing with results of group a similar with results of the scour development of the front pile fp4 in group a the temporal evolution of the front fp0 pile in group b show strong independency of the gap ratio effect however the scour development of the rear pile fp4 shares the exactly different features at g d 2 the scour development of the rear fp4 pile is very close to the results of the single pile as the gap ratio increases g d 4 a distinct phenomenon is observed the scour depth at the upstream corner increases sharply as the scour initials and then drops to a very low values at around t 1 4 h following with the dramatical increase till the equilibrium state is reached as g d further increases to 6 the observation still exists with a late timing at t 1 9 h with the gap ratio increases to g d 8 the trend still can be captured but with smaller reductions from the initial scour even at g d 10 the trend still can be found at around t 4 5 h comparing with the scour depth of the single pile results of the rear fp4 pile shows dramatical reductions with increase of the gap ratio the difference of the results of single pile and the rear fp4 pile decreases from the minimum value of 9 at g d 2 to the maximum value of 294 at g d 8 as g d 8 the value increases slightly back during the tests performed the corresponding observation is that the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile extends dramatically as the scour initials and then at a certain instant a backfill is found at the scour hole of the rear pile it is observed that after the scour initials the co existence of the suspended load and bed load leads the water very murky large volume of the sediment eroded from the front fp0 pile deposited in the wake with variations of the gap ratio the depositing location is exactly the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile where the backfill occurs with the test continuing the volume of the depositing suspended sediments reduced significantly and then the scour hole re extends till the equilibrium state is reached it should be noted that during the tests a few cases were stopped before the equilibrium state was reached as opposed to a direct observation the fitted equilibrium scour depth can be regarded as an approximation this approximation will be reliable provided that the experiments were run close to the equilibrium state and the development of the scour is self similar and well approximated by the fitted mathematical expression which appears to be true as discussed in the next section baker 1979 and baker 1980 concluded that as the incoming flow is impinged on the vertical pile on the ersosion seabed the adverse pressure gradient is produced in the vicinity and leads to the boundary layer separation around the pile surface the separated boundary layers roll up towards the downstream to form a horseshoe vortex the main vortex rotating in the junction futher results in the streamline contraction at two sides and vortex shedding in the wake region the flow velocity acceleration is observed to be induced by the streamline contraction and the momentum transfer at the junction of the pile surface and the seabed boundary for a cylinder with a square cross section the momentum transfer with the pile surface contributes to the development of the vertical velocity profile and strong turbulence at the junction as indicated by yang et al 2021 the existence of the structure porosity diverted the fluid impinged on the structure for two paths which are the flow through the structure and flow across the structure this mecanims leads to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and further results in the reduction of the scour depth the pile with large porosity can be regarded as the object with the weak sediment transport which futher results in the minimized dimensions of the scour hole and the sand deposits landing in the wake in the present work it is apparent that the results of group a and group b represent two different scenarios for the influence of the gap ratio on the local scour around the tandem cylinders it can be concluded that due to the influence of the structure porosity the behaviors of the interefence of horsehoe vortex and lee wake vortex for the tandem pile group configuration would be largely influenced in group a the porosity of the front fp4 pile is significantly larger than the counterpart of the rear fp0 pile corresponding to the fact that the sediment transport for the rear pile is much stronger at this scenario the erosion at the junction of the rear fp0 pile is believed to be stronger than deposits from the upstream of the front fp4 pile the intereferce effect of the horseshoe vortex and the vortex shedding in the lee wake leads to a smaller scour depth at smaller gap ratio and as the inference effect is weakening the scour depth of the rear fp0 pile increases monotonically with the increase of the gap ratio as for group b the structure porosity of the front fp0 pile is smaller than the porosity of the rear fp4 pile the sediment transport of the rear fp4 pile is much weaker during the process that the sediment is eroded from the junction of the rear pile the suspended sediments from the upstream of the front pile are continuously depositing this is the reason that the backfill of the sediment to the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile is observed as shown in fig 6 the presence of the backfill would lead the diminished scour hole of the rear pile 5 2 time scale many researchers focused on the prediction of the development of local scour around a vertical pile through empirical functions melville and sutherland 1988 whitehouse 1998 sumer and fredsoe 2002 sumer and fredsoe 2002 introduced an exponential function eq 3 to describe the development of the scour depth 3 s t s 0 1 e x p t t where s is the scour depth s 0 is the equilibrium scour depth t is the time and t is defined as the time scale of scour whitehouse 1998 employed a modified exponential term of eq 3 with an exponential factor of i 4 s t s 0 1 e x p t t i briaud et al 1999 proposed a hyperbolic function 5 s t s 0 t t t 0 in which t 0 is the non dimensional time scale as sumer and fredsoe 2002 whitehouse 1998 and briaud et al 1999 dervied a series of equations to predict the development of the local scour aound the vertical pile as show in eq 9 11 fig 7 shows the comparision of the curve fittings to measured temporal evolution of the scour depth it can be seen that the exponential equation eq 5 with modified form by whitehouse 1998 matches better with the dotted data for the front fp4 pile of group a and the front fp0 pile of group b the rear fp0 pile of group a also shows good agreement as for the rear fp4 pile of group b due to the existence of sediment backfill as discussed in fig 6 the curve doesn t follow the exponential or hyperbolic fittings the fittings in fig 7 d are fitted through the stable part of the temporal evolution through eq 3 5 which is regarded as less affected by the backfill the curve fitting shows eq 4 of whitehouse 1998 fits better with the present data shown the square of correlation coefficient r 2 of the fitted curves from eq 3 5 is shown in table 3 as generally larger values the summary of r 2 for eq 4 shows reasonable application in the present work on the other hand the equilibrium scour depths fitted from the exponential equations eq 5 with modified form are more conservative than the exponential equations eq 4 and hyperbolic equations eq 5 therefore exponential equation eq 4 is applied to the predictions of the equilibrium scour depth and time scale in the present work it should be noted that the development of the scour is self similar and well approximated by the modified exponential eq 10 some cases in the present work stopped before the equilibrium state achieved and the fitted equilibrium scour depth can be regarded as the reliable approximation rather than the direct observations the summary of the equilibrium scour depth for all cases is presented in table 4 which will be discussed in detailed in the following sections fig 8 presents the non dimensional time scale t for tandem porous piles and the trend lines have been draw approximating the data for the front piles of group a and group b the time scale t has no obvious correlation with the gap ratio which is corresponding that the rear pile has very limited impact on front as disused in figs 5 and 6 as for the rear pile both the time scale t are observed to decline with the increase of the gap ratio it is suspected that horseshoe vortex is heading stronger resulting in a large sediment transport rate and a smaller time scale both melville and chiew 1999 and yao et al 2018 present an increasing time scale t as the influence of the horseshoe vortex is weakened which can be reasonable supports for the observation as yao an et al 2018 demonstrated that the time scale t is proportional to the equilibrium scour depth this indicates a larger scour holes require longer to extend and the scour depth is inversely proportional to the local transport rate which means as the local transport rate increases scour happens more quickly as shown in eq 6 6 g s 1 d 50 3 1 2 d 2 t 0 t s 0 2 d 2 1 œÜ l in which œÜ l is the dimensionless local transport rate it can be seen that in eq 7 7 t 2 t s 0 d 2 1 œÜ l removing the influence of the equilibrium scour depth in the time scale t the non dimensional time scale t 2 drops with the increase of the gap ratio corresponding to the increase of the local transport rate for the two rear piles as shown in fig 9 this can be attributed the reason that the rear pile gradually behaves like the single state as the further increase of the gap ratio as g d increases from 2 to 12 t 2 increases more than 12 times the value which is corresponding to less than 1 12 of the local transport rate 5 3 scour profiles fig 10 presents the three dimensional scour profiles at the final stage of the scouring process for group a with difference gap ratios it should be noted that variations of z direction represent the variations of the sand level during the test as z 0 this corresponds to the seabed level without scour or accumulations as z 0 this means the depth is lower than the initial seabed level which corresponds to the occurrence of the scour and as z 0 this means the sediment accumulate themselves at the certain locations which corresponds to the sand accumulation or pile up the descriptions were frequently used by many previous researchers at the smallest gap ratio of g d 2 the maximum scour depth is observed located at the upstream of the front fp4 pile the radius of the scour hole is around 290 to 290 mm in x direction a slight two leg scour trace is found at the wake of the rear fp0 pile which is results of the vortex street for the front and rear piles a large sand deposit is formed in the wake region which is directly from the suspended sediments washed from the upstream the height of the sand deposit is up to around 140 mm and the location is at around 1000 mm to the center of the front fp4 pile the scour hole of the rear fp0 pile still exists but with very small range of around 200 to 200 mm near the pile surface fig 10 a shows that global scour seems to be not obvious for both the front and rear piles at g d 2 different from the observations of the global scour for solid piles as indicated by sumer and fredsoe 2002 the local scour in the upstream is observed for the rear fp0 pile at g d 2 with increase of the gap ratio to g d 4 the scour hole of the rear fp0 pile is expanding quickly the scour depth is found to be larger in the upstream the radius of scour hole for the rear pile is around 100 to 100 mm in x direction whilst the counterpart of the front fp4 pile has almost no change comparing the results of fig 10 b for g d 2 the two leg scour traces can be observed for both front and rear piles but the sand deposits still collapse together with slightly far location at around 1200 mm and the lower height of around 130 mm this observation indicates the shielding effect is weakening with increase of the gap ratio with further increase of the gap ratio of g d 6 in fig 10 c the above observations are strengthened the radius of the rear fp0 pile is further widened from around 230 to 230 mm in x direction the sand deposit is moved far downstream at the location of 1500 mm to the center of the front pile center with the smaller height of around 120 mm a small accumulation of the sediment is found in the middle of both piles with a height of around 30 mm it is believed that this small accumulation in the middle is from by the deposit of eroded sediments from the front fp4 pile and the large sand deposit in the wake is combination results of the sediment transporting from both the front and rear piles as the gap ratio further increases to g d 8 the accumulation in the middle of the front and rear piles is further increased with a height of up to 100 mm with further increase of the gap ratio to g d 8 this accumulation grows fast corresponding to the sand deposit formed by the erosion from the front pile the scour hole extends larger radius of around 280 to 280 mm which is almost similar with the results of the front fp4 pile this indicates the presence of the horseshoe vortex in the rear pile play the key role on the local scour however due to the large sand deposit formed exactly at the upstream of the rear pile from the front fp4 pile it is expected that the more sediment needs to be eroded from the upstream by the horseshoe vortex which is the reason that the scour depth of the rear fp0 pile is smaller than its counterpart of the single fp0 pile fig 11 summarizes the y z cross section of the three dimensional scour profiles to illustrate scour features for group a in fig 11 the maximum scour depth is observed to located at the upstream of the front fp4 pile with the slope angles ranging from 30 to 32 which is very similar to the internal friction angle based on the sediment features this corresponds to the equilibrium state in the final stage of the front pile the sand deposit in the wake region is pushed further downstream as the gap ratio increases with slight reductions of the height in the middle of the front and rear piles the sediments are observed to be accumulated with increase of the gap ratio it is apparent that the suspended sediments from the front pile locate in the middle and accumulate to form a large pile up due to this observation and the weakening of the horseshoe vortex on the rear pile the scour hole of the rear fp0 pile is minimized at g d 4 the back scour hole is observed to initial at g d 8 and this ascribed to the presence of the horseshoe vortex and contraction streamlines in the wake regarding the results of group a in figs 10 and 11 it is clear that as the porosity of the front pile is larger than the counterpart of the rear pile the sediment transport and erosion ability for the front pile is weak due to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex by the porosity together with weakening feature of the sediment deposit at this scenario the erosion of the rear pile is believed to be stronger than the deposit this results in the facts that the global scour for both front and rear piles is hard to capture even at g d 2 the local scour of the rear pile is growing fast to form a large scour hole as well as the sand deposit in the wake the accumulation in the middle is also expected to be weak as shown in fig 11 fig 12 shows the distinct features of the three dimensional scour profiles for group b the maximum scour depth is observed located in the upstream of the front fp0 pile the radius of the scour hole and the scour depth seems to keep almost constant with variations of gap ratios implying the independency of the gap ratio for the front pile comparing with the smaller scour hole of the front fp4 pile in group a the observation shows the strong sediment transport for the front fp0 pile in group b at g d 2 the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile is observed to merge with the counterpart of the front fp0 pile it is quite hard to distinguish the boundaries of the two scour holes which can be treated as the global scour two leg scour traces are observed in the wake of the rear pile the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile can be recognized at g d 4 with a smaller radius and scour depth and keeps at the small dimensions as the gap ratio increases this indicates that the weak sediment transport of the rear fp4 pile induced by the porosity effect the structure porosity on the surface of fp4 pile is believed to weaken the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and further leads to a weak erosion the sand deposit in the wake is quite similar to the counterpart of group a which is reduced sharply as the gap ratio increases along with the increased location to the center of the front pile the dimension is decreased dramatically as the more suspended sediments eroded from the front pile are located in the middle of two plies and the small sand deposit in the wake is largely from the erosion of the rear fp4 pile as shown in fig 12 e the accumulation in the middle of the front and rear pile is first captured at g d 6 in fig 12 c and increases dramatically in dimensions with further increase of the gap ratio the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile can be identified locating on the foundation of the accumulation as g d 10 the dimensions of the accumulation don t increase and keep almost constant with the observation that the scour hole of rear fp4 pile is completely formed in the wake region fig 13 shows the cross views of y z direction with slope angles similar with the results of group a the maximum scour depth always occurs in the upstream of the front pile with the slope angles ranging from 32 to 35 the values near the internal friction angle correspond to the equilibrium state achieved for the front pile implying the fact that the local scour of the front pile is independent of the gap ratio effect the sand deposits in the wake region are further pushed toward the downstream with increase of the gap ratios the height is also observed to be reduced in the middle of the front and rear piles the accumulation cannot be seen at g d 4 which indicates the suspended sediment from the front pile is mainly deposited in the wake rather in the middle with increase of the gap ratio to g d 6 the accumulation in the middle starts to formed with the slope angle of 32 35 the large volume of the sediment deposited from the front pile is just located at the upstream of the rear fp0 pile and leads to the smaller scour depth the scour hole is observed to be always above the seabed level even at g d 12 implying the strong influence of the deposit from the front pile at this scenario the structure porosity of the front pile is smaller than it of the rear pile this indicates that the sediment transport of the rear pile is weaker with a weak horseshoe vortex by the large porosity as demonstrated by yang et al 2021 and dhi snamprogetti 1992 for the tandem pile as the gap ratio g d g is the gap length between the front and rear pile d is the width of the pile which is the length between the two pile g d 0 15 the two piles act as a single body with only one vortex street in the wake as g d 3 a binary vortex street is formed in the vortex street behind the downstream pile it is observed that each vortex consisted of two vortices one is formed behind the upstream pile and the other is behind the downstream pile for the mechanism of horseshoe vortex in the upstream the horseshoe vortex of the rear pile is reported to exist at g d 3 and the size and strength are relatively small due to the shielding effect of the front pile and for the horseshoe vortex in the front pile it is observed a slightly influence different from the tandem of the solid piles the erosion for the rear fp4 pile is expected to be smaller than the sediment deposit from the upstream of the front fp0 pile this mechanism leads to the observation in figs 12 and 13 that the global scour for both piles is at g d 2 the scour hole of the rear pile is much diminished with an increase of the gap ratio in the range of g d 8 two observations are observed during this scenario which are the erosions and sediment transport of the rear fp4 pile and larger volume of the suspended sediment depositing from the upstream front fp0 piles a trade off between the two observations leads to the formatting of the scour hole of the rear pile as the sediment transport of the rear fp0 pile is much weak the volume of the suspended sediments depositing is larger than the erosion which is the reason of the backfill illustrated in fig 6 as g d 8 the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile gradually moves downstream away from the location of the depositing and the local scour starts to extend and the influence of the sand deposit is gradually less affected the scour features extracted from the three dimensional scour profiles are summarized in the following discussion fig 14 and fig 15 summarized the slope angles for fp0 pile and fp4 pile for group a and group b Œ± u and Œ± d are denoted as the slope angles at the upstream and downstream sides as shown in the schematical drawing of fig 14 for group a Œ± u for rear fp0 pile shows almost constant values at 31 35 which is near the internal friction angle whilst Œ± d increases with increases of the gap ratio indicating the shielding effect is weakening and the horseshoe vortex in front of the rear fp0 pile governs the scour process gradually as for group b Œ± u and Œ± d for the front fp0 pile show independency of the gap ratios this observation can be ascribed to the fact that due to the strong sediment transport the scour hole of the front fp0 pile show minor influence by the rear pile which agrees well with the temporal evolution results in fig 5 for the slope angles of fp4 pile in group a Œ± u shows the independency of the gap ratio which is similar to the counterpart of fp0 pile the increase of Œ± d however increases dramatically with increase of the gap ratio corresponding to the transition from the global scour to the local scour this indicates that though the horseshoe vortex in the upstream of front fp4 pile plays the key role on the scour development during the tests the strong sediment transport of the rear fp0 pile can significantly influence the scour hole at the back of the front fp4 pile in group b the slope angles of Œ± u 32 35 shows the presence of the scour hole around fp4 pile the low value of Œ± u equalling 11 indicates the global scour of both front fp0 and rear fp4 piles where the scour at the back is diminished as shown in fig 13 the increase of Œ± u from 10 at g d 2 28 at g d 10 is corresponding to the trade off between the local scour of fp4 pile and the suspended sediments from the front fp0 pile at g d 12 the scour hole at the back of fp4 pile is first lower the seabed level as shown in fig 13 indicating the shielding effect of the front fp0 pile is suppressed and the horseshoe vortex effect governs the scour process for the rear fp4 pile fig 16 summarized the radius of the scour hole around the front and rear piles for group a and group b respectively the values are referenced by the corresponding radius values of the single pile here are the major findings 1 for group a in fig 16 a the radius of the scour hole of the front fp4 pile is almost independent of the gap ratio the referenced value is around 1 which indicates the local scour of the front fp4 pile is similar to the counterpart of the single pile state on the other hand the radius for the rear fp0 pile increases dramatically with increase of the gap ratio indicating that the shielding effect of the front pile is diminished till the referenced value equals around 0 93 at g d 12 2 similar with the above observations with the front pile in group a the radius of the front fp0 pile in group b keeps almost constant with variations of g d however the radius of the rear fp4 pile shows very interesting phenomenon the referenced value decreases from around 0 9 at g d 2 to the minimum value of 0 55 at g d 6 and then increases sharply till the referenced value achieves at around 0 85 at g d 12 as discussed in figs 12 and 13 the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile is highly depends on the development of the scour hole of the front fp0 pile which is the global scour this is the reason why the referenced value of radius is larger at small gap ratio as the transition from the global scour of both the front and rear piles to the local scour of the front pile occurs the referenced values show a decline at g d 6 3 the minimum referenced value at g d 6 corresponds to the scenario that the weak erosion of the rear fp4 pile in the influence of large volume of suspended sediments transported from the front pile at g d 6 a trade off is observed between small volume of sediments transported from the rear fp4 pile to the further downstream and the large volume of suspended sediments from the front fp0 pile g d 6 is denoted as the critical gap ratio that the transition from global scour the local scour the referenced scour depths for group a and group b are summarized in fig 17 breusers et al 1977 explored that the scour depth of the front pile increased dramatically to around 30 higher than its counterpart of a single pile at g d 2 and then decreases to its single pile value for g d 10 zdravkovich 1987 indicated that the horseshoe vortex of the front pile was strengthened as g d 3 and the horseshoe vortex of the rear pile was destructed as the small value of the pile spacing the influence of the lee wake flow dominates the scour development at this scenario the downstream horseshoe vortex was observed to exist as g d 3 the major findings are very similar to the discussions in fig 16 however the critical gap ratio for the transition is observed at g d 8 for the rear fp4 pile in group b it is not contradictive that the critical value for the referenced radius value is at g d 6 that the scour hole of the rear fp4 pile covers a certain area it was observed that the scour depth of the rear pile was always smaller than its counterpart of the single pile case the scour depth experienced an obvious reduction as g d 3 and kept around 20 smaller than it of the single pile case 6 discussions in the offshore engineering the complex configurations such as the supporting structures comprising of horizonal and vertical beams are usually not the solid surfaces but with structure porosity this implies that for piles with a tandem arrangement the porosity of the front and rear piles has significantly effect on the development of local scour along with the influence of the gap ratio through the observations in the present work three regimes are classified in the influence of the porosity and the gap ratio which are regime i the porosities of the front and rear pile are equal which is p front p rear at this scenario the sediment transport of the front and rear pile is independent of the influence of the porosity and behaves like the solid tandem piles case c9 c13 explored the local scour for the tandem group with p front p rear 26 3 the results are quite similar to the results of local scour around the tandem sold piles reported by breusers et al 1977 and sumer and fredsoe 2002 the global scour for the group is observed at g d 2 and the local scour occurs at g d 10 the dimensions of the scour hole including scour depth and radius increase monotonically with the increase of the gap ratio till the rear pile behaves like singe pile state regime ii the porosity of the front pile is larger than the counterpart of the rear p front p rear as demonstrated by group a the influence of the large porosity weakens the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and the vortex shedding in the lee wake region and further minimizes the sediment transport and depositing of the suspended sediment from the front pile the erosion at the rear pile is expected to be stronger than the deposits this results in the facts that the global scour cannot even recognized at small gap i e g d 2 in the present work the rear pile shows strong single pile features on the development of the local scour regime iii the porosity of the rear pile is larger than the porosity of the front pile p front p rear during this scenario the erosion at the rear pile is significantly weakened due to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex the depositing of sediment from the front pile landed at the vicinity of the rear pile and is significantly larger than the sediment transport of the rear pile this leads to the observations as shown in group b that the global scour for both piles is expected to be at g d 2 the trade off between the erosion and depositing always continues till the rear pile behaves like a single pile state minimum values of dimensions of the scour hole for the rear pile is observed to be happened at g d 6 8 as the gap ratio further increases the scour depth of the rear pile increases monotonically the gap ratio at g d 6 8 based on the minimum values of the scour depth and radius of the scour hole is regarded as a critical gap ratio g d cr which could be important for the scour designing in the application of the offshore engineering case c1 c18 were carried out for the supplementary tests with group a and group b to quantify the influence of the porosity on the local scour around the tandem piles the characteristics of the local scour for case c1 c18 are summarized in table 4 which would not be detailed discussed in the present work due to its similar trends with group a and group b fig 18 presents the summary of the critical gap ratio g d cr with variations of the porosity difference between the front and rear plies p dif p rear p front for both the minimum values of the scour depth and the radius of the scour hole it can be seen that g d cr decreases with the increase of p dif and g d cr 0 indicates that regime iii no longer exists it should be noted that the critical gap ratio g d cr is probably strongly depend on the influence of the flow intensity Œ∏ s Œ∏ c r and the water depth for the flow intensity Œ∏ s Œ∏ c r yao et al 2018 and sumer et al 2001 reported that the scour depth didn t vary monotonically with the flow intensity a local maximum value of the scour depth was observed at Œ∏ s Œ∏ c r 1 which is expected to due to the influence of the upstream sediment transport and the bed ripples with further increase of Œ∏ s Œ∏ c r to around 1 5 the scour depth decreases dramatically and then increases again to a certain level as the critical gap ratio g d cr is largely due to the trade off between the erosion and depositing the influence of the flow intensity would have significant impact on the other hand the influence of the water depth plays key role in the development of the local scour though it is not systematically studied yet melville and sutherland 1988 concluded that the scour depth would be reduced largely at the shallow water whose depth is smaller than 2 6 times of the effectiveness diameter the influence of the flow intensity and water depth could be potential research target in the future study 7 conclusion the local scour around tandem porous pies in steady current has been investigated in the present work experimentally as a simplified by a certain supporting structures of the subsea objects the influence of porosity on the development of the local scour at front and rear piles is quantify with regards to the influence of the gap ratio the structure porosity of the tandem piles is ranging from p 0 38 5 the gap ratio between front and rear piles is in the range of g d 2 12 the temporal evolution of the scour development time scale three dimensional scour profiles as well as the scour characteristics have been systematically studied the following conclusions are summarized as below 1 the existence of the structure porosity leads to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex and further results in the small scour dimensions at the junction of the pile based on this feature three different regimes are identified based on the different scour characteristics in the influence of porosity and gap ratios 2 at regime i p front p rear the sediment transport for the front pile equals to its counterpart of the rear pile the global scour is observed at g d 2 and the scour development for the rear pile behaves like a single pile at g d 10 3 at regime ii with p front p rear the sediment transport for the rear pile is stronger and leads to the global scour cannot even be captured at g d 2 the scour depth of the rear pile increases monotonically with the increase of the gap ratio till the state of the single pile is achieved 4 at regime iii with p front p rear the distinct scour features are found due to the inference effect of the porosity the weak horseshoe vortex of the rear pile leads to the minimized the erosion at the junction whilst the sediment transport of the front pile is relatively stronger the global scour can be recognized at even g d 4 the dimensions of the scour hole for the rear pile decrease first as a trade off is observed between the sediment deposit landed around the rear pile and its weak erosion at a certain gap ratio which is referred as the critical gap ratio g d cr the deposit is significantly larger than the erosion and minimum dimensions of the scour hole around the rear pile is achieved at g d g d cr the scour depth of the rear increases monotonically with the increase of the gap ratio till the single state is presented 5 the critical gap ratio g d cr for the minimum scour depth and radius of the scour hole for the rear pile is expected to be strongly depends on the difference of the porosity of the rear and front piles p dif p rear p front with the increase of p dif g d cr increases credit authorship contribution statement fan yang conceptualization data curation writing original draft writing review

20419,to make up for the lack of study on high speed water jet propulsion pump tip clearances a newly developed water jet pump system close to the critical specific speed nsc has been investigated based on the body of the underwater vehicle and the non uniform flow the pump system with different tip clearance sizes 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 mm is evaluated and validated via numerical simulations preliminary steady simulating results demonstrate that increasing the tip clearance size can reduce the overall performance of the head the efficiency pump thrust and the consuming power following further unsteady simulations we reveal the unsteady dynamic performance induced by the tip clearances related to the similar distribution characteristics of the pressure intensities and the pressure pulsations around the underwater vehicle furthermore the pressure intensity and pressure pulsations in the pump increase with the tip clearance quantitative and comparative analysis of the distribution characteristics indicates that the blade loading and scrapping effect of the shroud are key factors influencing the leakage flow at last the leakage flow s dynamic distributing law under different tip clearances have been clarified keywords underwater vehicle water jet propulsion pump tip clearance operating characteristic 1 introduction due to the high propulsive efficiency low vibration and great maneuverability water jet propulsion pumps are widely adopted in advanced underwater vehicles zou et al 2019 during the operation of the underwater vehicle the surrounding water is sucked in the intake and works with the rotating impeller to generate the thrust the tip clearance is located between the rotating blade and stating casing of the water jet propulsion pump which consequently generates the leakage flow the comprehensive action of the leakage and passage flow results in several adverse effects including the inviscid blockage bodling and sharma 2019 and the efficiency losses wu et al 2011 greatly limiting the pump performances since the tip clearance and the leakage flow are inherent features in the loaded rotor blades of the pump the drawbacks are unavoidable and must be accounted for lu et al 2021 in order to clarify the effects of the tip clearance flow and the corresponding inner flow mechanism as early as the 1990s particle image velocimetry piv measurements started to reveal the flow structure and turbulent flow within the tip leakage vortex for example farrell et al farrell and billet 1994 analyzed the correlation between the vortexes and the cavitation flows and miorini et al 2012 adopted high resolution planar piv measurements to investigate the processes related to the vortexes in a breakthrough study dreyer et al 2014 utilized stereo particle image velocimetry spiv in three planes to investigate the tip clearance flows of a typical naca0009 hydrofoil despite the rapid development of non intrusive measurement techniques wu et al 2012 kim and chun 2007 only a small amount of data is available for the analysis process and the lack of detailed information on the entire flow analysis in the pump is a major obstacle in order to reduce the problems associated with insufficient data and to determine the flow properties several advanced numerical approaches are commonly used alda≈ü et al aldas and yapici 2014 investigated the effects of surface roughness on a water jet propulsion system by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the detailed flow characteristics were provided and analyzed liu et al 2017 implemented cfd to reveal the influence of tip clearance size on the energy performance and flow patterns in pumps and based on this study tan et al 2018 proposed a novel t shape tip clearance to control the tip leakage flow and improve the pump performance zhang et al 2015a 2015b employed the shear stress transport sst k œâ turbulence model to analyze the tip leakage vortex trajectories and cavitation patterns in an axial flow pump moreover using a rans solver on a spiral like structured grid peng et al 2013 evaluated the steady state tip vortex flow of a david taylor model basin dtmb propeller in a study considering the cavitation effect ji et al 2013 investigated the unsteady cavitating turbulent flow around a full scale marine propeller the previous research has revealed the specific details of the tip leakage flow and the corresponding losses have been carefully analyzed however the majority of studies investigate the relatively low specific speeds while flow mechanism analysis with the high speed water jet propulsion pumps is limited the specific speed ns is typically adopted to clarify the pump s operating ranges furthermore as the pump s specific speed is close to the critical specific speed nsc jin et al 2018 the pump performance drops sharply and requires inner flow analysis to reveal the physical principles in addition the models in previous studies generally adopt the isolated impeller zone which ignores the practical non uniform suction flow caused by the entire under water vehicle thus the conclusions obtained from such simplified research require further work to get close to the practical condition cao et al 2017 in order to reveal the practical inner flow characteristics of the pump system installed in moving underwater vehicles this study takes a newly developed water jet pump system with a specific speed close to the critical specific speed nsc as the study object moreover considering the influence of the underwater vehicle s body and non uniform flow a pump system with varying tip clearance sizes 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 mm is investigated and clarified with a validated numerical simulation method the corresponding effects on the underwater vehicle are then evaluated via comparative unsteady analysis 2 the target model fig 1 presents the underwater vehicle installed with the high speed water jet propulsion pump to ensure the comprehensive assessment of the entire underwater vehicle performance the vehicle is placed into the center of a cylindrical simulation domain fig 1 marks the key size information with specific values reported in table 1 the principle components of the underwater vehicle are the underwater vehicle s body and the water jet propulsion pump the water jet propulsion pump contains the rotating impeller static intake passage and static guide vane the impeller has two blades with a height of 0 0275 m the impeller blades are placed input into the casing with a diameter of 0 155 m the manufactured impeller has a tip clearance size of 0 2 mm which is taken as the baseline while three additional tip clearance sizes 0 1 mm 0 4 mm 0 8 mm are selected for analysis thus the tip clearance between the blade tip and casing are set as 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 mm table 1 both the intake passage and guide vane are enclosed in a shrinking casing with five and 6 blades respectively the underwater vehicle is designed with a cruising speed of u d 60 kn the rotating speed of the impeller is n 17 500 r min and under the designed moving speed the corresponding designed mass flow and head are q d 294 kg s and h d 114 m respectively thus the specific speed ns of the impeller can be calculated as follows 1 n s 3 65 n q h 3 4 this yields a specific speed ns equal to 980 which is close to the definition of the critical specific speed nsc the derived specific speed indicates that our research model is an advanced high speed water jet pump with the corresponding results potentially fulfilling the practical needs in engineering 3 numerical approach and its validation 3 1 numerical approach 3 1 1 basic governing equations the cavitation flow into the high speed water jet propulsion pump inevitably occurs during the working process this turbulent type of cavitating fluid can be defined as a uniform mixture flow comprised of water and vapor ji et al 2010 to simulate this flow the basic governing equations for the unsteady reynolds average navier stokes urans approach can be expressed as follows 2 œÅ m t œÅ m u j x j 0 3 œÅ m u i t œÅ m u i u j x j p x i x j Œº m Œº t u i x j u j x i 2 3 u k x k Œ¥ i j where i 1 2 3 j 1 2 3 k 1 2 3 x i x j x k are the cartesian coordinate components u i u j u k denote the velocity components p is the static pressure Œº t Œº m are the turbulent viscosity and mixture dynamic viscosity respectively and œÅ m is the mixture density the mixture dynamic viscosity Œº m and the mixture density œÅ m can be further transformed as 4 œÅ m œÅ v Œ± v œÅ l 1 Œ± v 5 Œº m Œº v Œ± v Œº l 1 Œ± v where subscripts ŒΩ and l are the vapor phase and water phase respectively in order to describe the mass transfer rates between the vapor and liquid in the cavitating flow the corresponding source terms m and m are defined as 6 m f e v a p 3 Œ± n c g 1 Œ± ŒΩ œÅ ŒΩ r b 2 3 m a x p ŒΩ p 0 œÅ l 7 m f c o n d 3 Œ± ŒΩ œÅ ŒΩ r b 2 3 m a x p ŒΩ p

10 4 and r b 10 6 the occurrence of cavitation is accompanied by the thermodynamics and kinetics phase change hence based on the defined source terms m and m the rayleigh plesset equation used to balance the dynamic process relationship is given as 8 œÅ ŒΩ Œ± ŒΩ t x j œÅ ŒΩ Œ± ŒΩ u j m m this cavitation model was initially proposed by schnerr and sauer 2001 and has consequently been adopted into ansys cfx commercial codes the cfx solver has improved the cavitation model increasing its subtility for the unsteady cavitation performance simulation of pump jet systems ji et al 2010 pan et al 2016 3 1 2 turbulence model and additional settings we adopted the urans simulation method for incompressible flows to simulate the performance of the target model due to the existence of reynolds stress the turbulence model has been defined for closed equations for engineering applications the standard k Œµ and sst k œâ models are much more preferred bing et al 2013 lu et al 2018 huang et al 2020 figs 4 and 5 compare these two models indicating that the sst turbulence model is closer to the experimental results and thus it was selected as the turbulence model in this study the simulation process was implemented in the cfx solver as presented in fig 1 the entire simulating zone is the cylindrical domain comprising of the underwater vehicle the corresponding boundary conditions are as follows 1 the cylindrical domain inlet is set as the velocity mode whose specific value is the cruising speed of the underwater vehicle u 2 the cylindrical domain outlet is set as the outlet mode whose specific value is determined by the environment pressure and 3 the cylindrical domain s flank is set as the wall mode the impeller is the only rotating hydraulic component and thus a rotational coordinate system is adopted the multiple reference frames mrf technique is applied to set up the rotating impeller zone whose interfaces between the rotor and the stator are selected as the frozen rotor mode in the steady simulation and the transient rotor stator mode in the unsteady simulation moreover the no slip technique is used to treat the walls in the computational domain while the automatic wall function technique is applied to treat the zones near the walls water at 25 c is set as the flow medium with a dynamic viscosity of 8 899 10 4 kg m s and density of 997 kg m3 the time dependent governing equations are discretized both in space and time using the direct coupling method together with the second order unwind discretization for the convection term the convergence criterion for different stages are described as follows steady simulation convergence criterion of 10 5 time step of 1 90476 10 5 s and maximum iteration step of 20 with a single step convergence of 10 7 simulations were performed on a dell workstation 3 2 validation of the numerical approach in order to verify the feasibility of the numerical approach the pump system comprised of the impeller and vane was taken as the test object as already mentioned the underwater vehicle has a relatively high speed propulsion pump with a design mass flow and speed of q d 294 kg s and n d 17 500 r min respectively after investigating the existing test conditions in the national industrial pump quality supervision and texting center of china it was found out that the preliminary pump s mass flow and rotating speed are too large to be realized in consideration of the practical test conditions and the test cost we decided to use the similarity criterion to transform the original operating conditions into the operable experimental conditions guan 2011 9 q q t n d n d t d h d h t 3 10 h h t n d n d t 2 d h d h t 2 Œ∑ Œ∑ t where q is the practical mass flow d h is the practical diameter of the impeller hub q t is the testing mass flow h t is the testing head p t is the testing power d h t is the testing diameter of the impeller hub which equals to d h in this study according to eq 9 with the testing hydraulic model s size unchanged the experimental design mass flow has been changed from q d 294 kg s into q d t 95 kg s and the corresponding rotate speed has been changed from n d 17 500 r min into n d t 5800 r min so as to illustrate the feasibility of the transformed testing conditions the comparative analysis would be conducted then with the separate submission of the practical operating condition q d 294 kg s n d 17 500 r min and the experimental condition q d t 95 kg s n d t 5800 r min into the cfd solver sst model and the reason to choose it would be introduced next the simulating heads have been extracted and presented in the first two columns based on the known simulating results and eq 10 the last column in fig 2 have given the predicting head with the application of the similarity criterion by comparison of the head gotten with cfd and the similarity criterion it is known that their values are close to each other which implies the feasibility of the transformed testing condition with the similarity criterion as for the transformed testing condition the rotating speed and the mass flow are still much larger than the performances in most studies miorini et al 2012 zhang et al 2015b ji et al 2010 after many failures and explorations and established on the above identified experimental condition the test rig has been set up in the national industrial pump quality supervision and test center whose field drawing and sectional view are presented in fig 3 the main components of the test rig are consisted of the electric machinery the testing model the fixed guard and the pressure transmitter etc as for the testing model the fluid medium is firstly absorbed and regulated by the case and vane 1 separately then it would be worked with rotating impeller and finally it would be output through vane 2 as for the tested impeller its tip clearance is 0 2 mm the water with 25 c is taken as the fluid medium during the testing process the main variables to determine the performances can be settled down as the inlet static pressure p t i n and the outlet static pressure p o u t can be measured by the pressure transmitters the torque is gotten with the installed test meter near the electric machinery since the water jet pump belongs to the high speed pump the cavitation phenomenon can be easily caused during the testing process to make an overall description of the cavitation performance the passing mass flow is controlled to be at the design point while the impeller s inlet pressure is dynamically adjusted to generate different degrees of cavitation phenomenon the cavitation performance comprised of the net positive suction head npsh and the head h can be settled down with the following formulas 11 h p t o u t p t i n œÅ g 12 n p s h p t i n p s œÅ g where p t o u t p t i n are the total pressure at the impeller inlet and vane outlet relatively p s is the saturated vapor pressure in accordance with the experiment the simulation is then implemented with the numerical approach of part 3 1 and the identified mesh schema the settlement progress would be introduced next whose final calculated cavitation performance is shown in fig 4 in the figure it is known that simulating performance and the experiment performance have the same increasing trend usually when the head drops to 3 the corresponding npsh is defined as the critical cavitation condition seen from the figure it is known that the npsh of the critical cavitation is about 9 5 m which satisfies with the design standard of being lower than 10 m then the pump performance would be tested at the cavitation break down point as for the cavitation break down point in fig 4 its inlet pressure has been settled down and the range of the testing impeller s mass flow is set to be 0 86 1 16q d t to test the pump performance the hydraulic models comprised of the impeller and the vane are to be simulated with the numerical settings illustrated in part 3 1 the same as the experimental conditions the rotating speed of the impeller of the calculating process is set as n d t 5800 r min whose mass flow ranges from 76 kg s to101 kg s with the identified mesh schema the settlement progress would be introduced next the simulating pump performances consisted of the head and efficiency are presented in fig 5 meanwhile the formula used to calculate the efficiency Œ∑ is as 13 Œ∑ q œÅ g h œÑ œâ where œâ is the angular velocity œÑ is the torque through the comparative analysis of the standard kŒµ and sst model results fig 5 demonstrates the sst simulation performance to be slightly lower than that of the kŒµ model which is much more closer to the experimental results additionally in terms of the cavitation performance curve in fig 4 the sst model can make a much more accurate prediction for the head performance than the standard kŒµ model in relative to the experiment moreover the sst model is widely applied to simulate the water jet pump performance according to the related studies ji et al 2010 luo et al 2020 regarding of the ability to predict the cavitation performance and the previous applications the sst turbulence model would be adopted during the simulating process of this study moreover by comparison of the simulating result and the experiment it is easily known that they have the same changing trend and most importantly the maximum errors fall within 10 for the head and efficiency separately which satisfies with the basic accuracy standard so as to clarify the feasibility of the experiment during the testing process the uncertainty analysis would be implemented by taking the design mass flow point q d t 95 kg s as the study target at the design mass flow point the pump performances have been tested five times whose measuring results are listed in the left columns of table 2 then the head uncertainty and the efficiency uncertainty would be separately calculated based on eq 11 and eq 13 during the testing process the uncertainties are mainly consisted of two parts namely the class an uncertainty u a i and the class b uncertainty u b i liu et al 2012 the class an uncertainty u a i is caused by the random error while the class b uncertainty u b i is caused by the system error the calculating process is presented in fig 2 after the execution of the procedure presented in fig 6 the corresponding calculated uncertainties are shown in the right column of table 2 then from the table it is known that the overall uncertainty of the mass flow is u c q 0 97 the overall uncertainty of the inlet pressure is u c ptin 2 95 the overall uncertainty of the outlet pressure is u c ptout 3 25 and the overall uncertainty of the torque is u c œÑ 1 14 in eq 11 it is known that the head is mainly related to the inlet pressure and outlet pressure thus the head uncertainty can be calculated as liu et al 2012 14 u c h e a d u c p t i n 2 u c p t o u t 2 and according to eq 13 it is known that the efficiency is mainly related to the head the mass flow and the torque and the efficiency uncertainty can be calculated with the following formula 15 u c e f f i c i e n c y u c h e a d 2 u c œÑ 2 u c q 2 with the execution of eqs 14 and 15 the calculated head uncertainty is 4 39 and the efficiency is 4 64 3 3 grid independence verification the grid scale is an important factor for the stability of the calculating process in order to identify the satisfied mesh four mesh types ranging from 3 8 to 6 6 million were selected for analysis among the hydraulic components of the underwater vehicle the rotating impeller is the most complex whose yplus would be representative fig 7 presents the yplus distribution for the impellers the largest value of yplus is lower than 110 which satisfies with the basic standard for the application of the sst turbulence model luo et al 2020 based on the settings in part 3 the calculating progress is then performed on the server with 6 cores 12 threads table 3 reports the results for these four meshes when the grid number reaches 5 8 million the calculated results are observed to be stable taking into account the computing accuracy and time constraints mesh 3 is selected as the mesh schema for further analysis fig 8 4 investigation of the tip clearance s effects on the operating characteristics of the underwater vehicle 4 1 influence of the tip clearance size on the steady performance in the current study we focus on the effect of the rotating impeller s tip clearance size on the underwater vehicle s performance therefore we keep the other matching components unchanged and sequentially install the impeller on the four tip clearances in table 1 in the computational domain of fig 1 the corresponding performances are simulated via the numerical approach and the cavitation model in part 3 fig 9 presents the pressure distribution of the underwater vehicle with 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 mm blade tip clearances at the design cruising condition the pressure on the navigation body is initially stable and subsequently increases gradually from the inlet to the outlet of the water jet pump this is attributed to the operation of the rotating impeller moreover the pressure is observed to exhibit similar distribution characteristics on the navigating body across the different tip clearances however for the impeller and vane in the pump system the static pressure decreases with an increasing tip clearance size in order to illustrate the local flow characteristics of the impeller fig 10 depicts the cavitating flow and vortex distribution of the underwater vehicle with a 0 2 mm blade tip clearance at the design cruising condition the cloudy cavitating flow is identified with the vapor while the vortex is identified with the water velocity based on the Œª 2 criteria li et al 2020 the cavitating flow and vortex across different passages are essentially equal implying that the flow field of the moving underwater vehicle achieves a good convergence in fig 10 the cloudy cavitating flow initially appears in the leading edge and subsequently develops in a disperse manner around the tip clearance and the blade root furthermore the majority of the vortex body parts exist around the shroud which is caused by the tip clearance leakage flow bodling and sharma 2019 the steady flow characteristics in fig 10 demonstrate the great importance of the leakage flow effects to the pump therefore in order to explore and analyze the effects of tip clearance sizes on the flow characteristics the quantitative performances comprised of the head h efficiency Œ∑ thrust t r and the power p c must be calculated the head and efficiency can be settled down with eq 11 and eq 13 respectively while for the other performances they can be gotten as 16 t r q m v o u t u 17 p c œâ œÑ where œâ is the impeller angular velocity q m is the mass flow of the pump v o u t is the velocity at the pump outlet u is the cruising speed œÑ means the torque of the pump as demonstrated in fig 11 the mass flow of the water entering pump q m is controlled by cruising speed u keeping the other boundary conditions equal to those in section 3 the corresponding relationship between u and q m is shown in fig 11 a as the cruising speed changes from 0 2u d to 2 0u d the corresponding mass flow varies from 250 kg s to 310 kg s the pump performances under different cruising speeds and mass flow are simulated under the cavitating and non cavitating conditions based on the four tip clearances in table 1 fig 11 b e depict the performances calculated using eq 11 to eq 17 based on fig 11 a c we can obtain the following conclusions 1 under fixed cruising speed u a change in tip clearance exerts a slight influence on the pump mass flow and the larger the tip clearance the smaller the mass flow 2 as the tip clearance size increases the pump performances the efficiency and the head are greatly reduced particularly at the design mass flow point with maximum reductions in efficiency and head of about 6 and 15 respectively and 3 comparing the non cavitating and cavitating results indicates that the simulated efficiencies at the small mass flow ranges decrease greatly while the downward trend of the head performances is sharply enhanced under the cavitating condition fig 11 d and e further present the underwater vehicle s power and thrust controlled by the cruising speed under cavitation the pump thrust and consuming power exhibit a decreasing trend with the increasing tip clearance size moreover at the design cruising velocity the maximum reduction in the thrust and power are 9 9 and 5 4 respectively fig 11 reveals the huge difference between the overall performances of the non cavitating and cavitating models in order to clarify the results we select the design mass flow of 294 kg s for further analysis fig 12 presents the distribution of the pressure at the 90 blade height by comparing the inner flows we observe that the other zones exhibit similar distribution characteristics with the exception of the impeller zone similarly fig 12 indicates the 3d distribution of the cavitation cloud 0 01 vapor mass fraction in the pump implying that the cavitation phenomenon only exists at the impeller zone unlike the non cavitating model applying the cavitation model can capture the cavitation zone with a relative low static pressure thus far the results have revealed the internal difference with and without the cavitation model however the effects of the tip clearance size on the water jet pump inner flow characteristics remain to be demonstrated during the steady analysis and are thus the subject of the subsequent analysis 4 2 effect of the tip clearance on the unsteady dynamic performances of the underwater vehicle the quantitative comparative analysis of the steady performances above reveals the strong influence of the tip clearances on the underwater vehicle s performance in this section we calculate the unsteady dynamic performances underlying the cavitating process we take the steady analysis in section 2 2 and implement the unsteady analysis on the same cfd solver distinct to the steady analysis the interfaces between the rotor and stator are changed from frozen rotor to transient rotor stator mode during the unsteady calculating process the settlement of the time step Œ¥ t is crucial and can be determined as follows 18 Œ¥ t Œ¥ œÜ 180 œâ where Œ¥ œÜ is the impeller s rotating angle under the single time step the value of Œ¥ œÜ is taken as 1 in this study according to bodling and sharma 2019 and the corresponding time step is Œ¥ t 9 5238 10 5 s according to eq 18 the maximum iterative step is set to 20 for each time step while the convergence criteria is 10 7 following the calculation of 8 circles the unsteady results of the 9th circle are taken for further analysis as already mentioned the tip clearance size has a direct influence on the leakage flow distribution however its effects on the pump s dynamic characteristics such as the turbulence kinetic energy pressure pulsation and forces remain unclear and are thus the focus of the following investigation the turbulence kinetic energy is an important indicator of the flow stability the lower the turbulence kinetic value the more stable the flow fig 13 presents the instantaneous distribution of the kinetic energy at 1 4 t 2 4 t and 3 4 t with a 90 blade height the turbulence kinetic energy increases with the blade tip clearance size namely the flow stability is reduced for excessive tip clearance sizes this agrees with the performance distribution law in fig 11 in order to intuitively demonstrate the effects of the tip clearance on the dynamic characteristics of the underwater vehicle the unsteady pressure fluctuation intensity p sdv is herein defined as 19 p 1 m n 1 n p i x y z n 360 t 20 p s d v 1 m 1 n 1 n p i x y z n 360 t p 2 where p i x y z n 360 t is the pressure on each grid node t is the periodic time and m denotes the number of the output files at periodic time t furthermore the pressure intensity p sdv adopts a statistical approach to evaluate the dynamic pressure fluctuation on each node more specifically the smaller the value of p sdv the lower the pressure fluctuation fig 14 depicts the distribution of p sdv under different tip clearances based on eqs 17 and 18 the maximum pressure intensity zones appear at the pump system and its outlet fig 14 a this implies that these zones typically have a much larger pressure pulsation and can be easily damaged fig 14 b enlarges the pressure intensity distribution in the pump and comparing with fig 14 a reveals that the average pressure intensity in the pump can be hundreds of times greater than that in the outflow field around the underwater vehicle in addition the pressure intensities surrounding the underwater vehicle exhibit similar distribution characteristics under different tip clearances this is in agreement with the distribution pressure around the navigating body in fig 9 a moreover the pressure intensity in the pump increases with the tip clearance we perform pressure fluctuation analysis to support these results we selected six monitoring points around the underwater vehicle fig 14 a c1 c6 and three monitoring points in the water jet pump fig 14 b c7 c9 to represent the pressure pulsation fluctuations from the unsteady simulation results fig 15 presents the results determined via a fast fourier transform the maximum fluctuation in the pressure pulsation corresponds to the impeller rotating frequency f n aldas and yapici 2014 fig 16 depicts the pressure pulsation across different tip clearance sizes at the f n frequency the pressure pulsation in the pump ranges from 1500 to 40 000 pa while the pressure pulsation surrounding the underwater vehicle is approximately 100 pa in terms of the tip clearance size s effects on the above typical 9 monitoring points it can be approximately known that the overall distributing characteristics are the same however the specific values are determined by the tip clearance size around the underwater vehicle there exists a peak pressure pulsation at the 0 2 mm tip clearance size however as for the three monitoring points in the pump the increasing tip clearance size would lead to the pressure pulsation decrease the effects of the tip clearance size on the aforementioned nine typical monitoring points generally exhibit the same trend however the specific values vary with the tip clearance size a peak pressure pulsation at the 0 2 mm tip clearance size is observed around the underwater vehicle yet for the three monitoring points in the pump the increasing tip clearance size reduces the pressure pulsation during the working process the rotating pump needs to generate the appropriate forces i e the radial force and axial force the radial force plays a key role in ensuring the balance in the circumferential direction while the axial force is crucial for a safe working process of the thrust bearing yang et al 2013 the radial force f r t can be described as follows 21 f r t p x t d a b l a d e p x t d a h u b 2 p y t d a b l a d e p y t d a h u b 2 where a h u b a b l a d e are the surfaces of the impeller hub and blade p x t p y t are the instantaneous pressure in terms of f r z it can be calculated with the following formula 22 f z t p z t d a b l a d e p z t d a h u b where p z t denotes the instantaneous pressure at the z direction fig 17 presents the distribution of the forces under the different tip clearances calculated in the 9th cycle period based on eqs 21 and 22 the radial and axial forces are in close proximity to each other for tip clearance sizes under 0 2 mm however when the size of the tip clearance increases the values of these two forces drop greatly in addition in order to quantitatively describe the effects of the tip clearance size on the volume of the cavitating cloudy we determine transient cavity size v c by integrating the vapor fraction function Œ± v during the simulating process chen et al 2019 23 v c Œ± v d v where v is the whole volume of the computational domain shown in fig 1 fig 18 presents the calculated volume of the cavitating cloud under different tip clearance sizes based on the application of eq 23 to the transient simulation results of fig 17 increasing the tip clearance size is observed to reduce the cloudy size agreeing with the extracted vapor mass fraction distribution in fig 19 this indicates the ability of the tip clearance size to decrease the cavitating process 5 quantitative analysis of the leakage flow under different tip clearance sizes 5 1 investigation of the key influence factors on the leakage flow the results in section 4 indicate that the tip clearance shown in fig 1 and the generated leakage flows in fig 10 exert a great influence on the pump performance in order to determine the dynamic characteristics of the pump we perform further mechanism analysis by considering the cavitating process in order to quantitatively describe the leakage flow we adopt the leakage flow intensity which refers to the passing leakage flow per unit area lu and liu 2017 24 q l œÅ l w n d a l d a l where d a l is the split units of the tip clearance œÅ l is the density w is the passing velocity n is the normal vector of the split tip clearance based on eq 24 fig 20 shows the calculated leakage intensity along the streamline under different tip clearances as for the extracted leakage intensity the values of the 0 1 mm tip clearance is about 20 25 lower than the other three kinds of tip clearances on the whole streamline location and the detailed distributing characteristics would be discussed in the next section and then fig 21 illustrates blade loading p calculated as the pressure difference between the ps blade and ss blade sides figs 20 and 21 demonstrate that the leakage flow and pressure load distributions of blades 1 and 2 are distinct at the 0 9 1 0 streamline location particularly under the small tip clearance conditions through comparative analysis of the leakage intensity in fig 20 and the pressure loading in fig 21 it can be known that they have almost the same increasing and decreasing trend thus it can be quantitatively deduced out that the blade loading is the main factor to drive the leakage flow however at the 0 6 0 8 streamline location the pressure loading takes a greater dropping trend than the leakage intensity thus there is a reason to believe that another factor helps to improve the leakage intensity the comparative analysis of the leakage intensity in fig 20 and the pressure loading in fig 21 indicate that they have the same increasing and decreasing trend thus it can be quantitatively deduced out that the blade loading is the main factor driving the leakage flow however at the 0 6 0 8 streamline location the pressure loading exhibits a greater dropping trend than the leakage intensity implying an improvement in the leakage intensity fig 22 provides an enlarged view of the 0 2 mm tip clearance leakage flow at the 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 streamline locations the scrapping effect from the shroud is observed to promote the leakage flow hence in order to quantitatively describe the effect of the shroud we adopt the scrapping pressure determined from the centripetal turbine sauer et al 2012 in particular relative to the rotating blades the static shroud can be taken as the power source of the scraping leakage in fig 22 and the circumferential rotating velocity u generates a velocity component u cos Œ≤ perpendicular to the tip clearance based on the transformed formula between the velocity and dynamic pressure lu and liu 2017 lu et al 2020 the scrapping pressure is defined as 25 p s 1 2 œÅ u cos Œ≤ 2 where œÅ is the density and Œ≤ is the install blade angle fig 23 provides the distribution of the installed blade angle as well as the scrapping pressure at the shroud side the scrapping pressure value falls within the range of 980 000 10050 000 pa which is much smaller than the fluctuating range of the pressure loading in fig 21 as the scrapping pressure is stable relative to the pressure loading we can conclude that the pressure loading is the main influencing factor of the leakage flow however the 0 4 0 9 streamline location exhibits a peak scrapping pressure value which compensates for the sharp drop in the pressure loading of fig 21 resulting in the distribution characteristics of the leakage flow of fig 20 5 2 the dynamic distributing laws for the leakage flow under different tip clearances in order to further analyze the dynamic characteristics underlying the cavitating process fig 24 presents the unsteady leakage flow across time as presented in the figure the tip clearances are separated into 4 uniform sections along the streamline namely l1 1 l1 2 l1 3 l1 4 are the segmented domains for blade 1 and l2 1 l2 2 l2 3 l2 4 are the segmented domains for blade 2 with eq 24 the leakage flows within one rotating cycle are calculated whose final results changing with time are given in fig 24 in the figure the ranges of the averaged leakage intensity have declined from 48 000 to 54000 kg s m2 at the leading edge 0 0 25 streamline location to 20 000 45000 kg s m2 at the trailing edge 0 75 1 0 streamline location which satisfies with the distributing characteristics of the leakage intensity in fig 20 in terms of the effects of the tip clearances on the leakage intensity it is revealed that the leakage intensity with the 0 1 mm clearance is much smaller than the other clearances in most cases especially the maximum drop at the 0 25 0 5 streamline location can be as much as 800 kg s m2 the results determined from the comparative analysis of the leakage intensity reveal several key conclusions the overall average leakage intensity is observed to increase with the clearance size yet at the 0 0 25 streamline location the tip clearance does not exhibit any obvious effects on the specific values of the leakage flow moreover from the inlet to the outlet of the streamline the fluctuation range of the leakage intensity tends to be larger particularly at the 0 75 1 0 streamline location for the same blade the leakage intensities under different tip clearances exhibit the same increasing and decreasing trend yet the opposite is true for different blades on the basis of the results from the divided zones fig 25 a gives the leakage intensities on the whole streamline similar to the distributing characteristics in figs 20 and 24 the leakage intensities would increase with the enlargement of the tip clearance size and the leakage intensity with the 0 1 mm clearance falls in the bottom based on the calculated leakage intensities changing with time in fig 25 a and b shows the corresponding frequency domain results under different tip clearances with the fft analysis in the figure as for the fluctuated leakage intensity pulsation the maximum value appears at the impeller rotating frequency f n location and when the tip clearance size exceeds 0 2 mm the amplitudes would present a sharp decreasing trend when the tip clearance increase 6 conclusions in the current study we take a newly developed water jet pump system with a specific speed close to the critical specific speed nsc as the target object the pump system under different tip clearance sizes 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 mm has been investigated via a validated numerical approach by accounting for the influence from the underwater vehicle body and the non uniform flow the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the influence of the tip clearance size on the steady performance was clarified under fixed cruising speed u variations in the tip clearance exerted a minimal influence on the pump s mass flow and the larger the tip clearance the smaller the mass flow as the tip clearance size increased the pump performances efficiency and head dropped greatly in particular at the design mass flow point the maximum reduction in the efficiency and head were approximately 6 and 15 respectively the non cavitating and cavitating results revealed a great reduction in the simulated efficiencies at low mass flow ranges while the downward trend of the head performances was enhanced under the cavitating condition in addition the greater tip clearance sizes reduced the pump thrust and consuming power and at the design cruising velocity the maximum decline of the thrust and power was determined as 9 9 and 5 4 respectively 2 the visible difference between the cavitating and non cavitating flows was highlighted comparative analysis of the two flow types identified the cavitation process to only exist at the impeller zone the application of the cavitation model was able to capture the cavitation zone with a relative low static pressure which has been ignored in the non cavitating model 3 the key unsteady dynamic performances of the underwater vehicle controlled by the tip clearances was illustrated high turbulence kinetic energy typically appeared at the blade tip and leading edge agreeing with the distorted flow field comprised of the cavitating flow and vortex moreover the pressure intensities and pressure pulsations surrounding the underwater vehicle exhibited similar distribution characteristics under different tip clearances while the pressure intensity and pressure pulsations in the pump increased with the tip clearance the radial and axial forces were close to each other under the 0 2 mm tip clearance size yet as the size of the tip clearance increased the values of the two forces dropped sharply 4 we investigated the key influencing factors of the generated leakage flow the leakage intensity and pressure loading were observed to exhibit almost identical increasing and decreasing trends thus the blade loading is the principle factor affecting the leakage flow however at the 0 6 0 8 streamline location the pressure loading exhibits a greater dropping trend compared to the leakage intensity analysis of the local flow and scrapping pressure demonstrates the scrapping effect from the shroud to be another important factor promoting the leakage flow 5 the dynamic distribution laws of the leakage flow under different tip clearances were clarified the overall average leakage intensity increased with the tip clearance size however at the 0 0 25 streamline location the tip clearance did not exert any obvious effects on the specific values of the leakage flow from the inlet to the outlet of the streamline the fluctuation range of the leakage intensity was typically larger especially at the 0 75 1 0 streamline location furthermore the leakage intensities of the same blade under different tip clearances exhibited the same increasing and decreasing trend while the opposite was observed for different blades the frequency domain results of the leakage intensities reveal the maximum amplitude to appear at impeller rotating frequency f n this indicates a sharp decreasing trend corresponding to the increasing tip clearance size particularly at tip clearance sizes exceeding 0 2 mm credit authorship contribution statement

20419,to make up for the lack of study on high speed water jet propulsion pump tip clearances a newly developed water jet pump system close to the critical specific speed nsc has been investigated based on the body of the underwater vehicle and the non uniform flow the pump system with different tip clearance sizes 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 mm is evaluated and validated via numerical simulations preliminary steady simulating results demonstrate that increasing the tip clearance size can reduce the overall performance of the head the efficiency pump thrust and the consuming power following further unsteady simulations we reveal the unsteady dynamic performance induced by the tip clearances related to the similar distribution characteristics of the pressure intensities and the pressure pulsations around the underwater vehicle furthermore the pressure intensity and pressure pulsations in the pump increase with the tip clearance quantitative and comparative analysis of the distribution characteristics indicates that the blade loading and scrapping effect of the shroud are key factors influencing the leakage flow at last the leakage flow s dynamic distributing law under different tip clearances have been clarified keywords underwater vehicle water jet propulsion pump tip clearance operating characteristic 1 introduction due to the high propulsive efficiency low vibration and great maneuverability water jet propulsion pumps are widely adopted in advanced underwater vehicles zou et al 2019 during the operation of the underwater vehicle the surrounding water is sucked in the intake and works with the rotating impeller to generate the thrust the tip clearance is located between the rotating blade and stating casing of the water jet propulsion pump which consequently generates the leakage flow the comprehensive action of the leakage and passage flow results in several adverse effects including the inviscid blockage bodling and sharma 2019 and the efficiency losses wu et al 2011 greatly limiting the pump performances since the tip clearance and the leakage flow are inherent features in the loaded rotor blades of the pump the drawbacks are unavoidable and must be accounted for lu et al 2021 in order to clarify the effects of the tip clearance flow and the corresponding inner flow mechanism as early as the 1990s particle image velocimetry piv measurements started to reveal the flow structure and turbulent flow within the tip leakage vortex for example farrell et al farrell and billet 1994 analyzed the correlation between the vortexes and the cavitation flows and miorini et al 2012 adopted high resolution planar piv measurements to investigate the processes related to the vortexes in a breakthrough study dreyer et al 2014 utilized stereo particle image velocimetry spiv in three planes to investigate the tip clearance flows of a typical naca0009 hydrofoil despite the rapid development of non intrusive measurement techniques wu et al 2012 kim and chun 2007 only a small amount of data is available for the analysis process and the lack of detailed information on the entire flow analysis in the pump is a major obstacle in order to reduce the problems associated with insufficient data and to determine the flow properties several advanced numerical approaches are commonly used alda≈ü et al aldas and yapici 2014 investigated the effects of surface roughness on a water jet propulsion system by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the detailed flow characteristics were provided and analyzed liu et al 2017 implemented cfd to reveal the influence of tip clearance size on the energy performance and flow patterns in pumps and based on this study tan et al 2018 proposed a novel t shape tip clearance to control the tip leakage flow and improve the pump performance zhang et al 2015a 2015b employed the shear stress transport sst k œâ turbulence model to analyze the tip leakage vortex trajectories and cavitation patterns in an axial flow pump moreover using a rans solver on a spiral like structured grid peng et al 2013 evaluated the steady state tip vortex flow of a david taylor model basin dtmb propeller in a study considering the cavitation effect ji et al 2013 investigated the unsteady cavitating turbulent flow around a full scale marine propeller the previous research has revealed the specific details of the tip leakage flow and the corresponding losses have been carefully analyzed however the majority of studies investigate the relatively low specific speeds while flow mechanism analysis with the high speed water jet propulsion pumps is limited the specific speed ns is typically adopted to clarify the pump s operating ranges furthermore as the pump s specific speed is close to the critical specific speed nsc jin et al 2018 the pump performance drops sharply and requires inner flow analysis to reveal the physical principles in addition the models in previous studies generally adopt the isolated impeller zone which ignores the practical non uniform suction flow caused by the entire under water vehicle thus the conclusions obtained from such simplified research require further work to get close to the practical condition cao et al 2017 in order to reveal the practical inner flow characteristics of the pump system installed in moving underwater vehicles this study takes a newly developed water jet pump system with a specific speed close to the critical specific speed nsc as the study object moreover considering the influence of the underwater vehicle s body and non uniform flow a pump system with varying tip clearance sizes 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 mm is investigated and clarified with a validated numerical simulation method the corresponding effects on the underwater vehicle are then evaluated via comparative unsteady analysis 2 the target model fig 1 presents the underwater vehicle installed with the high speed water jet propulsion pump to ensure the comprehensive assessment of the entire underwater vehicle performance the vehicle is placed into the center of a cylindrical simulation domain fig 1 marks the key size information with specific values reported in table 1 the principle components of the underwater vehicle are the underwater vehicle s body and the water jet propulsion pump the water jet propulsion pump contains the rotating impeller static intake passage and static guide vane the impeller has two blades with a height of 0 0275 m the impeller blades are placed input into the casing with a diameter of 0 155 m the manufactured impeller has a tip clearance size of 0 2 mm which is taken as the baseline while three additional tip clearance sizes 0 1 mm 0 4 mm 0 8 mm are selected for analysis thus the tip clearance between the blade tip and casing are set as 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 mm table 1 both the intake passage and guide vane are enclosed in a shrinking casing with five and 6 blades respectively the underwater vehicle is designed with a cruising speed of u d 60 kn the rotating speed of the impeller is n 17 500 r min and under the designed moving speed the corresponding designed mass flow and head are q d 294 kg s and h d 114 m respectively thus the specific speed ns of the impeller can be calculated as follows 1 n s 3 65 n q h 3 4 this yields a specific speed ns equal to 980 which is close to the definition of the critical specific speed nsc the derived specific speed indicates that our research model is an advanced high speed water jet pump with the corresponding results potentially fulfilling the practical needs in engineering 3 numerical approach and its validation 3 1 numerical approach 3 1 1 basic governing equations the cavitation flow into the high speed water jet propulsion pump inevitably occurs during the working process this turbulent type of cavitating fluid can be defined as a uniform mixture flow comprised of water and vapor ji et al 2010 to simulate this flow the basic governing equations for the unsteady reynolds average navier stokes urans approach can be expressed as follows 2 œÅ m t œÅ m u j x j 0 3 œÅ m u i t œÅ m u i u j x j p x i x j Œº m

into ansys cfx commercial codes the cfx solver has improved the cavitation model increasing its subtility for the unsteady cavitation performance simulation of pump jet systems ji et al 2010 pan et al 2016 3 1 2 turbulence model and additional settings we adopted the urans simulation method for incompressible flows to simulate the performance of the target model due to the existence of reynolds stress the turbulence model has been defined for closed equations for engineering applications the standard k Œµ and sst k œâ models are much more preferred bing et al 2013 lu et al 2018 huang et al 2020 figs 4 and 5 compare these two models indicating that the sst turbulence model is closer to the experimental results and thus it was selected as the turbulence model in this study the simulation process was implemented in the cfx solver as presented in fig 1 the entire simulating zone is the cylindrical domain comprising of the underwater vehicle the corresponding boundary conditions are as follows 1 the cylindrical domain inlet is set as the velocity mode whose specific value is the cruising speed of the underwater vehicle u 2 the cylindrical domain outlet is set as the outlet mode whose specific value is determined by the environment pressure and 3 the cylindrical domain s flank is set as the wall mode the impeller is the only rotating hydraulic component and thus a rotational coordinate system is adopted the multiple reference frames mrf technique is applied to set up the rotating impeller zone whose interfaces between the rotor and the stator are selected as the frozen rotor mode in the steady simulation and the transient rotor stator mode in the unsteady simulation moreover the no slip technique is used to treat the walls in the computational domain while the automatic wall function technique is applied to treat the zones near the walls water at 25 c is set as the flow medium with a dynamic viscosity of 8 899 10 4 kg m s and density of 997 kg m3 the time dependent governing equations are discretized both in space and time using the direct coupling method together with the second order unwind discretization for the convection term the convergence criterion for different stages are described as follows steady simulation convergence criterion of 10 5 time step of 1 90476 10 5 s and maximum iteration step of 20 with a single step convergence of 10 7 simulations were performed on a dell workstation 3 2 validation of the numerical approach in order to verify the feasibility of the numerical approach the pump system comprised of the impeller and vane was taken as the test object as already mentioned the underwater vehicle has a relatively high speed propulsion pump with a design mass flow and speed of q d 294 kg s and n d 17 500 r min respectively after investigating the existing test conditions in the national industrial pump quality supervision and texting center of china it was found out that the preliminary pump s mass flow and rotating speed are too large to be realized in consideration of the practical test conditions and the test cost we decided to use the similarity criterion to transform the original operating conditions into the operable experimental conditions guan 2011 9 q q t n d n d t d h d h t 3 10 h h t n d n d t 2 d h d h t 2 Œ∑ Œ∑ t where q is the practical mass flow d h is the practical diameter of the impeller hub q t is the testing mass flow h t is the testing head p t is the testing power d h t is the testing diameter of the impeller hub which equals to d h in this study according to eq 9 with the testing hydraulic model s size unchanged the experimental design mass flow has been changed from q d 294 kg s into q d t 95 kg s and the corresponding rotate speed has been changed from n d 17 500 r min into n d t 5800 r min so as to illustrate the feasibility of the transformed testing conditions the comparative analysis would be conducted then with the separate submission of the practical operating condition q d 294 kg s n d 17 500 r min and the experimental condition q d t 95 kg s n d t 5800 r min into the cfd solver sst model and the reason to choose it would be introduced next the simulating heads have been extracted and presented in the first two columns based on the known simulating results and eq 10 the last column in fig 2 have given the predicting head with the application of the similarity criterion by comparison of the head gotten with cfd and the similarity criterion it is known that their values are close to each other which implies the feasibility of the transformed testing condition with the similarity criterion as for the transformed testing condition the rotating speed and the mass flow are still much larger than the performances in most studies miorini et al 2012 zhang et al 2015b ji et al 2010 after many failures and explorations and established on the above identified experimental condition the test rig has been set up in the national industrial pump quality supervision and test center whose field drawing and sectional view are presented in fig 3 the main components of the test rig are consisted of the electric machinery the testing model the fixed guard and the pressure transmitter etc as for the testing model the fluid medium is firstly absorbed and regulated by the case and vane 1 separately then it would be worked with rotating impeller and finally it would be output through vane 2 as for the tested impeller its tip clearance is 0 2 mm the water with 25 c is taken as the fluid medium during the testing process the main variables to determine the performances can be settled down as the inlet static pressure p t i n and the outlet static pressure p o u t can be measured by the pressure transmitters the torque is gotten with the installed test meter near the electric machinery since the water jet pump belongs to the high speed pump the cavitation phenomenon can be easily caused during the testing process to make an overall description of the cavitation performance the passing mass flow is controlled to be at the design point while the impeller s inlet pressure is dynamically adjusted to generate different degrees of cavitation phenomenon the cavitation performance comprised of the net positive suction head npsh and the head h can be settled down with the following formulas 11 h p t o u t p t i n œÅ g 12 n p s h p t i n p s œÅ g where p t o u t p t i n are the total pressure at the impeller inlet and vane outlet relatively p s is the saturated vapor pressure in accordance with the experiment the simulation is then implemented with the numerical approach of part 3 1 and the identified mesh schema the settlement progress would be introduced next whose final calculated cavitation performance is shown in fig 4 in the figure it is known that simulating performance and the experiment performance have the same increasing trend usually when the head drops to 3 the corresponding npsh is defined as the critical cavitation condition seen from the figure it is known that the npsh of the critical cavitation is about 9 5 m which satisfies with the design standard of being lower than 10 m then the pump performance would be tested at the cavitation break down point as for the cavitation break down point in fig 4 its inlet pressure has been settled down and the range of the testing impeller s mass flow is set to be 0 86 1 16q d t to test the pump performance the hydraulic models comprised of the impeller and the vane are to be simulated with the numerical settings illustrated in part 3 1 the same as the experimental conditions the rotating speed of the impeller of the calculating process is set as n d t 5800 r min whose mass flow ranges from 76 kg s to101 kg s with the identified mesh schema the settlement progress would be introduced next the simulating pump performances consisted of the head and efficiency are presented in fig 5 meanwhile the formula used to calculate the efficiency Œ∑ is as 13 Œ∑ q œÅ g h œÑ œâ where œâ is the angular velocity œÑ is the torque through the comparative analysis of the standard kŒµ and sst model results fig 5 demonstrates the sst simulation performance to be slightly lower than that of the kŒµ model which is much more closer to the experimental results additionally in terms of the cavitation performance curve in fig 4 the sst model can make a much more accurate prediction for the head performance than the standard kŒµ model in relative to the experiment moreover the sst model is widely applied to simulate the water jet pump performance according to the related studies ji et al 2010 luo et al 2020 regarding of the ability to predict the cavitation performance and the previous applications the sst turbulence model would be adopted during the simulating process of this study moreover by comparison of the simulating result and the experiment it is easily known that they have the same changing trend and most importantly the maximum errors fall within 10 for the head and efficiency separately which satisfies with the basic accuracy standard so as to clarify the feasibility of the experiment during the testing process the uncertainty analysis would be implemented by taking the design mass flow point q d t 95 kg s as the study target at the design mass flow point the pump performances have been tested five times whose measuring results are listed in the left columns of table 2 then the head uncertainty and the efficiency uncertainty would be separately calculated based on eq 11 and eq 13 during the testing process the uncertainties are mainly consisted of two parts namely the class an uncertainty u a i and the class b uncertainty u b i liu et al 2012 the class an uncertainty u a i is caused by the random error while the class b uncertainty u b i is caused by the system error the calculating process is presented in fig 2 after the execution of the procedure presented in fig 6 the corresponding calculated uncertainties are shown in the right column of table 2 then from the table it is known that the overall uncertainty of the mass flow is u c q 0 97 the overall uncertainty of the inlet pressure is u c ptin 2 95 the overall uncertainty of the outlet pressure is u c ptout 3 25 and the overall uncertainty of the torque is u c œÑ 1 14 in eq 11 it is known that the head is mainly related to the inlet pressure and outlet pressure thus the head uncertainty can be calculated as liu et al 2012 14 u c h e a d u c p t i n 2 u c p t o u t 2 and according to eq 13 it is known that the efficiency is mainly related to the head the mass flow and the torque and the efficiency uncertainty can be calculated with the following formula 15 u c e f f i c i e n c y u c h e a d 2 u c œÑ 2 u c q 2 with the execution of eqs 14 and 15 the calculated head uncertainty is 4 39 and the efficiency is 4 64 3 3 grid independence verification the grid scale is an important factor for the stability of the calculating process in order to identify the satisfied mesh four mesh types ranging from 3 8 to 6 6 million were selected for analysis among the hydraulic components of the underwater vehicle the rotating impeller is the most complex whose yplus would be representative fig 7 presents the yplus distribution for the impellers the largest value of yplus is lower than 110 which satisfies with the basic standard for the application of the sst turbulence model luo et al 2020 based on the settings in part 3 the calculating progress is then performed on the server with 6 cores 12 threads table 3 reports the results for these four meshes when the grid number reaches 5 8 million the calculated results are observed to be stable taking into account the computing accuracy and time constraints mesh 3 is selected as the mesh schema for further analysis fig 8 4 investigation of the tip clearance s effects on the operating characteristics of the underwater vehicle 4 1 influence of the tip clearance size on the steady performance in the current study we focus on the effect of the rotating impeller s tip clearance size on the underwater vehicle s performance therefore we keep the other matching components unchanged and sequentially install the impeller on the four tip clearances in table 1 in the computational domain of fig 1 the corresponding performances are simulated via the numerical approach and the cavitation model in part 3 fig 9 presents the pressure distribution of the underwater vehicle with 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 mm blade tip clearances at the design cruising condition the pressure on the navigation body is initially stable and subsequently increases gradually from the inlet to the outlet of the water jet pump this is attributed to the operation of the rotating impeller moreover the pressure is observed to exhibit similar distribution characteristics on the navigating body across the different tip clearances however for the impeller and vane in the pump system the static pressure decreases with an increasing tip clearance size in order to illustrate the local flow characteristics of the impeller fig 10 depicts the cavitating flow and vortex distribution of the underwater vehicle with a 0 2 mm blade tip clearance at the design cruising condition the cloudy cavitating flow is identified with the vapor while the vortex is identified with the water velocity based on the Œª 2 criteria li et al 2020 the cavitating flow and vortex across different passages are essentially equal implying that the flow field of the moving underwater vehicle achieves a good convergence in fig 10 the cloudy cavitating flow initially appears in the leading edge and subsequently develops in a disperse manner around the tip clearance and the blade root furthermore the majority of the vortex body parts exist around the shroud which is caused by the tip clearance leakage flow bodling and sharma 2019 the steady flow characteristics in fig 10 demonstrate the great importance of the leakage flow effects to the pump therefore in order to explore and analyze the effects of tip clearance sizes on the flow characteristics the quantitative performances comprised of the head h efficiency Œ∑ thrust t r and the power p c must be calculated the head and efficiency can be settled down with eq 11 and eq 13 respectively while for the other performances they can be gotten as 16 t r q m v o u t u 17 p c œâ œÑ where œâ is the impeller angular velocity q m is the mass flow of the pump v o u t is the velocity at the pump outlet u is the cruising speed œÑ means the torque of the pump as demonstrated in fig 11 the mass flow of the water entering pump q m is controlled by cruising speed u keeping the other boundary conditions equal to those in section 3 the corresponding relationship between u and q m is shown in fig 11 a as the cruising speed changes from 0 2u d to 2 0u d the corresponding mass flow varies from 250 kg s to 310 kg s the pump performances under different cruising speeds and mass flow are simulated under the cavitating and non cavitating conditions based on the four tip clearances in table 1 fig 11 b e depict the performances calculated using eq 11 to eq 17 based on fig 11 a c we can obtain the following conclusions 1 under fixed cruising speed u a change in tip clearance exerts a slight influence on the pump mass flow and the larger the tip clearance the smaller the mass flow 2 as the tip clearance size increases the pump performances the efficiency and the head are greatly reduced particularly at the design mass flow point with maximum reductions in efficiency and head of about 6 and 15 respectively and 3 comparing the non cavitating and cavitating results indicates that the simulated efficiencies at the small mass flow ranges decrease greatly while the downward trend of the head performances is sharply enhanced under the cavitating condition fig 11 d and e further present the underwater vehicle s power and thrust controlled by the cruising speed under cavitation the pump thrust and consuming power exhibit a decreasing trend with the increasing tip clearance size moreover at the design cruising velocity the maximum reduction in the thrust and power are 9 9 and 5 4 respectively fig 11 reveals the huge difference between the overall performances of the non cavitating and cavitating models in order to clarify the results we select the design mass flow of 294 kg s for further analysis fig 12 presents the distribution of the pressure at the 90 blade height by comparing the inner flows we observe that the other zones exhibit similar distribution characteristics with the exception of the impeller zone similarly fig 12 indicates the 3d distribution of the cavitation cloud 0 01 vapor mass fraction in the pump implying that the cavitation phenomenon only exists at the impeller zone unlike the non cavitating model applying the cavitation model can capture the cavitation zone with a relative low static pressure thus far the results have revealed the internal difference with and without the cavitation model however the effects of the tip clearance size on the water jet pump inner flow characteristics remain to be demonstrated during the steady analysis and are thus the subject of the subsequent analysis 4 2 effect of the tip clearance on the unsteady dynamic performances of the underwater vehicle the quantitative comparative analysis of the steady performances above reveals the strong influence of the tip clearances on the underwater vehicle s performance in this section we calculate the unsteady dynamic performances underlying the cavitating process we take the steady analysis in section 2 2 and implement the unsteady analysis on the same cfd solver distinct to the steady analysis the interfaces between the rotor and stator are changed from frozen rotor to transient rotor stator mode during the unsteady calculating process the settlement of the time step Œ¥ t is crucial and can be determined as follows 18 Œ¥ t Œ¥ œÜ 180 œâ where Œ¥ œÜ is the impeller s rotating angle under the single time step the value of Œ¥ œÜ is taken as 1 in this study according to bodling and sharma 2019 and the corresponding time step is Œ¥ t 9 5238 10 5 s according to eq 18 the maximum iterative step is set to 20 for each time step while the convergence criteria is 10 7 following the calculation of 8 circles the unsteady results of the 9th circle are taken for further analysis as already mentioned the tip clearance size has a direct influence on the leakage flow distribution however its effects on the pump s dynamic characteristics such as the turbulence kinetic energy pressure pulsation and forces remain unclear and are thus the focus of the following investigation the turbulence kinetic energy is an important indicator of the flow stability the lower the turbulence kinetic value the more stable the flow fig 13 presents the instantaneous distribution of the kinetic energy at 1 4 t 2 4 t and 3 4 t with a 90 blade height the turbulence kinetic energy increases with the blade tip clearance size namely the flow stability is reduced for excessive tip clearance sizes this agrees with the performance distribution law in fig 11 in order to intuitively demonstrate the effects of the tip clearance on the dynamic characteristics of the underwater vehicle the unsteady pressure fluctuation intensity p sdv is herein defined as 19 p 1 m n 1 n p i x y z n 360 t 20 p s d v 1 m 1 n 1 n p i x y z n 360 t p 2 where p i x y z n 360 t is the pressure on each grid node t is the periodic time and m denotes the number of the output files at periodic time t furthermore the pressure intensity p sdv adopts a statistical approach to evaluate the dynamic pressure fluctuation on each node more specifically the smaller the value of p sdv the lower the pressure fluctuation fig 14 depicts the distribution of p sdv under different tip clearances based on eqs 17 and 18 the maximum pressure intensity zones appear at the pump system and its outlet fig 14 a this implies that these zones typically have a much larger pressure pulsation and can be easily damaged fig 14 b enlarges the pressure intensity distribution in the pump and comparing with fig 14 a reveals that the average pressure intensity in the pump can be hundreds of times greater than that in the outflow field around the underwater vehicle in addition the pressure intensities surrounding the underwater vehicle exhibit similar distribution characteristics under different tip clearances this is in agreement with the distribution pressure around the navigating body in fig 9 a moreover the pressure intensity in the pump increases with the tip clearance we perform pressure fluctuation analysis to support these results we selected six monitoring points around the underwater vehicle fig 14 a c1 c6 and three monitoring points in the water jet pump fig 14 b c7 c9 to represent the pressure pulsation fluctuations from the unsteady simulation results fig 15 presents the results determined via a fast fourier transform the maximum fluctuation in the pressure pulsation corresponds to the impeller rotating frequency f n aldas and yapici 2014 fig 16 depicts the pressure pulsation across different tip clearance sizes at the f n frequency the pressure pulsation in the pump ranges from 1500 to 40 000 pa while the pressure pulsation surrounding the underwater vehicle is approximately 100 pa in terms of the tip clearance size s effects on the above typical 9 monitoring points it can be approximately known that the overall distributing characteristics are the same however the specific values are determined by the tip clearance size around the underwater vehicle there exists a peak pressure pulsation at the 0 2 mm tip clearance size however as for the three monitoring points in the pump the increasing tip clearance size would lead to the pressure pulsation decrease the effects of the tip clearance size on the aforementioned nine typical monitoring points generally exhibit the same trend however the specific values vary with the tip clearance size a peak pressure pulsation at the 0 2 mm tip clearance size is observed around the underwater vehicle yet for the three monitoring points in the pump the increasing tip clearance size reduces the pressure pulsation during the working process the rotating pump needs to generate the appropriate forces i e the radial force and axial force the radial force plays a key role in ensuring the balance in the circumferential direction while the axial force is crucial for a safe working process of the thrust bearing yang et al 2013 the radial force f r t can be described as follows 21 f r t p x t d a b l a d e p x t d a h u b 2 p y t d a b l a d e p y t d a h u b 2 where a h u b a b l a d e are the surfaces of the impeller hub and blade p x t p y t are the instantaneous pressure in terms of f r z it can be calculated with the following formula 22 f z t p z t d a b l a d e p z t d a h u b where p z t denotes the instantaneous pressure at the z direction fig 17 presents the distribution of the forces under the different tip clearances calculated in the 9th cycle period based on eqs 21 and 22 the radial and axial forces are in close proximity to each other for tip clearance sizes under 0 2 mm however when the size of the tip clearance increases the values of these two forces drop greatly in addition in order to quantitatively describe the effects of the tip clearance size on the volume of the cavitating cloudy we determine transient cavity size v c by integrating the vapor fraction function Œ± v during the simulating process chen et al 2019 23 v c Œ± v d v where v is the whole volume of the computational domain shown in fig 1 fig 18 presents the calculated volume of the cavitating cloud under different tip clearance sizes based on the application of eq 23 to the transient simulation results of fig 17 increasing the tip clearance size is observed to reduce the cloudy size agreeing with the extracted vapor mass fraction distribution in fig 19 this indicates the ability of the tip clearance size to decrease the cavitating process 5 quantitative analysis of the leakage flow under different tip clearance sizes 5 1 investigation of the key influence factors on the leakage flow the results in section 4 indicate that the tip clearance shown in fig 1 and the generated leakage flows in fig 10 exert a great influence on the pump performance in order to determine the dynamic characteristics of the pump we perform further mechanism analysis by considering the cavitating process in order to quantitatively describe the leakage flow we adopt the leakage flow intensity which refers to the passing leakage flow per unit area lu and liu 2017 24 q l œÅ l w n d a l d a l where d a l is the split units of the tip clearance œÅ l is the density w is the passing velocity n is the normal vector of the split tip clearance based on eq 24 fig 20 shows the calculated leakage intensity along the streamline under different tip clearances as for the extracted leakage intensity the values of the 0 1 mm tip clearance is about 20 25 lower than the other three kinds of tip clearances on the whole streamline location and the detailed distributing characteristics would be discussed in the next section and then fig 21 illustrates blade loading p calculated as the pressure difference between the ps blade and ss blade sides figs 20 and 21 demonstrate that the leakage flow and pressure load distributions of blades 1 and 2 are distinct at the 0 9 1 0 streamline location particularly under the small tip clearance conditions through comparative analysis of the leakage intensity in fig 20 and the pressure loading in fig 21 it can be known that they have almost the same increasing and decreasing trend thus it can be quantitatively deduced out that the blade loading is the main factor to drive the leakage flow however at the 0 6 0 8 streamline location the pressure loading takes a greater dropping trend than the leakage intensity thus there is a reason to believe that another factor helps to improve the leakage intensity the comparative analysis of the leakage intensity in fig 20 and the pressure loading in fig 21 indicate that they have the same increasing and decreasing trend thus it can be quantitatively deduced out that the blade loading is the main factor driving the leakage flow however at the 0 6 0 8 streamline location the pressure loading exhibits a greater dropping trend than the leakage intensity implying an improvement in the leakage intensity fig 22 provides an enlarged view of the 0 2 mm tip clearance leakage flow at the 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 streamline locations the scrapping effect from the shroud is observed to promote the leakage flow hence in order to quantitatively describe the effect of the shroud we adopt the scrapping pressure determined from the centripetal turbine sauer et al 2012 in particular relative to the rotating blades the static shroud can be taken as the power source of the scraping leakage in fig 22 and the circumferential rotating velocity u generates a velocity component u cos Œ≤ perpendicular to the tip clearance based on the transformed formula between the velocity and dynamic pressure lu and liu 2017 lu et al 2020 the scrapping pressure is defined as 25 p s 1 2 œÅ u cos Œ≤ 2 where œÅ is the density and Œ≤ is the install blade angle fig 23 provides the distribution of the installed blade angle as well as the scrapping pressure at the shroud side the scrapping pressure value falls within the range of 980 000 10050 000 pa which is much smaller than the fluctuating range of the pressure loading in fig 21 as the scrapping pressure is stable relative to the pressure loading we can conclude that the pressure loading is the main influencing factor of the leakage flow however the 0 4 0 9 streamline location exhibits a peak scrapping pressure value which compensates for the sharp drop in the pressure loading of fig 21 resulting in the distribution characteristics of the leakage flow of fig 20 5 2 the dynamic distributing laws for the leakage flow under different tip clearances in order to further analyze the dynamic characteristics underlying the cavitating process fig 24 presents the unsteady leakage flow across time as presented in the figure the tip clearances are separated into 4 uniform sections along the streamline namely l1 1 l1 2 l1 3 l1 4 are the segmented domains for blade 1 and l2 1 l2 2 l2 3 l2 4 are the segmented domains for blade 2 with eq 24 the leakage flows within one rotating cycle are calculated whose final results changing with time are given in fig 24 in the figure the ranges of the averaged leakage intensity have declined from 48 000 to 54000 kg s m2 at the leading edge 0 0 25 streamline location to 20 000 45000 kg s m2 at the trailing edge 0 75 1 0 streamline location which satisfies with the distributing characteristics of the leakage intensity in fig 20 in terms of the effects of the tip clearances on the leakage intensity it is revealed that the leakage intensity with the 0 1 mm clearance is much smaller than the other clearances in most cases especially the maximum drop at the 0 25 0 5 streamline location can be as much as 800 kg s m2 the results determined from the comparative analysis of the leakage intensity reveal several key conclusions the overall average leakage intensity is observed to increase with the clearance size yet at the 0 0 25 streamline location the tip clearance does not exhibit any obvious effects on the specific values of the leakage flow moreover from the inlet to the outlet of the streamline the fluctuation range of the leakage intensity tends to be larger particularly at the 0 75 1 0 streamline location for the same blade the leakage intensities under different tip clearances exhibit the same increasing and decreasing trend yet the opposite is true for different blades on the basis of the results from the divided zones fig 25 a gives the leakage intensities on the whole streamline similar to the distributing characteristics in figs 20 and 24 the leakage intensities would increase with the enlargement of the tip clearance size and the leakage intensity with the 0 1 mm clearance falls in the bottom based on the calculated leakage intensities changing with time in fig 25 a and b shows the corresponding frequency domain results under different tip clearances with the fft analysis in the figure as for the fluctuated leakage intensity pulsation the maximum value appears at the impeller rotating frequency f n location and when the tip clearance size exceeds 0 2 mm the amplitudes would present a sharp decreasing trend when the tip clearance increase 6 conclusions in the current study we take a newly developed water jet pump system with a specific speed close to the critical specific speed nsc as the target object the pump system under different tip clearance sizes 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 mm has been investigated via a validated numerical approach by accounting for the influence from the underwater vehicle body and the non uniform flow the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the influence of the tip clearance size on the steady performance was clarified under fixed cruising speed u variations in the tip clearance exerted a minimal influence on the pump s mass flow and the larger the tip clearance the smaller the mass flow as the tip clearance size increased the pump performances efficiency and head dropped greatly in particular at the design mass flow point the maximum reduction in the efficiency and head were approximately 6 and 15 respectively the non cavitating and cavitating results revealed a great reduction in the simulated efficiencies at low mass flow ranges while the downward trend of the head performances was enhanced under the cavitating condition in addition the greater tip clearance sizes reduced the pump thrust and consuming power and at the design cruising velocity the maximum decline of the thrust and power was determined as 9 9 and 5 4 respectively 2 the visible difference between the cavitating and non cavitating flows was highlighted comparative analysis of the two flow types identified the cavitation process to only exist at the impeller zone the application of the cavitation model was able to capture the cavitation zone with a relative low static pressure which has been ignored in the non cavitating model 3 the key unsteady dynamic performances of the underwater vehicle controlled by the tip clearances was illustrated high turbulence kinetic energy typically appeared at the blade tip and leading edge agreeing with the distorted flow field comprised of the cavitating flow and vortex moreover the pressure intensities and pressure pulsations surrounding the underwater vehicle exhibited similar distribution characteristics under different tip clearances while the pressure intensity and pressure pulsations in the pump increased with the tip clearance the radial and axial forces were close to each other under the 0 2 mm tip clearance size yet as the size of the tip clearance increased the values of the two forces dropped sharply 4 we investigated the key influencing factors of the generated leakage flow the leakage intensity and pressure loading were observed to exhibit almost identical increasing and decreasing trends thus the blade loading is the principle factor affecting the leakage flow however at the 0 6 0 8 streamline location the pressure loading exhibits a greater dropping trend compared to the leakage intensity analysis of the local flow and scrapping pressure demonstrates the scrapping effect from the shroud to be another important factor promoting the leakage flow 5 the dynamic distribution laws of the leakage flow under different tip clearances were clarified the overall average leakage intensity increased with the tip clearance size however at the 0 0 25 streamline location the tip clearance did not exert any obvious effects on the specific values of the leakage flow from the inlet to the outlet of the streamline the fluctuation range of the leakage intensity was typically larger especially at the 0 75 1 0 streamline location furthermore the leakage intensities of the same blade under different tip clearances exhibited the same increasing and decreasing trend while the opposite was observed for different blades the frequency domain results of the leakage intensities reveal the maximum amplitude to appear at impeller rotating frequency f n this indicates a sharp decreasing trend corresponding to the increasing tip clearance size particularly at tip clearance sizes exceeding 0 2 mm credit authorship contribution statement
