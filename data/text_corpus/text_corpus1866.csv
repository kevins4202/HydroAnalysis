9330,effective agricultural water management requires accurate continuous and transparent accounting of water use in irrigated agroecosystems especially in water limited regions where moratoriums may be imposed advances in sensor technologies networking and data analytics can aid in fulfilling this task by automatically collecting analyzing and reporting real time data to infer irrigators practices and behaviors crop water requirements water applications and use in this research an automated irrigation water withdrawal and water use monitoring and data collection system was deployed to monitor actual irrigation dynamics for 31 commercial and large scale agricultural production fields for three consecutive years production scale fields representing a total of 1050 ha included center pivot p gravity surface furrow g and subsurface drip irrigated s fields on average irrigation was initiated 40 70 days after planting dap and terminated by 120 140 dap the proportion of irrigation systems operating simultaneously and peak water abstraction were highest 70 90 during july and august mean depth of water applied across all fields was 243 264 and 284 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively site specific monitoring of precipitation soil moisture and evaporative demand and a soil water balance model resulted in mean seasonal irrigation requirement estimates of 394 242 and 184 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively for maize and 307 163 and 219 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively for soybean despite reduction of calculated mean irrigation requirement in 2014 and 2015 by 40 50 actual irrigation applications by producers did not change considerably and irrigation applied exceeded irrigation water requirements in 80 of the fields suggesting needs for irrigation water management technology implementation and associated educational programs in the region some fields showed irrigation applications exceeding the mean annual allocated moratorium irrigation depth 305 mm implying that irrigation decisions are still largely driven by non scientific and or technical methods while substantial farm to farm heterogeneity makes it challenging to robustly benchmarking regional water footprint and irrigator behavior it also creates an opportunity for developing and implementing methodologies and strategies for real time monitoring of farm level irrigation dynamics new advances in technologies with telemetry capabilities as well as internet of things iots can be leveraged to effectively create databases track and compare water usage to better plan allocate distribute monitor and manage limited water resources for enhancing agricultural productivity these processes can also be used for education and demonstration for irrigation professionals to enhance adoption of such technologies this research has the potential for technology and strategy transfer for advanced water management to other regions in the united states and globally keywords automation evapotranspiration irrigation maize soil moisture soybean telemetry water management 1 introduction due to the nature of the novel goal of producing food fiber and fuel demand of rapidly growing world s population agricultural irrigation in many cases is the largest customer of global freshwater resources with 70 80 of the total water withdrawal from ground and surface water resources globally oecd 2021 gordon et al 2010 in many cases it is stated by different researchers scientists and other non experts in water resources engineering agricultural water management agricultural engineering disciplines that irrigated agriculture consumes 70 80 of water withdrawn water resources which is not accurate and is misleading as not all water withdrawn from ground or surface water resources is consumed by plants and a considerable portion of water withdrawn and delivered to the production fields through irrigation systems returns to its sources the amount of water withdrawn that returns to the source is a function of numerous factors including irrigation method soil characteristics crop type and crop growth stage climate conditions soil and crop management practices effectiveness of irrigation management irrigation method etc on a rough estimate in the united states about 42 of the total water withdrawal is for irrigation purposes ers 2015 which is experiencing increasing pressure for improved efficiency to produce significantly more food and fiber and other commodities in addition to proper assessment forecasting planning effectively managing limited freshwater resources requires transparency in accounting and analysis of irrigation water withdrawal and use characteristics at appropriate scales this immense and critical task is typically accomplished by site specific measurement of environmental biophysical and micrometeorological parameters or by estimation of irrigation water requirements by relying on empirical and other approaches irrigation water requirement in agriculture can be defined as the adequate amount of water that must be artificially supplied to the crop for achieving ideal crop growth quality and desired yield in cases where the amount of precipitation and stored soil water are not sufficient to meet crop water demand for achieving potential yield the primary unknown in order to accurately determining irrigation water requirement is crop water use or crop evapotranspiration etc which is driven by weather conditions solar radiation relative humidity air temperature wind speed vapor pressure deficit soil and crop management practices including tillage practices seeding rate row spacing etc crop type and growth including leaf area index leaf orientation etc soil properties soil texture field capcity permanent wilting point water holding capcity root development root density rooting depth soil water availability time of the year time of the day for hourly time step and other factors etc can be measured via advanced techniques such as lysimeters surface renewal bowen ratio energy balance systems and eddy correlation systems steduto and hsiao 1998 irmak and irmak 2008 irmak 2010 li et al 2008 snyder et al 1996 despite high representativeness and accuracy these measurement techniques can be quite laborious expensive require trained professionals time consuming and can be used only on certain areas due to their nature of operations as convenient alternatives estimation methods such as two step approach i e etc reference et x crop coefficient can be used to calculate etc however this approach is subject to assumptions that do not consider variability in soil and crop practices variety differences and other factors that different commercial fields are managed with moreover evaporative demand at a particular site may vary considerably than what is calculated at a nearby weather monitoring site due to microclimate impacts from specific management practices e g tillage irmak et al 2019 irrigation method cavero et al 2009 terrain characteristics etc this results in compromising of the site specificity of etc and irrigation requirements that are needed for precise assessment and management of water in producers fields in contrast several sensor technologies network and data advances make it possible to observe and record irrigation water withdrawal etc as well as irrigator behaviour at individual farms simultaneously by avoiding the complications encountered in the abovementioned technical approaches that rely on energy balance principles several critical variables that drive etc and irrigation water withdrawal can be measured independently and site specifically to render robust data on regional irrigation related characteristics in real or near real time these technologies include atmometers etgauges that can be deployed in field to measure site specific evaporative demand by closely resembling plant s resistance to etc alam and trooien 2001 magliulo et al 2003 irmak et al 2005a chen and robinson 2009 soil moisture sensors installed in the crop root zone to report soil water depletion wetzel and chang 1987 and precipitation gauges in addition measurement of flow rate and volume of water pumped by an individual producer aids in determining and improving irrigation water productivity iwp crop water productivity cwp determining pumping plant efficiency detecting various technical and operational well pump pipes and irrigation system malfunctions that result in improved irrigation water delivery and use a variety of flow measurement devices are available to measure instantaneous and total flow rate applied to a particular field throughout the growing season various state water management agencies such as water management districts natural resources districts nrds etc have been established to monitor irrigation water consumption by implementing the management plans and strategies in their specific areas in nebraska nrds regulate groundwater resources and department of natural resources dnr regulates surfacewater resources the difference between nrds and irrigation districts is that nrds are responsible for regulating groundwater and developing rules for withdrawal allocations etc whereas irrigation districts are usually responsible for delivering the water to the irrigators for example in nebraska regulations are imposed by nrds to install water meters on the irrigation systems which helps keep a check on producers to monitor and or limit their water withdrawal to the allocated amount with respect to the allocated amount however these rules and regulations vary in respective geographic areas of concern and are decided by the local nrds according to the requirements in the concerned area in some nrds flowmeters are required on all wells and or on new wells and some nrds require flowmeters in sub areas or in certain areas whereas irrigation water allocation moratorium rule are employed by some nrds for example in the larger republican river basin upper middle and lower republican nrds impose different amount of water allocations moratoriums based on the stakeholders advisory committee 2016 the lower republican nrd lrnrd established a moratorium restriction on the amount of water irrigators can pump during a given time on new irrigation well drilling on december 9 2002 no new irrigation wells have been drilled since that date district established a moratorium on adding new irrigated lands on december 31 2004 no new irrigated land has been added since that date all groundwater irrigated areas were certified in 2004 and all wells were metered by april 1 2005 the lower republican nrd has the lowest groundwater allocation in the state the present allocation is 230 mm yr nrd allocates a 5 year block for 1143 mm and the water may be used however the irrigator chooses during that 5 years unless there is an allocation cap nrd allows up to 230 mm to be carried over the end of an allocation period to the next allocation period unless otherwise provided imposition of penalties for exceeding the allocation amounts shall be at the discretion of the nrd board and may include but are not limited to a a reduction in whole or in part of a person s allocation of groundwater b a reduction in whole or in part of a person s certified irrigated acres and c decommissioning of water wells penalty for exceeding carry over include deducting 50 mm carryover deducted for every inch of carry over used above 190 mm the middle republican nrd mrnrd is and will continue to enforce all of the management actions that have been described in the handout such as moratorium on new irrigation wells and acres abiding our 4th generation of the integrated management plan helping producers with programs for their irrigated land implementing allocations and penalties and much more that we have been doing for years already within our district the mrnrd currently has 1524 5 yr allocation rule imposed in cases when unused amount of water remained from the allocated amount it is carried over to the next allocation cycle if an irrigator has exceeded his her allocation the allocation for the next allocation period shall be reduced by the number of acre inches by which said allocation was exceeded in the prior period a penalty of 25 4 mm for every inch over the first 76 mm and 50 mm for every mm over 76 mm of overuse will be applied moratoriums in the republican river basin do not consider the cropping pattern grown in a given year although most district has maize soybean rotation based on the republican river basin wide plan 2018 the upper republican nrd urnrd has prohibited new irrigation wells since 1998 any replacement irrigation well replacement livestock well replacement industrial well or replacement public water system must be at least 183 m from any domestic well or range livestock well 805 m from a public water supply well and 305 from any irrigation well commercial livestock well or industrial well no wells can be connected without prior approval from the urnrd in all three nrds any person who violates a cease and desist order issued by the district pursuant to neb rev stat 46 707 h may be subject to a civil penalty assessed pursuant to neb rev stat 46 745 to monitor water withdrawal by irrigators nrd personnel travel long distances and manually read the meters installed at the registered wells once a year after the irrigation season and record the readings these readings are used to keep a check on the water pumped to keep a sustainable balance between water use and water supply which ensures the region s economic viability social and environmental health environmental services safety and welfare these practices of manual data collection though effective are very labor intensive and expensive it is also subject to human error and annual readings are not enough to provide sufficient information to find the relation between the water usage during the crop growing season and crop water requirements furthermore these manual readings provide data and information only after the season is over and are not effective to make in season or real time monitoring or assessments taking totalized readings only once a year after the irrigation season does not provide detailed data on how water is used during the crop growing season in relation to crop water requirements this critically important need to better assess forecast and manage water resources can be fulfilled by implementing an automated water use monitoring and data collection system which can compile record and communicate irrigation flow rate water withdrawal data along with critical site specific drivers of irrigation water use recent developments of smart meter technologies that are capable of remotely reading meters in real time and archiving the records in a central database provides great opportunity to change the way irrigation water use is monitored and documented the smart meter technology is already being used by public utility providers electricity gas domestic water supply to reduce the expenses of periodic trips to each physical location to read a meter the new technologies transmit hourly water consumption data to the city s billing system by wireless network this real time water use information allows city s water managers to monitor water use and detect leaks and other issues quickly water consumers are also able to view their daily water usage data online and learn ways to conserve water despite the great potential of smart meter to provide reliable and real time water use information the technology has not been applied in the management of irrigation water use by irrigation and water resources management organizations application of this technology in the management of the nation s irrigation water use has several potential benefits including reduced cost of data collection documentation and analyses and real time data for better irrigation management strategies in addition to irrigation water use data other information such as rainfall soil moisture and etc are required for management and performance evaluation of irrigation systems when such data are measured by sensors with wireless data transmission capability it becomes possible to automate the collection documentation and storage of the data to a central database the timely water use information coupled with analysis can give both irrigation managers and farmers better control of water use smart meter technologies allow farmers to view their irrigation information through handheld mobile and network technologies via wired or wireless platforms radio frequency or powerline transmission in this research we demonstrated the use of such an automated system to analyze irrigation analytics across commercial agricultural production fields within an important irrigated crop production region i e republican river basin nebraska united states which is divided into three natural resources districts nrds among which mrnrd is the largest and intensively irrigated the largest source of irrigation water in the mrnrd is groundwater with 3000 registered wells and the area is facing significant challenges associated with water needs and quality the objectives of this research were to demonstrate the deployment and use of a novel and an automated near real time water withdrawal and use monitoring and data collection system and decipher the complex irrigator behavior and pattern of irrigation water use in the region specifically critical aspects of regional irrigation are studied such as the start and termination of irrigation season frequency of the irrigation in a crop growing season and depth of irrigation water applied finally irrigation water depths directly observed at producer fields were compared and assessed against irrigation requirement estimates obtained using viable and scientific methodologies the irrigator behaviour in decision making is assessed against both true irrigation requirements as well as water allocation moratorium such large scale deployment of technologies and extensive water withdrawal and use analyses on large scale production fields as well as irrigator behaviors with respect to water allocations are unique and have not been studied before the anticipated benefits from this project are reduced cost of data collection documentation and analyses real time data availability for better irrigation management strategies improvement in groundwater quality from reduced irrigation and reduced chemical leaching potential to water resources and reduced soil erosion from reduced runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the republican river basin is located along the border of kansas and nebraska and encompasses portions of three states the total drainage area sums up to 64 800 km2 of which 31 is in northeastern colorado 30 in northwestern kansas and 39 in southwestern nebraska fig 1 the drainage area within nebraska overlaps with four natural resources districts nrds upper republican middle republican lower republican and tri basin nrd while smaller areas also overlap with little blue and twin platte nrds the area for this research is the mrnrd the mrnrd encompasses all of hayes hitchcock and red willow counties most of frontier and the southern one third of lincoln county fig 1 the total land area covered by mrnrd is 9950 km2 995 332 ha comprising of 53 of rangeland and 46 of cropland the major crops in this region are maize winter wheat sorghum and soybean the growing season generally lasts between 150 and 160 days the major soil types in the area are a coly uly and colby ulysses

546 mm and 10 1 c respectively prism 2021 over 3000 registered irrigation wells in the mrnrd fig 1 are required to be equipped with a flowmeter for this research 31 fields that have well permits were selected for a 3 year pilot assessment distributed across mrnrd twentysix fields were irrigated with center pivots 3 with gravity surface and 2 with subsurface drip irrigation sdi fig 1 geographical details of the research fields are provided in table 1 2 2 instrumentation and data sources 2 2 1 instrumentation and development of irrigation water use data acquisition system in this research all producer collaborators fields were named with their respective irrigation method such as center pivot irrigation p1 p2 gravity furrow irrigation g1 g2 and subsurface drip irrigation s1 s2 table 1 to avoid using actual producers names these field names were also used in the telemetry and online cloud platforms to protect the identity and privacy of the collaborators the irrigation water use data acquisition system was designed to automate the gathering of irrigation water use and other information such as rainfall crop type planting date etc and soil moisture data into a central irrigation water use database platform the system uses the most appropriate and cost effective yet advanced satellite telemetry wireless technology for delivering up to date irrigation water flow soil moisture etc and rainfall data from the sensors installed in the field to a central monitoring computer the components of the irrigation water use data acquisition system are shown in picture 1 all research fields were equipped with flowmeters on the irrigation pipelines to measure record and communicate irrigation flow data every 15 min the telemetry system allows monitoring water withdrawal quantities and enables to set alerts alarms to indicate high or low water withdrawal which can be concurrently tracked for each field the collected data are processed and output via easy to understand graphs showing the irrigation water pumped in each farm in relation to water allocation limits crop water use and average irrigation withdrawals of the neighboring farms farmers can login to the system online using a username and password to view their own irrigation water withdrawal data and associated information the research used the existing totalizer flowmeters tfm installed in the research fields the flowmeters were propeller type manufactured by mccrometer great plains meter inc aurora ne usa and have a measurement accuracy of 2 of discharge and repeatability of 0 25 to obtain this accuracy of discharge we ensured that the tfm were installed correctly following the manufacturer s specifications at each selected irrigation well a tfm was installed inline in a full flowing acceptable test section of pipe on the discharge side of the pump where the measurement of water velocity was made picture 2 the flowmeter location was in a straight constant diameter length of pipeline without turbulence to prevent obstructions elbows valves pumps and changes in pipe diameter for a certain distance upstream and downstream from the flowmeter installation point distances required usually were related to the diameter of the discharge pipe at the measurement location the desired distance upstream for the flowmeters without a straightening vane installed was 10 pipe diameters and for flowmeters with a straightening vane it was 5 pipe diameters to allow automated flowmeter readings data logging and telemetry transmission a pulse transmitter unit was installed at the bases of the existing flowmeters picture 3 the transmitter unit transmits pulses representing irrigation flow rate pulse range 4 20 ma to the telemetry unit through a cable on site calibration was performed for each installed pulse transmitter unit in each field the remote telemetry units rtus used in this data acquisition system was standalone gprs stations model a755 gprs sdi 12 adcon telemetry vienna austria picture 3 each station has two input ports and was connected through cables to receive data signals from the flowmeter and from either rain gauges or atmometers etgauge as needed data signals are first stored in the memory of an rtu an rtu has its own intelligence in the form of a built in microcontroller which periodically performs several tasks for example it interrogates the sensors stores the measured data and checks the local battery status continuously rtu is equipped with a gsm modem which allows for real time wireless communication with a base station reverse communication is also possible from the base station the stations were configured to record data with 15 min intervals and set to deliver the recorded data to the telemetry gateway at hourly intervals to provide near real time data the power for the unit comes from an internal nimh battery which is charged using a compact solar panel rain gauge model rg1 200 mccrometer inc aurora ne usa that was used is compatible with the rtu and has a capacity to maintain an accuracy of within 2 of rainfall up to 60 mm etgauge is an et measurement device in the local field conditions the electronic version of etgauge model e etgauge company loveland co usa was used it has a performance accuracy of 1 of evaporated water the watermark soil moisture sensors irrometer co riverside ca usa were used to measure soil matric potential kpa in each field and sensors were connected to watermark monitor dataloggers model 900 m irrometer co riverside ca usa to log soil moisture data on an hourly basis smp data were converted to soil water content vol using the soil water retention curves developed by irmak 2019a 2019b for the research area soils for each field telemetry gateway model a850 adcon telemetry austria was used in the research picture 3 it forms the core of the data acquisition system as a base station the gateway acts as a network controller and at regular intervals typically 15 min but this can be changed it requests data via modem from the rtus in the field network the gateway also stores the incoming data in its memory allowing it to supervise large numbers of rtus and keep their data for a period of time before data are downloaded to a proserver for long term storage in a central database and for processing one telemetry gateway model a850 can handle up to 1000 rtu field stations communication between the remote telemetry unit and the telemetry gateway is through cellular communication system s global system for mobile communication this data acquisition system is run by the addvantage pro software adcon telemetry vienna austria which controls various functions in the rtus and the gateway picture 4 the software collects data from the telemetry gateways and makes it available for viewing or for specialized analysis the server is responsible for downloading data from the telemetry gateway storing into the database starting and stopping raw data processing and servicing clients as they connect to the system 2 2 2 meteorological data field specific measurements of soil matric potential evaporative demand and precipitation four agricultural weather stations were selected for the computation of reference and crop evapotranspiration for this purpose daily weather data from 2013 to 2015 at brule plate valley champion mccook and dickens sites were obtained from the high plains regional climatic center automated weather data network hprcc awdn the meteorological variables included in this dataset were maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed relative humidity and incoming shortwave radiation the magnitudes of average growing season meteorological variables recorded at each site for the three growing seasons are presented in table 2 crop growing season was considered as may 1 to september 20 based on the most common historical planting and harvesting dates in the region smp in each field was measured on an hourly basis using watermark granular matrix sensors installed at four depths in the root zone profile 30 60 90 and 120 cm etgauges were installed in five representative fields for site specific reference et measurements designed to simulate et from plant canopy in a way that closely mimics plant s resistance to et irmak et al 2005a 2005b tipping bucket rain gauges were also installed in these five representative fields for site specific precipitation data geographic information system gis based tools were used to record organize and analyze these datasets geographically within the research area the management practices adopted by individual growers which included crop type acreage and cultivar information maturity planting and harvesting dates seeding rate tillage practices fertilizer type and application crop yield etc were obtained via personal communication with the producer partners 2 3 crop classification information on the crop grown in the selected fields was obtained through the use of survey forms circulated and collected annually additionally the cropland data layer cdl provided by usda nass was considered as an appropriate tool to collect crop type information the cdl is a raster based geo referenced crop specific land cover data layer created annually for the continental united states using moderate resolution satellite imagery and extensive agricultural ground truthing data cdl derived crop type data were verified against survey collected crop type data and a perfect agreement was found for available 51 field year combinations ensuring confidence in use of cdl data the total number of fields planted with maize was 28 90 in 2013 24 77 in 2014 and 21 67 in 2015 and soybean was 3 10 in 2013 7 23 in 2014 and 7 23 in 2015 table 3 additionally there were 3 10 fields in 2015 cultivated with winter wheat however our analyses was limited to the fields growing maize and soybean due to their dominance in the region 2 4 precipitation and site specific reference evapotranspiration the precipitation data were obtained from three sources noaa ghcn national oceanic and atmospheric administration global historical climatology network hprcc awdn and nerain nebraska rainfall assessment and information network among these sources 101 weather stations in 2013 99 in 2014 and 96 in 2015 were selected to determine precipitation depth for spatial interpolation a proportion of the selected weather station sites were outside the geographic boundary of the mrnrd ensuring accurate interpolation along the borders inverse distance weighing idw interpolation technique was implemented for spatial interpolation using the spatial analyst toolset provided in arcgis 10 2 arcgis 10 2 esri redlands california interpolation resulted in 459 spatial datasets rasters of daily precipitation for the region across the research period which were used to develop monthly and growing season total precipitation

intercomparisons between etgauge measured at field p2 and asce ewri pm estimated eto at dickens hprcc weather site for three research years were made fig 2 a strong agreement was observed among the measured and estimated eto with a mean rmse of 0 99 mm d 1 and r2 ranging from 0 78 to 0 88 indicating that estimated eto can serve as a proxy for the measured eto or vice versa with good accuracy for

the different growth stages of the crop as well as varies with climate soil crop type and varieties irrigation methods and management practices the crop growth is generally divided into four stages initial stage crop developmental stage mid season stage and late season stage in this research the crop coefficient curves maize and soybean were used as the function of days after planting dap as shown in fig 3 these curves were measured and developed by the senior author s irmak in nebraska as a part of the nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 project developed polynomial equations were used in this research to calculate kc values for maize the kc values were 0 15 0 20 in the initial stage and extended up to 1 02 in the mid season july again reducing to 0 48 in the late season for soybean the kc values start with 0 20 increasing up to 0 94 in july and decreasing to 0 28 in the late season the kc values reported in fig 3 are generally within the range of values reported in the literature sharma and irmak 2012a used the same crop coefficient equations to determine long term 1986 2009 growing season 1 may to 30 september etc and net irrigation requirements the actual plating dates were used for the fields for which the actual producer reported data were available which resulted in better field specific estimations 2 6

mean growing season precipitation across the mrnrd for the years 2013 2015 are presented in fig 4 growing season precipitation varied from 295 to 593 mm across the research region the year 2013 was the driest with mean precipitation of 301 mm across all the research fields the mean precipitation amounts in 2014 and 2015 were 423 mm and 418 mm respectively maximum precipitation was recorded in field s3 345 mm in 2013 field p26 546 mm in 2014 and field g3 508 mm in 2015 the fields g1 g2 g3 p16 p17 p23 p24 p25 with higher mean precipitation occurring in frontier county which lies in the eastern part of mrnrd fig 4 fields p26 and s1 lie in red willow county southeastern part of mrnrd and received highest precipitation in 2014 fig 5 presents the precipitation amounts at all the selected fields for the three growing seasons 3 2 initiation termination and length of irrigation season one of the most important decision in irrigation application is the onset and termination of the irrigation season the start of irrigation in a season usually depends on the antecedent moisture availability in the soil profile and crop growth stage the last irrigation of the season depends on the maturity stage of the crop soil water availability in the soil profile and evaporative demand since these factors are subject to change both spatially and temporally it is expected that the timing of first and last irrigation events would also vary in different fields primarily these dates depend on the management practices of the irrigator as well as the planting date and climate conditions the planting dates varied from april 26 to may 21 between the research fields the first and last irrigation in a season was tracked from the data communicated via the telemetry system for all three years figs 6 and 7 show the first and last irrigation respectively represented as days after planting dap it was observed that the first irrigation varied from 4 to 82 dap fig 6 in 2013 55 6 out of 11 producers irrigated from 50 to 60 dap 27 of them irrigated from 41 to 44 dap whereas two of them fields p15 and s1 irrigated at 70 and 82 dap respectively in 2014 three of them were irrigating at 45 46 and 47 dap respectively field p26 was irrigated 4 dap which was very early in the season whereas field p16 was irrigated on 65 dap in 2015 eight fields were irrigated first time on 38 54 dap and the gravity field g1 was irrigated on 67 dap similarly the last day of irrigation was also observed for the same fields the last day of irrigation in all the three years ranged from 112 field g2 to 141 field p3 dap fig 7 which is a duration of 49 days almost 90 of the fields in 2013 terminated irrigations between 118 and 136 dap with the exception of field g2 in which irrigation was terminated 112 dap in 2014 the range was between 114 dap and 135 dap in 2015 78 of the fields terminated irrigation season between 125 dap to 131 dap whereas fields p1 and p3 applied their last irrigation on 137 and 141 dap respectively fig 7 length of irrigation season defined as the total number of days that water was pumped for the purpose of irrigation in a season the number of fields selected in this analysis were 25 in 2013 25 in 2014 and 22 in 2015 from the common period may 1 to september 20 in all three years the maximum and minimum length of irrigation season was observed in sdi irrigated field s3 86 days in 2015 and gravity field g2 14 days in 2014 respectively fig 8 a significant difference was observed in the length of irrigation season among the selected fields demonstrating the role of management practices climatic variables and irrigator s decision making in irrigation application for example in field s3 the length of irrigation season in 2015 was quite high as compared with 2013 and 2014 which increased the irrigation depth applied in 2015 however the precipitation was 32 mm higher in 2015 than in 2013 and was 61 mm lower than in 2014 hence it was observed that precipitation timing or amount likely has little impact on the irrigator s decision making instead the observed differences in the initiation termination and length of irrigation season across fields that were even planted within the same time frame last week of april to the first week of may demonstrates the role of individual decision making of the irrigator this can vary almost arbitrarily across irrigators most likely due to their time share among other activities on the farm such as fertilizer application pesticide applications fungicide application tillage and other soil and crop management practices 3 3 frequency distribution of irrigation applications in the research region the crop planting dates usually range from the last week of april to the first week of may most producers planting at the same date with same or similar varieties would also need to irrigate at the same time especially the ones experiencing the same distribution of precipitation and evaporative demand simultaneous irrigation application by a high proportion of producers not only results in high water abstractions from the aquifer but also increases the energy demand at that particular time it remains crucial to determine the peak water demand and its timing in a particular region for efficient allocation by the authorities fig 9 shows the percentage of irrigation systems operating during each month of the growing season it was observed that july and august were the months when the highest number of irrigation systems 70 90 were operational in all three years however in september which is the last month of the growing season 71 45 and 61 of the systems were operating in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the lowest number of irrigation systems that was in operation was in may due to early crop growth not requiring supplemental moisture other than contribution from stored crop root zone moisture from spring precipitation in fact there were no irrigation systems operating in 2013 in may and a small percentage in 2014 23 and even smaller percentage 16 in 2015 on average of three years most of the precipitation occurred in may 104 mm and june 109 mm and lowest occurred in july 55 mm august 80 mm and september 34 mm when plant leaf area index and consequently etc rates are the highest 3 4 depth of irrigation applied the irrigation systems selected for irrigation depth calculations were 25 in 2013 25 in 2014 and 22 in 2015 the information on crop type in each field and each season is presented in table 3 the total water depths applied by all individual irrigators in each season are shown in fig 10 along with the mean annual allocated moratorium irrigation depth black line by mrnrd the irrigation amount allocated to each irrigator in mrnrd is 1524 mm per five years or a annual mean allocated depth of 305 mm assuming uniform annual distribution there were considerable differences in irrigation applications between the fields for the same crop type and between the years for the same fields in 2013 nine of the 25 cp fields were irrigated by approximately 300 mm or more approaching the mean allocated depth gravity system fields were irrigated considerably more than the cp fields by about 90 mm in 2013 field p9 was irrigated with 386 mm which was the only cp field irrigated significantly higher than its neighbors as well as more than the annually allocated irrigation depth in 2013 however about 40 of the selected fields were irrigated less than 200 mm in 2013 the irrigation depth in gravity system field g2 was reduced to 345 mm in 2014 and 307 mm in 2015 as compared with 391 mm in 2013 however in field g1 the irrigation was increased to 415 mm in 2015 as compared with 390 mm in 2013 in the cp fields in 2014 the irrigation depth was almost equal or more than the previous year field p9 p5 and p10 were irrigated the most with 398 375 and 352 mm respectively in 2014 in 2015 irrigation depth in field p1 was about 500 mm which was considerably higher than the previous two years and all other selected fields however most of the systems irrigated around or less than 300 mm in contrast to the field p9 for which the irrigation depth was around 400 mm in all the three consecutive years fig 10 in sdi fields s1 and s3 the irrigation depth was 164 and 199 mm in 2013 and 208 and 195 mm in 2014 respectively which was considerably less than the gravity and center pivot fields there was no difference observed in irrigation depth due to the crop type planted in the research fields the average irrigation depth was observed to be 243 264 and 284 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively there were 40 of fields each year exceeding the mean annual allocated irrigation depth threshold 3 5 evaporative demand and crop evapotranspiration etc daily etr values in the growing period april 27 to september 20 for each year are presented in fig 11 daily etr values of all the four stations were observed to be very similar to each other and the variability observed in seasonal etr was not higher than the inter annual variability observed at an individual site indicating that etr did not vary substantially across the mrnrd since computation of reference et requires extensive climate data measurements and the region did not have adequate number density of these measurement sites the computation of field scale etr was not carried out the black line in fig 11 represents the average etr values of all four stations for the three consecutive growing seasons the growing season total etr for 2013 2014 and 2015 was 1175 1005 and 958 mm respectively the most probable reasons for the higher etr in 2013 can be the warmer air temperatures higher solar radiation higher wind speed higher vapor pressure deficit and lower relative humidity as compared with 2014 and 2015 table 2 average daily maize and soybean etc along with standard deviation among the thirty one fields for three research years is presented in fig 12 for maize the growing season total etc ranged from 676 to 756 mm in 2013 615 659 mm in 2014 and 608 624 mm in 2015 with an average of 733 648 and 621 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively for soybean the growing season total etc ranged from 629 to 680 mm in 2013 535 597 mm in 2014 and 544 571 mm in 2015 with an average of 663 577 and 560 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively on average maize etc was 10 higher than the soybean etc in all three years similar to the results found in sharma and irmak 2012b for the long term 1986 2009 large scale assessments for mrnrd area etc in 2013 was relatively higher than in 2014 and 2015 for both crops the average etc for maize in 2013 was 85 mm and 112 mm higher than those determined for 2014 and 2015 respectively for soybean average etc was 86 mm and 103 mm higher in 2013 than in 2014 and 2015 respectively the etc variations observed within the fields were primarily due to the differences in the planting dates and the crop type as other parameters variables were similar for all fields 3 6 calculated irrigation requirement vs producers actual application the actual irrigation depth applied for each field was compared to the computed irrigation water requirements as estimated using two step approach and the soil water balance fig 13 that used information and data obtained specifically for each field in 2013 irrigation requirement was greater than irrigation applied in all fields except field g2 in 2014 and 2015 irrigation applied exceeded the irrigation water requirements in 80 of the fields there were three fields in 2014 and in 2015 where irrigation requirement was more than actual amount of irrigation water applied on average irrigation requirement in maize fields were 394 242 and 184 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively whereas the average amount of irrigation water withdrawal was 267 292 and 264 mm in the same years respectively similarly irrigation requirement in soybean fields was 307 163 and 219 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively whereas the average amount of water pumped was 234 251 and 274 mm in the same years respectively it is observed that on average maize irrigation requirement was 61 and 47 in 2014 and 2015 respectively as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied was 109 and 99 in 2014 and 2015 respectively as compared with 2013 similarly soybean irrigation requirement was 53 and 71 in 2014 and 2015 respectively as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied was 107 and 117 in 2014 and 2015 respectively as compared with 2013 the inter annual variation in irrigation requirement was substantial but it was relatively insignificant in irrigation application given the same site characteristics irrigation requirement is mostly affected by environmental factors such as evaporative water demand vapor pressure deficit precipitation and stored soil water the magnitudes of these variables were considerably different between the three years which govern the magnitude of irrigation requirement ideally the changes in irrigation requirement should be reflected in irrigation application by producers provided that continuous and appropriate monitoring of soil moisture and or crop water use is performed as these metrics will respond to the various factors governing plant water uptake in contrast to this our observations of irrigation application show that most producers did not consider following any established irrigation scheduling approach resulting in suboptimal greater or lower amount of water being applied to their fields for example field p10 was under irrigated by 78 mm in 2013 while it was over irrigated by 70 mm in 2014 and by 105 mm in 2015 field p3 was under irrigated by 210 104 and 35 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively sdi irrigated field s3 was under irrigated by 170 mm in 2013 whereas it was over irrigated by 73 and 42 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively indicating the need for implementing agricultural water management technologies and associated educational programs training and demonstrations to enable optimum use of limited water resources and enhance crop water productivity 3 7 applied irrigation water vs water allocation fig 14 shows the cumulative amount of water pumped in each field in three years along with the allocated water per five years as well as an annual mean allocated water assuming uniform distribution of 305 mm per year there were few fields that pumping more irrigation water than allocated in 2013 which increased in 2014 there were seven fields in 2015 which crossed the 3rd year mean allocated amount with the field p9 almost pumping the fourth year allocated amount according to the trend observed in fig 14 it is expected that a reasonable proportion of fields would have exceeded the five year allocated water depth in the region nevertheless 70 of the producers applied irrigation water well within their restricted water allocations if producers pumped more than 305 mm of water per year for multiple years they risk consuming their 5 year allocation sooners which also risks not having enough or any water available for crop production in the 4th and or 5th year which can have significant negative consequences to farm income thus implementing scientifically based water management technologies and strategies to account for stored soil moisture and effective use of precipitation as well as implanting effective soil management practices e g reduced till or no till can aid not only increasing crop water productivity but can aid in ensuring the total allocated water amount can be used appropriately in a given year 4 summary and conclusions field specific irrigation water withdrawal and use data are essential for effective agricultural water management and for development of policies and regulations governing the use of water predicting changes in water demand in response to changing climatic conditions cropping systems and irrigation management scenarios good decision making in irrigation water management is dependent upon data that can provide real time information about crop water needs irrigation applications crop growth and development stage and weather patterns irrigation water use data are also used to more effectively manage finite groundwater supplies in regions where surface and groundwater supplies are either over appropriated demand exceeds supply or fully appropriated demand are supply are critically equal the field specific automated irrigation water use monitoring and data collection system deployed in this research provide real time and site specific metrics reflecting irrigation analytics and irrigator behavior throughout the growing season various metrics calculated from the obtained datasets such as initiation termination and length duration of irrigation season irrigation application frequency and irrigation depth show that there can be substantial farm to farm heterogeneity even within relatively small irrigated regions thus it is challenging to robustly benchmark regional water footprint and irrigator behavior across larger scales owing to the high degree of farm to farm variability unaccounted variables irrigation vs other farm operations that are used or not used for decision making by irrigators surprisingly it was also observed that irrigation depths estimated using scientifically based and widely used procedures such as the two step approach of computing etc and site specific soil water balance showed little agreement with actual applied irrigation depths by the producers only few farms followed the trend of year to year and farm to farm variation captured in estimated irrigation depths monitoring and accounting for farm specific evaporative demand soil moisture and precipitation amounts did not lead to accurate representation of irrigator decisions this observation is strong evidence that irrigation decisions by users are not backed by data and scientific protocols and are largely driven by condition of crop feel of soil personal calendar schedule neighbor practices or no irrigation management protocol at al despite increase in technologies that can be used for agricultural water management decision making in this research irrigator decisions did not seem to reasonably follow patterns of water use metrics like soil moisture and or crop water use or evaporative demand thus standard estimations of crop water footprint should be carefully assessed prior to representing actual water use across large regions our observations demonstrate the need for greater momentum for real time monitoring of farm level irrigation dynamics and their integrative reporting advances in internet of things iot can be leveraged to connect these data streams to effectively report privately or publicly host and utilize quantitative information on irrigation water use and irrigation behavior across agroecosystems automated water dynamics system deployed in this research can aid in more

9330,effective agricultural water management requires accurate continuous and transparent accounting of water use in irrigated agroecosystems especially in water limited regions where moratoriums may be imposed advances in sensor technologies networking and data analytics can aid in fulfilling this task by automatically collecting analyzing and reporting real time data to infer irrigators practices and behaviors crop water requirements water applications and use in this research an automated irrigation water withdrawal and water use monitoring and data collection system was deployed to monitor actual irrigation dynamics for 31 commercial and large scale agricultural production fields for three consecutive years production scale fields representing a total of 1050 ha included center pivot p gravity surface furrow g and subsurface drip irrigated s fields on average irrigation was initiated 40 70 days after planting dap and terminated by 120 140 dap the proportion of irrigation systems operating simultaneously and peak water abstraction were highest 70 90 during july and august mean depth of water applied across all fields was 243 264 and 284 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively site specific monitoring of precipitation soil moisture and evaporative demand and a soil water balance model resulted in mean seasonal irrigation requirement estimates of 394 242 and 184 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively for maize and 307 163 and 219 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively for soybean despite reduction of calculated mean irrigation requirement in 2014 and 2015 by 40 50 actual irrigation applications by producers did not change considerably and irrigation applied exceeded irrigation water requirements in 80 of the fields suggesting needs for irrigation water management technology implementation and associated educational programs in the region some fields showed irrigation applications exceeding the mean annual allocated moratorium irrigation depth 305 mm implying that irrigation decisions are still largely driven by non scientific and or technical methods while substantial farm to farm heterogeneity makes it challenging to robustly benchmarking regional water footprint and irrigator behavior it also creates an opportunity for developing and implementing methodologies and strategies for real time monitoring of farm level irrigation dynamics new advances in technologies with telemetry capabilities as well as internet of things iots can be leveraged to effectively create databases track and compare water usage to better plan allocate distribute monitor and manage limited water resources for enhancing agricultural productivity these processes can also be used for education and demonstration for irrigation professionals to enhance adoption of such technologies this research has the potential for technology and strategy transfer for advanced water management to other regions in the united states and globally keywords automation evapotranspiration irrigation maize soil moisture soybean telemetry water management 1 introduction due to the nature of the novel goal of producing food fiber and fuel demand of rapidly growing world s population agricultural irrigation in many cases is the largest customer of global freshwater resources with 70 80 of the total water withdrawal from ground and surface water resources globally oecd 2021 gordon et al 2010 in many cases it is stated by different researchers scientists and other non experts in water resources engineering agricultural water management agricultural engineering disciplines that irrigated agriculture consumes 70 80 of water withdrawn water resources which is not accurate and is misleading as not all water withdrawn from ground or surface water resources is consumed by plants and a considerable portion of water withdrawn and delivered to the production fields through irrigation systems returns to its sources the amount of water withdrawn that returns to the source is a function of numerous factors including irrigation method soil characteristics crop type and crop growth stage climate conditions soil and crop management practices effectiveness of irrigation management irrigation method etc on a rough estimate in the united states about 42 of the total water withdrawal is for irrigation purposes ers 2015 which is experiencing increasing pressure for improved efficiency to produce significantly more food and fiber and other commodities in addition to proper assessment forecasting planning effectively managing limited freshwater resources requires transparency in accounting and analysis of irrigation water withdrawal and use characteristics at appropriate scales this immense and critical task is typically accomplished by site specific measurement of environmental biophysical and micrometeorological parameters or by estimation of irrigation water requirements by relying on empirical and other approaches irrigation water requirement in agriculture can be defined as the adequate amount of water that must be artificially supplied to the crop for achieving ideal crop growth quality and desired yield in cases where the amount of precipitation and stored soil water are not sufficient to meet crop water demand for achieving potential yield the primary unknown in order to accurately determining irrigation water requirement is crop water use or crop evapotranspiration etc which is driven by weather conditions solar radiation relative humidity air temperature wind speed vapor pressure deficit soil and crop management practices including tillage practices seeding rate row spacing etc crop type and growth including leaf area index leaf orientation etc soil properties soil texture field capcity permanent wilting point water holding capcity root development root density rooting depth soil water availability time of the year time of the day for hourly time step and other factors etc can be measured via advanced techniques such as lysimeters surface renewal bowen ratio energy balance systems and eddy correlation systems steduto and hsiao 1998 irmak and irmak 2008 irmak 2010 li et al 2008 snyder et al 1996 despite high representativeness and accuracy these measurement techniques can be quite laborious expensive require trained professionals time consuming and can be used only on certain areas due to their nature of operations as convenient alternatives estimation methods such as two step approach i e etc reference et x crop coefficient can be used to calculate etc however this approach is subject to assumptions that do not consider variability in soil and crop practices variety differences and other factors that different commercial fields are managed with moreover evaporative demand at a particular site may vary considerably than what is calculated at a nearby weather monitoring site due to microclimate impacts from specific management practices e g tillage irmak et al 2019 irrigation method cavero et al 2009 terrain characteristics etc this results in compromising of the site specificity of etc and irrigation requirements that are needed for precise assessment and management of water in producers fields in contrast several sensor technologies network and data advances make it possible to observe and record irrigation water withdrawal etc as well as irrigator behaviour at individual farms simultaneously by avoiding the complications encountered in the abovementioned technical approaches that rely on energy balance principles several critical variables that drive etc and irrigation water withdrawal can be measured independently and site specifically to render robust data on regional irrigation related characteristics in real or near real time these technologies include atmometers etgauges that can be deployed in field to measure site specific evaporative demand by closely resembling plant s resistance to etc alam and trooien 2001 magliulo et al

measurement of flow rate and volume of water pumped by an individual producer aids in determining and improving irrigation water productivity iwp crop water productivity cwp determining pumping plant efficiency detecting various technical and operational well pump pipes and irrigation system malfunctions that result in improved irrigation water delivery and use a variety of flow measurement devices are available to measure instantaneous and total flow rate applied to a particular field throughout the growing season various state water management agencies such as water management districts natural resources districts nrds etc have been established to monitor irrigation water consumption by implementing the management plans and strategies in their specific areas in nebraska nrds regulate groundwater resources and department of natural resources dnr regulates surfacewater resources the difference between nrds and irrigation districts is that nrds are responsible for regulating groundwater and developing rules for withdrawal allocations etc whereas irrigation districts are usually responsible for delivering the water to the irrigators for example in nebraska regulations are imposed by nrds to install water meters on the irrigation systems which helps keep a check on producers to monitor and or limit their water withdrawal to the allocated amount with respect to the allocated amount however these rules and regulations vary in respective geographic areas of concern and are decided by the local nrds according to the requirements in the concerned area in some nrds flowmeters are required on all wells and or on new wells and some nrds require flowmeters in sub areas or in certain areas whereas irrigation water allocation moratorium rule are employed by some nrds for example in the larger republican river basin upper middle and lower republican nrds impose different amount of water allocations moratoriums based on the stakeholders advisory committee 2016 the lower republican nrd lrnrd established a moratorium restriction on the amount of water irrigators can pump during a given time on new irrigation well drilling on december 9 2002 no new irrigation wells have been drilled since that date district established a moratorium on adding new irrigated lands on december 31 2004 no new irrigated land has been added since that date all groundwater irrigated areas were certified in 2004 and all wells were metered by april 1 2005 the lower republican nrd has the lowest groundwater allocation in the state the present allocation is 230 mm yr nrd allocates a 5 year block for 1143 mm and the water may be used however the irrigator chooses during that 5 years unless there is an allocation cap nrd allows up to 230 mm to be carried over the end of an allocation period to the next allocation period unless otherwise provided imposition of penalties for exceeding the allocation amounts shall be at the discretion of the nrd board and may include but are not limited to a a reduction in whole or in part of a person s allocation of groundwater b a reduction in whole or in part of a person s certified irrigated acres and c decommissioning of water wells penalty for exceeding carry over include deducting 50 mm carryover deducted for every inch of carry over used above 190 mm the middle republican nrd mrnrd is and will continue to enforce all of the management actions that have been described in the handout such as moratorium on new irrigation wells and acres abiding our 4th generation of the integrated management plan helping producers with programs for their irrigated land implementing allocations and penalties and much more that we have been doing for years already within our district the mrnrd currently has 1524 5 yr allocation rule imposed in cases when unused amount of water remained from the allocated amount it is carried over to the next allocation cycle if an irrigator has exceeded his her allocation the allocation for the next allocation period shall be reduced by the number of acre inches by which said allocation was exceeded in the prior period a penalty of 25 4 mm for every inch over the first 76 mm and 50 mm for every mm over 76 mm of overuse will be applied moratoriums in the republican river basin do not consider the cropping pattern grown in a given year although most district has maize soybean rotation based on the republican river basin wide plan 2018 the upper republican nrd urnrd has prohibited new irrigation wells since 1998 any replacement irrigation well replacement livestock well replacement industrial well or replacement public water system must be at least 183 m from any domestic well or range livestock well 805 m from a public water supply well and 305 from any irrigation well commercial livestock well or industrial well no wells can be connected without prior approval from the urnrd in all three nrds any person who violates a cease and desist order issued by the district pursuant to neb rev stat 46 707 h may be subject to a civil penalty assessed pursuant to neb rev stat 46 745 to monitor water withdrawal by irrigators nrd personnel travel long distances and manually read the meters installed at the registered wells once a year after the irrigation season and record the readings these readings are used to keep a check on the water pumped to keep a sustainable balance between water use and water supply which ensures the region s economic viability social and environmental health environmental services safety and welfare these practices of manual data collection though effective are very labor intensive and expensive it is also subject to human error and annual readings are not enough to provide sufficient information to find the relation between the water usage during the crop growing season and crop water requirements furthermore these manual readings provide data and information only after the season is over and are not effective to make in season or real time monitoring or assessments taking totalized readings only once a year after the irrigation season does not provide detailed data on how water is used during the crop growing season in relation to crop water requirements this critically important need to better assess forecast and manage water resources can be fulfilled by implementing an automated water use monitoring and data collection system which can compile record and communicate irrigation flow rate water withdrawal data along with critical site specific drivers of irrigation water use recent developments of smart meter technologies that are capable of remotely reading meters in real time and archiving the records in a central database provides great opportunity to change the way irrigation water use is monitored and documented the smart meter technology is already being used by public utility providers electricity gas domestic water supply to reduce the expenses of periodic trips to each physical location to read a meter the new technologies transmit hourly water consumption data to the city s billing system by wireless network this real time water use information allows city s water managers to monitor water use and detect leaks and other issues quickly water consumers are also able to view their daily water usage data online and learn ways to conserve water despite the great potential of smart meter to provide reliable and real time water use information the technology has not been applied in the management of irrigation water use by irrigation and water resources management organizations application of this technology in the management of the nation s irrigation water use has several potential benefits including reduced cost of data collection documentation and analyses and real time data for better irrigation management strategies in addition to irrigation water use data other information such as rainfall soil moisture and etc are required for management and performance evaluation of irrigation systems when such data are measured by sensors with wireless data transmission capability it becomes possible to automate the collection documentation and storage of the data to a central database the timely water use information coupled with analysis can give both irrigation managers and farmers better control of water use smart meter technologies allow farmers to view their irrigation information through handheld mobile and network technologies via wired or wireless platforms radio frequency or powerline transmission in this research we demonstrated the use of such an automated system to analyze irrigation analytics across commercial agricultural production fields within an important irrigated crop production region i e republican river basin nebraska united states which is divided into three natural resources districts nrds among which mrnrd is the largest and intensively irrigated the largest source of irrigation water in the mrnrd is groundwater with 3000 registered wells and the area is facing significant challenges associated with water needs and quality the objectives of this research were to demonstrate the deployment and use of a novel and an automated near real time water withdrawal and use monitoring and data collection system and decipher the complex irrigator behavior and pattern of irrigation water use in the region specifically critical aspects of regional irrigation are studied such as the start and termination of irrigation season frequency of the irrigation in a crop growing season and depth of irrigation water applied finally irrigation water depths directly observed at producer fields were compared and assessed against irrigation requirement estimates obtained using viable and scientific methodologies the irrigator behaviour in decision making is assessed against both true irrigation requirements as well as water allocation moratorium such large scale deployment of technologies and extensive water withdrawal and use analyses on large scale production fields as well as irrigator behaviors with respect to water allocations are unique and have not been studied before the anticipated benefits from this project are reduced cost of data collection documentation and analyses real time data availability for better irrigation management strategies improvement in groundwater quality from reduced irrigation and reduced chemical leaching potential to water resources and reduced soil erosion from reduced runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the

producer collaborators fields were named with their respective irrigation method such as center pivot irrigation p1 p2 gravity furrow irrigation g1 g2 and subsurface drip irrigation s1 s2 table 1 to avoid using actual producers names these field names were also used in the telemetry and online cloud platforms to protect the identity and privacy of the collaborators the irrigation water use data acquisition system was designed to automate the gathering of irrigation water use and other information such as rainfall crop type planting date etc and soil moisture data into a central irrigation water use database platform the system uses the most appropriate and cost effective yet advanced satellite telemetry wireless technology for delivering up to date irrigation water flow soil moisture etc and rainfall data from the sensors installed in the field to a central monitoring computer the components of the irrigation water use data acquisition system are shown in picture 1 all research fields were equipped with flowmeters on the irrigation pipelines to measure record and communicate irrigation flow data every 15 min the telemetry system allows monitoring water withdrawal quantities and enables to set alerts alarms to indicate high or low water withdrawal which can be concurrently tracked for each field the collected data are processed and output via easy to understand graphs showing the irrigation water pumped in each farm in relation to water allocation limits crop water use and average irrigation withdrawals of the neighboring farms farmers can login to the system online using a username and password to view their own irrigation water withdrawal data and associated information the research used the existing totalizer flowmeters tfm installed in the research fields the flowmeters were propeller type manufactured by mccrometer great plains meter inc aurora ne usa and have a measurement accuracy of 2 of discharge and repeatability of 0 25 to obtain this accuracy of discharge we ensured that the tfm were installed correctly following the manufacturer s specifications at each selected irrigation well a tfm was installed inline in a full flowing acceptable test section of pipe on the discharge side of the pump where the measurement of water velocity was made picture 2 the flowmeter location was in a straight constant diameter length of pipeline without turbulence to prevent obstructions elbows valves pumps and changes in pipe diameter for a certain distance upstream and downstream from the flowmeter installation point distances required usually were related to the diameter of the discharge pipe at the measurement location the desired distance upstream for the flowmeters without a straightening vane installed was 10 pipe diameters and for flowmeters with a straightening vane it was 5 pipe diameters to allow automated flowmeter readings data logging and telemetry transmission a pulse transmitter unit was installed at the bases of the existing flowmeters picture 3 the transmitter unit transmits pulses representing irrigation flow rate pulse range 4 20 ma to the telemetry unit through a cable on site calibration was performed for each installed pulse transmitter unit in each field the remote telemetry units rtus used in this data acquisition system was standalone gprs stations model a755 gprs sdi 12 adcon telemetry vienna austria picture 3 each station has two input ports and was connected through cables to receive data signals from the flowmeter and from either rain gauges or atmometers etgauge as needed data signals are first stored in the memory of an rtu an rtu has its own intelligence in the form of a built in microcontroller which periodically performs several tasks for example it interrogates the sensors stores the measured data and checks the local battery status continuously rtu is equipped with a gsm modem which allows for real time wireless communication with a base station reverse communication is also possible from the base station the stations were configured to record data with 15 min intervals and set to deliver the recorded data to the telemetry gateway at hourly intervals to provide near real time data the power for the unit comes from an internal nimh battery which is charged using a compact solar panel rain gauge model rg1 200 mccrometer inc aurora

electronic version of etgauge model e etgauge company loveland co usa was used it has a performance accuracy of 1 of evaporated water the watermark soil moisture sensors irrometer co riverside ca usa were used to measure soil matric potential kpa in each field and sensors were connected to watermark monitor dataloggers model 900 m irrometer co riverside ca usa to log soil moisture data on an hourly basis smp data were converted to soil water content vol using the soil water retention curves developed by irmak 2019a 2019b for the research area soils for each field telemetry gateway model a850 adcon telemetry austria was used in the research picture 3 it forms the core of the data acquisition system as a base station the gateway acts as a network controller and at regular intervals typically 15 min but this can be changed it requests data via modem from the rtus in the field network the gateway also stores the incoming data in its memory allowing it to supervise large numbers of rtus and keep their data for a period of time before data are downloaded to a proserver for long term storage in a central database and for processing one telemetry gateway model a850 can handle up to 1000 rtu field stations communication between the remote telemetry unit and the telemetry gateway is through cellular communication system s global system for mobile communication this data acquisition system is run by the addvantage pro software adcon telemetry vienna austria which controls various functions in the rtus and the gateway picture 4 the software collects data from the telemetry gateways and makes it available for viewing or for specialized analysis the server is responsible for downloading data from the telemetry gateway storing into the database starting and stopping raw data processing and servicing clients as they connect to the system 2 2 2 meteorological data field specific measurements of soil matric potential evaporative demand and precipitation four agricultural weather stations were selected for the computation of reference and crop evapotranspiration for this purpose daily weather data from 2013 to 2015 at brule plate valley champion mccook and dickens sites were obtained from the high plains regional climatic center automated weather data network hprcc awdn the meteorological variables included in this dataset were maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed relative humidity and incoming shortwave radiation the magnitudes of average growing season meteorological variables recorded at each site for the three growing seasons are presented in table 2 crop growing season was considered as may 1 to september 20 based on the most common historical planting and harvesting dates in the region smp in each field was measured on an hourly basis using watermark granular matrix sensors installed at four depths in the root zone profile 30 60 90 and 120 cm etgauges were installed in five representative fields for site specific reference et measurements designed to simulate et from plant canopy in a way that closely mimics plant s resistance to et irmak et al 2005a 2005b tipping bucket rain gauges were also installed in these five representative fields for site specific precipitation data geographic information system gis based tools were used to record organize and analyze these datasets geographically within the research area the management practices adopted by individual growers which included crop type acreage and cultivar information maturity planting and harvesting dates seeding rate tillage practices fertilizer type and application crop yield etc were obtained via personal communication with the producer partners 2 3 crop classification information on the crop grown in the selected fields was obtained through the use of survey forms circulated and collected annually additionally the cropland data layer cdl provided by usda nass was considered as an appropriate tool to collect crop type information the cdl is a raster based geo referenced crop specific land cover data layer created annually for the continental united states using moderate resolution satellite imagery and extensive agricultural ground truthing data cdl derived crop type data were verified against survey collected crop type data and a perfect agreement was found for available 51 field year combinations ensuring confidence in use of cdl data the total number of fields planted with maize was 28 90 in 2013 24 77 in 2014 and 21 67 in 2015 and soybean was 3 10 in 2013 7 23 in 2014 and 7 23 in 2015 table 3 additionally there were 3 10 fields in 2015 cultivated with winter wheat however our analyses was limited to the fields growing maize and soybean due to their dominance in the region 2 4 precipitation and site specific reference evapotranspiration the precipitation data were obtained from three sources noaa ghcn national oceanic and atmospheric administration global historical climatology network hprcc awdn and nerain nebraska rainfall assessment and information network among these sources 101 weather stations in 2013 99 in 2014 and 96 in 2015 were selected to determine precipitation depth for spatial interpolation a proportion of the selected weather station sites were outside the geographic boundary of the mrnrd ensuring accurate interpolation along the borders inverse distance weighing idw interpolation technique was implemented for spatial interpolation using the spatial analyst toolset provided in arcgis 10 2 arcgis 10 2 esri redlands california interpolation resulted in 459 spatial datasets rasters of daily precipitation for the region across the research period which were used to develop monthly and growing season total precipitation

intercomparisons between etgauge measured at field p2 and asce ewri pm estimated eto at dickens hprcc weather site for three research years were made fig 2 a strong agreement was observed among the measured and estimated eto with a mean rmse of 0 99 mm d 1 and r2 ranging from 0 78 to 0 88 indicating that estimated eto can serve as a proxy for the measured eto or vice versa with good accuracy for

the different growth stages of the crop as well as varies with climate soil crop type and varieties irrigation methods and management practices the crop growth is generally divided into four stages initial stage crop developmental stage mid season stage and late season stage in this research the crop coefficient curves maize and soybean were used as the function of days after planting dap as shown in fig 3 these curves were measured and developed by the senior author s irmak in nebraska as a part of the nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 project developed polynomial equations were used in this research to calculate kc values for maize the kc values were 0 15 0 20 in the initial stage and extended up to 1 02 in the mid season july again reducing to 0 48 in the late season for soybean the kc values start with 0 20 increasing up to 0 94 in july and decreasing to 0 28 in the late season the kc values reported in fig 3 are generally within the range of values reported in the literature sharma and irmak 2012a used the same crop coefficient equations to determine long term 1986 2009 growing season 1 may to 30 september etc and net irrigation requirements the actual plating dates were used for the fields for which the actual producer reported data were available which resulted in better field specific estimations 2 6

sand in 12 4 9 and 6 fields respectively the soil water characteristic equations irmak 2019a 2019b were used to convert soil matric potential smp kpa to volumetric water content vwc vol for each soil

mean growing season precipitation across the mrnrd for the years 2013 2015 are presented in fig 4 growing season precipitation varied from 295 to 593 mm across the research region the year 2013 was the driest with mean precipitation of 301 mm across all the research fields the mean precipitation amounts in 2014 and 2015 were 423 mm and 418 mm respectively maximum precipitation was recorded in field s3 345 mm in 2013 field p26 546 mm in 2014 and field g3 508 mm in 2015 the fields g1 g2 g3 p16 p17 p23 p24 p25 with higher mean precipitation occurring in frontier county which lies in the eastern part of mrnrd fig 4 fields p26 and s1 lie in red willow county southeastern part of mrnrd and received highest precipitation in 2014 fig 5 presents the precipitation amounts at all the selected fields for the three growing seasons 3 2 initiation termination and length of irrigation season one of the most important decision in irrigation application is the onset and termination of the irrigation season the start of irrigation in a season usually depends on the antecedent moisture availability in the soil profile and crop growth stage the last irrigation of the season depends on the maturity stage of the crop soil water availability in the soil profile and evaporative demand since these factors are subject to change both spatially and temporally it is expected that the timing of first and last irrigation events would also vary in different fields primarily these dates depend on the management practices of the irrigator as well as the planting date and climate conditions the planting dates varied from april 26 to may 21 between the research fields the first and last irrigation in a season was tracked from the data communicated via the telemetry system for all three years figs 6 and 7 show the first and last irrigation respectively represented as days after planting dap it was observed that the first irrigation varied from 4 to 82 dap fig 6 in 2013 55 6 out of 11 producers irrigated from 50 to 60 dap 27 of them irrigated from 41 to 44 dap whereas two of them fields p15 and s1 irrigated at 70 and 82 dap respectively in 2014 three of them were irrigating at 45 46 and 47 dap respectively field p26 was irrigated 4 dap which was very early in the season whereas field p16 was irrigated on 65 dap in 2015 eight fields were irrigated first time on 38 54 dap and the gravity field g1 was irrigated on 67 dap similarly the last day of irrigation was also observed for the same fields the last day of irrigation in all the three years ranged from 112 field g2 to 141 field p3 dap fig 7 which is a duration of 49 days almost 90 of the fields in 2013 terminated irrigations between 118 and 136 dap with the exception of field g2 in which irrigation was terminated 112 dap in 2014 the range was between 114 dap and 135 dap in 2015 78 of the fields terminated irrigation season between 125 dap to 131 dap whereas fields p1 and p3 applied their last irrigation on 137 and 141 dap respectively fig 7 length of irrigation season defined as the total number of days that water was pumped for the purpose of irrigation in a season the number of fields selected in this analysis were 25 in 2013 25 in 2014 and 22 in 2015 from the common period may 1 to september 20 in all three years the maximum and minimum length of irrigation season was observed in sdi irrigated field s3 86 days in 2015 and gravity field g2 14 days in 2014 respectively fig 8 a significant difference was observed in the length of irrigation season among the selected fields demonstrating the role of management practices climatic variables and irrigator s decision making in irrigation application for example in field s3 the length of irrigation season in 2015 was quite high as compared with 2013 and 2014 which increased the irrigation depth applied in 2015 however the precipitation was 32 mm higher in 2015 than in 2013 and was 61 mm lower than in 2014 hence it was observed that precipitation timing or amount likely has little impact on the irrigator s decision making instead the observed differences in the initiation termination and length of irrigation season across fields that were even planted within the same time frame last week of april to the first week of may demonstrates the role of individual decision making of the irrigator this can vary almost arbitrarily across irrigators most likely due to their time share among other activities on the farm such as fertilizer application pesticide applications fungicide application tillage and other soil and crop management practices 3 3 frequency distribution of irrigation applications in the research region the crop planting dates usually range from the last week of april to the first week of may most producers planting at the same date with same or similar varieties would also need to irrigate at the same time especially the ones experiencing the same distribution of precipitation and evaporative demand simultaneous irrigation application by a high proportion of producers not only results in high water abstractions from the aquifer but also increases the energy demand at that particular time it remains crucial to determine the peak water demand and its timing in a particular region for efficient allocation by the authorities fig 9 shows the percentage of irrigation systems operating during each month of the growing season it was observed that july and august were the months when the highest number of irrigation systems 70 90 were operational in all three years however in september which is the last month of the growing season 71 45 and 61 of the systems were operating in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the lowest number of irrigation systems that was in operation was in may due to early crop growth not requiring supplemental moisture other than contribution from stored crop root zone moisture from spring precipitation in fact there were no irrigation systems operating in 2013 in may and a small percentage in 2014 23 and even smaller percentage 16 in 2015 on average of three years most of the precipitation occurred in may 104 mm and june 109 mm and lowest occurred in july 55 mm august 80 mm and september 34 mm when plant leaf area index and consequently etc rates are the highest 3 4 depth of irrigation applied the irrigation systems selected for irrigation depth calculations were 25 in 2013 25 in 2014 and 22 in 2015 the information on crop type in each field and each season is presented in table 3 the total water depths applied by all individual irrigators in each season are shown in fig 10 along with the mean annual allocated moratorium irrigation depth black line by mrnrd the irrigation amount allocated to each irrigator in mrnrd is 1524 mm per five years or a annual mean allocated depth of 305 mm assuming uniform annual distribution there were considerable differences in irrigation applications between the fields for the same crop type and between the years for the same fields in 2013 nine of the 25 cp fields were irrigated by approximately 300 mm or more approaching the mean allocated depth gravity system fields were irrigated considerably more than the cp fields by about 90 mm in 2013 field p9 was irrigated with 386 mm which was the only cp field irrigated significantly higher than its neighbors as well as more than the annually allocated irrigation depth in 2013 however about 40 of the selected fields were irrigated less than 200 mm in 2013 the irrigation depth in gravity system field g2 was reduced to 345 mm in 2014 and 307 mm in 2015 as compared with 391 mm in 2013 however in field g1 the irrigation was increased to 415 mm in 2015 as compared with 390 mm in 2013 in the cp fields in 2014 the irrigation depth was almost equal or more than the previous year field p9 p5 and p10 were irrigated the most with 398 375 and 352 mm respectively in 2014 in 2015 irrigation depth in field p1 was about 500 mm which was considerably higher than the previous two years and all other selected fields however most of the systems irrigated around or less than 300 mm in contrast to the field p9 for which the irrigation depth was around 400 mm in all the three consecutive years fig 10 in sdi fields s1 and s3 the irrigation depth was 164 and 199 mm in 2013 and 208 and 195 mm in 2014 respectively which was considerably less than the gravity and center pivot fields there was no difference observed in irrigation depth due to the crop type planted in the research fields the average irrigation depth was observed to be 243 264 and 284 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively there were 40 of fields each year exceeding the mean annual allocated irrigation depth threshold 3 5 evaporative demand and crop evapotranspiration etc daily etr values in the growing period april 27 to september 20 for each year are presented in fig 11 daily etr values of all the four stations were observed to be very similar to each other and the variability observed in seasonal etr was not higher than the inter annual variability observed at an individual site indicating that etr did not vary substantially across the mrnrd since computation of reference et requires extensive climate data measurements and the region did not have adequate number density of these measurement sites the computation of field scale etr was not carried out the black line in fig 11 represents the average etr values of all four stations for the three consecutive growing seasons the growing season total etr for 2013 2014 and 2015 was 1175 1005 and 958 mm respectively the most probable reasons for the higher etr in 2013 can be the warmer air temperatures higher solar radiation higher wind speed higher vapor pressure deficit and lower relative humidity as compared with 2014 and 2015 table 2 average daily maize and soybean etc along with standard deviation among the thirty one fields for three research years is presented in fig 12 for maize the growing season total etc ranged from 676 to 756 mm in 2013 615 659 mm in 2014 and 608 624 mm in 2015 with an average of 733 648 and 621 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively for soybean the growing season total etc ranged from 629 to 680 mm in 2013 535 597 mm in 2014 and 544 571 mm in 2015 with an average of 663 577 and 560 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively on average maize etc was 10 higher than the soybean etc in all three years similar to the results found in sharma and irmak 2012b for the long term 1986 2009 large scale assessments for mrnrd area etc in 2013 was relatively higher than in 2014 and 2015 for both crops the average etc for maize in 2013 was 85 mm and 112 mm higher than those determined for 2014 and 2015 respectively for soybean average etc was 86 mm and 103 mm higher in 2013 than in 2014 and 2015 respectively the etc variations observed within the fields were primarily due to the differences in the planting dates and the crop type as other parameters variables were similar for all fields 3 6 calculated irrigation requirement vs producers actual application the actual irrigation depth applied for each field was compared to the computed irrigation water requirements as estimated using two step approach and the soil water balance fig 13 that used information and data obtained specifically for each field in 2013 irrigation requirement was greater than irrigation applied in all fields except field g2 in 2014 and 2015 irrigation applied exceeded the irrigation water requirements in 80 of the fields there were three fields in 2014 and in 2015 where irrigation requirement was more than actual amount of irrigation water applied on average irrigation requirement in maize fields were 394 242 and 184 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively whereas the average amount of irrigation water withdrawal was 267 292 and 264 mm in the same years respectively similarly irrigation requirement in soybean fields was 307 163 and 219 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively whereas the average amount of water pumped was 234 251 and 274 mm in the same years respectively it is observed that on average maize irrigation requirement was 61 and 47 in 2014 and 2015 respectively as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied was 109 and 99 in 2014 and 2015 respectively as compared with 2013 similarly soybean irrigation requirement was 53 and 71 in 2014 and 2015 respectively as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied was 107 and 117 in 2014 and 2015 respectively as compared with 2013 the inter annual variation in irrigation requirement was substantial but it was relatively insignificant in irrigation application given the same site characteristics irrigation requirement is mostly affected by environmental factors such as evaporative water demand vapor pressure deficit precipitation and stored soil water the magnitudes of these variables were considerably different between the three years which govern the magnitude of irrigation requirement ideally the changes in irrigation requirement should be reflected in irrigation application by producers provided that continuous and appropriate monitoring of soil moisture and or crop water use is performed as these metrics will respond to the various factors governing plant water uptake in contrast to this our observations of irrigation application show that most producers did not consider following any established irrigation scheduling approach resulting in suboptimal greater or lower amount of water being applied to their fields for example field p10 was under irrigated by 78 mm in 2013 while it was over irrigated by 70 mm in 2014 and by 105 mm in 2015 field p3 was under irrigated by 210 104 and 35 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively sdi irrigated field s3 was under irrigated by 170 mm in 2013 whereas it was over irrigated by 73 and 42 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively indicating the need for implementing agricultural water management technologies and associated educational programs training and demonstrations to enable optimum use of limited water resources and enhance crop water productivity 3 7 applied irrigation water vs water allocation fig 14 shows the cumulative amount of water pumped in each field in three years along with the allocated water per five years as well as an annual mean allocated water assuming uniform distribution of 305 mm per year there were few fields that pumping more irrigation water than allocated in 2013 which increased in 2014 there were seven fields in 2015 which crossed the 3rd year mean allocated amount with the field p9 almost pumping the fourth year allocated amount according to the trend observed in fig 14 it is expected that a reasonable proportion of fields would have exceeded the five year allocated water depth in the region nevertheless 70 of the producers applied irrigation water well within their restricted water allocations if producers pumped more than 305 mm of water per year for multiple years they risk consuming their 5 year allocation sooners which also risks not having enough or any water available for crop production in the 4th and or 5th year which can have significant negative consequences to farm income thus implementing scientifically based water management technologies and strategies to account for stored soil moisture and effective use of precipitation as well as implanting effective soil management practices e g reduced till or no till can aid not only increasing crop water productivity but can aid in ensuring the total allocated water amount can be used appropriately in a given year 4 summary and conclusions field specific irrigation water withdrawal and use data are essential for effective agricultural water management and for development of policies and regulations governing the use of water predicting changes in water demand in response to changing climatic conditions cropping systems and irrigation management scenarios good decision making in irrigation water management is dependent upon data that can provide real time information about crop water needs irrigation applications crop growth and development stage and weather patterns irrigation water use data are also used to more effectively manage finite groundwater supplies in regions where surface and groundwater supplies are either over appropriated demand exceeds supply or fully appropriated demand are supply are critically equal the field specific automated irrigation water use monitoring and data collection system deployed in this research provide real time and site specific metrics reflecting irrigation analytics and irrigator behavior throughout the growing season various metrics calculated from the obtained datasets such as initiation termination and length duration of irrigation season irrigation application frequency and irrigation depth show that there can be substantial farm to farm heterogeneity even within relatively small irrigated regions thus it is challenging to robustly benchmark regional water footprint and irrigator behavior across larger scales owing to the high degree of farm to farm variability unaccounted variables irrigation vs other farm operations that are used or not used for decision making by irrigators surprisingly it was also observed that irrigation depths estimated using scientifically based and widely used procedures such as the two step approach of computing etc and site specific soil water balance showed little agreement with actual applied irrigation depths by the producers only few farms followed the trend of year to year and farm to farm variation captured in estimated irrigation depths monitoring and accounting for farm specific evaporative demand soil moisture and precipitation amounts did not lead to accurate representation of irrigator decisions this observation is strong evidence that irrigation decisions by users are not backed by data and scientific protocols and are largely driven by condition of crop feel of soil personal calendar schedule neighbor practices or no irrigation management protocol at al despite increase in technologies that can be used for agricultural water management decision making in this research irrigator decisions did not seem to reasonably follow patterns of water use metrics like soil moisture and or crop water use or evaporative demand thus standard estimations of crop water footprint should be carefully assessed prior to representing actual water use across large regions our observations demonstrate the need for greater momentum for real time monitoring of farm level irrigation dynamics and their integrative reporting advances in internet of things iot can be leveraged to connect these data streams to effectively report privately or publicly host and utilize quantitative information on irrigation water use and irrigation behavior across agroecosystems automated water dynamics system deployed in this research can aid in more effectively planning and managing the quantity and distribution of limited water resources especially in regions with pumping allocations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9331,current rice production in china is associated with low rainfall use efficiency in order to increase rainfall use efficiency and develop simple water saving irrigation modes that could be readily implemented by farmers a new multi objective optimization framework for irrigation modes of paddy rice was developed based on a modified version of the aquacrop model called acop rice model the optimization focused on the water level at which irrigation was triggered for five growth periods and the irrigation frequency rainfall use efficiency and yield were optimized the procedure was tested on nine rice production cases in china for which over 60 years of historical meteorological data and irrigation guidelines were available analysis of the weather data showed that rainfall distribution varied greatly between the different locations and growth periods the results obtained by following the current guidelines were compared to three optimal solutions that corresponded to minimum number of irrigation events maximum rainfall use efficiency and balanced performance in which equal attention was given to rainfall use efficiency and irrigation frequency respectively overall the optimization led to lowering the water depth at which irrigation was triggered the optimal water level after irrigation varied between the different cases depending on the combined effects of rainfall distribution operation constraints and length of growth period compared to the current guidelines the optimized irrigation modes reduced the proportion of drainage caused by rainfall after irrigation for optimal solutions with minimum number of irrigation events maximum rainfall use efficiency and balanced performance the number of irrigation events was reduced by 57 18 and 44 on average 9 4 3 0 and 7 4 fewer irrigation events per year while on average rainfall use efficiency improved by 5 19 and 17 without significant yield loss keywords paddy rice irrigation modes muti objective optimization aquacrop 1 introduction paddy rice is one of the most important crops in china with about 30 million hectares of planted area dong et al 2020 nbsprc 2021 rice is a water loving crop which consumes a lot of fresh water in the process of its growth although irrigation is often required rainfall is an important source of water that should be exploited to meet the water requirement of rice growth although generally rainfall and water resources are relatively abundant in china exceeding 300 billion m3 in 2020 mwrprc 2020 rice cultivation is still vulnerable to seasonal drought and flood due to the large spatial and temporal variation of rainfall zhu et al 2020 luo et al 2022 in addition with the acceleration of urbanization industrial and domestic water consumptions have increased

increasing the rainfall use efficiency appears to be one of the measures required to reduce irrigation water consumption and to solve the exacerbated water shortage threat tuong 2000 akpoti et al 2021 the objective of the present study was to develop an irrigation strategy that would allow for such an improvement while being simple enough to be readily applied by chinese farmers the traditional irrigation mode in china is flooding irrigation guo 1997 that is the water layer in the field is maintained within a certain depth range specific to each growth stage conventionally irrigation events for paddy rice are controlled by the criteria of field water depth including the lower limit of water depth hmin the upper limit of water depth hmax and the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall hp as shown in fig 1 when soil moisture or field water depth for paddy rice reaches the threshold hmin an irrigation event occurs and the water depth is replenished to the upper threshold hmax in addition drainage events take place whenever the water depth is beyond the maximum allowable water depth hp to avoid waterlog for paddy rice as indicated in fig 1 paddy rice fields are drained on demand twice once around mid season to enhance production and at the end of the season right before harvest the application of flooding irrigation in any specific region usually follows a standard protocol which makes planning and management of irrigation relatively simple and convenient however such a strategy is too general and ignores the spatial and temporal variation of rainfall distribution so that effective rainfall cannot be fully utilized indeed several researchers who have studied rainfall use rate in the growing period of rice showed that rainfall distribution varied from year to year and region to region cao et al 2019 shi 2016 zheng and lin 2003 therefore it is necessary to investigate the relationship between drainage rainfall and irrigation management on a location specific basis irrigation modes can be determined through field experiments i e perform multi year experiments to determine the optimal irrigation modes for a specific area however such experiments are time consuming and labor intensive and expensive after years of experimental research and practice various water saving irrigation technologies for rice have been developed in various parts of china mainly including alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd shallow wet and dry irrigation mode swdi semi dry irrigation mode sd and rain gathering irrigation mode rg mao 1997 dong et al 2020 however it is difficult to popularize and apply rice water saving irrigation technologies because farmers are required to be trained to acquire the appropriate professional knowledge and they must adopt new modes of irrigation therefore it is important to propose a simple and efficient improvement method to optimize the conventional flood irrigation mode in the present work we used a simulation model to investigate the use of historical meteorological data for developing simple irrigation modes that improve the use rate of rainfall our analysis is restricted to the flooding irrigation configuration described above in order to improve the rainfall use efficiency hmin and hmax should be reduced and hp should be increased so as to capture rainfall in the paddy field as much as possible however reducing hmin may cause water stress and result in yield reduction while the decrease of hmax leads to more frequent irrigation events and increased cost of labor related to irrigation in addition increasing hp may also cause waterlogging therefore the optimization of irrigation modes is about the trade off between rainfall use efficiency the number of irrigation events and yield to solve this problem we adopted the multi objective optimization method nsga ii deb et al 2002 which is one of the advanced algorithms for solving multi objective optimization problems and has been widely used in irrigation scheduling optimization and water allocation linker 2020 liu and yang 2021 guo et al 2021 to optimize irrigation modes for paddy rice the effect of irrigation and field management on yield is of great significance other than field experiments a crop growth model is an important and convenient tool to reflect the crop respond to various climate condition irrigation management and field management various crop growth models have been developed such as cropwat fao 1992 ceres rice ritchie et al 1986 and oryza2000 bouman et al 2001 recently the aquacrop model developed by fao has received much attention due to its balance between accuracy simplicity and robustness steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 it has been applied to simulate crop growth development for various upland crops such as maize shirazi et al 2021 cotton linker et al 2016 corn ahmadi et al 2015 wheat alvar beltrán et al 2021 in particular for paddy rice aquacrop has also been used for various purposes such as evaluating yield response to irrigation and soil management lin et al 2012 simulating the crop development under climate change xu et al 2019 and irrigation scheduling optimization zhai et al 2019 as a water driven model aquacrop is particularly suitable for irrigation scheduling optimization however there are two main limitations to applying aquacrop directly in a study such as ours the first limitation is that the original aquacrop model is distributed solely as a compiled software package which makes it difficult to combine aquacrop with other models or make specific modifications according to the users need to solve this problem researchers have developed an open source version of aquacrop aquacrop os which is implemented in matlab octave foster et al 2017 and r language rodriguez and ober 2019 due to the growing popularity of python thanks to its flexibility interoperability extensive ecosystem and accessible learning resources a python version of aquacrop acosp based on aquacrop os was later developed kelly and foster 2021 however not all the functionalities of the original aquacrop model are included in the acosp version and in particular the acosp is relatively simplified for paddy rice production compared to the original version to address this issue in the present study we introduced modifications to acosp to make it closer to the original aquacrop the second limitation is that although aquacrop includes a bund height parameter this parameter cannot represent hp as defined above because this parameter retains a fixed value for the whole season while in practice at different growth stages there are different acceptable flooding depths for rice therefore we modified acosp to handle a changeable bund height i e hp and reflect the irrigation reality of paddy rice in china the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a model specific to paddy rice based on acosp called the acop rice model which mimics irrigation practices of paddy rice in china 2 to establish a simulation optimization method combining nsga ii and acop rice model and to analyze its results and 3 to explore the impact of rainfall pattern on the optimal results in different regions in terms of trade off between the different objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data paddy rice is cultivated in six rice growth subregions of china including double season rice early rice and late rice and single season rice middle rice considering the geographical location data accessibility and cropping system nine cases in the six representative irrigation districts and corresponding meteorological stations were selected in different rice growing subregions as shown in fig 2 and table 1 for each location over 60 years of daily observations were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma gov cn including minimum and maximum temperature average temperature average wind speed sunshine duration mean relative humidity and precipitation information on recommended agricultural management in each region was collected from the national irrigation experiment results information service platform http ggsy jsgg com cn 9080 eisflex field experiments and previous studies yu 2013 liu et al 2005 gu et al 2005 the growth period of paddy rice was divided into seven stages the returning green rg early tillering et late tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mr and yellow ripe yr stages all cases were assumed to apply the conventional flooded irrigation mode and the criteria of field water depth in each growth stage of paddy rice are shown in table a1 as mentioned above in practice farmers drain and dry the paddy fields in the sun for a few days at the end of the lt period to control inefficient tillers for improving production to account for this practice in all the simulations the field was fully drained for 5 days before the end of the lt period 2 2 modification to the acosp model as mentioned before the acosp model is simplified with respect to irrigation management with bunds compared to original aquacrop model in this study we added a new irrigation method specific to paddy rice to the acosp model this modification was required in order to enable setting different thresholds for the depth of the surface water layer at each growth stage which as described above is the common practice for paddy rice cultivation in china an irrigation event is generated when the water depth reaches this threshold like in the original aquacrop model another important improvement is that the height of soil bund hp is allowed to change with growth stage to adapt to the requirements of rice waterlogging control finally we also fixed bugs in acosp specific rice irrigation simulation the code of this new model acop rice and a detailed description of the modifications that were made can be found on the github https github com rheat acop rice the parameters about phenology were adjusted based on actual situation of each case and the other parameters were adopted from the default rice model in original aquacrop model as shown in table a2 to test and evaluate the modified model the simulation results were compared with the original version since the original aquacrop cannot change the height of the bunds this verification was performed with constant values of the bunds to assess the performance of acop rice model the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were used 1 m a e i 1 n y ˆ i y i n 2 r m s e i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 n 3 r 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y 2 y i y 2 where y ˆ i represents the outputs of acop rice model y i represents the outputs of original aquacrop model i is the sample sequence i 1 2 n y is the average values of outputs from original aquacrop model 2 3 optimization model for irrigation scheduling 2 3 1 framework for simulation optimization model the decision variables are the water depth thresholds hmin hmax and hp at each growth period constrained by some conditions the objective in our study was to maximize rainfall use efficiency and yield while minimizing the number of irrigation events the latter was preferred to the seasonal irrigation amount since under the current situation in which irrigation is operated manually irrigation cost is directly proportional to the number of irrigation events referring to the irrigation threshold of the local conventional flooding irrigation nine levels are defined by increasing or decreasing by 0 5 10 15 or 20 mm compared to current recommended practices in each station as shown in table a1 5 mm increment was defined for convenient management the current irrigation mode reported in table a1 is used as control check ck throughout the study it is obvious that there could be no advantage in decreasing hp or increasing hmin therefore hp was not included in the optimization process but was set to 20 mm higher than the original level for all periods at all locations similarly only lowering hmin was considered mathematically 4 min r f 1 h min h max h p min n f 2 h min h max h p min y f 3

h min ck i h max ck i h p ck i are the water depth criteria of current recommended practices in i th period as listed in table a1 in mm when hmin 0 the crop should extract water from the soil rather than from the pound water and the absolute value of hmin correspond to the amount of water that would be removed from the root zone it is worth noting that the rice seedlings at rg stage are too fragile to adapt rapidly to changing water depth which would cause serious yield reduction and no water layer is maintained on the paddy field at yr stage therefore the optimization did not include the rg and yr stages the general flowchart of the complete procedure is shown on fig 3 and table 2 the multi objective optimization was conducted with nsga ii a fast and elitist multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on a non dominated sorting approach implemented in the genetic algorithm toolbox geatpy2 for python http www geatpy com first the input data consisting of weather soil crop and management information combined with decision variables i e water depth thresholds were imported to acop rice model for crop growth simulation the outputs of acop rice model consisting of runoff irrigation scheduling and yield were used to calculate the optimization criteria according to nsga ii algorithm the decision variables were updated and a non dominated solution set was obtained through iterations 2 3 2 decision making for multi objective optimization a set of non dominated solutions was obtained by multi objective genetic algorithm from which a solution should be selected for implementation decision makers can simply set the weight values of different objectives according to their preferences or adopt advanced multi objective criteria decision making methods such as the efficiency coefficient method and the entropy method guo et al 2021 shao et al 2018 since our goal was to explore the impact of rainfall distribution on irrigation scheduling optimization four optimal solutions were selected and compared the extreme solutions corresponding to the lowest number of irrigation events maximum rainfall use efficiency highest yield and the balanced solution in which all three criteria were close to their average values a simple way to choose the balanced solution of a solution set is by considering normalized criteria and select the solution at which their sum is minimum mathematically 10 w i j 1 n f i max f i h min j h max j h p j f i max f i min min j i 1 n w i j where f i max and f i min are the maximum and minimum values for the i th objective functions of non dominated solution set the subscript j corresponds to the j th non dominated solution i 1 2 n and n is the number of objective functions 3 results and discussion 3 1 testing and evaluation of acop rice model the simulation results of the original aquacrop model and the acop rice model for nce are shown in fig 4 it is worth noting that one of the main reasons the acop rice model was developed was the need to implement different values of hp at different growth periods however since in the aquacrop model using different bunds heights for different periods was not possible for this test hp was set to a constant value of 60 mm all other parameters were those of conventional flooding irrigation mode reported in table a1 the results showed that the simulated values of acop rice model were in perfect agreement with the simulated values of original aquacrop model confirming the validity of the acop rice model for this nominal case the yield increase over time is due to increasing ambient co2 concentration raes et al 2009 the values of mae for seasonal irrigation seasonal drainage and yield were 0 448 mm 1 110 mm and 0 002 ton ha respectively the corresponding rmse values were 3 665 mm 3 858 mm and 0 005 ton ha respectively the values of r2 were all above 0 99 the range of evaluation indicators were acceptable and similar to the results for dry crops obtained in previous study kelly and foster 2021 3 2 rainfall distribution and drainage pattern the distributions of various rainfall levels in each growth period for the nine locations considered in the study are shown in fig 5 the rainfall level was divided into six categories labeled as light rain moderate rain heavy rain storm heavy storm and extraordinary storm with the corresponding thresholds 0 1 10 10 25 25 50 and 50 100 100 250 250 mm d overall rainfall distribution varied greatly with location and growth periods from the seasonal average average stack it can be seen that southern locations generally obtained more rain than northern ones there was more rainfall in nce ncm zje zjl and dlm with multi year average daily precipitation of 7 5 mm d 5 2 mm d 4 8 mm d 5 7 mm d and 5 5 mm d respectively ncl shm ycm and xxm had less rainfall with multi year average daily precipitation of 2 7 mm d 3 5 mm d 1 0 mm d and 3 3 mm d respectively for different growth periods the curve of rainfall is the typical unimodal sort but with differences in amplitude duration and time of the maximum rainfall the peak of rainfall distribution for most stations was heading flowering period while the peak of rainfall distribution for xxm and zjl was in early tillering period for nce was in returning green and for ncl was in the first three growth periods according to the probability distribution of the various rainfall levels among the rainy locations nce ncm zje zjl and dlm the rainfall distribution of nce and ncm were significantly concentrated with the proportion of storm or above of 44 and 46 followed by zje and zjl which were 30 and 34 respectively the probability of storm or above in dlm was much lower 19 in the less rainy areas ncl shm xxm and ycm the rainfall was more intensive in xxm and ncl where the proportion of storm or above was 33 and 27 respectively while the proportion of extreme rain in shm and ycm was much lower 13 and 7 respectively in addition storm or above occurred more frequently in the periods with most rainfall such as in heading flowering period of nce returning green of ncm returning green and late tillering of ncl heading flowering of shm and early tillering of xxm to summarize the rainfall distribution in nce and ncm is uneven with more rain in ncl and xxm it is uneven with less rain in zje zjl and dlm it is even with more rain and in shm and ycm it is even with less rain in each simulation the time interval between the occurrence of drainage and the last irrigation was determined and the accumulated precipitation during that period was calculated to identify the degree of rainfall caused drainage after irrigation the drainage pattern of conventional flooding irrigation mode is shown in fig a1 for all cases and fig 6 for ncl as an example for the ncl case drainage events caused by rainfall after irrigation occurred 1 7 times a year on average and the frequency of drainage gradually decreased as the time elapsed from the last irrigation increased about 88 of the drainage caused by rainfall after irrigation occurred within the first four days after irrigation and 99 within the first seven days therefore to improve the use rate of rainfall management should focus on rainfall within one week after irrigation drainage occurred when the average daily rainfall reached about 46 mm far exceeding the value of hp hmax which was 10 mm the accumulated rainfall required to cause drainage generally increased slightly with the number of days since the last irrigation which was expected due to crop water uptake and evaporation furthermore the average amount of drainage reached 15 mm per event corresponding to 29 of rainfall for all cases fig a1 the drainage events caused by rainfall after irrigation occurred twice a year on average at each location with a minimum of once a year at ycm and a maximum of 3 times a year at dlm the average amount of drainage ranged from 14 mm to 30 mm per event and approximately 27 of rainfall was lost to drainage on average the largest losses occurred in xxm where drainage corresponded to 34 of rainfall these results indicated that significant water savings could be potentially achieved by utilizing rainfalls more efficiently 3 3 optimal irrigation scheduling for paddy rice the non dominated solution sets of each case are shown in fig 7 it is found that the 3d scatter of non dominated solutions showed a convex shape heading to the maximum of r minimum of n and maximum of y the lowest yield usually occurred at the outer edge of the r and n projection indicating that optimization of n and r would lower yield y however this yield reduction was negligible less than 0 1ton ha the range of optimal n and r varied greatly from case to case rainfall use efficiency of each location ranged from 0 40 to 0 90 and the number of irrigation events ranged from 3 to 35 due to the negligible variations observed in yield yield was not taken into consideration when choosing the balanced solution and this solution was based on the balance of irrigation and rainfall use efficiency table 3 summarizes the objective values associated with four of the non dominated solutions the solution with the least number of irrigation events n min the solution with highest rainfall use efficiency r max the solution with the highest yield y max and the balanced solution balanced since the yield range in nce ncl and dlm was less than 0 01ton ha the y max solution was not selected in these cases as shown in table 3 among the n min solutions the number of irrigation events decreased significantly with an average reduction of 9 4 57 per year the rainfall use rate also increased with an average increase of 5 however in some cases the rainfall use rate was slightly worse when reducing the number of irrigation events such as ycm at the r max solutions the rainfall use efficiency increased by 19 on average the number of irrigation events also decreased with an average decrease of 3 events 18 per season however similarly to what was observed before in some cases improving rue slightly increased the irrigation number of irrigation events such as for instance ncl where the number of irrigation events increased by 3 6 in y max the yield changed slightly after optimization at the balanced solutions the improvements of the number of irrigation events and rainfall use rate were on average 7 4 events 45 and 17 respectively both of them were close to the best single objective oriented improvement of n min solution or r max solution which indicated that the optimization model can improve the two objectives greatly at the same time by adjusting the water depth thresholds according to zhai et al 2019 in the longtouqiao irrigation district near the suihua station sh irrigation should be conducted 14 17 times the number of irrigation events at r max solution obtained in the present work is slightly lower 12 irrigation events given that the geographical location and irrigation system of the two sites are not strictly identical our current results can be considered to be well within a reasonable range the improvement achieved for the various objective functions indicated that the optimization of the number of irrigation events outperformed that of rainfall use efficiency quite disappointingly even after optimization rainfall use rate remained rather low i e 65 and there was still a large amount of rain water wasted this may be linked to the characteristics of rainfall some cases have high proportion of very intense rainfall events which are hard to utilize such as nce as shown in fig 5 when heavy storms of more than 100 mm are encountered it is difficult for paddy fields to maintain such a large amount of rainfall and drainage is likely to occur thus greatly limiting the potential improvement of rainfall use efficiency the optimization in this paper mainly improves the rainfall use efficiency of those accessible rainfall types i e light rain moderate rainfall and heavy rain for extremely heavy rain decision makers still need to consider other measures such as building rain storage facilities such as ponds and small reservoirs nakanishi 2004 chen et al 2016 the water depth thresholds corresponding to the four optimal solutions selected are shown in table 4 compared to the current irrigation mode the optimized irrigation mode only modified the water depth thresholds without requiring any other complex adjustments so farmers could adopt these recommended thresholds without professional training each cell in table 4 shows the optimal values of hmin hmax and hp for a specific growth period at a specific location the optimal hmin basically reached the lower bound set for this variable or was close to this lower bound except for some periods of y max solutions for example at shm of y max solutions the hmin for et lt and ml period were only 5 mm less than original level the original hmin in shm i e 0 mm was low and the lower bound of hmin is close to the threshold of water stress and yield loss therefore the decision aiming at the highest yield would rigorously prevent such negative impact for yield even if it is very slight furthermore although the optimal hmin is 20 mm in the other three solutions causing water stress the water stress degree was relatively slight so there was no obvious risk of production reduction for other cases the original hmin was not shallow so there was no potential water stress risk even if hmin reached its lower boundary in fact in the study of dong et al 2020 on awd sd and swdi of water saving irrigation technologies the hmin of non critical period of water demand was negative to make the field soil exposed to the air without causing yield loss which is in agreement with our optimization of hmin as for the improvement of hmax the optimal hmax of n min solutions was higher than original level for all cases the higher hmax the larger the amount of water delivered at each irrigation event and the lower the number irrigation events however as the water depth of paddy field increased after irrigation the risk of exceeding hp and hence the risk of drainage in case of heavy rainfall increased reducing the effective use rate of rainfall for the r max solutions hmax values were lower than the original levels therefore when adopting this strategy the water depth in paddy field was usually maintained at a low level often reaching hmin and hence requiring frequent irrigation in addition the water layer in the field was maintained at a low level for a long time and there was more space to store rainfall consequently improving the effective use rate of rainfall for balanced solutions the pattern of optimal hmax was not uniform due to the variation of rainfall distribution as discussed in more details in section 3 4 below it must be recalled that all the analysis was conducted after increasing hp by 20 mm for all cases corresponding to an actual bund height of 70 100 mm some scholars have applied water catching and controlled irrigation method to improve rainwater use efficiency in nanjing in such cases hp can reach 150 200 mm without causing significant yield reduction guo et al 2009 however the experiments conducted by guo et al 2010 showed that the yield of rice subjected to drought stress began to decline if hp exceeded 150 200 mm in some specific growth periods given that drought stress was not observed on our simulation results and the optimal hp was lower than the thresholds of causing adverse impact the bund heights obtained in our study are safe and reasonable 3 4 impact of rainfall distribution on optimization benefit the number of irrigation events and the rainfall use efficiency of each growth period associated with the three non dominated solutions n min r max and balanced and current recommendations ck are presented in fig a2 and fig a3 for all cases and in fig 8 for ncl as an example as shown in fig 8 compared to current recommendations solution the improvement for rainfall use efficiency was lowest for the n min solution and largest for the r max solution for the number of irrigation events the pattern was reversed however for the jb period the number of irrigation events for the ck solution was higher than that of the r max solution indicating that optimizing rainfall efficiency improved r at the expense of the number of irrigation events similarly the n min solution sacrificed r to reduce n in the lt yr periods in these specific growth periods the change of hmax was capable of greatly improving r or n solely thus one of the objectives overwhelmed the other it is worth noting that such a situation occurred in lt and yr period for the n min solution in several cases as shown in fig a2 and fig a3 this is most probably due to the compulsive drainage events in lt and yr periods which is also the reason why the rainfall use efficiency was negative in lt and yr periods and hmax tended to be increased for reducing irrigation frequency resulting in heavier drainage in the lt and yr periods for the whole growth period the optimization of hmax was affected by the amount of rainfall the probability of hmax being lower after optimization than initially was smaller at rainy locations nce ncm zje zjl dlm than that at drier locations ncl shm xxm ycm see table 4 for example the hmax after optimization was lower than that before optimization in five growth periods of dlm compared to three for ycm because decreasing hmax in areas with high rainfall was greatly beneficial to improve the use rate of rainfall without increasing the number of irrigation events significantly taking dlm as an example the rainfall use efficiency r of the balanced solution was very close to that of the r max solution only 1 less than that of r max solution but the number of irrigation events of each growth period was much lower than that of the r max solution table 3 the reason is that rainfall was captured in rainy areas as a supplementary water source the need for additional irrigation was reduced and the number of irrigation events was not significantly increased on the contrary increasing hmax in dry areas was beneficial to reduce the number of irrigation events but did not reduce significantly rainfall use efficiency taking ycm as an example the number of irrigation events at the balanced solution was closer to that of the n min solution only four more irrigation events than that of n min solution but the rainfall use efficiency was far higher than that of n min solution approximately 30 see table 3 because there was little rainfall available in ycm see fig 5 the probability of drainage caused by rainfall was small and the rainfall use efficiency was not significantly reduced by increasing hmax more importantly rainfall distribution also affected the optimization of hmax more specifically the probability of the optimal hmax being lower than before optimization was smaller for nce and ncm which both have large proportion of extreme rainfalls and was higher for zje zjl and dlm which have even rainfall distribution see table 4 and fig 5 when a high proportion of rainfall occurs as extreme rainfall even if hmax was lowered a large proportion of rainfall would be lost by drainage anyway and frequent irrigation would still be needed in absence of rain in such cases it was advantageous to set hmax to a high value rather than to lower it in different growth periods the optimization of hmax was affected by several factors the first was the influence of rainfall distribution for instance in the et period of nce and hf of ncl although the whole growth periods of both cases have even and plentiful rainfall the rainfall in these two specific periods was much less than in the other growth periods see fig 5 so the optimal hmax was higher secondly operational constraints controlled specific growth periods in all cases the optimal hmax of the lt and mr periods were lower than before optimization because the water needed to be drained in the last five days of the lt period and at the yr period that followed the mr period these operational constraints became the dominant factor and the optimization tended to choose a lower hmax to keep a shallow water depth in paddy field for avoiding drainage last but not least the length of the growth period had an impact on the tradeoff between the objectives for instance although the jb period at nce was rainy it was much longer and had greater water requirement than the other periods which made it extremely significant for the optimization therefore for the whole growth period the benefit of increasing hmax on the number of irrigation events was greater than that of increasing the rainfall use rate brought by decreasing the hmax and the rainfall distribution in this growth period became a secondary influencing factor the time interval between the last irrigation and the occurrence of drainage as well as the precipitation accumulated during that period were determined and are shown in fig a4 for all cases and fig 9 for ncl as an example noting that balanced solutions were selected for comparison these figures can be compared to fig a1 and fig 6 respectively for ncl it can be seen that optimizing hmin and hmax reduces greatly the probability of drainage after irrigation and the cumulative rainfall required to induce drainage increased drainage events occurred 0 8 times per year on average compared to 1 7 times a year before optimization after optimization drainage occurred on average when single day rainfall exceeded 61 mm which was 15 mm more than before optimization it is worth noting that contrarily to what was observed before optimization fig 6 after optimization the drainage events did not occur primarily within one week of the last irrigation event about 75 the reason might be that after optimization the rainfall level required to trigger drainage was very high and drainage occurrence was no longer strongly influenced by irrigation for all cases fig a4 drainage events occurred 1 2 times per year on average compared to twice a year before optimization the maximum decrease was achieved at ycm 1 8 times furthermore drainage corresponded to a smaller proportion of rainfall 22 on average compared to 27 before optimization 4 conclusions in this study a new multi objective optimization method for irrigation scheduling for paddy rice using a modified version of the aquacrop model acop rice has been developed and tested based on over 60 years of historical meteorological records in six rice growing regions in china the conventional flooded schedule was optimized by optimizing two thresholds related to water depth in each growth stage namely the water level at which irrigation was triggered hmin and the water level after irrigation hmax the rainfall distribution in our cases can be divided into 4 types uneven with more rain in nce and ncm uneven with less rain in ncl and xxm even with more rain in zje zjl and dlm even with less rain in shm and ycm as for drainage pattern the drainage events caused by rainfall after irrigation occurred 2 0 times per year on average at each case most of them occurred within 7 days after irrigation which accounted 26 9 of rainfall during the period after optimization three non dominated solutions corresponding to minimum number of irrigation events n min maximum rain use efficiency r max and balanced performance were thoroughly investigated compared with the conventional mode of flooded irrigation the average number of irrigation events was reduced by 9 4 57 3 0 18 and 7 4 44 for the n min r max balanced solutions respectively on average optimization led to corresponding rainfall use efficiency improvement of 5 19 and 17 respectively overall proportionally more improvement was achieved for number of irrigation events than for rainfall use efficiency the optimization of hmax is closely related to the dominance of diverse factors including rainfall distribution operation constraints required field drainage at specific periods and the length of growth period rainfall distribution affects the overall optimization while operational constraints strongly affect the lt and ml periods due compulsory drainage and the longest growth period with heavy water requirement tended to counteract the impact of rainfall distribution due to the complexity of the actual irrigation costs in china the objective function of this paper did not consider economic factors and only the trade off between number of irrigation events rainfall use rate and yield was investigated farmers can choose the optimal solution for implementation according to their own preferences and the specific conditions in which they operate for example increasing rainfall efficiency is likely to be a priority in places where water is scarce in which case it would be natural for farmers to choose the r max solution conversely at locations where water resources are less limited farmers could prefer to implement the n min solution that prioritizes reducing labor associated with irrigation in further studies irrigation costs and crop prices could be considered and single objective optimization considering net profit could be investigated the present work relied solely on historical data which has limitations since it does not consider weather forecasts therefore in further studies following the example of chen et al 2021 the use of weather forecasts and in particular seven day rainfall forecast which according to fig a1 and fig a4 is the crucial period for avoiding drainage after irrigation should be considered

9331,current rice production in china is associated with low rainfall use efficiency in order to increase rainfall use efficiency and develop simple water saving irrigation modes that could be readily implemented by farmers a new multi objective optimization framework for irrigation modes of paddy rice was developed based on a modified version of the aquacrop model called acop rice model the optimization focused on the water level at which irrigation was triggered for five growth periods and the irrigation frequency rainfall use efficiency and yield were optimized the procedure was tested on nine rice production cases in china for which over 60 years of historical meteorological data and irrigation guidelines were available analysis of the weather data showed that rainfall distribution varied greatly between the different locations and growth periods the results obtained by following the current guidelines were compared to three optimal solutions that corresponded to minimum number of irrigation events maximum rainfall use efficiency and balanced performance in which equal attention was given to rainfall use efficiency and irrigation frequency respectively overall the optimization led to lowering the water depth at which irrigation was triggered the optimal water level after irrigation varied between the different cases depending on the combined effects of rainfall distribution operation constraints and length of growth period compared to the current guidelines the optimized irrigation modes reduced the proportion of drainage caused by rainfall after irrigation for optimal solutions with minimum number of irrigation events maximum rainfall use efficiency and balanced performance the number of irrigation events was reduced by 57 18 and 44 on average 9 4 3 0 and 7 4 fewer irrigation events per year while on average rainfall use efficiency improved by 5 19 and 17 without significant yield loss keywords paddy rice irrigation modes muti objective optimization aquacrop 1 introduction paddy rice is one of the most important crops in china with about 30 million hectares of planted area dong et al 2020 nbsprc 2021 rice is a water loving crop which consumes a lot of fresh water in the process of its growth although irrigation is often required rainfall is an important source of water that should be exploited to meet the water requirement of rice growth although generally rainfall and water resources are relatively abundant in china exceeding 300 billion m3 in 2020 mwrprc 2020 rice cultivation is still vulnerable to seasonal drought and flood due to the large spatial and temporal variation of rainfall zhu et al 2020 luo et al 2022 in addition with the acceleration of urbanization industrial and domestic water consumptions have increased drastically increasing by 7 7 billion m3 and 27 0 billion m3 respectively in the past 20 years and the agricultural sector must use water more efficiently bao and fang 2012 mwrprc 2020 intuitively increasing the rainfall use efficiency appears to be one of the measures required to reduce irrigation water consumption and to solve the exacerbated water shortage threat tuong 2000 akpoti et al 2021 the objective of the present study was to develop an irrigation strategy that would allow for such an improvement while being simple enough to be readily applied by chinese farmers the traditional irrigation mode in china is flooding irrigation guo 1997 that is the water layer in the field is maintained within a certain depth range specific to each growth stage conventionally irrigation events for paddy rice are controlled by the criteria of field water depth including the lower limit of water depth hmin the upper limit of water depth hmax and the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall hp as shown in fig 1 when soil moisture or field water depth for paddy rice reaches the threshold hmin an irrigation event occurs and the water depth is replenished to the upper threshold hmax in addition drainage events take place whenever the water depth is beyond the maximum allowable water depth hp to avoid waterlog for paddy rice as indicated in fig 1 paddy rice fields are drained on demand twice once around mid season to enhance production and at the end of the season right before harvest the application of flooding irrigation in any specific region usually follows a standard protocol which makes planning and management of irrigation relatively simple and convenient however such a strategy is too general and ignores the spatial and temporal variation of rainfall distribution so that effective rainfall cannot be fully utilized indeed several researchers who have studied rainfall use rate in the growing period of rice showed that rainfall distribution varied from year to year and region to region cao et al 2019 shi 2016 zheng and lin 2003 therefore it is necessary to investigate the relationship between drainage rainfall and irrigation management on a location specific basis irrigation modes can be determined through field experiments i e perform multi year experiments to determine the optimal irrigation modes for a specific area however such experiments are time consuming and labor intensive and expensive after years of experimental research and practice various water saving irrigation technologies for rice have been developed in various parts of china mainly including alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd shallow wet and dry irrigation mode swdi semi dry irrigation mode sd and rain gathering irrigation mode rg mao 1997 dong et al 2020 however it is difficult to popularize and apply rice water saving irrigation technologies because farmers are required to be trained to acquire the appropriate professional knowledge and they must adopt new modes of irrigation therefore it is important to propose a simple and efficient improvement method to optimize the conventional flood irrigation mode in the present work we used a simulation model to investigate the use of historical meteorological data for developing simple irrigation modes that improve the use rate of rainfall our analysis is restricted to the flooding irrigation configuration described above in order to improve the rainfall use efficiency hmin and hmax should be reduced and hp should be increased so as to capture rainfall in the paddy field as much as possible however reducing hmin may cause water stress and result in yield reduction while the decrease of hmax leads to more frequent irrigation events and increased cost of labor related to irrigation in addition increasing hp may also cause waterlogging therefore the optimization of irrigation modes is about the trade off between rainfall use efficiency the number of irrigation events and yield to solve this problem we adopted the multi objective optimization method nsga ii deb et al 2002 which is one of the advanced algorithms for solving multi objective optimization problems and has been widely used in irrigation scheduling optimization and water allocation linker 2020 liu and yang 2021 guo et al 2021 to optimize irrigation modes for paddy rice the effect of irrigation and field management on yield is of great significance other than field experiments a crop growth model is an important and convenient tool to reflect the crop respond to various climate condition irrigation management and field management various crop growth models have been developed such as cropwat fao 1992 ceres rice ritchie et al 1986 and oryza2000 bouman et al 2001 recently the aquacrop model developed by fao has received much attention due to its balance between accuracy simplicity and robustness steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 it has been applied to simulate crop growth development for various upland crops such as maize shirazi et al 2021 cotton linker et al 2016 corn ahmadi et al 2015 wheat alvar beltrán et al 2021 in particular for paddy rice aquacrop has also been used for various purposes such as evaluating yield response to irrigation and soil management lin et al 2012 simulating the crop development under climate change xu et al 2019 and irrigation scheduling optimization zhai et al 2019 as a water driven model aquacrop is particularly suitable for irrigation scheduling optimization however there are two main limitations to applying aquacrop directly in a study such as ours the first limitation is that the original aquacrop model is distributed solely as a compiled software package which makes it difficult to combine aquacrop with other models or make specific modifications according to the users need to solve this problem researchers have developed an open source version of aquacrop aquacrop os which is implemented in matlab octave foster et al 2017 and r language rodriguez and ober 2019 due to the growing popularity of python thanks to its flexibility interoperability extensive ecosystem and accessible learning resources a python version of aquacrop acosp based on aquacrop os was later developed kelly and foster 2021 however not all the functionalities of the original aquacrop model are included in the acosp version and in particular the acosp is relatively simplified for paddy rice production compared to the original version to address this issue in the present study we introduced modifications to acosp to make it closer to the original aquacrop the second limitation is that although aquacrop includes a bund height parameter this parameter cannot represent hp as defined above because this parameter retains a fixed value for the whole season while in practice at different growth stages there are different acceptable flooding depths for rice therefore we modified acosp to handle a changeable bund height i e hp and reflect the irrigation reality of paddy rice in china the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a model specific to paddy rice based on acosp called the acop rice model which mimics irrigation practices of paddy rice in china 2 to establish a simulation optimization method combining nsga ii and acop rice model and to analyze its results and 3 to explore the impact of rainfall pattern on the optimal results in different regions in terms of trade off between the different objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data paddy rice is cultivated in six rice growth subregions of china including double season rice early rice and late rice and single season rice middle rice considering the geographical location data accessibility and cropping system nine cases in the six representative irrigation districts and corresponding meteorological stations were selected in different rice growing subregions as shown in fig 2 and table 1 for each location over 60 years of daily observations were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma gov cn including minimum and maximum temperature average temperature average wind speed sunshine duration mean relative humidity and precipitation information on recommended agricultural management in each region was collected from the national irrigation experiment results information service platform http ggsy jsgg com cn 9080 eisflex field experiments and previous studies yu 2013 liu et al 2005 gu et al 2005 the growth period of paddy rice was divided into seven stages the returning green rg early tillering et late tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mr and yellow ripe yr stages all cases were assumed to apply the conventional flooded irrigation mode and the criteria of field water depth in each growth stage of paddy rice are shown in table a1 as mentioned above in practice farmers drain and dry the paddy fields in the sun for a few days at the end of the lt period to control inefficient tillers for improving production to account for this practice in all the simulations the field was fully drained for 5 days before the end of the lt period 2 2 modification to the acosp model as mentioned before the acosp model is simplified with respect to irrigation management with bunds compared to original aquacrop model in this study we added a new irrigation method specific to paddy rice to the acosp model this modification was required in order to enable setting different thresholds for the depth of the surface water layer at each growth stage which as described above is the common practice for paddy rice cultivation in china an irrigation event is generated when the water depth reaches this threshold like in the original aquacrop model another important improvement is that the height of soil bund hp is allowed to change with growth stage to adapt to the requirements of rice waterlogging control finally we also fixed bugs in acosp specific rice irrigation simulation the code of this new model acop rice and a detailed description of the modifications that were made can be found on the github https github com rheat acop rice the parameters about phenology were adjusted based on actual situation of each case and the other parameters were adopted from the default rice model in original aquacrop model as shown in table a2 to test and evaluate the modified model the simulation results were compared with the original version since the original aquacrop cannot change the height of the bunds this verification was performed with constant values of the bunds to assess the performance of acop rice model the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were used 1 m a e i 1 n y ˆ i y i n 2 r m s e i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 n 3 r 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y 2 y i y 2 where y ˆ i represents the outputs of acop rice model y i represents the outputs of original aquacrop model i is the sample sequence i 1 2 n y is the average values of outputs from original aquacrop model 2 3 optimization model for irrigation scheduling 2 3 1 framework for simulation optimization model the decision variables are the water depth thresholds hmin hmax and hp at each growth period constrained by some conditions the objective in our study was to maximize rainfall use efficiency and yield while minimizing the number of irrigation events the latter was preferred to the seasonal irrigation amount since under the current situation in which irrigation is operated manually irrigation cost is directly proportional to the number of irrigation events referring to the irrigation threshold of the local conventional flooding irrigation nine levels are defined by increasing or decreasing by 0 5 10 15 or 20 mm compared to current recommended practices in each station as shown in table a1 5 mm increment was defined for convenient management the current irrigation mode reported in table a1 is used as control check ck throughout the study it is obvious that there could be no advantage in decreasing hp or increasing hmin therefore hp was not included in the optimization process but was set to 20 mm higher than the original level for all periods at all locations similarly only lowering hmin was considered mathematically 4 min r f 1 h min h max h p min n f 2 h min h max h p min y f 3

h min ck i h max ck i h p ck i are the water depth criteria of current recommended practices in i th period as listed in table a1 in mm when hmin 0 the crop should extract water from the soil rather than from the pound water and the absolute value of hmin correspond to the amount of water that would be removed from the root zone it is worth noting that the rice seedlings at rg stage are too fragile to adapt rapidly to changing water depth which would cause serious yield reduction and no water layer is maintained on the paddy field at yr stage therefore the optimization did not include the rg and yr stages the general flowchart of the complete procedure is shown on fig 3 and table 2 the multi objective optimization was conducted with nsga ii a fast and elitist multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on a non dominated sorting approach implemented in the genetic algorithm toolbox geatpy2 for python http www geatpy com first the input data consisting of weather soil crop and management information combined with decision variables i e water depth thresholds were imported to acop rice model for crop growth simulation the outputs of acop rice model consisting of runoff irrigation scheduling and yield were used to calculate the optimization criteria according to nsga ii algorithm the decision variables were updated and a non dominated solution set was obtained through iterations 2 3 2 decision making for multi objective optimization a set of non dominated solutions was obtained by multi objective genetic algorithm from which a solution should be selected for implementation decision makers can simply set the weight values of different objectives according to their preferences or adopt advanced multi objective criteria decision making methods such as the efficiency coefficient method and the entropy method guo et al 2021 shao et al 2018 since our goal was to explore the impact of rainfall distribution on irrigation scheduling optimization four optimal solutions were selected and compared the extreme solutions corresponding to the lowest number of irrigation events maximum rainfall use efficiency highest yield and the balanced solution in which all three criteria were close to their average values a simple way to choose the balanced solution of a solution set is by considering normalized criteria and select the solution at which their sum is minimum mathematically 10 w i j 1 n f i max f i h min j h max j h p j f i max f i min min j i 1 n w i j where f i max and f i min are the maximum and minimum values for the i th objective functions of non dominated solution set the subscript j corresponds to the j th non dominated solution i 1 2 n and n is the number of objective functions 3 results and discussion 3 1 testing and evaluation of acop rice model the simulation results of the original aquacrop model and the acop rice model for nce are shown in fig 4 it is worth noting that one of the main reasons the acop rice model was developed was the need to implement different values of hp at different growth periods however since in the aquacrop model using different bunds heights for different periods was not possible for this test hp was set to a constant value of 60 mm all other parameters were those of conventional flooding irrigation mode reported in table a1 the results showed that the simulated values of acop rice model were in perfect agreement with the simulated values of original aquacrop model confirming the validity of the acop rice model for this nominal case the yield increase over time is due to increasing ambient co2 concentration raes et al 2009 the values of mae for seasonal irrigation seasonal drainage and yield were 0 448 mm 1 110 mm and 0 002 ton ha respectively the corresponding rmse values were 3 665 mm 3 858 mm and 0 005 ton ha respectively the values of r2 were all above 0 99 the range of evaluation indicators were acceptable and similar to the results for dry crops obtained in previous study kelly and foster 2021 3 2 rainfall distribution and drainage pattern the distributions of various rainfall levels in each growth period for the nine locations considered in the study are shown in fig 5 the rainfall level was divided into six categories labeled as light rain moderate rain heavy rain storm heavy storm and extraordinary storm with the corresponding thresholds 0 1 10 10 25 25 50 and 50 100 100 250 250 mm d overall rainfall distribution varied greatly with location and growth periods from the seasonal average average stack it can be seen that southern locations generally obtained more rain than northern ones there was more rainfall in nce ncm zje zjl and dlm with multi year average daily precipitation of 7 5 mm d 5 2 mm d 4 8 mm d 5 7 mm d and 5 5 mm d respectively ncl shm ycm and xxm had less rainfall with multi year average daily precipitation of 2 7 mm d 3 5 mm d 1 0 mm d and 3 3 mm d respectively for different growth periods the curve of rainfall is the typical unimodal sort but with differences in amplitude duration and time of the maximum rainfall the peak of rainfall distribution for most stations was heading flowering period while the peak of rainfall distribution for xxm and zjl was in early tillering period for nce was in returning green and for ncl was in the first three growth periods according to the probability distribution of the various rainfall levels among the rainy locations nce ncm zje zjl and dlm the rainfall distribution of nce and ncm were significantly concentrated with the proportion of storm or above of 44 and 46 followed by zje and zjl which were 30 and 34 respectively the probability of storm or above in dlm was much lower 19 in the less rainy areas ncl shm xxm and ycm the rainfall was more intensive in xxm and ncl where the proportion of storm or above was 33 and 27 respectively while the proportion of extreme rain in shm and ycm was much lower 13 and 7 respectively in addition storm or above occurred more frequently in the periods with most rainfall such as in heading flowering period of nce returning green of ncm returning green and late tillering of ncl heading flowering of shm and early tillering of xxm to summarize the rainfall distribution in nce and ncm is uneven with more rain in ncl and xxm it is uneven with less rain in zje zjl and dlm it is even with more rain and in shm and ycm it is even with less rain in each simulation the time interval between the occurrence of drainage and the last irrigation was determined and the accumulated precipitation during that period was calculated to identify the degree of rainfall caused drainage after irrigation the drainage pattern of conventional flooding irrigation mode is shown in fig a1 for all cases and fig 6 for ncl as an example for the ncl case drainage events caused by rainfall after irrigation occurred 1 7 times a year on average and the frequency of drainage gradually decreased as the time elapsed from the last irrigation increased about 88 of the drainage caused by rainfall after irrigation occurred within the first four days after irrigation and 99 within the first seven days therefore to improve the use rate of rainfall management should focus on rainfall within one week after irrigation drainage occurred when the average daily rainfall reached about 46 mm far exceeding the value of hp hmax which was 10 mm the accumulated rainfall required to cause drainage generally increased slightly with the number of days since the last irrigation which was expected due to crop water uptake and evaporation furthermore the average amount of drainage reached 15 mm per event corresponding to 29 of rainfall for all cases fig a1 the drainage events caused by rainfall after irrigation occurred twice a year on average at each location with a minimum of once a year at ycm and a maximum of 3 times a year at dlm the average amount of drainage ranged from 14 mm to 30 mm per event and approximately 27 of rainfall was lost to drainage on average the largest losses occurred in xxm where drainage corresponded to 34 of rainfall these results indicated that significant water savings could be potentially achieved by utilizing rainfalls more efficiently 3 3 optimal irrigation scheduling for paddy rice the non dominated solution sets of each case are shown in fig 7 it is found that the 3d scatter of non dominated solutions showed a convex shape heading to the maximum of r minimum of n and maximum of y the lowest yield usually occurred at the outer edge of the r and n projection indicating that optimization of n and r would lower yield y however this yield reduction was negligible less than 0 1ton ha the range of optimal n and r varied greatly from case to case rainfall use efficiency of each location ranged from 0 40 to 0 90 and the number of irrigation events ranged from 3 to 35 due to the negligible variations observed in yield yield was not taken into consideration when choosing the balanced solution and this solution was based on the balance of irrigation and rainfall use efficiency table 3 summarizes the objective values associated with four of the non dominated solutions the solution with the least number of irrigation events n min the solution with highest rainfall use efficiency r max the solution with the highest yield y max and the balanced solution balanced since the yield range in nce ncl and dlm was less than 0 01ton ha the y max solution was not selected in these cases as shown in table 3 among the n min solutions the number of irrigation events decreased significantly with an average reduction of 9 4 57 per year the rainfall use rate also increased with an average increase of 5 however in some cases the rainfall use rate was slightly worse when reducing the number of irrigation events such as ycm at the r max solutions the rainfall use efficiency increased by 19 on average the number of irrigation events also decreased with an average decrease of 3 events 18 per season however similarly to what was observed before in some cases improving rue slightly increased the irrigation number of irrigation events such as for instance ncl where the number of irrigation events increased by 3 6 in y max the yield changed slightly after optimization at the balanced solutions the improvements of the number of irrigation events and rainfall use rate were on average 7 4 events 45 and 17 respectively both of them were close to the best single objective oriented improvement of n min solution or r max solution which indicated that the optimization model can improve the two objectives greatly at the same time by adjusting the water depth thresholds according to zhai et al 2019 in the longtouqiao irrigation district near the suihua station sh irrigation should be conducted 14 17 times the number of irrigation events at r max solution obtained in the present work is slightly lower 12 irrigation events given that the geographical location and irrigation system of the two sites are not strictly identical our current results can be considered to be well within a reasonable range the improvement achieved for the various objective functions indicated that the optimization of the number of irrigation events outperformed that of rainfall use efficiency quite disappointingly even after optimization rainfall use rate remained rather low i e 65 and there was still a large amount of rain water wasted this may be linked to the characteristics of rainfall some cases have high proportion of very intense rainfall events which are hard to utilize such as nce as shown in fig 5 when heavy storms of more than 100 mm are encountered it is difficult for paddy fields to maintain such a large amount of rainfall and drainage is likely to occur thus greatly limiting the potential improvement of rainfall use efficiency the optimization in this paper mainly improves the rainfall use efficiency of those accessible rainfall types i e light rain moderate rainfall and heavy rain for extremely heavy rain decision makers still need to consider other measures such as building rain storage facilities such as ponds and small reservoirs nakanishi 2004 chen et al 2016 the water depth thresholds corresponding to the four optimal solutions selected are shown in table 4 compared to the current irrigation mode the optimized irrigation mode only modified the water depth thresholds without requiring any other complex adjustments so farmers could adopt these recommended thresholds without professional training each cell in table 4 shows the optimal values of hmin hmax and hp for a specific growth period at a specific location the optimal hmin basically reached the lower bound set for this variable or was close to this lower bound except for some periods of y max solutions for example at shm of y max solutions the hmin for et lt and ml period were only 5 mm less than original level the original hmin in shm i e 0 mm was low and the lower bound of hmin is close to the threshold of water stress and yield loss therefore the decision aiming at the highest yield would rigorously prevent such negative impact for yield even if it is very slight furthermore although the optimal hmin is 20 mm in the other three solutions causing water stress the water stress degree was relatively slight so there was no obvious risk of production reduction for other cases the original hmin was not shallow so there was no potential water stress risk even if hmin reached its lower boundary in fact in the study of dong et al 2020 on awd sd and swdi of water saving irrigation technologies the hmin of non critical period of water demand was negative to make the field soil exposed to the air without causing yield loss which is in agreement with our optimization of hmin as for the improvement of hmax the optimal hmax of n min solutions was higher than original level for all cases the higher hmax the larger the amount of water delivered at each irrigation event and the lower the number irrigation events however as the water depth of paddy field increased after irrigation the risk of exceeding hp and hence the risk of drainage in case of heavy rainfall increased reducing the effective use rate of rainfall for the r max solutions hmax values were lower than the original levels therefore when adopting this strategy the water depth in paddy field was usually maintained at a low level often reaching hmin and hence requiring frequent irrigation in addition the water layer in the field was maintained at a low level for a long time and there was more space to store rainfall consequently improving the effective use rate of rainfall for balanced solutions the pattern of optimal hmax was not uniform due to the variation of rainfall distribution as discussed in more details in section 3 4 below it must be recalled that all the analysis was conducted after increasing hp by 20 mm for all cases corresponding to an actual bund height of 70 100 mm some scholars have applied water catching and controlled irrigation method to improve rainwater use efficiency in nanjing in such cases hp can reach 150 200 mm without causing significant yield reduction guo et al 2009 however the experiments conducted by guo et al 2010 showed that the yield of rice subjected to drought stress began to decline if hp exceeded 150 200 mm in some specific growth periods given that drought stress was not observed on our simulation results and the optimal hp was lower than the thresholds of causing adverse impact the bund heights obtained in our study are safe and reasonable 3 4 impact of rainfall distribution on optimization benefit the number of irrigation events and the rainfall use efficiency of each growth period associated with the three non dominated solutions n min r max and balanced and current recommendations ck are presented in fig a2 and fig a3 for all cases and in fig 8 for ncl as an example as shown in fig 8 compared to current recommendations solution the improvement for rainfall use efficiency was lowest for the n min solution and largest for the r max solution for the number of irrigation events the pattern was reversed however for the jb period the number of irrigation events for the ck solution was higher than that of the r max solution indicating that optimizing rainfall efficiency improved r at the expense of the number of irrigation events similarly the n min solution sacrificed r to reduce n in the lt yr periods in these specific growth periods the change of hmax was capable of greatly improving r or n solely thus one of the objectives overwhelmed the other it is worth noting that such a situation occurred in lt and yr period for the n min solution in several cases as shown in fig a2 and fig a3 this is most probably due to the compulsive drainage events in lt and yr periods which is also the reason why the rainfall use efficiency was negative in lt and yr periods and hmax tended to be increased for reducing irrigation frequency resulting in heavier drainage in the lt and yr periods for the whole growth period the optimization of hmax was affected by the amount of rainfall the probability of hmax being lower after optimization than initially was smaller at rainy locations nce ncm zje zjl dlm than that at drier locations ncl shm xxm ycm see table 4 for example the hmax after optimization was lower than that before optimization in five growth periods of dlm compared to three for ycm because decreasing hmax in areas with high rainfall was greatly beneficial to improve the use rate of rainfall without increasing the number of irrigation events significantly taking dlm as an example the rainfall use efficiency r of the balanced solution was very close to that of the r max solution only 1 less than that of r max solution but the number of irrigation events of each growth period was much lower than that of the r max solution table 3 the reason is that rainfall was captured in rainy areas as a supplementary water source the need for additional irrigation was reduced and the number of irrigation events was not significantly increased on the contrary increasing hmax in dry areas was beneficial to reduce the number of irrigation events but did not reduce significantly rainfall use efficiency taking ycm as an example the number of irrigation events at the balanced solution was closer to that of the n min solution only four more irrigation events than that of n min solution but the rainfall use efficiency was far higher than that of n min solution approximately 30 see table 3 because there was little rainfall available in ycm see fig 5 the probability of drainage caused by rainfall was small and the rainfall use efficiency was not significantly reduced by increasing hmax more importantly rainfall distribution also affected the optimization of hmax more specifically the probability of the optimal hmax being lower than before optimization was smaller for nce and ncm which both have large proportion of extreme rainfalls and was higher for zje zjl and dlm which have even rainfall distribution see table 4 and fig 5 when a high proportion of rainfall occurs as extreme rainfall even if hmax was lowered a large proportion of rainfall would be lost by drainage anyway and frequent irrigation would still be needed in absence of rain in such cases it was advantageous to set hmax to a high value rather than to lower it in different growth periods the optimization of hmax was affected by several factors the first was the influence of rainfall distribution for instance in the et period of nce and hf of ncl although the whole growth periods of both cases have even and plentiful rainfall the rainfall in these two specific periods was much less than in the other growth periods see fig 5 so the optimal hmax was higher secondly operational constraints controlled specific growth periods in all cases the optimal hmax of the lt and mr periods were lower than before optimization because the water needed to be drained in the last five days of the lt period and at the yr period that followed the mr period these operational constraints became the dominant factor and the optimization tended to choose a lower hmax to keep a shallow water depth in paddy field for avoiding drainage last but not least the length of the growth period had an impact on the tradeoff between the objectives for instance although the jb period at nce was rainy it was much longer and had greater water requirement than the other periods which made it extremely significant for the optimization therefore for the whole growth period the benefit of increasing hmax on the number of irrigation events was greater than that of increasing the rainfall use rate brought by decreasing the hmax and the rainfall distribution in this growth period became a secondary influencing factor the time interval between the last irrigation and the occurrence of drainage as well as the precipitation accumulated during that period were determined and are shown in fig a4 for all cases and fig 9 for ncl as an example noting that balanced solutions were selected for comparison these figures can be compared to fig a1 and fig 6 respectively for ncl it can be seen that optimizing hmin and hmax reduces greatly the probability of drainage after irrigation and the cumulative rainfall required to induce drainage increased drainage events occurred 0 8 times per year on average compared to 1 7 times a year before optimization after optimization drainage occurred on average when single day rainfall exceeded 61 mm which was 15 mm more than before optimization it is worth noting that contrarily to what was observed before optimization fig 6 after optimization the drainage events did not occur primarily within one week of the last irrigation event about 75 the reason might be that after optimization the rainfall level required to trigger drainage was very high and drainage occurrence was no longer strongly influenced by irrigation for all cases fig a4 drainage events occurred 1 2 times per year on average compared to twice a year before optimization the maximum decrease was achieved at ycm 1 8 times furthermore drainage corresponded to a smaller proportion of rainfall 22 on average compared to 27 before optimization 4 conclusions in this study a new multi objective optimization method for irrigation scheduling for paddy rice using a modified version of the aquacrop model acop rice has been developed and tested based on over 60 years of historical meteorological records in six rice growing regions in china the conventional flooded schedule was optimized by optimizing two thresholds related to water depth in each growth stage namely the water level at which irrigation was triggered hmin and the water level after irrigation hmax the rainfall distribution in our cases can be divided into 4 types uneven with more rain in nce and ncm uneven with less rain in ncl and xxm even with more rain in zje zjl and dlm even with less rain in shm and ycm as for drainage pattern the drainage events caused by rainfall after irrigation occurred 2 0 times per year on average at each case most of them occurred within 7 days after irrigation which accounted 26 9 of rainfall during the period after optimization three non dominated solutions corresponding to minimum number of irrigation events n min maximum rain use efficiency r max and balanced performance were thoroughly investigated compared with the conventional mode of flooded irrigation the average number of irrigation events was reduced by 9 4 57 3 0 18 and 7 4 44 for the n min r max balanced solutions respectively on average optimization led to corresponding rainfall use efficiency improvement of 5 19 and 17 respectively overall proportionally more improvement was achieved for number of irrigation events than for rainfall use efficiency the optimization of hmax is closely related to the dominance of diverse factors including rainfall distribution operation constraints required field drainage at specific periods and the length of growth period rainfall distribution affects the overall optimization while operational constraints strongly affect the lt and ml periods due compulsory drainage and the longest growth period with heavy water requirement tended to counteract the impact of rainfall distribution due to the complexity of the actual irrigation costs in china the objective function of this paper did not consider economic factors and only the trade off between number of irrigation events rainfall use rate and yield was investigated farmers can choose the optimal solution for implementation according to their own preferences and the specific conditions in which they operate for example increasing rainfall efficiency is likely to be a priority in places where water is scarce in which case it would be natural for farmers to choose the r max solution conversely at locations where water resources are less limited farmers could prefer to implement the n min solution that prioritizes reducing labor associated with irrigation in further studies irrigation costs and crop prices could be considered and single objective optimization considering net profit could be investigated the present work relied solely on historical data which has limitations since it does not consider weather forecasts therefore in further studies following the example of chen et al 2021

evapotranspiration et comprises two major processes evaporation from plant and soil surfaces and transpiration from plants to air adnan et al 2021a b et is essential for estimating hydrological processes agronomy systems irrigation water demands etc muhammad et al 2021 shiri et al 2013 accurate et estimation is crucial also for irrigation plans and enhances the efficiency of water resource usage ferreira et al 2019 accurate et computation is highly reliant on the availability of eto which is the et of a hypothetical grass with a fixed surface resistance of 70 sm 1 the uniform height of 0 12 m and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998a b et computation requires precise eto estimation for improved agricultural water reuse and irrigation efficiency feng et al 2016 shiri et al 2013 literature review reported three frequently used empirical formulations for the eto assessment including thornthwaite pereira and pruitt 2004 hargreaves hargreaves and allen 2003 and fao 56 penman monteith pm penman 1948 the first two methods are based on temperature single factor whereas pm based on multiple factor synthesis method li et al 2022 the pm method based on empirical formulations and the laws of energy balance and aerodynamics and remains the most widely used eto computation method it is also used for the validation of other eto methods tabari et al 2012 the pm approach on the other hand necessitates several climatic parameters including maximum minimum air temperatures relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed which makes it challenging to use especially in developing nations abdullah et al 2015 traore et al 2010 as a result a simpler model with fewer meteorological characteristics is needed to estimate eto with adequate precision many scholars have used empirical approaches such as radiation based humidity based temperature based water budget based pan based and mass transfer based approaches to estimate reference evapotranspiration using inadequate meteorological data bickici arikan et al 2021 xu and singh 2002 others focused on the remote sensing dataset for estimating and mapping the crop evapotranspiration pôças et al 2020 in the absence of enough meteorological variables the radiation based humidity based and temperature based models are typically employed to compute eto rather than the pm technique priestley and taylor 1972 the simplicity and great precision of the hargreaves h and modified hargreaves mh methods temperature based made them the most employed eto estimation methods luo et al 2014 improved versions of the 11 temperature based approaches to estimate eto and noted that the h method achieved the best accuracy almorox et al 2015 the commonly available radiation based models are the priestley taylor pt markkink m ritchie r models these models have been evaluated for eto computation and it was found that the pt and r equations were more accurate than the m equation feng et al 2016 another study reported the use of multiple empirical models to estimate eto such as the pt m r jensen haise and turc models the study found the r equation to outperform the other models tabari et al 2012 the humidity based models such as the schendel s and romanenko rom equations are often employed to derive eto from humidity based weather data djaman et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2017 but despite the good performance of several empirical models such as the h mh pt r rom and s equations in calculating eto their effectiveness varies greatly among locations in another study 16 empirical models were tested for eto computation in the absence of comprehensive meteorological data the study found that the eto was either overestimated or underestimated by the empirical models djaman et al 2015 hence more research and development are required to build superior eto estimation models with better precision while using fewer meteorological variables 1 2 soft computing literature review eto computation using meteorological data has been deemed a regression task that artificial intelligence ai models that can solve in recent decades thanks to the rapid advancement in computational capacity and ai theory cui et al 2022 danandeh mehr et al 2022 dou and yang 2018 halder et al 2021 kalteh 2015 the first ai model adopted for eto prediction was the artificial neural networks ann kumar et al 2002 later a self organizing map neural network was built to measure the variability of evaporation based on meteorological factors chang et al 2010 the extreme learning machine elm model has also been evaluated for eto estimation and found to be suitable for the modeling task abdullah et al 2015 the support vector machine svm was designed to forecast eto using only radiation data and air temperature the assessment showed that svm performed better than the h and pt methods in eto estimation wen et al 2015 multivariate relevance vector machine is used to build a forecasting for eto based on limited dataset and the model confirmed its potential against classical empirical formulation torres et al 2011 in saudi arabia researchers used a back propagation technique for multilayer perceptron mlp transformation into a back propagation neural network bpnn for eto prediction yassin et al 2016 the study noted that this modification the addition of a bp method was required to bridge the accuracy gap between pm and ann models in southwest china metrological data from two stations have been used to build random forests rf and generalized regression neural networks grnn for daily eto estimation feng et al 2017 both models local and external rf and grnn models were found to efficiently estimate the daily eto even though the rf model outperformed grnn meteorological data from 8 weather stations across china has been used to build rf m5tree extreme gradient boosting xgboost svm gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and elm models for daily eto estimation fan et al 2018 the performance of the xgboost and gbdt models were found to be similar in terms of stability and accuracy to the performance of the elm and svm however the computation cost of the xgboost and gbdt models was substantially less the study thereby recommended the xgboost and gbdt models for daily eto estimation in the studied region of china the hybridization of rf and a wavelet technique for eto estimation in the southern region of iran has been presented by shiri 2018 the study results proved the feasibility of the hybridized rf model as it demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional rf and empirical models similarly a hybridized gpr model has been shown to perform better eto estimation than a standalone model karbasi 2017 eto estimation within the african region using

inspired algorithms ant colony optimization aco genetic algorithm ga flower pollination algorithm fpa and cuckoo search algorithm csa has been reported by wu et al 2019 the study observed a good match between the predicted and computed eto values using the fao 56 pm method the elm fpa and elm csa models performed better eto prediction than the standard elm model an assessment of four supervised learning algorithms for future eto prediction has been reported by saggi and jain 2019 the evaluated models deep learning multilayer perceptron dl generalized linear model glm rf and gbdt performed well when it came to modeling daily eto several studies have confirmed the viability of ml models for eto prediction in various locations around the globe chen et al 2020 huang et al 2019 for complicated hydrological processes like eto estimation hybrid models built by combining two or more ml models often perform better than standalone models jing et al 2019 eto estimation in the north western region of china with limited metrological data using an optimized elm model with particle swarm optimization pso has been reported by zhu et al 2020 another study in malaysia used metrological data from 3 stations in sarawak to confirm the performance of the hybrid elm pso model moth flame optimization mfo and whale optimization algorithm woa on eto prediction chia et al 2021 the study found woa elm to achieve a higher average rank score based on the data daily eto estimation at four sites in china s arid region and four stations in the humid region using a hybrid xgboost woa model has been reported yan et al 2021 the study found that eto estimation using the xgboost woa model is a promising technique when there is a dearth of long term historical or complete recent data the

b the proposed model was benchmarked against other models such as anfis rf m5tree and three well known ml models the performance of the ffa kelm model was a bit better than that of the anfis model but both models outperformed the rf and m5p models other applications of ai models in predicting and forecasting eto include the use of genetic programming gp goci et al 2015 gaussian process regression

2019 2016 hybrid deep learning ahmed et al 2022 1 3 research motivation and objectives although remarkable progress has been witnessed over the literature on developing versions of ai models for modeling eto some limitations are still associated with such a kind of theoretical model for instance machine learning ml algorithms like ai models behave differently from one region based on the physical meaning of the climate on the other hand using the data decomposition based complementary models based on several hydrometeorological parameters to forecast evapotranspiration has received much attention one of the requirements of these methods is to use the feature selection strategy to reduce unimportant components in the forecasting process which could reduce the computational cost and enhance the accuracy of the forecasting procedure hence the current research objective is the development of a powerful expert complementary system comprised of the mvmd decomposition scheme coupled with the ridge regression feature selection and three efficient ml approaches i e brt kelm and xgboost to forecast the daily eto in three regions of india here five important meteorological inputs including the maximum and minimum temperatures tmax tmin c relative humidity rh wind speed us km h and solar radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 were simultaneously decomposed using mvmd pre processing scheme then after identifying the critical antecedent information two first lags the most significant decomposed components were utilized to feed the ml models for the multi step ahead t 3 and t 7 forecasting of the eto in three regions of india several visual validation tools and statistical analysis were implemented to compare the performance of the complementary models and standalone counterpart models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and data acquisition in the present study three stations including i bathinda ii ludhiana and ii hisar were considered for daily eto forecasting using advanced ml techniques the bathinda and ludhiana stations lie in punjab state and hisar station lies in haryana state see fig 1 furthermore both the states are part of the trans gangetic plain of india appendix a provides the latitude longitude altitude agro climatic region and climatic data period the study sites cover an area of 3385 km2 bathinda 3767 km2 ludhiana and 3983 km2 hisar the climate on study sites varies from semi arid bathinda and hisar to sub humid ludhiana kumar et al 2008 niwas et al 2006 on study sites the maximum hottest temperature experienced in summer 28 48 c at bathinda 43 45 c at ludhiana and 40 48 c at hisar and minimum coolest through winter 4 21 c at bathinda 0 6 5 8 c at ludhiana and sub zero to 6 c at hisar sharma et al 2021 vishwakarma et al 2022 the sites received an average annual rainfall of 436 mm at bathinda 75 received during july to september 528 680 mm at ludhiana 70 received during july to september and 470 472 mm at hisar 80 received during july to september individually anurag et al 2017 majumder et al 2020 malik et al 2021 rawal et al 2020 the daily weather data i e maximum and minimum temperatures tmax tmin c relative humidity rh wind speed us km h wind speed was measured using a cup anemometer placed at 3 5 m height in agrometeorology for bathinda ludhiana hisar stations and then adjusted to the standard height of 2 m above the ground surface using the procedure recommended by allen et al 1998a b and solar radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 of 4 years for bathinda was acquired from observatory installed at jodhpur research farm of punjab agricultural university pau regional research station rrs bathinda for ludhiana were collected from school of climate change and agrometeorology pau ludhiana and for hisar were obtained from ccshau chaudhary charan singh haryana agricultural university hisar all the three weather observatories stations are installed on the land surface reference site conditions for measuring the atmospheric conditions after that the obtained data of 4 years was partitioned into two sets one for training which consists of the year 2016 2018 1096 observations for bathinda ludhiana and year 2011 2013 1096 observations for hisar whereas the second for testing comprises 365 observations the year 2019 for bathinda ludhiana and year 2014 for hisar 2 2 data quality and integrity assessment generally the quality and integrity of data are assessed using double mass curve technique which requires more than 30 years of record of many locations but in our case the length of the data is 4 years in three locations which can be simply examined by doing the basic statistical analysis i e minimum maximum range mean standard std deviation skewness kurtosis table 1 summarizes the statistical features of daily climatological data i e tmin tmax rh us rs and eto in training and testing phases it can be clearly seen from table 1 the skewness was positive and negative while the kurtosis indicates the platykurtic and leptokurtic nature of climatic variables in training and testing stages similarly the mean and std deviation values of tmin tmax rh us rs and eto variables are not have much variation in training and testing datasets which help in building the best possible models with less uncertainty in forecasting daily eto at study sites fig 2 demonstrates the original signals of the eto for each station 2 3 penman monteith fao 56 description the present study utilized the penman monteith pm model of fao 56 food and agricultural organization manual no 56 for the computation of daily eto at bathinda hisar and ludhiana stations mathematically the fao 56 pm model is written as allen et al 1998a b 1 et o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 here eto represents reference evapotranspiration mm day denotes slope of saturation vapor pressure kpa c r n indicates net radiation mj m² day g designates soil heat flux density mj m² day γ labels psychrometric constant kpa c t represents the means air temperature c u 2 signifies the wind speed at 2 m height above the ground surface m s and calculated as u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 here u z is the measured wind speed at z m above ground surface m s and z is the height of measurement above ground surface m allen et al 1998a b and e s and e a are saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa the cropwat 8 0 software developed by the fao built formulated fao 56 pm model was used to calculate the values of daily eto and considered as the baseline data for the assessment of ai models in semi arid and sub humid climates 2 4 ridge regression feature selection hoerl and kennard 1970 introduced the ridge regression modeling approach to deal with collinearity issues the issue of multicollinearity or collinearity in terms of moderate exact complete and severe supercollinearity collinearity exists amongst highly correlated regressors or predictors the predictors used for daily eto forecasting have a similar nature in a set of κ dimension predictors with n data points each feature is standardized to have zero mean and a variance of 1 to give reliable estimates of features the following cost function for ridge regression is applied fan and li 2020 2 min ω 0 ω 1 2 n i 1 n y i ω 0 x i t ω 2 λ n r ω where x i y i i 1 2 n represents a random sample of the linear regression model whereby x i x 1 x 2 x n t and y i y 1 y 2 y n t ω 0 and ω ω 1 ω 2 ω κ are model parameters or regression coefficients r ω is a penalty term regulated by the λ while i 1 n y i ω 0 x i t ω 2 is the square loss term the ridge regression penalty term aka l2 norm is as follows 3 r ω 1 2 ω 2 2 1 2 ρ 1 κ ω j 2 note that ω 2 2 ρ 1 κ ω j 2 the ridge regression penalty term shrinks the size of the regression coefficients whereby a multidimensional sphere represents the constraint region hence for a solution the elliptical contours can intersect anywhere on the sphere as a successor algorithm of the ordinary least squares regression the ridge regression overcomes the collinearity issues by penalizing the least squares loss on the regression coefficients by a l2 penalty wu 2020 2 5 multivariate variational mode decomposition mvmd the mvmd was developed by rehman and aftab 2019 which is an advancement of the robust variational mode decomposition vmd dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 in vmd a one dimensional predictor variable x t is decomposed into m amplitude modulated frequency modulated sub signals called the band limited intrinsic mode functions bl imfs imf m t dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 hence the signal x t can be reconstructed in least square sense by summing up the m bl imfs i e imf m t as follow 4 x t m 1 m imf m t the mvmd advances this approach to multivariate signals for instance for a matrix of k multivariate signals x t x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t x k t the mvmd extracts m multivariate bl imfs imf m t where imf m t imf 1 t imf 2 t imf 3 t imf k t the alternating direction method of multipliers admm approach is applied to resolve the optimization of variational modes in the fourier domain rehman and aftab 2019 this approach yields an optimal set of multivariate decomposed signals with matching center frequencies and narrow bandwidths present in all multivariate signals rehman and aftab 2019 the mvmd has the following features that make it a superior multivariate decomposition tool a splits the multivariate modulated frequencies that otherwise would not be possible with multivariate data set b mode alignment ability of multivariate signals c robustness to noise and d quasi orthogonality across decomposed signals gavas et al 2020 ur rehman and aftab 2019 for more information on mvmd readers can refer to rehman and aftab 2019 2 6 boosted regression tree brt the brt is a non parametric model beneficial for data mining since it does not assume any prior knowledge about the connection between independent and dependent variables saha et al 2021 brt is a model that combines regression trees with boosting friedman 2001 this model is one of the various ways to enhance the performance of a single model through multiple independent models faskari et al 2022 brt is a hybrid approach that combines two techniques i cart regression tree and ii the development and integration of a series of models using the boosting technique in comparison to a single model this method produces more accurate and robust models brt addresses the single decision tree s primary shortcoming which is a rather poor match brt generates just the initial tree from the whole training set the remaining data from the original tree is used to construct the succeeding trees elith et al 2008 boosting procedures are used to increase the regression tree s predictive power this method is similar to model averaging the averaged results of numerous models are employed except that the boosting operation is a step by step process in which models are fitted to a subset of the training dataset in each iteration step however this demands the inclusion of additional tress n t to the model carty et al 2015 this approach offers many advantages including the ability to evaluate huge amounts of data quickly and is less susceptible to model overfitting westreich et al 2010 fig 3a illustrates the framework of the brt method 2 7 extreme gradient boosting xgboost the xgboost modeling approach was initially proposed by friedman 2001 and later developed by chen and guestrin 2016 it is an efficient implementation of regression trees that incorporates boosting to an ensemble of regression trees naganna et al 2020 each tree is generated independently with respective self governing binary rules terminating at the nodes having continuous scores the mapping of respective trees is carried out during the training process to fit the training samples and the final output is an aggregation of scores at corresponding nodes the output function y i t of the total t number of the tree is calculated as follows chen and guestrin 2016 5 y i t m 1 t f m x i tree i t 1 f t x i where tree i t 1 is the generated tree and f m x i is the newly created tree model the trees in the xgboost model are determined through minimization of a regularized objective function chen and guestrin 2016 6 m i n k 1 k g f x k y k τ γ k τ 1 2 θ δ τ 2 regularization term where g represents a differentiable convex loss function which computes the difference between f x k and y k in which f x k is the mapping result and y k is the observed output values the γ and θ represents two coefficients while k τ represents the number of nodes leaves in the respective τ th tree and δ τ is the scores vector of respective τ th tree nodes during model training an iterative process is used to add respective trees in each separate iteration then a greedy algorithm is utilized to iteratively add splits to the tree beginning from the solitary tree the regularization term as shown in eq 6 penalizes the complexity of the ensemble model to avoid overfitting for this normalization is used in the objective function in addition shrinkage and column subsampling is also employed further to reduce overfitting yu et al 2020 this modeling approach has been found to have better predictive performance than solitary tree modeling techniques yu et al 2020 here xgboost model was performed using xgboost library on python environment and main significant tuning parameter to adjust the xgboost model are n estimation max depth learning rate and child weight singh et al 2022 the schematic flowchart of the xgboost is illustrates in fig 3b 2 8 kernel extreme learning machine kelm the extreme learning machine elm was built to train single hidden layer feedforward networks slfn quickly huang et al 2006 input weights and hidden biases can be assigned randomly in elm araba et al 2021 despite this global approximation features of slfn networks trained using the elm technique have been established the randomly assigned network hidden layer parameters on the other hand add to the instability of the analytical conclusions derived using the elm model kelm is an extension of elm however the feature mapping in elm has been replaced with a kernel matrix which results in a technique with greater stability and accuracy than elm huang et al 2011 different kernel functions such as the linear polynomial and radial basis can be employed to solve various issues in kelm slfn may be demonstrated as follows huang et al 2011 7 f x h x β h β where x is the input sample and h x as well as h denote the hidden layer feature mapping matrix respectively and β is the weight between the hidden and output layers the weight in elm may be computed using the following equation 8 β h t i c h h t 1 y where c is the penalty factor or regularization coefficient that is used to balance the empirical and structural risk of kelm i is the unit matrix and y is the target matrix thus elm may be stated simply as 9 f x h x β h x h t i c h h t 1 y the kernel function k x i x j is added in kelm to replace the hidden layer s feature mapping h x as a result eq 6 is expressed as follows 10 f x h x h t i c hh t 1 y k x x 1 k x x n t i c ω kelm 1 y ω kelm is a kernel matrix defined as follows 11 ω kelm h h t ω kelmi j h x i h x j k x i x j the gaussian kernel function which is the most often utilized is presented in the following equation 12 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 additionally the kelm based model optimizes only two hyperparameters c and γ kernel parameter by utilizing the grid search approach the kelm method s structure is depicted in fig 3c 2 9 validation and assessment of proposed models the capability and prediction accuracy of proposed kelm brt and xgboost models as well as their combination with mvvmd were evaluated and compared using the goodness of fit values and statistical errors such as correlation coefficient r root mean

hybridized models such as mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost were created in matlab r2020a and python programming languages for multi step forecasting the daily eto in three locations i e bathinda hisar and ludhiana in india it is to be noted that the xgboost model was designed in a python environment using the open source software library in contrast mvmd and kelm and brt models were constructed in a matlab environment adding to this the brt method adopted the fitrensemble learner function besides the rr feature selection model was implemented in python via scikit learn open library pedregosa et al 2011 execution of these models was carried out on intel r core tm i7 6700 cpu series 2 40 ghz and 16 g ram fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed modeling approach to forecast multi step evapotranspiration in three regions of india further steps of the model development are described in detail as follows step 1 extraction of significant antecedent information at this step the correlation of antecedent time lagged input data i e tmin tmax rh us and rs with eto was determined with the help of the cross correlation function the results confirmed that the two first lags i e t 1 and t 2 for horizons of t 3 and t 7 for all three stations based on the trial and error approach appeared to be statistically the most important and significant influencing the forecasting accuracy of the models thus the significant lags at t 1 and t 2 were used to forecast the daily eto in all regions step 2 decomposition of significant input lags via mvmd technique this is the primary pre processing step of the proposed newly hybrid modeling approach the mvmd method is applied to demarcate each input time series simultaneously at t 3 and t 7 time horizons the mvmd approach is more efficient due to simultaneously decomposing input features than the vmd method the decomposed signals of each input are comprised of the imfs and residuals the number of modes in this study has been optimized by adopting the trial and error process for bathinda station the number of k 3 modes for each input has been considered whereas hisar and ludhiana stations these numbers are k 8 at both t 1 and t 7 respectively appendix b shows the parameters setting of the mvmd pre processing procedure for all three stations for bathinda station the total number of decomposed factors imfs residuals is 40 while these decomposed components for hisar and ludhiana stations are acquired as imfs residuals 90 total step 3 feature selection using rr method determining the best feature is a critical step in designing an ml based model feature selection is advantageous because it reduces the computational complexity and the reduction of dimensionality to enhance the accuracy and foster better interpretability bennasar et al 2015 maier et al 2010 the rr technique was used to determine the crucial components for eto forecasting at both t 1 and t 7 scales the rr feature selection strategy is based on the important concept of ridge regression theory all the decomposed signals by mvmd were examined in the rr technique to filter select determine the important features which can reduce cost and computational time fig 5 showed the selection procedure via the rr approach to filter out the unimportant features for each component in the understudy regions according to fig 5 the number of filtered features for bathinda station is 14 and 17 at t 3 and t 7 time step while the number of unimportant remained features are 26 and 23 respectively on the other hand the total filtered selected features are 47 and 43 for the time horizon at t 3 and t 7 respectively in the hisar station the features which are remaining unimportant turns out to be 43 t 3 and 47 t 7 time scale for ludhiana station the filtered decomposed features 17 with remaining features 73 at t 3 whereas these filtered features 29 and remaining 61 at t 7 respectively the results of steps 3 are also summarized in appendix b the results of the feature selection process i e rr in filtering the imfs residuals show that the reduction percentage is approximately 35 and 42 2 for bathinda station 52 20 and 44 40 for hisar station while 18 88 and 32 22 for ludhiana station to forecast daily eto at t 3 and t 7 respectively step 4 preparations of models feeding all the decomposed components are used as the input to directly feed the ml models after filtering by rr feature selection in the case of machine learning ml models application there is no hard and fast rule for splitting the dataset into training calibration and testing validation periods it is based on the author s choice availability and length of data generally for training 60 80 of data and for testing 20 40 of data of the entire dataset length is used barzegar et al 2019 deo et al 2017 in the current case the 4 years data obtained from the pre processing stages were divided into training subset 1093 and 1090 for the horizons of t 3 and t 7 respectively and testing subset 364 and 363 for the horizons of t 3 and t 7 respectively with a ratio of 75 25 to design eto forecasting ai based models moreover the cross validation or any data random sampling cannot be adopted as time series data by definition occur in a temporal order sequence and this order or sequence must be preserved in order to keep the structure of the series intact bergmeir and benítez 2012 here three robust ml techniques were employed xgboost brt and kelm the normalization and denormalization process of training and testing sets were also adopted to unify the data scale and increase the convergence speed of the models since the main objective of this research study is to examine and explore the effect of the pre processing procedure on improving the forecasting accuracy of daily eto it is crucial to benchmark the performance of the proposed hybrid models with the state of the art standalone models thus to design the standalone models it is required to ignore steps 2 and 3 and directly use the information related to the lags at t 3 and t 7 of the input time series notably the features number in each standalone model in both horizons is 10 for all three study stations 3 2 setting and tuning parameter optimization one of the most critical tasks in constructing the forecasting methods based on ml models is to adjust the tuning and pruning of parameters connected with these ml models to attain optimum accuracy rehamnia et al 2020 different techniques were utilized to fine tune the parameters to obtain optimum ml models the list consists of metaheuristic optimization algorithms jamei et al 2021 grid search shahsavar et al 2021 random search and manual search methods trial and error strategy xia et al 2017 etc the grid search methodology was utilized to get the optimum parameters based on rmse as a convergence criterion appendix c standalone models and appendix d hybrid models display the details on setting up the parameters during the multi step forecasting of daily eto the parameters used to design the xgboost model are n estimation max depth learning rate and child weight the brt model utilizes learning rate maxnumsplits and numlearningcycles while the number of parameters for klm is two regularization coefficient and kernel parameter the comprehensive details on fine tuning of these parameters are provided in the appendix c and d during the optimum performance of the standalone models as well as hybridized models for all study regions 4 application results and analysis in this study three standalone kelm brt xgboost and three hybrids mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt mvmd rr xgboost complementary ai models were employed for multi scale ahead i e t 3 and t 7 days forecasting of eto in semi arid bathinda hisar and sub humid ludhiana climates the developed complementary ai models were trained 1096 data and tested 365 data using daily climatic data of tmax tmin rh us and rs their predictive accuracy was evaluated using goodness of fit metrics r rmse mape nse ia u95 and through graphical interpretation scatter plots taylor diagram residual plots uncertainty plot temporal plots the complementary ai model with minimum values of rmse mape u95 and maximum r nse and ia in the testing phase will be considered optimal for multi scale ahead forecasting of eto the obtained results are discussed in the following sub sequent sections 4 1 application of ai models at study sites table 2 outlined the training and testing results of standalone and hybrid ai models for t 3 and t 7 days ahead foresting of eto at bathinda semi arid region the forecasting accuracy for training period can be seen in table 2 for t 3 day forecasting the highest values of r nse ia and u95 are 0 949 0 899 0 974 and 1 379 respectively and the lowest values of rmse 0 497 mm day and mape 13 537 during the testing yielded by mvmd rr xgboost model similarly for t 7 these values are r 0 938 nse 0 874 ia 0 968 u95 1 538 rmse 0 555 mape 17 006 produced by mvmd rr xgboost model these assessment metrics for benchmark comparing models can be seen in table 2 table 2 shows that the hybrid complementary ai models produced better forecasts than standalone models also the superior forecasting was attained by the hybrid mvmd rr kelm against comparing models for t 3 and t 7 forecasting horizons therefore the rank of models was assigned based on their testing performance as mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr xgboost mvmd rr brt xgboost kelm brt to forecast eto in both horizons the training and testing results of t 3 and t 7 days ahead forecasting at hisar semi arid region yielded by the complementary ai models are given table 3 as observed from table 3 the performance metrics are mvmd rr kelm r 0 972 nse 0 944 ia 0 986 and u95 1 364 rmse 0 494 mm day mape 12 299 for t 3 day ahead forecasting of eto likewise for t 7 days ahead the mvmd rr kelm model appeared to be the best by acquiring the highest values of r nse ia u95 and lowest magnitudes of rmse and mape error metrics please refer to the table 3 for more details the complementary mvmd rr kelm model produced better outcomes than the other models at both timescales also the proposed models follow the same ranking order as marked for at hisar site the comparative results of kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models for t 3 and t 7 horizons at ludhiana sub humid region in training and testing stages are reported in table 4 the comparison of results revealed that the mvmd rr kelm model is more powerful than kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models in t 3 and t 7 days ahead forecasting of eto at ludhiana site hence the following pattern of rank has been established mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr xgboost mvmd rr brt kelm xgboost brt for timescale eto forecasting appendix e f and g demonstrate the scatter plots of kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models for t 3 and t 7 days ahead eto forecasting during training and testing phases at bathinda hisar and ludhiana stations respectively the blue circle represents the training dataset and the red circle signifies the testing dataset both periods datasets were plotted against the measured eto concerning the best fit line solid black line also the relative error bands of 30 dash dot lines were added about the best fit line for checking the distribution pattern of data it is clearly noted that the mvmd rr kelm model outcomes concentrate more towards the best fit within the relative error bands or less amount of diffusion than the other applied ai models for t 3 and t 7 days ahead eto forecasting at three study locations also the scatter plots confirm the forecasting superiority of the kelm model enhanced with the mvmd rr technique in semi arid and sub humid climates fig 6 shows the taylor diagram of measured and forecasted eto values on t 3 and t 7 days ahead on bathinda hisar and ludhiana using kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models during testing taylor diagram taylor 2001 is a set of three statistical measures including standard deviation sd e rmse and r in a polar coordinate system a model with minimum value std rmse and maximum value of r is considered optimal another way to judge the model accuracy is if the test field is close to the reference field is marked as the best model fig 6 test fields are kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt mvmd rr xgboost models and the reference field is measured eto represented by the red circle on the x axis these figures clearly show the mvmd rr kelm model is close to the measured eto for both horizons at all three study sites the residual plots i e absolute error of standalone and complementary ai models for t 3 and t 7 time scale forecasting in the testing stage at three study sites are shown in fig 7 which display that the residual errors are lowest within 2 0 to 2 5 for t 3 days and 3 0 for t 7 days of the mvmd rr kelm model at study locations overall evaluation of results indicates that the mvmd rr kelm model provides the best eto forecast on 3 and 7 days ahead closely followed by the mvmd rr xgboost model under in this study 4 2 discussion and achievements comparison the eto outcomes of the testing phase of the kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models on three and seven days are compared in fig 8 in terms of uncertainty analysis at bathinda hisar and ludhiana stations these uncertainty plots of semi arid and sub humid climates proved that the mvmd rr kelm model is more accurate than other proposed models for multi scale daily eto forecasting with tmax tmin rh us and rs climatic variables similarly the temporal variation of eto measured dash dot black line and forecasted values of 3 and 7 days are plotted in appendix h only for mvmd rr kelm dash dot red line mvmd rr brt dash dot green line and mvmd rr xgboost dash dot blue line models during testing appendix h clearly reveals that the eto forecast of the mvmd rr kelm model is close to the measured eto for both horizons in semi arid and sub humid climates additionally by considering the statistical measures and uncertainty plots it was also detected that when the forecasting shifted from t 3 to t 7 days it indicates a slight reduction in performance of the mvmd rr kelm model this reflection led to future development research and boosted the proposed models for weekly and monthly scale eto forecasting granata and di nunno 2021 recommended that the deep learning based models provide better eto predictions for 1 7 days ahead in south florida and central nevada they also noted a slight reduction in the performance of deep learning models for 7 days eto predictions in our study based on the performance indicators it was noted that the obtained results of the ml models are slightly reduced on the t 7 horizon than the t 3 horizon for all sites and agreed with granata and di nunno 2021 findings thus the applied ml based models are more viable for t 3 horizon forecasting at study sites in addition the weather station density on a spatial scale does not affect the performance of the employed ml models i e kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost because these models are classified as lumped means treat the region area as a single unit they provide no information about the spatial distribution of inputs and outputs and simulate only the gross response of the region area dawson and wilby 2001 evapotranspiration is a complex environmental process affected by many climate parameters in the past half century the major influencing factor was climate change a variety of models exits for eto estimation namely combination radiation mass transfer water budget and temperature based all these models are site specific and not valid for all regions and climates gao et al 2017 the fao 56 pm model is more precise and widely adopted for eto estimation but it needs more data which is unavailable in developing countries tikhamarine et al 2019 2020a hence building a reliable and robust paramount model is the demand of the current scenario to reduce water losses and wastages by filling the gaps between water application and crop water requirements and improving crop productivity and agricultural practices nowadays this issue has been tackled by the ai ml machine learning models and received a massive application for eto forecasting in different climates over the globe granata 2019 granata et al 2020 malik et al 2019 sharma et al 2021 tikhamarine et al 2020a b wu et al 2021b hence the outcomes of the proposed ai models in the present study were standardized with the existed studies on eto forecasting using ml standalone and hybrid models kaya et al 2021 kisi et al 2021 maroufpoor et al 2020 adnan et al 2021a b estimated monthly eto at dhaka and mymensing stations of bangladesh using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and their hybrid i e anfis wca water cycle algorithm anfis mfo moth flame optimization algorithm and anfis wcamfo models perusal of results reveal superiority of anfis wcamfo model rmse 0 220 0

expression programming hs hargreaves samani and pt priestley taylor models for estimating monthly eto in semi arid and arid climates of iran they found hybrid svr iwd model outperformed the other ai models in both environments the above reported state of arts also confirms the better feasibility of hybrid ai models for eto estimation in different climates furthermore many ai models are sensitive to outliers and need to be optimized properly by tuning their parameters the proposed mvmd rr kelm model is very strong to outliers and has good generalization ability than other ai models so it is anticipated that the mvmd rr kelm model can provide better forecasts of eto for three and seven days ahead on study locations henceforth the obtained results of the hybrid mvmd rr kelm model explore its capability in forecasting eto in semi arid and sub humid climates and marked as a more robust reliable and dynamic model in addition this way of eto forecasting will help in maintaining agricultural operations with the available water resources on a regional scale and handle the issue of increasing water stress in agriculture due to climate change 5 conclusion the precise forecasting of eto is crucial for managing field scale based agriculture these days ai techniques are excellent tools for constructing forecasting models the present research investigates the feasibility of a newly proposed hybrid ai model i e mvmd rr kelm against the kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr brt mvmd rr xgboost models for three and seven days ahead eto forecasting in semi arid and sub humid climatic zones the goodness of fit metrics and visual inspection were employed to check the proposed ai models forecasting accuracy standalone hybrid appraisal of results based on goodness of fit indicators reveals that the kelm model integrated with the mvmd rr algorithm mvmd rr kelm outperformed the kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr brt mvmd rr xgboost models for both horizons eto forecasting at study locations additionally better outcomes of the mvmd rr kelm model were found for t 3 horizon eto forecasting and a slight reduction in accuracy of ai models was noted for t 7 horizon eto forecasting in both climates furthermore the prediction accuracy of the mvmd rr kelm model improved remarkably comprehensively the findings of this study are immensely significant to develop a smart intelligence system for precisely forecasting daily eto and accordingly scheduling irrigation plans for the protection of available water resources in the study regions this study is limited with the three stations of two states i e punjab and haryana of india the obtained results cannot generalize the capability and accuracy of employed machine learning models for other climatic conditions zones in the world so it is recommended that the aerial extension i e india versus other countries with different environmental conditions need to be analyzed and confirms the feasibility of the applied machine learning models therefore future research will include more stations from different locations across the globe to overcome this difficulty and make generalized conclusions about the efficacy of the machine learning models in addition the geospatial technique will be considered for projecting the impact of reference evapotranspiration on a spatial scale furthermore the different percentage of training and testing datasets will be considered to strengthen the predictability of applied ml models against the other ml i e simple hybrid models for future studies funding there is no funding ethics

9332,accurate ahead forecasting of reference evapotranspiration eto is crucial for effective irrigation scheduling and management of water resources on a regional scale a variety of methods are available for eto simulation but the most trending is complementary artificial intelligence ai paradigms in this research a novel multivariate variational mode decomposition technique mvmd integrated

semi arid and sub humid regions keywords reference evapotranspiration multi step ahead forecasting integrative artificial intelligence haryana mvmd 1 introduction 1 1 research background evapotranspiration et comprises two major processes evaporation from plant and soil surfaces and transpiration from plants to air adnan et al 2021a b et is essential for estimating hydrological processes agronomy systems irrigation water demands etc muhammad et al 2021 shiri et al 2013 accurate et estimation is crucial also for irrigation plans and enhances the efficiency of water resource usage ferreira et al 2019 accurate et computation is highly reliant on the availability of eto which is the et of a hypothetical grass with a fixed surface resistance of 70 sm 1 the uniform height of 0 12 m and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998a b et computation requires precise eto estimation for improved agricultural water reuse and irrigation efficiency feng et al 2016 shiri et al 2013 literature review reported three frequently used empirical formulations for the eto assessment including thornthwaite pereira and pruitt 2004 hargreaves hargreaves and allen 2003 and fao 56 penman monteith pm penman 1948 the first two methods are based on temperature single factor whereas pm based on multiple factor synthesis method li et al 2022 the pm method based on empirical formulations and the laws of energy balance and aerodynamics and remains the most widely used eto computation method it is also used for the validation of other eto methods tabari et al 2012 the pm approach on the other hand necessitates several climatic parameters including maximum minimum air temperatures relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed which makes it challenging to use especially in developing nations abdullah et al 2015 traore et al 2010 as a result a simpler model with fewer meteorological characteristics is needed to estimate eto with adequate precision many scholars have used empirical approaches such as radiation based humidity based temperature based water budget based pan based and mass transfer based approaches to estimate reference evapotranspiration using inadequate meteorological data bickici arikan et al 2021 xu and singh 2002 others focused on the remote sensing dataset for estimating and mapping the crop evapotranspiration pôças et al 2020 in the absence of enough meteorological variables the radiation based humidity based and temperature based models are typically employed to compute eto rather than the pm technique priestley and taylor 1972 the simplicity and great precision of the hargreaves h and modified hargreaves mh methods temperature based made them the most employed eto estimation methods luo et al 2014 improved versions of the 11 temperature based approaches to estimate eto and noted that the h method achieved the best accuracy almorox et al 2015 the commonly available radiation based models are the priestley taylor pt markkink m ritchie r models these models have been evaluated for eto computation and it was found that the pt and r equations were more accurate than the m equation feng et al 2016 another study reported the use of multiple empirical models to estimate eto such as the pt m r jensen haise and turc models the study found the r equation to outperform the other models tabari et al 2012 the humidity based models such as the schendel s and romanenko rom equations are often employed to derive eto from humidity based weather data djaman et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2017 but despite the good performance of several empirical models such as the h mh pt r rom and s equations in calculating eto their effectiveness varies greatly among locations in another study 16 empirical models were tested for eto computation in the absence of comprehensive meteorological data the study found that the eto was either overestimated or underestimated by the empirical models djaman et al 2015 hence more research and development are required to build superior eto estimation models with better precision while using fewer meteorological variables 1 2 soft computing literature review eto computation using meteorological data has been deemed a regression task that artificial intelligence ai models that can solve in recent decades thanks to the rapid advancement in computational capacity and ai theory cui et al 2022 danandeh mehr et al 2022 dou and yang 2018 halder et al 2021 kalteh 2015 the first ai model adopted for eto prediction was the artificial neural networks ann kumar et al 2002 later a self organizing map neural network was built to measure the variability of evaporation based on meteorological factors chang et al 2010 the extreme learning machine elm model has also been evaluated for eto estimation and found to be suitable for the modeling task abdullah et al 2015 the support vector machine svm was designed to forecast eto using only radiation data and air temperature the assessment showed that svm performed better than the h and pt methods in eto estimation wen et al 2015 multivariate relevance vector machine is used to build a forecasting for eto based on limited dataset and the model confirmed its potential against classical empirical formulation torres et al 2011 in saudi arabia researchers used a back propagation technique for multilayer perceptron mlp transformation into a back propagation neural network bpnn for eto prediction yassin et al 2016 the study noted that this modification the addition of a bp method was required to bridge the accuracy gap between pm and ann models in southwest china metrological data from two stations have been used to build random forests rf and generalized regression neural networks grnn for daily eto estimation feng et al 2017 both models local and external rf and grnn models were found to efficiently estimate the daily eto even though the rf model outperformed grnn meteorological data from 8 weather stations across china has been used to build rf m5tree extreme gradient boosting xgboost svm gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and elm models for daily eto estimation fan et al 2018 the performance of the xgboost and gbdt models were found to be similar in terms of stability and accuracy to the performance of the elm and svm however the computation cost of the xgboost and gbdt models was substantially less the study thereby recommended the xgboost and gbdt models for daily eto estimation in the studied region of china the hybridization of rf and a wavelet technique for eto estimation in the southern region of iran has been presented by shiri 2018 the study results proved the feasibility of the hybridized rf model as it demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional rf and empirical models similarly a hybridized gpr model has been shown to perform better eto estimation than a standalone model karbasi 2017 eto estimation within the african region using a hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with a nature inspired tuning optimization technique has been reported tao et al 2018 daily eto prediction using four elm models optimized with bio inspired algorithms ant colony optimization aco genetic algorithm ga flower pollination algorithm fpa and cuckoo search algorithm csa has been reported by wu et al 2019 the study observed a good match between the predicted and computed eto values using the fao 56 pm method the elm fpa and elm csa models performed better eto prediction than the standard elm model an assessment of four supervised learning algorithms for future eto prediction has been reported by saggi and jain 2019 the evaluated models deep learning multilayer perceptron dl generalized linear model glm rf and gbdt performed well when it came to modeling daily eto several studies have confirmed the viability of ml models for eto prediction in various locations around the globe chen et al 2020 huang et al 2019 for complicated hydrological processes like eto estimation hybrid models built by combining two or more ml models often perform better than standalone models jing et al 2019 eto estimation in the north western region of china with limited metrological data using an optimized elm model with particle swarm optimization pso has been reported by zhu et al 2020 another study in malaysia used metrological data from 3 stations in sarawak to confirm the performance of the hybrid elm pso model moth flame optimization mfo and whale optimization algorithm woa on eto prediction chia et al 2021 the study found woa elm to achieve a higher average rank score based on the data daily eto estimation at four sites in china s arid region and four stations in the humid region using a hybrid xgboost woa model has been reported yan et al 2021 the study found that eto estimation using the xgboost woa model is a promising technique when there is a dearth of long term historical or complete recent data the combination of the kernel elm model with k means clustering and firefly algorithms ffa for monthly mean daily eto prediction in the poyang lake basin of south china has been reported by wu et al 2021a b the proposed model was benchmarked against other models such as anfis rf m5tree and three well known ml models the performance of the ffa kelm model was a bit better than that of the anfis model but both models outperformed the rf and m5p models other applications of ai models in predicting and forecasting eto include the use of genetic programming gp goci et al 2015 gaussian process regression

2019 2016 hybrid deep learning ahmed et al 2022 1 3 research motivation and objectives although remarkable progress has been witnessed over the literature on developing versions of ai models for modeling eto some limitations are still associated with such a kind of theoretical model for instance machine learning ml algorithms like ai models behave differently from one region based on the physical meaning of the climate on the other hand using the data decomposition based complementary models based on several hydrometeorological parameters to forecast evapotranspiration has received much attention one of the requirements of these methods is to use the feature selection strategy to reduce unimportant components in the forecasting process which could reduce the computational cost and enhance the accuracy of the forecasting procedure hence the current research objective is the development of a powerful expert complementary system comprised of the mvmd decomposition scheme coupled with the ridge regression feature selection and three efficient ml approaches i e brt kelm and xgboost to forecast the daily eto in three regions of india here five important meteorological inputs including the maximum and minimum temperatures tmax tmin c relative humidity rh wind speed us km h and solar radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 were simultaneously decomposed using mvmd pre processing scheme then after identifying the critical antecedent information two first lags the most significant decomposed components were utilized to feed the ml models for the multi step ahead t 3 and t 7 forecasting of the eto in three regions of india several visual validation tools and statistical analysis were implemented to compare the performance of the complementary models and standalone counterpart models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and data acquisition in the present study three stations including i bathinda ii ludhiana and ii hisar were considered for daily eto forecasting using advanced ml techniques the bathinda and ludhiana stations lie in punjab state and hisar station lies in haryana state see fig 1 furthermore both the states are part of the trans gangetic plain of india appendix a provides the latitude longitude altitude agro climatic region and climatic data period the study sites cover an area of 3385 km2 bathinda 3767 km2 ludhiana and 3983 km2 hisar the climate on study sites varies from semi arid bathinda and hisar to sub humid ludhiana kumar et al 2008 niwas et al 2006 on study sites the maximum hottest temperature experienced in summer 28 48 c at bathinda 43 45 c at ludhiana and 40 48 c at hisar and minimum coolest through winter 4 21 c at bathinda 0 6 5 8 c at ludhiana and sub zero to 6 c at hisar sharma et al 2021 vishwakarma et al 2022 the sites received an average annual rainfall of 436 mm at bathinda 75 received during july to september 528 680 mm at ludhiana 70 received during july to september and 470 472 mm at hisar 80 received during july to september individually anurag et al 2017 majumder et al 2020 malik et al 2021 rawal et al 2020 the daily weather data i e maximum and minimum temperatures tmax tmin c relative humidity rh wind speed us km h wind speed was measured using a cup anemometer placed at 3 5 m height in agrometeorology for bathinda ludhiana hisar stations and then adjusted to the standard height of 2 m above the ground surface using the procedure recommended by allen et al 1998a b and solar radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 of 4 years for bathinda was acquired from observatory installed at jodhpur research farm of punjab agricultural university pau regional research station rrs bathinda for ludhiana were collected from school of climate change and agrometeorology pau ludhiana and for hisar were obtained from ccshau chaudhary charan singh haryana agricultural university hisar all the three weather observatories stations are installed on the land surface reference site conditions for measuring the atmospheric conditions after that the obtained data of 4 years was partitioned into two sets one for training which consists of the year 2016 2018 1096 observations for bathinda ludhiana and year 2011 2013 1096 observations for hisar whereas the second for testing comprises 365 observations the year 2019 for bathinda ludhiana and year 2014 for hisar 2 2 data quality and integrity assessment generally the quality and integrity of data are assessed using double mass curve technique which requires more than 30 years of record of many locations but in our case the length of the data is 4 years in three locations which can be simply examined by doing the basic statistical analysis i e minimum maximum range mean standard std deviation skewness kurtosis table 1 summarizes the statistical features of daily climatological data i e tmin tmax rh us rs and eto in training and testing phases it can be clearly seen from table 1 the skewness was positive and negative while the kurtosis indicates the platykurtic and leptokurtic nature of climatic variables in training and testing stages similarly the mean and std deviation values of tmin tmax rh us rs and eto variables are not have much variation in training and testing datasets which help in building the best possible models with less uncertainty in forecasting daily eto at study sites fig 2 demonstrates the original signals of the eto for each station 2 3 penman monteith fao 56 description the present study utilized the penman monteith pm model of fao 56 food and agricultural organization manual no 56 for the computation of daily eto at bathinda hisar and ludhiana stations mathematically the fao 56 pm model is written as allen et al 1998a b 1 et o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 here eto represents reference evapotranspiration mm day denotes slope of saturation vapor pressure kpa c r n indicates net radiation mj m² day g designates soil heat flux density mj m² day γ labels psychrometric constant kpa c t represents the means air temperature c u 2 signifies the wind speed at 2 m height above the ground surface m s and calculated as u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 here u z is the measured wind speed at z m above ground surface m s and z is the height of measurement above ground surface m allen et al 1998a b and e s and e a are saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa the cropwat 8 0 software developed by the fao built formulated fao 56 pm model was used to calculate the values of daily eto and considered as the baseline data for the assessment of ai models in semi arid and sub humid climates 2 4 ridge regression feature selection hoerl and kennard 1970 introduced the ridge regression modeling approach to deal with collinearity issues the issue of multicollinearity or collinearity in terms of moderate exact complete and severe supercollinearity collinearity exists amongst highly correlated regressors or predictors the predictors used for daily eto forecasting have a similar nature in a set of κ dimension predictors with n data points each feature is standardized to have zero mean and a variance of 1 to give reliable estimates of features the following cost function for ridge regression is applied fan and li 2020 2 min ω 0 ω 1 2 n i 1 n y i ω 0 x i t ω 2 λ n r ω where x i y i i 1 2 n represents a random sample of the linear regression model whereby x i x 1 x 2 x n t and y i y 1 y 2 y n t ω 0 and ω ω 1 ω 2 ω κ are model parameters or regression coefficients r ω is a penalty term regulated by the λ while i 1 n y i ω 0 x i t ω 2 is the square loss term the ridge regression penalty term aka l2 norm is as follows 3 r ω 1 2 ω 2 2 1 2 ρ 1 κ ω j 2 note that ω 2 2 ρ 1 κ ω j 2 the ridge regression penalty term shrinks the size of the regression coefficients whereby a multidimensional sphere represents the constraint region hence for a solution the elliptical contours can intersect anywhere on the sphere as a successor algorithm of the ordinary least squares regression the ridge regression overcomes the collinearity issues by penalizing the least squares loss on the regression coefficients by a l2 penalty wu 2020 2 5 multivariate variational mode decomposition mvmd the mvmd was developed by rehman and aftab 2019 which is an advancement of the robust variational mode decomposition vmd dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 in vmd a one dimensional predictor variable x t is decomposed into m amplitude modulated frequency modulated sub signals called the band limited intrinsic mode functions bl imfs imf m t dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 hence the signal x t can be reconstructed in least square sense by summing up the m bl imfs i e imf m t as follow 4 x t m 1 m imf m t the mvmd advances

aftab 2019 2 6 boosted regression tree brt the brt is a non parametric model beneficial for data mining since it does not assume any prior knowledge about the connection between independent and dependent variables saha et al 2021 brt is a model that combines regression trees with boosting friedman 2001 this model is one of the various ways to enhance the performance of a single model through multiple independent models faskari et al 2022 brt is a hybrid approach that combines two techniques i cart regression tree and ii the development and integration of a series of models using the boosting technique in comparison to a single model this method produces more accurate and robust models brt addresses the single decision tree s primary shortcoming which is a rather poor match brt generates just the initial tree from the whole training set the remaining data from the original tree is used to construct the succeeding trees elith et al 2008 boosting procedures are used to increase the regression tree s predictive power this method is similar to model averaging the averaged results of numerous models are employed except that the boosting operation is a step by step process in which models are fitted to a subset of the training dataset in each iteration step however this demands the inclusion of additional tress n t to the model carty et al 2015 this approach offers many advantages including the ability to evaluate huge amounts of data quickly and is less susceptible to model overfitting westreich et al 2010 fig 3a illustrates the framework of the brt method 2 7 extreme gradient boosting xgboost the xgboost modeling approach was initially proposed by friedman 2001 and later developed by chen and guestrin 2016 it is an efficient implementation of regression trees that incorporates boosting to an ensemble of regression trees naganna et al 2020 each tree is generated independently with respective self governing binary rules terminating at the nodes having continuous scores the mapping of respective trees is carried out during the training process to fit the training samples and the final output is an aggregation of scores at corresponding nodes the output function y i t of the total t number of the tree is calculated as follows chen and guestrin 2016 5 y i t m 1 t f m x i tree i t 1 f t x i where tree i t 1 is the generated tree and f m x i is the newly created tree model the trees in the xgboost model are determined through minimization of a regularized objective function chen and guestrin 2016 6 m i n k 1 k g f x k y k τ γ k τ 1 2 θ δ τ 2 regularization term where g represents a differentiable convex loss function which computes the difference between f x k and y k in which f x k is the mapping result and y k is the observed output values the γ and θ represents two coefficients while k τ represents the number of nodes leaves in the respective τ th tree and δ τ is the scores vector of respective τ th tree nodes during model training an iterative process is used to add respective trees in each separate iteration then a greedy algorithm is utilized to iteratively add splits to the tree beginning from the solitary tree the regularization term as shown in eq 6 penalizes the complexity of the ensemble model to avoid overfitting for this normalization is used in the objective function in addition shrinkage and column subsampling is also employed further to reduce overfitting yu et al 2020 this modeling approach has been found to have better predictive performance than solitary tree modeling techniques yu et al 2020 here xgboost model was performed using xgboost library on python environment and main significant tuning parameter to adjust the xgboost model are n estimation max depth learning rate and child weight singh et al 2022 the schematic flowchart of the xgboost is illustrates in fig 3b 2 8 kernel extreme learning machine kelm the extreme learning machine elm was built to train single hidden layer feedforward networks slfn quickly huang et al 2006 input weights and hidden biases can be assigned randomly in elm araba et al 2021 despite this global approximation features of slfn networks trained using the elm technique have been established the randomly assigned network hidden layer parameters on the other hand add to the instability of the analytical conclusions derived using the elm model kelm is an extension of elm however the feature mapping in elm has been replaced with a kernel matrix which results in a technique with greater stability and accuracy than elm huang et al 2011 different kernel functions such as the linear polynomial and radial basis can be employed to solve various issues in kelm slfn may be demonstrated as follows huang et al 2011 7 f x h x β h β where x is the input sample and h x as well as h denote the hidden layer feature mapping matrix respectively and β is the weight between the hidden and output layers the weight in elm may be computed using the following equation 8 β h t i c h h t 1 y where c is the penalty factor or regularization coefficient that is used to balance the empirical and structural risk of kelm i is the unit matrix and y is the target matrix thus elm may be stated simply as 9 f x h x β h x h t i c h h t 1 y the kernel function k x i x j is added in kelm to replace the hidden layer s feature mapping h x as a result eq 6 is expressed as follows 10 f x h x h t i c hh t 1 y k x x 1 k x x n t i c ω kelm 1 y ω kelm is a kernel matrix defined as follows 11 ω kelm h h t ω kelmi j h x i h x j k x i x j the gaussian kernel function which is the most often utilized is presented in the following equation 12 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 additionally the kelm based model optimizes only two hyperparameters c and γ kernel parameter by utilizing the grid search approach the kelm method s structure is depicted in fig 3c 2 9 validation and assessment of proposed models the capability and prediction accuracy of proposed kelm brt and xgboost models as well as their combination with mvvmd were evaluated and compared using the goodness of fit values and statistical errors such as correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse willmott s agreement index ia willmott et al 2012 mean absolute percentage error mape and coefficient of uncertainty with a 95 confidence level u 95 and nash sutcliffe model

different locations thus we used two additional performance indicators ia and u 95 the ia tackles the insensitivity issues as the differences between the observed and forecasted data are not squared

hybridized models such as mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost were created in matlab r2020a and python programming languages for multi step forecasting the daily eto in three locations i e bathinda hisar and ludhiana in india it is to be noted that the xgboost model was designed in a python environment using the open source software library in contrast mvmd and kelm and brt models were constructed in a matlab environment adding to this the brt method adopted the fitrensemble learner function besides the rr feature selection model was implemented in python via scikit learn open library pedregosa et al 2011 execution of these models was carried out on intel r core tm i7 6700 cpu series 2 40 ghz and 16 g ram fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed modeling approach to forecast multi step evapotranspiration in three regions of india further steps of the model development are described in detail as follows step 1 extraction of significant antecedent information at this step the correlation of antecedent time lagged input data i e tmin tmax rh us and rs with eto was determined with the help of the cross correlation function the results confirmed that the two first lags i e t 1 and t 2 for horizons of t 3 and t 7 for all three stations based on the trial and error approach appeared to be statistically the most important and significant influencing the forecasting accuracy of the models thus the significant lags at t 1 and t 2 were used to forecast the daily eto in all regions step 2 decomposition of significant input lags via mvmd technique this is the primary pre processing step of the proposed newly hybrid modeling approach the mvmd method is applied to demarcate each input time series simultaneously at t 3 and t 7 time horizons the mvmd approach is more efficient due to simultaneously decomposing input features than the vmd method the decomposed signals of each input are comprised of the imfs and residuals the number of modes in this study has been optimized by adopting the trial and error process for bathinda station the number of k 3 modes for each input has been considered whereas hisar and ludhiana stations these numbers are k 8 at both t 1 and t 7 respectively appendix b shows the parameters setting of the mvmd pre processing procedure for all three stations for bathinda station the total number of decomposed factors imfs residuals is 40 while these decomposed components for hisar and ludhiana stations are acquired as imfs residuals 90 total step 3 feature selection using rr method determining the best feature is a critical step in designing an ml based model feature selection is advantageous because it reduces the computational complexity and the reduction of dimensionality to enhance the accuracy and foster better interpretability bennasar et al 2015 maier et al 2010 the rr technique was used to determine the crucial components for eto forecasting at both t 1 and t 7 scales the rr feature selection strategy is based on the important concept of ridge regression theory all the decomposed signals by mvmd were examined in the rr technique to filter select determine the important features which can reduce cost and computational time fig 5 showed the selection procedure via the rr approach to filter out the unimportant features for each component in the understudy regions according to fig 5 the number of filtered features for bathinda station is 14 and 17 at t 3 and t 7 time step while the number of unimportant remained features are 26 and 23 respectively on the other hand the total filtered selected features are 47 and 43 for the time horizon at t 3 and t 7 respectively in the hisar station the features which are remaining unimportant turns out to be 43 t 3 and 47 t 7 time scale for ludhiana station the filtered decomposed features 17 with remaining features 73 at t 3 whereas these filtered features 29 and remaining 61 at t 7 respectively the results of steps 3 are also summarized in appendix b the results of the feature selection process i e rr in filtering the imfs residuals show that the reduction percentage is approximately 35 and 42 2 for bathinda station 52 20 and 44 40 for hisar station while 18 88 and 32 22 for ludhiana station to forecast daily eto at t 3 and t 7 respectively step 4 preparations of models feeding all the decomposed components are used as the input to directly feed the ml models after filtering by rr feature selection in the case of machine learning ml models application there is no hard and fast rule for splitting the dataset into training calibration and testing validation periods it is based on the author s choice availability and length of data generally for training 60 80 of data and for testing 20 40 of data of the entire dataset length is used barzegar et al 2019 deo et al 2017 in the current case the 4 years data obtained from the pre processing stages were divided into training subset 1093 and 1090 for the horizons of t 3 and t 7 respectively and testing subset 364 and 363 for the horizons of t 3 and t 7 respectively with a ratio of 75 25 to design eto forecasting ai based models moreover the cross validation or any data random sampling cannot be adopted as time series data by definition occur in a temporal order sequence and this order or sequence must be preserved in order to keep the structure of the series intact bergmeir and benítez 2012 here three robust ml techniques were employed xgboost brt and kelm the normalization and denormalization process of training and testing sets were also adopted to unify the data scale and increase the convergence speed of the models since the main objective of this research study is to examine and explore the effect of the pre processing procedure on improving the forecasting accuracy of daily eto it is crucial to benchmark the performance of the proposed hybrid models with the state of the art standalone models thus to design the standalone models it is required to ignore steps 2 and 3 and directly use the information related to the lags at t 3 and t 7 of the input time series notably the features number in each standalone model in both horizons is 10 for all three study stations 3 2 setting and tuning parameter optimization one of the most critical tasks in constructing the forecasting methods based on ml models is to adjust the tuning and pruning of parameters connected with these ml models to attain optimum accuracy rehamnia et al 2020 different techniques were utilized to fine tune the parameters to obtain optimum ml models the list consists of metaheuristic optimization algorithms jamei et al 2021 grid search shahsavar et al 2021 random search and manual search methods trial and error strategy xia et al 2017 etc the grid search methodology was utilized to get the optimum parameters based on rmse as a convergence criterion appendix c standalone models and appendix d hybrid models display the details on setting up the parameters during the multi step forecasting of daily eto the parameters used to design the xgboost model are n estimation max depth learning rate and child weight the brt model utilizes learning rate maxnumsplits and numlearningcycles while the number of parameters for klm is two regularization coefficient and kernel parameter the comprehensive details on fine tuning of these parameters are provided in the appendix c and d during the optimum performance of the standalone models as well as hybridized models for all study regions 4 application results and analysis in this study three standalone kelm brt xgboost and three hybrids mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt mvmd rr xgboost complementary ai models were employed for multi scale ahead i e t 3 and t 7 days forecasting of eto in semi arid bathinda hisar and sub humid ludhiana climates the developed complementary ai models were trained 1096 data and tested 365 data using daily climatic data of tmax tmin rh us and rs their predictive accuracy was evaluated using goodness of fit metrics r rmse mape nse ia u95 and through graphical interpretation scatter plots taylor diagram residual plots uncertainty plot temporal plots the complementary ai model with minimum values of rmse mape u95 and maximum r nse and ia in the testing phase will be considered optimal for multi scale ahead forecasting of eto the obtained results are discussed in the following sub sequent sections 4 1 application of ai models at study sites table 2 outlined the training and testing results of standalone and hybrid ai models for t 3 and t 7 days ahead foresting of eto at bathinda semi arid region the forecasting accuracy for training period can be seen in table 2 for t 3 day forecasting the highest values of r nse ia and u95 are 0 949 0 899 0 974 and 1 379 respectively and the lowest values of rmse 0 497 mm day and mape 13 537 during the testing yielded by mvmd rr xgboost model similarly for t 7 these values are r 0 938 nse 0 874 ia 0 968 u95 1 538 rmse 0 555 mape 17 006 produced by mvmd rr xgboost model these assessment metrics for benchmark comparing models can be seen in table 2 table 2 shows that the hybrid complementary ai models produced better forecasts than standalone models also the superior forecasting was attained by the hybrid mvmd rr kelm against comparing models for t 3 and t 7 forecasting horizons therefore the rank of models was assigned based on their testing performance as mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr xgboost mvmd rr brt xgboost kelm brt to forecast eto in both horizons the training and testing results of t 3 and t 7 days ahead forecasting at hisar semi arid region yielded by the complementary ai models are given table 3 as observed from table 3 the performance metrics are mvmd rr kelm r 0 972 nse 0 944 ia 0 986 and u95 1 364 rmse 0 494 mm day mape 12 299 for t 3 day ahead forecasting of eto likewise for t 7 days ahead the mvmd rr kelm model appeared to be the best by acquiring the highest values of r nse ia u95 and lowest magnitudes of rmse and mape error metrics please refer to the table 3 for more details the complementary mvmd rr kelm model produced better outcomes than the other models at both timescales also the proposed models follow the same ranking order as marked for at hisar site the comparative results of kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models for t 3 and t 7 horizons at ludhiana sub humid region in training and testing stages are reported in table 4 the comparison of results revealed that the mvmd rr kelm model is more powerful than kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models in t 3 and t 7 days ahead forecasting of eto at ludhiana site hence the following pattern of rank has been established mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr xgboost mvmd rr brt kelm xgboost brt for timescale eto forecasting appendix e f and g demonstrate the scatter plots of kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models for t 3 and t 7 days ahead eto forecasting during training and testing phases at bathinda hisar and ludhiana stations respectively the blue circle represents the training dataset and the red circle signifies the testing dataset both periods datasets were plotted against the measured eto concerning the best fit line solid black line also the relative error bands of 30 dash dot lines were added about the best fit line for checking the distribution pattern of data it is clearly noted that the mvmd rr kelm model outcomes concentrate more towards the best fit within the relative error bands or less amount of diffusion than the other applied ai models for t 3 and t 7 days ahead eto forecasting at three study locations also the scatter plots confirm the forecasting superiority of the kelm model enhanced with the mvmd rr technique in semi arid and sub humid climates fig 6 shows the taylor diagram of measured and forecasted eto values on t 3 and t 7 days ahead on bathinda hisar and ludhiana using kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models during testing taylor diagram taylor 2001 is a set of three statistical measures including standard deviation sd e rmse and r in a polar coordinate system a model with minimum value std rmse and maximum value of r is considered optimal another way to judge the model accuracy is if the test field is close to the reference field is marked as the best model fig 6 test fields are kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt mvmd rr xgboost models and the reference field is measured eto represented by the red circle on the x axis these figures clearly show the mvmd rr kelm model is close to the measured eto for both horizons at all three study sites the residual plots i e absolute error of standalone and complementary ai models for t 3 and t 7 time scale forecasting in the testing stage at three study sites are shown in fig 7 which display that the residual errors are lowest within 2 0 to 2 5 for t 3 days and 3 0 for t 7 days of the mvmd rr kelm model at study locations overall evaluation of results indicates that the mvmd rr kelm model provides the best eto forecast on 3 and 7 days ahead closely followed by the mvmd rr xgboost model under in this study 4 2 discussion and achievements comparison the eto outcomes of the testing phase of the kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost models on three and seven days are compared in fig 8 in terms of uncertainty analysis at bathinda hisar and ludhiana stations these uncertainty plots of semi arid and sub humid climates proved that the mvmd rr kelm model is more accurate than other proposed models for multi scale daily eto forecasting with tmax tmin rh us and rs climatic variables similarly the temporal variation of eto measured dash dot black line and forecasted values of 3 and 7 days are plotted in appendix h only for mvmd rr kelm dash dot red line mvmd rr brt dash dot green line and mvmd rr xgboost dash dot blue line models during testing appendix h clearly reveals that the eto forecast of the mvmd rr kelm model is close to the measured eto for both horizons in semi arid and sub humid climates additionally by considering the statistical measures and uncertainty plots it was also detected that when the forecasting shifted from t 3 to t 7 days it indicates a slight reduction in performance of the mvmd rr kelm model this reflection led to future development research and boosted the proposed models for weekly and monthly scale eto forecasting granata and di nunno 2021 recommended that the deep learning based models provide better eto predictions for 1 7 days ahead in south florida and central nevada they also noted a slight reduction in the performance of deep learning models for 7 days eto predictions in our study based on the performance indicators it was noted that the obtained results of the ml models are slightly reduced on the t 7 horizon than the t 3 horizon for all sites and agreed with granata and di nunno 2021 findings thus the applied ml based models are more viable for t 3 horizon forecasting at study sites in addition the weather station density on a spatial scale does not affect the performance of the employed ml models i e kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr kelm mvmd rr brt and mvmd rr xgboost because these models are classified as lumped means treat the region area as a single unit they provide no information about the spatial distribution of inputs and outputs and simulate only the gross response of the region area dawson and wilby 2001 evapotranspiration is a complex environmental process affected by many climate parameters in the past half century the major influencing factor was climate change a variety of models exits for eto estimation namely combination radiation mass transfer water budget and temperature based all these models are site specific and not valid for all regions and climates gao et al 2017 the fao 56 pm model is more precise and widely adopted for eto estimation but it needs more data which is unavailable in developing countries tikhamarine et al 2019 2020a hence building a reliable and robust paramount model is the demand of the current scenario to reduce water losses and wastages by filling the gaps between water application and crop water requirements and improving crop productivity and agricultural practices nowadays this issue has been tackled by the ai ml machine learning models and received a massive application for eto forecasting in different climates over the globe granata 2019 granata et al 2020 malik et al 2019 sharma et al 2021 tikhamarine et al 2020a b wu et al 2021b hence the outcomes of the proposed ai models in the present study were standardized with the existed studies on eto forecasting using ml standalone and hybrid models kaya et al 2021 kisi et al 2021 maroufpoor et al 2020 adnan et al 2021a b estimated monthly eto at dhaka and mymensing stations of bangladesh using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and their hybrid i e anfis wca water cycle algorithm anfis mfo moth flame optimization algorithm and anfis wcamfo models perusal of results reveal superiority of anfis wcamfo model rmse 0 220 0

dhaka mymensing stations in testing phase ahmadi et al 2021 compared the results of the hybrid ai model i e svr iwd support vector regression intelligent water drops against the svr gep gene expression programming hs hargreaves samani and pt priestley taylor models for estimating monthly eto in semi arid and arid climates of iran they found hybrid svr iwd model outperformed the other ai models in both environments the above reported state of arts also confirms the better feasibility of hybrid ai models for eto estimation in different climates furthermore many ai models are sensitive to outliers and need to be optimized properly by tuning their parameters the proposed mvmd rr kelm model is very strong to outliers and has good generalization ability than other ai models so it is anticipated that the mvmd rr kelm model can provide better forecasts of eto for three and seven days ahead on study locations henceforth the obtained results of the hybrid mvmd rr kelm model explore its capability in forecasting eto in semi arid and sub humid climates and marked as a more robust reliable and dynamic model in addition this way of eto forecasting will help in maintaining agricultural operations with the available water resources on a regional scale and handle the issue of increasing water stress in agriculture due to climate change 5 conclusion the precise forecasting of eto is crucial for managing field scale based agriculture these days ai techniques are excellent tools for constructing forecasting models the present research investigates the feasibility of a newly proposed hybrid ai model i e mvmd rr kelm against the kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr brt mvmd rr xgboost models for three and seven days ahead eto forecasting in semi arid and sub humid climatic zones the goodness of fit metrics and visual inspection were employed to check the proposed ai models forecasting accuracy standalone hybrid appraisal of results based on goodness of fit indicators reveals that the kelm model integrated with the mvmd rr algorithm mvmd rr kelm outperformed the kelm brt xgboost mvmd rr brt mvmd rr xgboost models for both horizons eto forecasting at study locations additionally better outcomes of the mvmd rr kelm model were found for t 3 horizon eto forecasting and a slight reduction in accuracy of ai models was noted for t 7 horizon eto forecasting in both climates furthermore the prediction accuracy of the mvmd rr kelm model improved remarkably comprehensively the findings of this study are immensely significant to develop a smart intelligence system for precisely forecasting daily eto and accordingly scheduling irrigation plans for the protection of available water resources in the study regions this study is limited with the three stations of two states i e punjab and haryana of india the obtained results cannot generalize the capability and accuracy of employed machine learning models for other climatic conditions zones in the world so it is recommended that the aerial extension i e india versus other countries with different environmental conditions need to be analyzed and confirms the feasibility of the applied machine learning models therefore future research will include more stations from different locations across the globe to overcome this difficulty and make generalized conclusions about the efficacy of the machine learning models in addition the geospatial technique will be considered for projecting the impact of reference evapotranspiration on a spatial scale furthermore the different percentage of training and testing datasets will be considered to strengthen the predictability of applied ml models against the other ml i e simple hybrid models for future studies funding there is no funding ethics

stable of the different oxidation states rahman and singh 2019 cd vi which has a long half life in the soil but is especially hazardous for biota is the most persistent chromium in the form of cr vi is more toxic to animals and humans than cr iii because it is more soluble mobile and poisonous lacalle et al 2020 wang et al 2021 xia et al 2019 because cr is a nonessential element for plants there is no uptake mechanism instead cr is taken up along with other critical components such as sulphate via sulphate transporters ao et al 2021 muszyńska and labudda 2019 inhibiting photosynthetic and respiration processes cr also inhibits the intake of water and minerals essential for plant growth mathur et al 2016 mishra and bharagava 2016 reactive oxygen species ros generated by cr toxicity

the adverse effects of wastewater if it is used correctly even though it can be harmful to plants khan et al 2022 as a response cr contamination levels in water and toxin transmission from water to

compared to the present findings the present investigation has higher findings of cr content in water 0 04 mg l as reported by alghobar and suresha 2016 in wastewater alghobar et al 2014 reported a higher concentration of cr 0 032 mg l in the groundwater samples than tube well water samples in the present study sandeep et al 2019 reported a much higher concentration of metals in t 2 and t 1 6 07 and 13 76 mg l respectively than in the present investigation the cr concentration in all the water samples was below the permissible value 0 1 mg l as recommended by wwf 2007 chromium is generated in large quantities by sectors such as leather electroplating tanning and textiles which were the primary sources of high cr concentrations in wastewater laxmi and kaushik 2020 leaching from rocks and topsoil on the other hand is a natural source of cr entering the groundwater reservoir agyeman et al 2021 various industries produced large amounts of cr which slowly leached down through the soil and into groundwater and the use of wastewater and industrial effluent for irrigation purposes might be a probable cause of increased cr concentrations in the water sources under consideration 4 2 chromium in agricultural soil in the present study cr concentrations in t 1 t 2 and t 3 treated soils had lower values at all sites than the reported cr concentration 25 9 mg kg by aydin et al 2015 the cr concentration in the wastewater site at bangalore india had a much higher value 54 mg kg as reported by ha et al 2009 than the present findings at all water irrigated soil sites liang et al 2011 reported a much higher cr content in wastewater irrigated soils of shanxi province of china 24 29 mg kg than presently investigated wastewater sites a study was conducted in india on cr concentrations 19 21 and 9 07 mg kg in wastewater and canal water irrigated soils reported by singh et al 2010 had a higher cr value than the current investigation the increase in the concentration of the pollutants occurred because soil with high clay contents jammed its path which resulted in the accumulation of heavy metals in the soil maddela et al 2020 the recent investigation of the cr value in the soil was within safe limits the concentration of cr in the current investigation was lower than the dangerous level 65 mg kg as reported by who 2000 which can be explained as in the sargodha the agricultural sector is in the forefront which may account for the low soil chromium levels or the wastewater sources of the city effulents has lesser cr contents as previously reported by ugulu et al 2021 cr was generally comparatively lower in soil occurrence the soil chromium level varies with the natural composition of the components of rocks and sediments cr plays a key role in soil processes because it has high plant availability and low solubility shahid et al 2017 cr may rise to a toxic level in soil mainly because of anthropogenic activities such as atmospheric deposition chromium plating baths cr waste and liquid dumping due to products choppala et al 2013 the cr soil level in this investigation was below the harmful limit since the selected sites had no anthropogenic activities 4 3 chromium in food crops sewage water was used for irrigation of crops in developing countries that contain a higher concentration of toxic metals that contaminate soil and accumulate in food crops hussain et al 2019 cr absorption in food crops was found to be lower in t 1 soils than the permissible limits 2 3 mg kg at all sites fao who 2001 yu et al 2016 reported that the cr concentration in crops was found 0 69 mg kg to be lower than the mean value of chromium at wastewater treatment sites similar to and higher than that at canal water and tube well water treatment sites in the present investigation the cr concentration in the present study was lower than the standard value 2 3 mg kg recommended by fao who 2001 metal concentration determines the harmfulness of cr which comprises many processes such as translocation and accumulation but the proliferation of cr through any pathway is unclear sarwar et al 2020 higher accumulation of cr in plants affects the physiological processes of photosynthesis which effectively decreases the productivity of plants and finally the expiration of the plant due to reduction and change in the structure of chloroplasts dubey et al 2020 in the present study the cr level of soil and crops was within the permissible limit at all water treatment sites so the crops grown on all treatment sources at all sites were not contaminated with cr metal 4 4 the bcf pli and ef of chromium the pollution load index value 1 84 in leafy vegetables studied by ahmad et al 2014 was higher than the present findings the results of the present study were higher than the findings of khan et al 2016b who reported pli for cr 0 023 in wastewater irrigated crops when the pli is greater than one the soil is considered polluted harikumar et al 2009 however the soil in the current study was not poisoned to a harmful degree the bioconcentration factor of cr in this investigation was higher than the results 0 003 in wastewater soils reported by al jumaily et al 2021 willby et al 2001 found that cr mostly persists in the roots of plants and seldom moves above into the upper parts in the present study cr was present in higher amounts in the addible parts of crops irrigated with t 1 and t 2 than the standard value 0 02 of cr as suggested by fao who 2001 all wastewater and groundwater sites have non accumulator crops but canal water irrigated crops are hyperaccumulators bcf values of 0 01 for non accumulator plants 0 1 1 for the moderate accumulator and bcf values of 1 10 for proximate analysis netty et al 2013 in the current study the ef for cr was found to be lower at all sites and treatments taha et al 2013 than that reported by 18 8 according to birth 2003 the soil was moderate to severely enriched with metal all samples showed a significantly higher ef for cr in the current investigation compared with the range 0 35 0 44 given by ololade 2014 in two different places 63 85 and 54 85 mg kg for cr khan et al 2016a calculated higher ef values than this investigation the enrichment factor was used to understand the influence of natural and anthropogenic sources on heavy metal accumulation in soils the enrichment factor was used to examine the impact of natural and human factors on soil heavy metal development ef has also been used to assess contamination and pollution levels hashmi et al 2013 4 5 the dim hri and thq of chromium ahmad et al 2016 and bhatti et al 2015 reported the daily intake in the range of the current work of cr 0 0003 0 004 mg kg day in sewage water and groundwater grown crops respectively the daily cr intake in this study was substantially lower 105 mg kg day than the usepa 2010 permitted levels singh et al 2010 reported a much lower value of health risk for chromium metal 0 0002 compared to the present findings neeratanaphan et al 2017 reported a nearer value of the hri value 0 30 for cr in crops irrigated in wastewater the current results showed an hri below 1 which indicates no life risk of cr metal on the consumption of these wastewater crops verma et al 2022 singh et al 2010 reported thq in different food crops irrigated with wastewater in the area of varanasi in india and his results were similar to those of the present investigation the thq value of the present study was below 1 which indicates that there was no carcinogenic risk due to the consumption of these crops irrigated with t 1 t 2 and t 3 wang et al 2005 in wastewater produced irrigated crops balkhair and ashraf 2016 reported a higher concentration of thq value 2 279 than the current study thq was reported by sanaei et al 2021 and was lower than the current results 0 11 in comparison to the current findings wang et al 2015 found a lower thq value for cr a thq value less than 1 indicates that the amount of exposure was lower than the reference dose which estimates that a daily exposure at this level would not produce any adverse effects in the human population during their lifetime dumitriu et al 2021 5 conclusion the present research evaluated the acceptability of wastewater canal water and groundwater for irrigation purposes the use of untreated wastewater for irrigation of food crops leads to the buildup of chromium cr in the soil and the transfer of cr to the edible components of these food crops soil enrichment by cr to plant bioaccumulation occurred despite low amounts of cr in wastewater water treatment sources had an evident influence on the gradual accumulation of cr in the soil values for the bioconcentration and enrichment factors reveal that soil at wastewater treatment sites is enriched with cr which provides a gradual hazard to wastewater treated crops consumers therefore it is proposed that the application of wastewater alone is not fully suitable for food crop irrigation due to the higher concentration of potentially toxic elements ethical approval the authors declare that the manuscript has not been published previously

3 had the lowest hri and b vulgaris at s 1 which was irrigated with t 1 had the highest hri table s the average value of hri was highest 0 25 at s 1 treated with t 1 fig 8 the target hazard quotient for cr is between 0 06 and 0 94 thq was lowest in m spicata when irrigated with t 3 and highest in b vulgaris when watered with t 1 table s 5 the mean value of the target hazard quotient was found to be highest 0 561 at s 1 treated with t 1 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 chromium in irrigated water ugulu et al 2021 reported lower cr concentrations in ground water 0 01 but similar to wastewater 0 03 when compared to the present findings the present investigation has higher findings of cr content in water 0 04 mg l as reported by alghobar and suresha 2016 in wastewater alghobar et al 2014 reported a higher concentration of cr 0 032 mg l in the groundwater samples than tube well water samples in the present study sandeep et al 2019 reported a much higher concentration of metals in t 2 and t 1 6 07 and 13 76 mg l respectively than in the present investigation the cr concentration in all the water samples was below the permissible value 0 1 mg l as recommended by wwf 2007 chromium is generated in large quantities by sectors such as leather electroplating tanning and textiles which were the primary sources of high cr concentrations in wastewater laxmi and kaushik 2020 leaching from rocks and topsoil on the other hand is a natural source of cr entering the groundwater reservoir agyeman et al 2021 various industries produced large amounts of cr which slowly leached down through the soil and into groundwater and the use of wastewater and industrial effluent for irrigation purposes might be a probable cause of increased cr concentrations in the water sources under consideration 4 2 chromium in agricultural soil in the present study cr concentrations in t 1 t 2 and t 3 treated soils had lower values at all sites than the reported cr concentration 25 9 mg kg by aydin et al 2015 the cr concentration in the wastewater site at bangalore india had a much higher value 54 mg kg as reported by ha et al 2009 than the present findings at all water irrigated soil sites liang et al 2011 reported a much higher cr content in wastewater irrigated soils of shanxi province of china 24 29 mg kg than presently investigated wastewater sites a study was conducted in india on cr concentrations 19 21 and 9 07 mg kg in wastewater and canal water irrigated soils reported by singh et al 2010 had a higher cr value than the current investigation the increase in the concentration of the pollutants occurred because soil with high clay contents jammed its path which resulted in the accumulation of heavy metals in the soil maddela et al 2020 the recent investigation of the cr value in the soil was within safe limits the concentration of cr in the current investigation was lower than the dangerous level 65 mg kg as reported by who 2000 which can be explained as in the sargodha the agricultural sector is in the forefront which may account for the low soil chromium levels or the wastewater sources of the city effulents has lesser cr contents as previously reported by ugulu et al 2021 cr was generally comparatively lower in soil occurrence the soil chromium level varies with the natural composition of the components of rocks and sediments cr plays a key role in soil processes because it has high plant availability and low solubility shahid et al 2017 cr may rise to a toxic level in soil mainly because of anthropogenic activities such as atmospheric deposition chromium plating baths cr waste and liquid dumping due to products choppala et al 2013 the cr soil level in this investigation was below the harmful limit since the selected sites had no anthropogenic activities 4 3 chromium in food crops sewage water was used for irrigation of crops in developing countries that contain a higher concentration of toxic metals that contaminate soil and accumulate in food crops hussain et al 2019 cr absorption in food crops was found to be lower in t 1 soils than the permissible limits 2 3 mg kg at all sites fao who 2001 yu et al 2016 reported that the cr concentration in crops was found 0 69 mg kg to be lower than the mean value of chromium at wastewater treatment sites similar to and higher than that at canal water and tube well water treatment sites in the present investigation the cr concentration in the present study was lower than the standard value 2 3 mg kg recommended by fao who 2001 metal concentration determines the harmfulness of cr which comprises many processes such as translocation and accumulation but the proliferation of cr through any pathway is unclear sarwar et al 2020 higher accumulation of cr in plants affects the physiological processes of photosynthesis which effectively decreases the productivity of plants and finally the expiration of the plant due to reduction and change in the structure of chloroplasts dubey et al 2020 in the present study the cr level of soil and crops was within the permissible limit at all water treatment sites so the crops grown on all treatment sources at all sites were not contaminated with cr metal 4 4 the bcf pli and ef of chromium the pollution load index value 1 84 in leafy vegetables studied by ahmad et al 2014 was higher than the present findings the results of the present study were higher than the findings of khan et al 2016b who reported pli for cr 0 023 in wastewater irrigated crops when the pli is greater than one the soil is considered polluted harikumar et al 2009 however the soil in the current study was not poisoned to a harmful degree the bioconcentration factor of cr in this investigation was higher than the results 0 003 in wastewater soils reported by al jumaily et al 2021 willby et al 2001 found that cr mostly persists in the roots of plants and seldom moves above into the upper parts in the present study cr was present in higher amounts in the addible parts of crops irrigated with t 1 and t 2 than the standard value 0 02 of cr as suggested by fao who 2001 all wastewater and groundwater sites have non accumulator crops but canal water irrigated crops are hyperaccumulators bcf values of 0 01 for non accumulator plants 0 1 1 for the moderate accumulator and bcf values of 1 10 for proximate analysis netty et al 2013 in the current study the ef for cr was found to be lower at all sites and treatments taha et al 2013 than that reported by 18 8 according to birth 2003 the soil was moderate to severely enriched with metal all samples showed a significantly higher ef for cr in the current investigation compared with the range 0 35 0 44 given by ololade 2014 in two different places 63 85 and 54 85 mg kg for cr khan et al 2016a calculated higher ef values than this investigation the enrichment factor was used to understand the influence of natural and anthropogenic sources on heavy metal accumulation in soils the enrichment factor was used to examine the impact of natural and human factors on soil heavy metal development ef has also been used to assess contamination and pollution levels hashmi et al 2013 4 5 the dim hri and thq of chromium ahmad et al 2016 and bhatti et al 2015 reported the daily intake in the range of the current work of cr 0 0003 0 004 mg kg day in sewage water and groundwater grown crops respectively the daily cr intake in this study was substantially lower 105 mg kg day than the usepa 2010 permitted levels singh et al 2010 reported a much lower value of health risk for chromium metal 0 0002 compared to the present findings neeratanaphan et al 2017 reported a nearer value of the hri value 0 30 for cr in crops irrigated in wastewater the current results showed an hri below 1 which indicates no life risk of cr metal on the consumption of these wastewater crops verma et al 2022 singh et al 2010 reported thq in different food crops irrigated with wastewater in the area of varanasi in india and his results were similar to those of the present investigation the thq value of the present study was below 1 which indicates that there was no carcinogenic risk due to the consumption of these crops irrigated with t 1 t 2 and t 3 wang et al 2005 in wastewater produced irrigated crops balkhair and ashraf 2016 reported a higher concentration of thq value 2 279 than the current study thq was reported by sanaei et al 2021 and was lower than the current results 0 11 in comparison to the current findings wang et al 2015 found a lower thq value for cr a thq value less than 1 indicates that the amount of exposure was lower than the reference dose which estimates that a daily exposure at this level would not produce any adverse effects in the human population during their lifetime dumitriu et al 2021 5 conclusion the present research evaluated the acceptability of wastewater canal water and groundwater for irrigation purposes the use of untreated wastewater for irrigation of food crops leads to the buildup of chromium cr in the soil and the transfer of cr to the edible components of these food crops soil enrichment by cr to plant bioaccumulation occurred despite low amounts of cr in wastewater water treatment sources had an evident influence on the gradual accumulation of cr in the soil values for the bioconcentration and enrichment factors reveal that soil at wastewater treatment sites is enriched with cr which provides a gradual hazard to wastewater treated crops consumers therefore it is proposed that the application of wastewater alone is not fully suitable for food crop irrigation due to the higher concentration of potentially toxic elements ethical approval the authors declare that the manuscript has not been published previously

9334,gaseous reactive nitrogen gnr losses n2o no emissions and nh3 volatilization etc in greenhouse vegetable fields gvf have received considerable critical attention much uncertainty still exists about gnr losses reduction under increasing vegetables demand and environmental policies in china an experiment spanning four greenhouse vegetable growing seasons cucumber and tomato was conducted in north china plain ncp it included four treatments i e flood irrigation with no urea n application fu0 flood irrigation with conventional urea n application fun drip fertigation with conventional urea n application dun and drip fertigation with 50 reduction of urea n application drun obvious emission peaks of n2o no and nh3 flux were captured in the gvf after each fertilization and irrigation event for fun treatment the mean annual area scaled emissions of n2o no and nh3 were 11 48 1 66 and 44 90 kg n ha 1 yr 1 respectively and the mean annual yield scaled emissions of n2o no and nh3 were 181 86 23 04 and 800 07 g n t 1 yr 1 respectively on the mean annual area scaled and yield scaled the n2o emissions were significantly p 0 05 lower by 40 1 and 32 3 and the no emissions were lower by 23 5 and 28 5 but the nh3 volatilization were significantly p 0 05 higher by 31 7 and 49 0 respectively for the dun treatment than fun also compared with fun in drun treatment the mean annual area scaled n2o emissions no emissions and nh3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 46 7 52 4 and 22 0 respectively and the mean annual yield scaled n2o emissions no emissions and nh3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 40 7 57 1 and 24 5 respectively moreover compared with fun treatment dun and drun treatment both alleviated the global temperature potential gtp at 20 and 100 year timescales overall compared with conventional water and fertilizer regimes only changing irrigation mode reduced n2o and no emissions but increased nh3 volatilization losses in greenhouse cucumber tomato cultivation system reducing n application while changing irrigation methods had significant emission reduction effects on n2o no and nh3 at both the area scaled and yield scaled and which is an effective water and fertilizer managements for greenhouse cucumber tomato cultivation system graphical abstract ga1 keywords n oxide emissions nh3 volatilization greenhouse cucumber tomato field drip

formation of atmospheric nitric acid hno3 which affects the acidification and eutrophication processes in terrestrial ecosystems ipcc 2021 nh3 has great impacts on the atmosphere and ecosystem besides the above feedback which can also enhance the formation of atmospheric pm2 5 guo et al 2010 liu et al 2017a manoel degaspari et al 2020 xu et al 2019 from 1970 2012 the total global gaseous reactive nitrogen gnr emissions to the atmosphere from agricultural land rose from 14 to 35 tg n yr 1 accounting for about 31 of the global xu et al 2020 greenhouse vegetable field gvf is different from general grain production systems due to the excessive n application frequent irrigation and high multiple cropping index liu et al 2013 lv et al 2020 min et al 2012b the average n application rates in china range from 550 to 2000 kg n ha 1 yr 1 miao et al 2011 qasim et al 2021 which is much higher than global average 220 kg n ha 1 in each cultivation season rezaei rashti et al 2015 additionally gvf experienced high water consumption due to flooding irrigation in china approximately 1000 mm yr 1 li et al 2018a sun et al 2013 it is also associated with these above that gvf have become a research hotspot of gnr emissions qasim et al 2021 for example n2o emissions observed in gvf 31 1 60 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 are about an order of magnitude higher than that from cereal crops 1 9 5 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 fertilized with 420 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in nearby regions yan et al 2015 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a a meta analysis showed mean no emissions in all soils were about 4 06 kg ha 1 yr 1 the largest in vegetable fields 9 75 kg ha 1 yr 1 liu et al 2017b wang et al 2021 also reported that the vegetable cropping system is the largest nh3 volatilization source accounting one quarter of total crop field nh3 emissions in china at present china has the largest vegetable planting area and total production in the world fao 2022 and with the improvement of people s living standards how to balance the growing demand for vegetables and gnr loss caused by greenhouse vegetable cultivation will become more and more challenging cucumber cucumis sativus l and tomato apium graveolens l occupied a vital position in vegetable supply as widely cultivated vegetables worldwide fao 2022 during the 13th five year plan period in china cucumber production ranked first globally fao 2022 tomato as the highest value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide makes a substantial nutritional contribution to the human diet zhu et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to provide appropriate and effective mitigation strategies for gnr emissions from gvf especially from cucumber tomato cultivations fertilizer and water are important factors driving gnr emissions in irrigated agroecosystems jiang et al 2017 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 revealed that reducing n fertilizer application significantly reduced n2o emissions from a multi year study of gvf tomato leafy vegetable rotation yao et al 2019 showed that the annual average n2o no emissions could be significantly reduced by 48 by a 1 3 reduction of n fertilizer for a greenhouse cucumber cultivation a nonlinear relationship between nh3 emission and n input rates was also observed by jiang et al 2017 moreover optimizing n rate reduced all the n loss pathways targeted while producing more yield were illustrated by a meta analysis xia et al 2017 therefore reducing the n input rate is still a reasonable strategy to moderate gnr emissions gu et al 2020 xia et al 2020 irrigation as a necessary management step to adjust water supply and demand in agriculture is of great importance for ensuring crop growth anonna et al 2022 moreover differences in irrigation regimes e g flood irrigation or drip irrigation varied in the amount of water applied generally drip irrigation is water saving irrigation irrigation frequency drip irrigation is more frequent than flood furrow irrigation in some areas which could differ moisture distribution of soil profile and soil microbial process and then result in divergent magnitude of soil gnr fluxes abalos et al 2014 guardia et al 2017a 2017b yao et al 2019 ye et al 2018 showed that drip irrigation significantly reduced the n2o emission in the greenhouse tomato field compared to furrow irrigation yao et al 2019 also demonstrated that higher n2o emissions in flood irrigation than drip irrigation 50 reduction in water volume of greenhouse cucumber fields by the higher moisture conditions favored denitrification at present drip irrigation fertigation has contrasting effects on soil no emission with some studies suggesting that drip irrigation fertigation can reduce sanchez martin et al 2008 zhang et al 2021b or promote tian et al 2017 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a or have no significant impact sanchez martin et al 2010 on no emissions ammonia volatilization the process of ammonia gas escaping from soil surface dry land or field water surface paddy field to atmosphere during the conversion of n in soil occurs when the partial pressure of ammonia on the surface of soil or field water is greater than that of atmospheric concentration of ammonia song et al 2021 irrigation could influence the movement of n and water in the soil layer which affects the ammonia volatilization process however the limited literature on nh3 volatilization related to irrigation also mainly focuses on the timing dong et al 2021 frequency vogeler et al 2019 amount wan et al 2021 of irrigation and the effect of irrigation regimes on nh3 volatilization remains unclear the only few studies that have been conducted have come to conflicting conclusions e g a 20 5 28 0 higher of nh3 volatilization under drip fertigation than flood treatment was found from wheat maize cropping system in northern china zhang et al 2019a while a meta analysis showed that drip fertigation could reduce nh3 volatilization by 14 8 sha et al 2021 moreover most of the current studies on gnr in gvf only focus on one or two gas emissions and there is a paucity of information on multiple gnr losses which may not accurately assess the risk of nitrogen losses due to changes in management practices and may even lead to decisions that are contrary to expectations therefore it still deserves special attention on how different fertilizer and irrigation regimes simultaneously affect multiple gnr emissions from the gvf by the change of the soil microclimate and water and n transport patterns to address these concerns we conducted a two consecutive years experiment that quantify the impacts of irrigation and nitrogen management on gnr n2o no and nh3 emissions from typical greenhouse cucumber tomato field in ncp our objectives were to 1 quantify seasonal annual gnr emissions from typical gvf and 2 assess the potential for mitigating gnr emissions by introducing drip fertigation instead of flood irrigation or merging chemical n reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and treatments the experiment was conducted from september 2017 to july 2019 for greenhouse vegetables at the test base of dasungezhuang town shunyi district beijing 116 28 e 40 00 n the study site experiences a typical monsoon sub humid climate with a mean annual air temperature of 11 5 and a mean annual precipitation of 625 mm the poly tunnel greenhouse 75 m 7 m is a typical non heated and non lighted greenhouse constructed of clay walls and covered with transparent plastic film the soil texture of the site is silt loam the basic soil properties in the top 0 20 cm soil layer were indicated as follows ph 7 19 soil organic matter 29 36 g kg 1 total nitrogen content 1 50 g kg 1 and bulk density 1 31 g cm 3 the experiment included four vegetable growing seasons for the cucumber cucumis sativus l helan m6 tomato solanum lycopersicum zhongyan tv1 rotation and the different vegetable growing seasons are recorded as s1 s4 in chronological order seeds of cucumber and tomato were planted in small plots then transplanted into the fields the planting density of cucumber and tomato were approximately 30 000 plants ha 1 and 31 250 plants ha 1 respectively four treatments with three replicates were arranged in a randomized block design the following treatments were realized for details see table 1 a flood irrigation with no urea n application fu0 b flood irrigation with conventional urea n application fun c drip fertigation with conventional urea n application dun and d drip fertigation with 50 reduction of urea n application drun according to the local conventional practice the n application rate was 700 kg n ha 1 crop 1 as urea plus 500 kg n ha 1 crop 1 as sheep dung for cucumber and 750 kg n ha 1 crop 1 as urea plus 800 kg n ha 1 crop 1 as sheep dung for tomato for dun the n fertilization rate was the same as that of fun treatment but the amount of irrigation water supplied by drip irrigation was only ca 70 of that of fun in topdressing periods for drun treatment the chemical n input was reduced 50 while irrigation water was supplied by drip irrigation was the same compared to those of the dun treatment during the experimental period urea 46 4 n and potassium sulfate at 52 k2o 200 kg k2o ha 1 season 1 for cucumber and 300 kg k2o ha 1 season 1 for tomato were added in both basal fertilizer application and topdressing and sheep dung and superphosphate at 14 p2o5 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 season 1 for cucumber and 200 kg p2o5 ha 1 season 1 for tomato were added in each basal fertilizer application for all the plots table 1 the base fertilizer was plowed into the soil after spreading and flood irrigation was used to slow the seedlings in each treatment after the crops were planted urea was dissolved into the water which was kept in a plastic barrel before each topdressing irrigation event then the water with dissolved urea was rushed into the furrow by the flood or drip irrigation drip irrigation was applied with adopted low pressure drip tapes and filters based on drip fertigation equipment netafim israel while flood irrigation was applied without any further equipment two drip tapes were laid in each furrow the drip tape had emitters spaced 30 cm apart other field management practices were conducted in agreement with the local farmers practices in this study the fertilization plan was adjusted after the cucumber season s3 so no organic fertilizer was applied before the tomato season s4 experiment the detailed fertilization and irrigation management parameters throughout the experiment period are shown in table 1 2 2 measurements of n2o and no fluxes fluxes of n2o and no were measured using the static vented chamber based technique as described in detail by zhang et al 2018 and yao et al 2015 in brief the manual chambers consisted of stainless steel base collars that were covered with chambers 0 5 0 5 0 8 m3 at the times of measurement in the respective plots the base collars were inserted into the soil to a depth of 10 cm and were kept in the soil during the entire measurement period the chamber covers were equipped with a circulating fan to ensure a uniform ghg concentration within the chamber headspace the chambers were wrapped with a layer of insulating material to minimize temperature changes during the sampling period generally the sampling time was fixed between 8 00 a m to 10 00 a m in each day by assuming that the data of that period can represent the mean n2o flux of the whole day when sampling the box was placed on the base and the connection was sealed with water when the power switch turned on the gas in the box was automatically pumped into the airbag gas samples were taken from the headspace of the chamber using 100 ml plastic syringes at 0 6 12 18 and 24 min after chamber closure and then they were stored in airbags produced by dalian plait company and the temperature in the box and the temperature of 5 cm of the soil can be read at the same time through the display on the box the n2o concentration was quantified within 24 h after the collection by using gas chromatography agilent 7890 a agilent technologies inc usa equipped with an electron capture detector zheng et al 2008 for the no flux determination two gas samples were taken from the same chamber headspace for n2o measurement at the beginning and end of the chamber enclosure period using the aluminum film airbags produced by dalian plait company within 1 h after sampling the no concentrations were analyzed by a model 42i chemiluminescence no no2 nox analyzer no samples were collected on september 26 2018 so in this study only the no emission characteristics of the s3 cucumber season topdressing period and complete s4 tomato season were captured and the n2o and no fluxes were measured daily until the fluxes returned to the level before these events after each irrigation or fertilization event and the sampling frequency for the rest of the time was once or twice a week the n2o and no fluxes were calculated from a linear or nonlinear fitting of changes in chamber headspace gas concentrations versus the closure time and adjusted for area and volume of the chamber and the fluxes for the days without measurements were estimated as the arithmetic mean fluxes of the two closest days when observations were carried out cumulative n2o and no emissions across a given period e g growing season or annual scale were calculated by linear interpolations of mean fluxes between sampling dates 2 3 measurements of nh3 volatilization nh3 volatilization samples were collected by the venting method the whole collection device includes an air exchange chamber a ventilation rod a vacuum pump a montessori gas bottle and an ammonia absorption liquid the air exchange chamber was a cylinder made of plexiglass with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 15 cm the bottom of the cylinder was opened and the top had an air inlet and an air outlet respectively the air inlet was connected to a 2 5 m high hollow plastic breather rod through a threaded tube and the air outlet was connected to an ammonia absorption device the negative pressure was provided by the vacuum pump absorbed the ammonia generated in the exchange chamber to the montessori gas scrubber 40 ml of 0 05 mol l 1 h2so4 solution was filled in a monteggia gas bottle as an ammonia absorption solution the sampling frequency was the same as that of n2o gas sampling after pumping the absorption liquid was brought back to the laboratory and the nh4 n concentration is measured with a continuous flow analyzer skalar analytical b v netherlands the calculation formula of nh3 volatilization flux is wan et al 2021 1 q m v s t 10 2 24 q is nh3 volatilization flux kg ha 1 d 1 m is the concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the absorption solution mg l 1 v volume of absorption solution l s is the surface area of the soil covered by the enclosure m2 t is the sampling time h nh3 volatilization fluxes for the days without measurements were estimated as the arithmetic mean fluxes of the two closest days when observations were carried out then we obtained cumulative nh3 volatilization emissions for each vegetable growing season or rotation period by summing daily nh3 estimates 2 4 global temperature potential gtp estimation the global temperature potential gtp is a common metric to quantify and inter compare the relative impacts of climate forcers on different time scales shi et al 2015 the gtp assesses not only the long term climate effects caused by emissions of long lived species such as n2o but also the short term climate fluctuations caused by emissions of short lived species nox and nh3 ma et al 2021 shi et al 2015 to assess the relative contribution of gnr emissions to climate change under different fertilization and irrigation regimes in gvf we used gtp expressed as equivalent co2 co2 eq units for different forms of gnr at 20 and 100 year timescales gtp20 and gtp100 referring to ma et al 2021 four direct climate drivers cfs of gnr were considered in this study namely the warming potential of n2o cf1 the aerosol effect of nh3 cf2 the aerosol effect of no cf3 and the effect of no on o3 and ch4 cf4 the direct cooling effects of nitrate and ammonium light scattering aerosols attributed to nh3 and no are included in our gtp estimates cfs were calculated by the following eq 2 ma et al 2021 2 cf e n r gtp t n where e n r represents gnr emissions t represents the 20 yr or 100 yr timescales n represents one of the four cfs gtp t n represents the gtp expressed as kg co2 eq per kg n emissions for a given gnr species at a given time horizon the gtp range can be found in table 2 2 5 auxiliary measurements soil temperature of 5 cm depth was measured by jm624 jingming instrument co ltd tianjin china and the air temperature inside the greenhouse was recorded by thermometer when conducting the n2o measurements irrigation water volume was recorded by water meter beijing yidu meter set factory beijing 00000343 and soil moisture of 15 cm depth was measured by trime pico 64 imko germany soil moisture was expressed as soil water filled pore space wfps by using the eq 3 zhang et al 2018 3 wfps ɵ v 1 ρ b 2 65 100 where θν is the measured soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 and ρb is soil bulk density g cm 3 we also measured soil ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 concentrations by using a colorimetric continuous flow analyzer skalar analytical b v netherlands the soils 0 20 cm for measuring mineral n concentrations were taken following the events of fertilizer and or irrigation at each time of commercial maturity cucumber and tomato were picked by hand and weighed to determine the fruit yield total fruit yields were calculated as the cumulative fruit weights of all harvest days 2 6 data analysis focusing only on area scaled gnr emissions may lead to low yield management practices while yield scaled gnr emissions will achieve a win win situation for food security and environmental protection linquist et al 2012 to further relate the cumulative nr emissions to crop production as influenced by fertilization and irrigation yield scaled nr emissions were calculated by the following equation yao et al 2019 yield scaled nr emissions g n t 1 nr emissions fresh vegetable yield 4 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using the spss software package for windows version 21 0 spss beijing china all data were checked for normality and differences in cumulative emissions and total yields between treatments were evaluated using the analysis of variance anova the least significant difference duncan test was used for multiple comparisons between means 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions during the experimental period of 2017 2019 soil temperatures showed a similar trend to that of air temperature the air temperature inside the greenhouse ranged from 7 0 to 37 0 mean 24 3 fig 1a the soil temperature ranged from 10 7 to 30 7 mean 19 8 fig 1b the average wfps for fu0 fun dun and drun treatments was 51 0 52 6 49 5 and 46 9 respectively fig 1c the increases of wfps generally observed following irrigation across the entire experimental period the wfps of drip fertigation treatment was slightly lower than that of flood irrigation treatment especially the wfps of drun treatment was statistically significantly p 0 05 lower than that of fu0 and fun treatment as shown in fig 1d and e soil no3 n were significantly p 0 01 higher compared to soil nh4 n over the whole experimental period on average the lowest mineral n nh4 n no3 n contents was observed under fu0 treatment the soil no3 n under drun were significantly p 0 05 lower than that under dun 3 2 n2o fluxes the seasonal dynamics of n2o fluxes for all treatments were shown in fig 2a high n2o emission peaks occurring following fertilization or irrigation events the n2o emission peak during s1 s3 season lasted about 7 days after basal fertilizer and about 3 5 days in the topdressing period and the peak during s4 season lasted about 5 days both in basal and topdressing period temporal patterns of the n2o fluxes were comparable between flood and drip irrigation across the entire observation period n2o fluxes of fu0 treatment has been maintained at a low level ranging from 3 to 709 μg n m 2 h 1 across the experimental period the highest n2o emission peaks were 4525 3232 and 1830 μg n m 2 h 1 under the fun dun and drun treatments respectively compared with fun both dun and drun reduced the n2o emission peaks for example the peak n2o fluxes of dun and drun were reduced by 6 6 38 6 and 26 7 59 6 respectively compared with fun treatment over entire observation period annual area scaled n2o emissions from the chemical fertilized treatments were 6 12 11 48 kg n ha 1 yr 1 table 3 there is a significant difference in seasonal n2o emissions among different treatments n2o emissions under fun dun and drun treatments were significantly p 0 05 higher than those under drun treatment which indicated a positive impact of the urea application on n2o emissions compared with fun treatment seasonal area scaled n2o emissions of dun and drun treatment were significantly p 0 05 reduced by 19 1 45 3 and 30 2 67 5 respectively and the mean annual area scaled n2o emissions under the dun and drun treatment were significantly p 0 05 reduced by 40 1 and 46 7 respectively compared with those under the fun indicating that drip fertigation or combined with chemical n reduction could mitigate n2o emissions from gvf compared with dun the area scaled n2o emissions of drun treatment were only significantly reduced in the first rotation period similar to area scaled emissions the yield scaled n2o emissions were consistently lower for the alternative practices dun and drun than for fun table 4 compared with fcur treatment the mean annual yield scaled n2o emissions under dun and drun treatment were significantly p 0 05 reduced by 32 3 and 40 7 respectively 3 3 no fluxes similar to the trend of n2o flux during the entire observation period all treatments showed obvious emission peaks after fertilization and irrigation lasting 2 6 days fig 2b the order of mean no fluxes was fun dun drun fu0 which was statistically significant due to the missed no flux monitoring during the base fertilizer period there is no significant difference between fun and dun dun and drun in the s3 season table 3 in the s4 season the difference in the no emission of each treatment reached a significant level the annual no emissions in treatments with urea n applied was significantly p 0 05 higher than that with no urea n applied compared with fun treatment dun treatment and drun treatment reduced the mean annual area scaled no emissions by 23 5 and 52 4 respectively table 3 compared with dun treatment drun also reduced annual no emissions by 37 8 compared with fun and dun treatment the annual yield scaled no emissions of drun treatment were significantly p 0 05 reduced or reduced by 57 1 and 40 0 respectively table 4 3 4 nh3 volatilization the nh3 volatilization peaks of each treatment reached the maximum within 2 4 days after irrigation and fertilization fig 2c nh3 volatilization fluxes were observed with an obvious seasonal variation characteristics during the entire observation period the nh3 volatilization flux of the autumn winter cucumber season s1 s3 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the spring summer tomato season s2 s4 there was no significant difference in mean nh3 volatilization fluxes among fu0 fun and drun treatments but they were all significantly lower than the mean nh3 volatilization fluxes in dun treatment the application of urea n significantly p 0 05 increased the area scaled nh3 volatilization compared with the treatment without urea n table 3 during the two year rotation period the autumn winter cucumber seasons contributed 48 69 s1 and 67 75 s3 of the area scaled nh3 volatilization of each rotation period compared to fun treatment dun and drun treatment significantly p 0 05 increased and reduced mean annual area scaled nh3 volatilization by 31 7 and 22 0 respectively and drun also significantly p 0 05 reduced mean annual nh3 volatilization by 40 7 compared with dun treatment accordingly the order of yield scaled nh3 volatilization was dun fun drun fu0 table 4 compared with fun treatment dun treatment significantly p 0 05 increased the mean annual yield scaled nh3 volatilization by 49 0 and drun reduced that by 24 5 similarly drun also significantly p 0 05 reduced mean annual yield scaled nh3 volatilization by 49 3 compared to dun 4 discussion 4 1 controls of gnr fluxes from greenhouse vegetable cultivations in this study the n2o and no fluxes during the basal period were higher than those during the top dressing period the observed differences may be due to the application of manure and irrigation applying manure during the basal period has a stronger stimulating effect on n2o and no emissions than only applying urea by stimulating and or prolonging the denitrification process fang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 flood irrigation was applied to improve seedling recovering during the basal period resulting in temporary flooding therefore an anaerobic environment was formed due to high soil moisture content which hindered the gas diffusion and increased the potential and rate of soil denitrification jayarathne et al 2021 in addition seedlings of the basal period have relatively weak competition in terms of nutrients yao et al 2019 during the topdressing period the growing plants and microorganisms effectively competed for soil nutrients which reduced the contents of nitrification and denitrification matrix in the soil profile thus shortening the duration of the n oxide emission peak hosono et al 2006 yao et al 2019 in this study n2o and no emission peaks mainly occurred following fertilization and irrigation events which consistent with previous studies kennedy et al 2013 tian et al 2017 however n oxide peaks were not captured after only irrigation events ma 29 2019 fig 2 which was slightly different from what zhang et al 2019b found that n2o emission peaks occurred after fertilization or irrigation environmental factors such as soil temperature wfps and mineral n concentrations have been reported to have strong effects on n2o aliyu et al 2018 ramzan et al 2020 snyder et al 2009 zhao et al 2020 no emissions liu et al 2017b yao et al 2019 zhan et al 2021 and nh3 volatilization dong et al 2021 wan et al 2021 generally both n2o and nh3 fluxes correlated positively p 0 01 with soil temperatures and wfps for all irrigation and fertilization treatments during the entire observation period whereas the correlation between no fluxes and soil temperatures and or wfps or between gaseous n fluxes and soil inorganic n concentrations was insignificant p 0 05 table 5 the determination coefficients of linear regressions indicated that variations in soil temperature or wfps alone explained 7 23 and 4 18 of the variance in soil n2o and nh3 fluxes respectively table 5 to assess and illustrate whether the observed variations of soil n2o and nh3 fluxes in gvf could be described by combined effects of soil temperature and wfps a multiple nonlinear regression analysis was conducted as shown in table 6 and figs 3 and 4 approximately 2 5 45 and 26 63 p 0 001 of the variance in soil n2o and nh3 fluxes respectively for gvf could be interpreted by the combined effects zhan et al 2021 also found that the combined effect of soil temperature and wfps changes well described the seasonal changes of soil n2o and no fluxes from various urban turfgrasses nh3 volatilization is a physical process influenced by the concentration of nh4 n in the soil solution bosch serra et al 2014 previous studies have demonstrated that nh3 volatilization is also strongly related to the soil nh4 n concentration sha et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 however the correlation between gaseous nitrogen fluxes n2o no and nh3 and inorganic nitrogen no3 n nh4 n contents were not significant in this study one possible reason was that soil samples were taken only once after fertilization and irrigation in a single crop growing season and the lower soil sampling frequency cannot well reflect the relationship between soil inorganic nitrogen content and gnr fluxes 4 2 effects of fertilization and irrigation regimes on gnr emissions the mean n2o of the fu0 2 17 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was lower than that from global unfertilized greenhouse vegetable system 3 2 kg n2o n ha 1 yr 1 reported by a meta analysis qasim et al 2021 the observed n2o emissions of chemical n applied treatment in this study were in the range of 6 12 11 48 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which is comparable with the results of studies by min et al 2016 2012a 8 44 10 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 but much lower than those from the greenhouse cucumber production system 31 1 60 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 observed by yao et al 2019 all these studies reported n2o emissions from gvf much higher than those from cereal crop fields in the same region 2 47 4 02 kg n ha 1 yr 1 cui et al 2012 niu et al 2017 tian et al 2017 yao et al 2017b this study found that compared with flood irrigation drip fertigation significantly reduced area scaled and yield scaled n2o emissions of gvf which is consistent with the previous studies ding et al 2019 kallenbach et al 2010 kennedy et al 2013 the wetting speed after flood irrigation in surface soil 0 30 cm was faster than that of drip irrigation which makes the soil more prone to form an anaerobic environment due to immersion thus stimulating the activity of soil denitrifying bacteria han et al 2016 besides soaked soil become dry over time and rewetting generally stimulates microbial activity and increases net n mineralization resulting in more n2o emissions zhang et al 2016 compared to flood irrigation drip irrigation not only reduces wfps mean 52 6 vs 49 5 fig 1 and inhibits the production of n2o by denitrification kallenbach et al 2010 sanchez martin et al 2008 but also forms dry and wet zones in the soil and tends to higher moisture near the drip head where may have favored the reduction of n2o to n2 thus decreasing n2o losses aguilera et al 2013 guardia et al 2017a in addition nutrients were transported more directly to crop rhizosphere with water under drip fertigation which reduced evapotranspiration and improved the n and water use efficiency and also reducing the substrate concentration of soil microorganisms in the process of nitrification and denitrification thus reducing n2o emissions ding et al 2019 kennedy et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a in addition to the impact of irrigation methods discussed above the n fertilizer is also an important factor driving n2o emissions in irrigated agroecosystems liu et al 2017a shang et al 2020 yao et al 2019 in this study drun 50 urea n reduced quantitatively resulted in lower annual n2o emissions by 11 7 compared to dun due to the reduction of substrate concentration in the process of nitrification and denitrification previous studies have also shown a significant positive correlation between n fertilizer application and n2o emissions kim et al 2013 yao et al 2017a in our study annual no emissions were low ranging from 0 79 to 1 66 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for the chemical n fertilized treatments table 2 thus our observed no emissions were comparable to the reports on no emissions from greenhouse cucumber fields in shouguang county 0 87 2 74 kg n ha 1 yr 1 yao et al 2019 the combined area scaled and yield scaled no emissions can be seen to indicate that the drip fertigation treatment dun and the drip fertigation with urea n reduction treatment drun reduced or significantly reduced the mean annual no emissions compared to the flood irrigation treatment fun which is inconsistent with the results of yao et al 2019 who observed that drip irrigation significantly increased the no emissions from greenhouse cucumber fields compared to flood irrigation but agreed with the meta analysis that drip irrigation decreased both n2o and no emissions ranging from 21 1 to 8 0 relative to flood irrigation reported by yangjin et al 2021 the nh3 volatilization in this study was 44 9 kg n ha 1 yr 1 under conventional n application and irrigation which was roughly comparable to that obtained by li et al 2016 in a greenhouse cucumber tomato field 46 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 but lower than the results of zheng et al 2018 only in an open field of cucumber growth period 125 2 kg n ha 1 different irrigation regimes had significant effects on soil nh3 volatilization we found that dun significantly increased nh3 volatilization compared to fun which overturned the hypothesis we proposed with flood irrigation where the irrigation volume is high and the soil is wetted more quickly soil moisture will rapidly reach saturation and produce less nh3 cai et al 2002 since urea is relatively mobile in soils and it is not strongly adsorbed by soil colloids the deeper movement of applied urea washed via flood irrigational water would tend to minimize nh3 volatilization losses han et al 2014 ju et al 2007 wan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b also found that less nh3 volatilization losses in flood irrigation than that in drip fertigation from wheat maize cropping system in northern china and the activity of urease was improved and the hydrolysis of urea in drip fertigation occurred much more quickly than with other systems such as flood irrigation especially under straw incorporation condition reported by li et al 2018b additionally in this study the mean wfps 52 6 vs 49 5 fig 1 of flood irrigation treatment was slightly higher than that of drip fertigation treatment through the entire observation period which enhanced the rate of dissolved ammonia resulting in the decrease of ammonia concentration gradient and diffusion capacity at the soil air interface also the lower soil nh4 concentrations 18 1 vs 12 6 vs 8 8 mg kg 1 for dun fun and drun fig 1 observed in drun significantly resulted in lower mean annual area scaled and yield scaled nh3 volatilization as compared to fun and dun treatments which illustrated that reduced fertilizer n application directly reduced soil nh4 concentration then highly contributed to nh3 volatilization mitigation zhang et al 2021b the s1 and s3 cucumber seasons in this study contributed 4 8 70 and 67 75 of nh3 volatilization losses in the first and second rotation periods respectively in addition to the lack of manure applied in the s4 growing season it may also be due to slow air circulation and long nh3 retention time in the greenhouse where some of the nh3 escaping from the topsoil can be absorbed by the plant canopy walker et al 2013 wang et al 2016 since tomato plants are larger than cucumber plants they have a relatively greater capacity for nh3 uptake 4 3 link among n2o no emissions and nh3 volatilization this study found that there was a significant positive correlation between each two of the three gnr table 7 all of the gnr emissions reached their peak soon due to high substrate concentrations after each fertilization and irrigation event and then gradually all fluxes decreased due to inorganic n absorbed by the crop or leached below the root system in previous studies it has been suggested that the denitrification process promotes n2o emissions and consumes no under certain water and fertilizer management measures yao et al 2019 and it has also been suggested that the changes in n2o and no emissions are only related to changes in external conditions but not to the interaction between the two gases zhang et al 2016 and zhou et al 2007 shown that n2o emissions and no emissions in a rice wheat crop rotation system can either be mutually supportive or simultaneously strong under certain conditions nh3 can also influence n2o emissions by affecting microbial processes in soil ammonia oxidation and n2o production processes hink et al 2017 hink et al 2017 demonstrated that aob dominates ammonia oxidation and n2o production under conditions of high inorganic ammonia nh3 input but result mainly from the activity of aoa when nh3 is derived from mineralization additionally the greenhouse vegetable system in this study in a semi enclosed state for a long time with high internal humidity and nh3 is easy to be absorbed by water vapor after escaping from the soil surface especially due to the large temperature difference inside and outside the greenhouse after thermal insulation measures are taken at winter night the water vapor condenses inside the greenhouse film in the morning and some ammonia dissolves in the condensate inside the greenhouse film and falls back to the ground luo et al 2019 which increases the content of soil inorganic nitrogen and promotes n2o emission 4 4 climate change impacts of gnr emissions in general gnr emissions have long term warming effects from the production of n2o and o3 and short term cooling effects through changes in tropospheric aerosols ch4 and o3 galloway james et al 2008 increased n2o emissions to the atmosphere can directly contribute to global warming and ozone depletion while increased n oxide emissions can remove long lived forcers and nh3 volatilization can enhance aerosol formation erisman et al 2011 given the diversity of gnr constituents and their importance to climate related issues this study calculated the relative contribution of each gnr component to climate forcing cf under different fertilizer irrigation regimes including the climate warming and cooling effects of nr emissions hereafter referred to as cf1 cf4 fig 5 representing the warming potential of n2o cf1 the aerosol effects of nh3 cf2 the aerosol effects of no cf3 and the effects of no on o3 and ch4 cf4 compared with the fun treatment the dun treatment reduced gtp20 and gtp100 by 45 7 and 40 6 respectively the drun treatment also reduced them by 48 2 and 46 5 respectively fig 5 the strong gtp of the long lived greenhouse gas n2o dominated the overall contribution to climate change from gvf and since the climate cooling effects of cf2 cf4 were largely short lived and tended to be negligible at a long term time horizon the short lived nh3 and no can still offset 11 1 27 6 and 2 2 4 4 of the greenhouse effect produced by n2o on 20 year time scales and only 2 2 4 4 of that on 100 year time scales 4 5 study limitation and future perspectives in this study the measurements of gnr were performed by manual participation which was time consuming and labor intensive and it was difficult to achieve real time or daily monitoring during the whole growth period in addition as an ecosystem with anthropogenic disturbance vegetable crops include a variety of species with more intensive rotations due to the limitations of the experimental site and number of treatments this study only investigated the effect of different irrigation and fertilization on the loss of gnr in the typical fruit vegetable cucumber tomato planting pattern in the npc and its application on a larger scale regional or national scale needs to be validated through multi year monitoring of different cropping patterns in the future as disciplines intermingle and technology develops more advanced monitoring equipment and methods e g the eddy covariance method sensors continuous flow through chamber systems slant path ftir technique etc will be applied that can greatly improve the frequency of monitoring and the accuracy of estimation tallec et al 2019 kostyanovsky et al 2018 bai et al 2018 accordingly more knowledge based management alternatives are needed when we quantify n losses from irrigation and fertilization management in greenhouse vegetable cropping systems i e to explore the response of different n loss nox nh3 and leaching and n balance to drip irrigation and fertilization managements to evaluate the short or long term impacts on the environment under different ratios of organic and chemical fertilizers application zhang et al 2021a and to estimate the n footprint over the whole life cycle of vegetable production etc 5 conclusions based on the two year round field observations our study evaluated the gaseous nitrogen emissions n2o no and nh3 of the greenhouse cucumber tomato cultivation system in ncp the results showed that the n2o and nh3 fluxes were well described by the combined effects of changes in soil temperature and wfps only changing the irrigation method replacing flood irrigation with drip fertigation without changing the amount of n applied reduced n2o and no emissions while significantly p 0 05 increasing nh3 volatilization both in area scaled and yield scaled reduce chemical n by 50 while replacing flood irrigation with drip fertigation resulted in significant reductions in n2o no and nh3 emissions both in area scaled and yield scaled in view of the effects of multiple gnr emissions on the gtp at the short and long term timescales both drip irrigation or combined chemical n reduction can reduce the gtp on the 20 and 100 year timescales considering the effects of different fertilizer and irrigation regimes on n2o no emissions and nh3 volatilization in the greenhouse cucumber tomato cultivation system the optimized drip fertigation combined with 50 chemical n reduction could be used as an effective water and fertilizer management for the greenhouse cucumber tomato cultivation system due to

9334,gaseous reactive nitrogen gnr losses n2o no emissions and nh3 volatilization etc in greenhouse vegetable fields gvf have received considerable critical attention much uncertainty still exists about gnr losses reduction under increasing vegetables demand and environmental policies in china an experiment spanning four greenhouse vegetable growing seasons cucumber and tomato was conducted in north china plain ncp it included four treatments i e flood irrigation with no urea n application fu0 flood irrigation with conventional urea n application fun drip fertigation with conventional urea n application dun and drip fertigation with 50 reduction of urea n application drun obvious emission peaks of n2o no and nh3 flux were captured in the gvf after each fertilization and irrigation event for fun treatment the mean annual area scaled emissions of n2o no and nh3 were 11 48 1 66 and 44 90 kg n ha 1 yr 1 respectively and the mean annual yield scaled emissions of n2o no and nh3 were 181 86 23 04 and 800 07 g n t 1 yr 1 respectively on the mean annual area scaled and yield scaled the n2o emissions were significantly p 0 05 lower by 40 1 and 32 3 and the no emissions were lower by 23 5 and 28 5 but the nh3 volatilization were significantly p 0 05 higher by 31 7 and 49 0 respectively for the dun treatment than fun also compared with fun in drun treatment the mean annual area scaled n2o emissions no emissions and nh3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 46 7 52 4 and 22 0 respectively and the mean annual yield scaled n2o emissions no emissions and nh3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 40 7 57 1 and 24 5 respectively moreover compared with fun treatment dun and drun treatment both alleviated the global temperature potential gtp at 20 and 100 year timescales overall compared with conventional water and fertilizer regimes only changing irrigation mode reduced n2o and no emissions but increased nh3 volatilization losses in greenhouse cucumber tomato cultivation system reducing n application while changing irrigation methods had significant emission reduction effects on n2o no and nh3 at both the area scaled and yield scaled and which is an

nitrogen gnr emissions to the atmosphere from agricultural land rose from 14 to 35 tg n yr 1 accounting for about 31 of the global xu et al 2020 greenhouse vegetable field gvf is different from general grain production systems due to the excessive n application frequent irrigation and high multiple cropping index liu et al 2013 lv et al 2020 min et al 2012b the average n application rates in china range from 550 to 2000 kg n ha 1 yr 1 miao et al 2011 qasim et al 2021 which is much higher than global average 220 kg n ha 1 in each cultivation season rezaei rashti et al 2015 additionally gvf experienced high water consumption due to flooding irrigation in china approximately 1000 mm yr 1 li et al 2018a sun et al 2013 it is also associated with these above that gvf have become a research hotspot of gnr emissions qasim et al 2021 for example n2o emissions observed in gvf 31 1 60 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 are about an order of magnitude higher than that from cereal crops 1 9 5 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 fertilized with 420 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in nearby regions yan et al 2015 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a a meta analysis showed mean no emissions in all soils were about 4 06 kg ha 1 yr 1 the largest in vegetable fields 9 75 kg ha 1 yr 1 liu et al 2017b wang et al 2021 also reported that the vegetable cropping system is the largest nh3 volatilization source accounting one quarter of total crop field nh3 emissions in china at present china has the largest vegetable planting area and total production in the world fao 2022 and with the improvement of people s living standards how to balance the growing demand for vegetables and gnr loss caused by greenhouse vegetable cultivation will become more and more challenging cucumber cucumis sativus l and tomato apium graveolens l occupied a vital position in vegetable supply as widely cultivated vegetables worldwide fao 2022 during the 13th five year plan period in china cucumber production ranked first globally fao 2022 tomato as the highest value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide makes a substantial nutritional contribution to the human diet zhu et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to provide appropriate and effective mitigation strategies for gnr emissions from gvf especially from cucumber tomato cultivations fertilizer and water are important factors driving gnr emissions in irrigated agroecosystems jiang et al 2017 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 revealed that reducing n fertilizer application significantly reduced n2o emissions from a multi year study of gvf tomato leafy vegetable rotation yao et al 2019 showed that the annual average n2o no emissions could be significantly reduced by 48 by a 1 3 reduction of n fertilizer for a greenhouse cucumber cultivation a nonlinear relationship between nh3 emission and n input rates was also observed by jiang et al 2017 moreover optimizing n rate reduced all the n loss pathways targeted while producing more yield were illustrated by a meta analysis xia et al 2017 therefore reducing the n input rate is still a reasonable strategy to moderate gnr emissions gu et al 2020 xia et al 2020 irrigation as a necessary management step to adjust water supply and demand in agriculture is of great importance for ensuring crop growth anonna et al 2022 moreover differences in irrigation regimes e g flood irrigation or drip irrigation varied in the amount of water applied generally drip irrigation is water saving irrigation irrigation frequency drip irrigation is more frequent than flood furrow irrigation in some areas which could differ moisture distribution of soil profile and soil microbial process and then result in divergent magnitude of soil gnr fluxes abalos et al 2014 guardia et al 2017a 2017b yao et al 2019 ye et al 2018 showed that drip irrigation significantly reduced the n2o emission in the greenhouse tomato field compared to furrow irrigation yao et al 2019 also demonstrated that higher n2o emissions in flood irrigation than drip irrigation 50 reduction in water volume of greenhouse cucumber fields by the higher moisture conditions favored denitrification at present drip irrigation fertigation has contrasting effects on soil no emission with some studies suggesting that drip irrigation fertigation can reduce sanchez martin et al 2008 zhang et al 2021b or promote tian et al 2017 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a or have no significant impact sanchez martin et al 2010 on no emissions ammonia volatilization the process of ammonia gas escaping from soil surface dry land or field water surface paddy field to atmosphere during the conversion of n in soil occurs when the partial pressure of ammonia on the surface of soil or field water is greater than that of atmospheric concentration of ammonia song et al 2021 irrigation could influence the movement of n and water in the soil layer which affects the ammonia volatilization process however the limited literature on nh3 volatilization related to irrigation also mainly focuses on the timing dong et al 2021 frequency vogeler et al 2019 amount wan et al 2021 of irrigation and the effect of irrigation regimes on nh3 volatilization remains unclear the only few studies that have been conducted have come to conflicting conclusions e g a 20 5 28 0 higher of nh3 volatilization under drip fertigation than flood treatment was found from wheat maize cropping system in northern china zhang et al 2019a while a meta analysis showed that drip fertigation could reduce nh3 volatilization by 14 8 sha et al 2021 moreover most of the current studies on gnr in gvf only focus on one or two gas emissions and there is a paucity of information on multiple gnr losses which may not accurately assess the risk of nitrogen losses due to changes in management practices and may even lead to decisions that are contrary to expectations therefore it still deserves special attention on how different fertilizer and irrigation regimes simultaneously affect multiple gnr emissions from the gvf by the change of the soil microclimate and water and n transport patterns to address these concerns we conducted a two consecutive years experiment that quantify the impacts of irrigation and nitrogen management on gnr n2o no and nh3 emissions from typical greenhouse cucumber tomato field in ncp our objectives were to 1 quantify seasonal annual gnr emissions from typical gvf and 2 assess the potential for mitigating gnr emissions by introducing drip fertigation instead of flood irrigation or merging chemical n reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and treatments the experiment was conducted from september 2017 to july 2019 for greenhouse vegetables at the test base of dasungezhuang town shunyi district beijing 116 28 e 40 00 n the study site experiences a typical monsoon sub humid climate with a mean annual air temperature of 11 5 and a mean annual precipitation of 625 mm the poly tunnel greenhouse 75 m 7 m is a typical non heated and non lighted greenhouse constructed of clay walls and covered with transparent plastic film the soil texture of the site is silt loam the basic soil properties in the top 0 20 cm soil layer were indicated as follows ph 7 19 soil organic matter 29 36 g kg 1 total nitrogen content 1 50 g kg 1 and bulk density 1 31 g cm 3 the experiment included four vegetable growing seasons for the cucumber cucumis sativus l helan m6 tomato solanum lycopersicum zhongyan tv1 rotation and the different vegetable growing seasons are recorded as s1 s4 in chronological order seeds of cucumber and tomato were planted in small plots then transplanted into the fields the planting density of cucumber and tomato were approximately 30 000 plants ha 1 and 31 250 plants ha 1 respectively four treatments with three replicates were arranged in a randomized block design the following treatments were realized for details see table 1 a flood irrigation with no urea n application fu0 b flood irrigation with conventional urea n application fun c drip fertigation with conventional urea n application dun and d drip fertigation with 50 reduction of urea n application drun according to the local conventional practice the n application rate was 700 kg n ha 1 crop 1 as urea plus 500 kg n ha 1 crop 1 as sheep dung for cucumber and 750 kg n ha 1 crop 1 as urea plus 800 kg n ha 1 crop 1 as sheep dung for tomato for dun the n fertilization rate was the same as that of fun treatment but the amount of irrigation water supplied by drip irrigation was only ca 70 of that of fun in topdressing periods for drun treatment the chemical n input was reduced 50 while irrigation water was supplied by drip irrigation was the same compared to those of the dun treatment during the experimental period urea 46 4 n and potassium sulfate at 52 k2o 200 kg k2o ha 1 season 1 for cucumber and 300 kg k2o ha 1 season 1 for tomato were added in both basal fertilizer application and topdressing and sheep dung and superphosphate at 14 p2o5 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 season 1 for cucumber and 200 kg p2o5 ha 1 season 1 for tomato were added in each basal fertilizer application for all the plots table 1 the base fertilizer was plowed into the soil after spreading and flood irrigation was used to slow the seedlings in each treatment after the crops were planted urea was dissolved into the water which was kept in a plastic barrel before each topdressing irrigation event then the water with dissolved urea was rushed into the furrow by the flood or drip irrigation drip irrigation was applied with adopted low pressure drip tapes and filters based on drip fertigation equipment netafim israel while flood irrigation was applied without any further equipment two drip tapes were laid in each furrow the drip tape had emitters spaced 30 cm apart other field management practices were conducted in agreement with the local farmers practices in this study the fertilization plan was adjusted after the cucumber season s3 so no organic fertilizer was applied before the tomato season s4 experiment the detailed fertilization and irrigation management parameters throughout the experiment period are shown in table 1 2 2 measurements of n2o and no fluxes fluxes of n2o and no were measured using the static vented chamber based technique as described in detail by zhang et al 2018 and yao et al 2015 in brief the manual chambers consisted of stainless steel base collars that were covered with chambers 0 5 0 5 0 8 m3 at the times of measurement in the respective plots the base collars were inserted into the soil to a depth of 10 cm and were kept in the soil during the entire measurement period the chamber covers were equipped with a circulating fan to ensure a uniform ghg concentration within the chamber headspace the chambers were wrapped with a layer of insulating material to minimize temperature changes during the sampling period generally the sampling time was fixed between 8 00 a m to 10 00 a m in each day by assuming that the data of that period can represent the mean n2o flux of the whole day when sampling the box was placed on the base and the connection was sealed with water when the power switch turned on the gas in the box was automatically pumped into the airbag gas samples were taken from the headspace of the chamber using 100 ml plastic syringes at 0 6 12 18 and 24 min after chamber closure and then they were stored in airbags produced by dalian plait company and the temperature in the box and the temperature of 5 cm of the soil can be read at the same time through the display on the box the n2o concentration was quantified within 24 h after the collection by using gas chromatography agilent 7890 a agilent technologies inc usa equipped with an electron capture detector zheng et al 2008 for the no flux determination two gas samples were taken from the same chamber headspace for n2o measurement at the beginning and end of the chamber enclosure period using the aluminum film airbags produced by dalian plait company within 1 h after sampling the no concentrations were analyzed by a model 42i chemiluminescence no no2 nox analyzer no samples were collected on september 26 2018 so in this study only the no emission characteristics of the s3 cucumber season topdressing period and complete s4 tomato season were captured and the n2o and no fluxes were measured daily until the fluxes returned to the level before these events after each irrigation or fertilization event and the sampling frequency for the rest of the time was once or twice a week the n2o and no fluxes were calculated from a linear or nonlinear fitting of changes in chamber headspace gas concentrations versus the closure time and adjusted for area and volume of the chamber and the fluxes for the days without measurements were estimated as the arithmetic mean fluxes of the two closest days when observations were carried out cumulative n2o and no emissions across a given period e g growing season or annual scale were calculated by linear interpolations of mean fluxes between sampling dates 2 3 measurements of nh3 volatilization nh3 volatilization samples were collected by the venting method the whole collection device includes an air exchange chamber a ventilation rod a vacuum pump a montessori gas bottle and an ammonia absorption liquid the air exchange chamber was a cylinder made of plexiglass with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 15 cm the bottom of the cylinder was opened and the top had an air inlet and an air outlet respectively the air inlet was connected to a 2 5 m high hollow plastic breather rod through a threaded tube and the air outlet was connected to an ammonia absorption device the negative pressure was provided by the vacuum pump absorbed the ammonia generated in the exchange chamber to the montessori gas scrubber 40 ml of 0 05 mol l 1 h2so4 solution was filled in a monteggia gas bottle as an ammonia absorption solution the sampling frequency was the same as that of n2o gas sampling after pumping the absorption liquid was brought back to the laboratory and the nh4 n concentration is measured with a continuous flow analyzer skalar analytical b v netherlands the calculation formula of nh3 volatilization flux is wan et al 2021 1 q m v s t 10 2 24 q is nh3 volatilization flux kg ha 1 d 1 m is the concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the absorption solution mg l 1 v volume of absorption solution l s is the surface area of the soil covered by the enclosure m2 t is the sampling time h nh3 volatilization fluxes for the days without measurements were estimated as the arithmetic mean fluxes of the two closest days when observations were carried out then we obtained cumulative nh3 volatilization emissions for each vegetable growing season or rotation period by summing daily nh3 estimates 2 4 global temperature potential gtp estimation the global temperature potential gtp is a common metric to quantify and inter compare the relative impacts of climate forcers on different time scales shi et al 2015 the gtp assesses not only the long term climate effects caused by emissions of long lived species such as n2o but also the short term climate fluctuations caused by emissions of short lived species nox and nh3 ma et al 2021 shi et al 2015 to assess the relative contribution of gnr emissions to climate change under different fertilization and irrigation regimes in gvf we used gtp expressed as equivalent co2 co2 eq units for different forms of gnr at 20 and 100 year timescales gtp20 and gtp100 referring to ma et al 2021 four direct climate drivers cfs of gnr were considered in this study namely the warming potential of n2o cf1 the aerosol effect of nh3 cf2 the aerosol effect of no cf3 and the effect of no on o3 and ch4 cf4 the direct cooling effects of nitrate and ammonium light scattering aerosols attributed to nh3 and no are included in our gtp estimates cfs were calculated by the following eq 2 ma et al 2021 2 cf e n r gtp t n where e n r represents gnr emissions t represents the 20 yr or 100 yr timescales n represents one of the four cfs gtp t n represents the gtp expressed as kg co2 eq per kg n emissions for a given gnr species at a given time horizon the gtp range can be found in table 2 2 5 auxiliary measurements soil temperature of 5 cm depth was measured by jm624 jingming instrument co ltd tianjin china and the air temperature inside the greenhouse was recorded by thermometer when conducting the n2o measurements irrigation water volume was recorded by water meter beijing yidu meter set factory beijing 00000343 and soil moisture of 15 cm depth was measured by trime pico 64 imko germany soil moisture was expressed as soil water filled pore space wfps by using the eq 3 zhang et al 2018 3 wfps ɵ v 1 ρ b 2 65 100 where θν is the measured soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 and ρb is soil bulk density g cm 3 we also measured soil ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 concentrations by using a colorimetric continuous flow analyzer skalar analytical b v netherlands the soils 0 20 cm for measuring mineral n concentrations were taken following the events of fertilizer and or irrigation at each time of commercial maturity cucumber and tomato were picked by hand and weighed to determine the fruit yield total fruit yields were calculated as the cumulative fruit weights of all harvest days 2 6 data analysis focusing only on area scaled gnr emissions may lead to low yield management practices while yield scaled gnr emissions will achieve a win win situation for food security and environmental protection linquist et al 2012 to further relate the cumulative nr emissions to crop production as influenced by fertilization and irrigation yield scaled nr emissions were calculated by the following equation yao et al 2019 yield scaled nr emissions g n t 1 nr emissions fresh vegetable yield 4 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using the spss software package for windows version 21 0 spss beijing china all data were checked for normality and differences in cumulative emissions and total yields between treatments were evaluated using the analysis of variance anova the least significant difference duncan test was used for multiple comparisons between means 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions during the experimental period of 2017 2019 soil temperatures showed a similar trend to that of air temperature the air temperature inside the greenhouse ranged from 7 0 to 37 0 mean 24 3 fig 1a the soil temperature ranged from 10 7 to 30 7 mean 19 8 fig 1b the average wfps for fu0 fun dun and drun treatments was 51 0 52 6 49 5 and 46 9 respectively fig 1c the increases of wfps generally observed following irrigation across the entire experimental period the wfps of drip fertigation treatment was slightly lower than that of flood irrigation treatment especially the wfps of drun treatment was statistically significantly p 0 05 lower than that of fu0 and fun treatment as shown in fig 1d and e soil no3 n were significantly p 0 01 higher compared to soil nh4 n over the whole experimental period on average the lowest mineral n nh4 n no3 n contents was observed under fu0 treatment the soil no3 n under drun were significantly p 0 05 lower than that under dun 3 2 n2o fluxes the seasonal dynamics of n2o fluxes for all treatments were shown in fig 2a high n2o emission peaks occurring following fertilization or irrigation events the n2o emission peak during s1 s3 season lasted about 7 days after basal fertilizer and about 3 5 days in the topdressing period and the peak during s4 season lasted about 5 days both in basal and topdressing period temporal patterns of the n2o fluxes were comparable between flood and drip irrigation across the entire observation period n2o fluxes of fu0 treatment has been maintained at a low level ranging from 3 to 709 μg n m 2 h 1 across the experimental period the highest n2o emission peaks were 4525 3232 and 1830 μg n m 2 h 1 under the fun dun and drun treatments respectively compared with fun both dun and drun reduced the n2o emission peaks for example the peak n2o fluxes of dun and drun were reduced by 6 6 38 6 and 26 7 59 6 respectively compared with fun treatment over entire observation period annual area scaled n2o emissions from the chemical fertilized treatments were 6 12 11 48 kg n ha 1 yr 1 table 3 there is a significant difference in seasonal n2o emissions among different treatments n2o emissions under fun dun and drun treatments were significantly p 0 05 higher than those under drun treatment which indicated a positive impact of the urea application on n2o emissions compared with fun treatment seasonal area scaled n2o emissions of dun and drun treatment were significantly p 0 05 reduced by 19 1 45 3 and 30 2 67 5 respectively and the mean annual area scaled n2o emissions under the dun and drun treatment were significantly p 0 05 reduced by 40 1 and 46 7 respectively compared with those under the fun indicating that drip fertigation or combined with chemical n reduction could mitigate n2o emissions from gvf compared with dun the area scaled n2o emissions of drun treatment were only significantly reduced in the first rotation period similar to area scaled emissions the yield scaled n2o emissions were consistently lower for the alternative practices dun and drun than for fun table 4 compared with fcur treatment the mean annual yield scaled n2o emissions under dun and drun treatment were significantly p 0 05 reduced by 32 3 and 40 7 respectively 3 3 no fluxes similar to the trend of n2o flux during the entire observation period all treatments showed obvious emission peaks after fertilization and irrigation lasting 2 6 days fig 2b the order of mean no fluxes was fun dun drun fu0 which was statistically significant due to the missed no flux monitoring during the base fertilizer period there is no significant difference between fun and dun dun and drun in the s3 season table 3 in the s4 season the difference in the no emission of each treatment reached a significant level the annual no emissions in treatments with urea n applied was significantly p 0 05 higher than that with no urea n applied compared with fun treatment dun treatment and drun treatment reduced the mean annual area scaled no emissions by 23 5 and 52 4 respectively table 3 compared with dun treatment drun also reduced annual no emissions by 37 8 compared with fun and dun treatment the annual yield scaled no emissions of drun treatment were significantly p 0 05 reduced or reduced by 57 1 and 40 0 respectively table 4 3 4 nh3 volatilization the nh3 volatilization peaks of each treatment reached the maximum within 2 4 days after irrigation and fertilization fig 2c nh3 volatilization fluxes were observed with an obvious seasonal variation characteristics during the entire observation period the nh3 volatilization flux of the autumn winter cucumber season s1 s3 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the spring summer tomato season s2 s4 there was no significant difference in mean nh3 volatilization fluxes among fu0 fun and drun treatments but they were all significantly lower than the mean nh3 volatilization fluxes in dun treatment the application of urea n significantly p 0 05 increased the area scaled nh3 volatilization compared with the treatment without urea n table 3 during the two year rotation period the autumn winter cucumber seasons contributed 48 69 s1 and 67 75 s3 of the area scaled nh3 volatilization of each rotation period compared to fun treatment dun and drun treatment significantly p 0 05 increased and reduced mean annual area scaled nh3 volatilization by 31 7 and 22 0 respectively and drun also significantly p 0 05 reduced mean annual nh3 volatilization by 40 7 compared with dun treatment accordingly the order of yield scaled nh3 volatilization was dun fun drun fu0 table 4 compared with fun treatment dun treatment significantly p 0 05 increased the mean annual yield scaled nh3 volatilization by 49 0 and drun reduced that by 24 5 similarly drun also significantly p 0 05 reduced mean annual yield scaled nh3 volatilization by 49 3 compared to dun 4 discussion 4 1 controls of gnr fluxes from greenhouse vegetable cultivations in this study the n2o and no fluxes during the basal period were higher than those during the top dressing period the observed differences may be due to the application of manure and irrigation applying manure during the basal period has a stronger stimulating effect on n2o and no emissions than only applying urea by stimulating and or prolonging the denitrification process fang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 flood irrigation was applied to improve seedling recovering during the basal period resulting in temporary flooding therefore an anaerobic environment was formed due to high soil moisture content which hindered the gas diffusion and increased the potential and rate of soil denitrification jayarathne et al 2021 in addition seedlings of the basal period have relatively weak competition in terms of nutrients yao et al 2019 during the topdressing period the growing plants and microorganisms effectively competed for soil nutrients which reduced the contents of nitrification and denitrification matrix in the soil profile thus shortening the duration of the n oxide emission peak hosono et al 2006 yao et al 2019 in this study n2o and no emission peaks mainly occurred following fertilization and irrigation events which consistent with previous studies kennedy et al 2013 tian et al 2017 however n oxide peaks were not captured after only irrigation events ma 29 2019 fig 2 which was slightly different from what zhang et al 2019b found that n2o emission peaks occurred after fertilization or irrigation environmental factors such as soil temperature wfps and mineral n concentrations have been reported to have strong effects on n2o aliyu et al 2018 ramzan et al 2020 snyder et al 2009 zhao et al 2020 no emissions liu et al 2017b yao et al 2019 zhan et al 2021 and nh3 volatilization dong et al 2021 wan et al 2021 generally both n2o and nh3 fluxes correlated positively p 0 01 with soil temperatures and wfps for all irrigation and fertilization treatments during the entire observation period whereas the correlation between no fluxes and soil temperatures and or wfps or between gaseous n fluxes and soil inorganic n concentrations was insignificant p 0 05 table 5 the determination coefficients of linear regressions indicated that variations in soil temperature or wfps alone explained 7 23 and 4 18 of the variance in soil n2o and nh3 fluxes respectively table 5 to assess and illustrate whether the observed variations of soil n2o and nh3 fluxes in gvf could be described by combined effects of soil temperature and wfps a multiple nonlinear regression analysis was conducted as shown in table 6 and figs 3 and 4 approximately 2 5 45 and 26 63 p 0 001 of the variance in soil n2o and nh3 fluxes respectively for gvf could be interpreted by the combined effects zhan et al 2021 also found that the combined effect of soil temperature and wfps changes well described the seasonal changes of soil n2o and no fluxes from various urban turfgrasses nh3 volatilization is a physical process influenced by the concentration of nh4 n in the soil solution bosch serra et al 2014 previous studies have demonstrated that nh3 volatilization is also strongly related to the soil nh4 n concentration sha et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 however the correlation between gaseous nitrogen fluxes n2o no and nh3 and inorganic nitrogen no3 n nh4 n contents were not significant in this study one possible reason was that soil samples were taken only once after fertilization and irrigation in a single crop growing season and the lower soil sampling frequency cannot well reflect the relationship between soil inorganic nitrogen content and gnr fluxes 4 2 effects of fertilization and irrigation regimes on gnr emissions the mean n2o of the fu0 2 17 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was lower than that from global unfertilized greenhouse vegetable system 3 2 kg n2o n ha 1 yr 1 reported by a meta analysis qasim et al 2021 the observed n2o emissions of chemical n applied treatment in this study were in the range of 6 12 11 48 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which is comparable with the results of studies by min et al 2016 2012a 8 44 10 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 but much lower than those from the greenhouse cucumber production system 31 1 60 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 observed by yao et al 2019 all these studies reported n2o emissions from gvf much higher than those from cereal crop fields in the same region 2 47 4 02 kg n ha 1 yr 1 cui et al 2012 niu et al 2017 tian et al 2017 yao et al 2017b this study found that compared with flood irrigation drip fertigation significantly reduced area scaled and yield scaled n2o emissions of gvf which is consistent with the previous studies ding et al 2019 kallenbach et al 2010 kennedy et al 2013 the wetting speed after flood irrigation in surface soil 0 30 cm was faster than that of drip irrigation which makes the soil more prone to form an anaerobic environment due to immersion thus stimulating the activity of soil denitrifying bacteria han et al 2016 besides soaked soil become dry over time and rewetting generally stimulates microbial activity and increases net n mineralization resulting in more n2o emissions zhang et al 2016 compared to flood irrigation drip irrigation not only reduces wfps mean 52 6 vs 49 5 fig 1 and inhibits the production of n2o by denitrification kallenbach et al 2010 sanchez martin et al 2008 but also forms dry and wet zones in the soil and tends to higher moisture near the drip head where may have favored the reduction of n2o to n2 thus decreasing n2o losses aguilera et al 2013 guardia et al 2017a in addition nutrients were transported more directly to crop rhizosphere with water under drip fertigation which reduced evapotranspiration and improved the n and water use efficiency and also reducing the substrate concentration of soil microorganisms in the process of nitrification and denitrification thus reducing n2o emissions ding et al 2019 kennedy et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a in addition to the impact of irrigation methods discussed above the n fertilizer is also an important factor driving n2o emissions in irrigated agroecosystems liu et al 2017a shang et al 2020 yao et al 2019 in this study drun 50 urea n reduced quantitatively resulted in lower annual n2o emissions by 11 7 compared to dun due to the reduction of substrate concentration in the process of nitrification and denitrification previous studies have also shown a significant positive correlation between n fertilizer application and n2o emissions kim et al 2013 yao et al 2017a in our study annual no emissions were low ranging from 0 79 to 1 66 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for the chemical n fertilized treatments table 2 thus our observed no emissions were comparable to the reports on no emissions from greenhouse cucumber fields in shouguang county 0 87 2 74 kg n ha 1 yr 1 yao et al 2019 the combined area scaled and yield scaled no emissions can be seen to indicate that the drip fertigation treatment dun and the drip fertigation with urea n reduction treatment drun reduced or significantly reduced the mean annual no emissions compared to the flood irrigation treatment fun which is inconsistent with the results of yao et al 2019 who observed that drip irrigation significantly increased the no emissions from greenhouse cucumber fields compared to flood irrigation but agreed with the meta analysis that drip irrigation decreased both n2o and no emissions ranging from 21 1 to 8 0 relative to flood irrigation reported by yangjin et al 2021 the nh3 volatilization in this study was 44 9 kg n ha 1 yr 1 under conventional n application and irrigation which was roughly comparable to that obtained by li et al 2016 in a greenhouse cucumber tomato field 46 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 but lower than the results of zheng et al 2018 only in an open field of cucumber growth period 125 2 kg n ha 1 different irrigation regimes had significant effects on soil nh3 volatilization we found that dun significantly increased nh3 volatilization compared to fun which overturned the hypothesis we proposed with flood irrigation where the irrigation volume is high and the soil is wetted more quickly soil moisture will rapidly reach saturation and produce less nh3 cai et al 2002 since urea is relatively mobile in soils and it is not strongly adsorbed by soil colloids the deeper movement of applied urea washed via flood irrigational water would tend to minimize nh3 volatilization losses han et al 2014 ju et al 2007 wan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b also found that less nh3 volatilization losses in flood irrigation than that in drip fertigation from wheat maize cropping system in northern china and the activity of urease was improved and the hydrolysis of urea in drip fertigation occurred much more quickly than with other systems such as flood irrigation especially under straw incorporation condition reported by li et al 2018b additionally in this study the mean wfps 52 6 vs 49 5 fig 1 of flood irrigation treatment was slightly higher than that of drip fertigation treatment through the entire observation period which enhanced the rate of dissolved ammonia resulting in the decrease of ammonia concentration gradient and diffusion capacity at the soil air interface also the lower soil nh4 concentrations 18 1 vs 12 6 vs 8 8 mg kg 1 for dun fun and drun fig 1 observed in drun significantly resulted in lower mean annual area scaled and yield scaled nh3 volatilization as compared to fun and dun treatments which illustrated that reduced fertilizer n application directly reduced soil nh4 concentration then highly contributed to nh3 volatilization mitigation zhang et al 2021b the s1 and s3 cucumber seasons in this study contributed 4 8 70 and 67 75 of nh3 volatilization losses in the first and second rotation periods respectively in addition to the lack of manure applied in the s4 growing season it may also be due to slow air circulation and long nh3 retention time in the greenhouse where some of the nh3 escaping from the topsoil can be absorbed by the plant canopy walker et al 2013 wang et al 2016 since tomato plants are larger than cucumber plants they have a relatively greater capacity for nh3 uptake 4 3 link among n2o no emissions and nh3 volatilization this study found that there was a significant positive correlation between each two of the three gnr table 7 all of the gnr emissions reached their peak soon due to high substrate concentrations after each fertilization and irrigation event and then gradually all fluxes decreased due to inorganic n absorbed by the crop or leached below the root system in previous studies it has been suggested that the denitrification process promotes n2o emissions and consumes no under certain water and fertilizer management measures yao et al 2019 and it has also been suggested that the changes in n2o and no emissions are only related to changes in external conditions but not to the interaction between the two gases zhang et al 2016 and zhou et al 2007 shown that n2o emissions and no emissions in a rice wheat crop rotation system can either be mutually supportive or simultaneously strong under certain conditions nh3 can also influence n2o emissions by affecting microbial processes in soil ammonia oxidation and n2o production processes hink et al 2017 hink et al 2017 demonstrated that aob dominates ammonia oxidation and n2o production under conditions of high inorganic ammonia nh3 input but result mainly from the activity of aoa when nh3 is derived from mineralization additionally the greenhouse vegetable system in this study in a semi enclosed state for a long time with high internal humidity and nh3 is easy to be absorbed by water vapor after escaping from the soil surface especially due to the large temperature difference inside and outside the greenhouse after thermal insulation measures are taken at winter night the water vapor condenses inside the greenhouse film in the morning and some ammonia dissolves in the condensate inside the greenhouse film and falls back to the ground luo et al 2019 which increases the content of soil inorganic nitrogen and promotes n2o emission 4 4 climate change impacts of gnr emissions in general gnr emissions have long term warming effects from the production of n2o and o3 and short term cooling effects through changes in tropospheric aerosols ch4 and o3 galloway james et al 2008 increased n2o emissions to the atmosphere can directly contribute to global warming and ozone depletion while increased n oxide emissions can remove long lived forcers and nh3 volatilization can enhance aerosol formation erisman et al 2011 given the diversity of gnr constituents and their importance to climate related issues this study calculated the relative contribution of each gnr component to climate forcing cf under different fertilizer irrigation regimes including the climate warming and cooling effects of nr emissions hereafter referred to as cf1 cf4 fig 5 representing the warming potential of n2o cf1 the aerosol effects of nh3 cf2 the aerosol effects of no cf3 and the effects of no on o3 and ch4 cf4 compared with the fun treatment the dun treatment reduced gtp20 and gtp100 by 45 7 and 40 6 respectively the drun treatment also reduced them by 48 2 and 46 5 respectively fig 5 the strong gtp of the long lived greenhouse gas n2o dominated the overall contribution to climate change from gvf and since the climate cooling effects of cf2 cf4 were largely short lived and tended to be negligible at a long term time horizon the short lived nh3 and no can still offset 11 1 27 6 and 2 2 4 4 of the greenhouse effect produced by n2o on 20 year time scales and only 2 2 4 4 of that on 100 year time scales 4 5 study limitation and future perspectives in this study the measurements of gnr were performed by manual participation which was time consuming and labor intensive and it was difficult to achieve real time or daily monitoring during the whole growth period in addition as an ecosystem with anthropogenic disturbance vegetable crops include a variety of species with more intensive rotations due to the limitations of the experimental site and number of treatments this study only investigated the effect of different irrigation and fertilization on the loss of gnr in the typical fruit vegetable cucumber tomato planting pattern in the npc and its application on a larger scale regional or national scale needs to be validated through multi year monitoring of different cropping patterns in the future as disciplines intermingle and technology develops more advanced monitoring equipment and methods e g the eddy covariance method sensors continuous flow through chamber systems slant path ftir technique etc will be applied that can greatly improve the frequency of monitoring and the accuracy of estimation tallec et al 2019 kostyanovsky et al 2018 bai et al 2018 accordingly more knowledge based management alternatives are needed when we quantify n losses from irrigation and fertilization management in greenhouse vegetable cropping systems i e to explore the response of different n loss nox nh3 and leaching and n balance to drip irrigation and fertilization managements to evaluate the short or long term impacts on the environment under different ratios of organic and chemical fertilizers application zhang et al 2021a and to estimate the n footprint over the whole life cycle of vegetable production etc 5 conclusions based on the two year round field observations our study evaluated the gaseous nitrogen emissions n2o no and nh3 of the greenhouse cucumber tomato cultivation system in ncp the results showed that the n2o and nh3 fluxes were well described by the combined effects of changes in soil temperature and wfps only changing the irrigation method replacing flood irrigation with drip fertigation without changing the amount of n applied reduced n2o and no emissions while significantly p 0 05 increasing nh3 volatilization both in area scaled and yield scaled reduce chemical n by 50 while replacing flood irrigation with drip fertigation resulted in significant reductions in n2o no and nh3 emissions both in area scaled and yield scaled in view of the effects of multiple gnr emissions on the gtp at the short and long term timescales both drip irrigation or combined chemical n reduction can reduce the gtp on the 20 and 100 year timescales considering the effects of different fertilizer and irrigation regimes on n2o no emissions and nh3 volatilization in the greenhouse cucumber tomato cultivation system the optimized drip fertigation combined with 50 chemical n reduction could be used as an effective water and fertilizer management for the greenhouse cucumber tomato cultivation system due to the prominent gaseous n reduction contribution credit authorship contribution statement wuhan ding conceptualization formal analysis methodology investigation data curation writing original draft
