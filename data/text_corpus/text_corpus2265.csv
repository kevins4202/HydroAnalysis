11325,the increasingly serious water crisis requires all water users to participate in the water saving action the majority of scattered smallholder farmers are in the disadvantage position of information it is difficult for them to obtain the guidance of scientific irrigation in order to satisfy the demands of farmers in north china plain ncp a web based irrigation decision support system with limited inputs widssli is presented in this paper widssli is based on the brower server mode and includes user interfaces uis for farmers and administrators models database and a weather data update system wdus fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach is adopted to simulate the soil water balance of different layers without in field soil moisture monitors the model is started from the earliest day of these days while crops are sowed or the cropland is irrigated and soil water depletions of all layers are initialized with 0 at the beginning using online weather forecast future irrigation decision is obtained by the comparison between the field water availability simulated by the system and the lower limit of the soil moisture for irrigation by which farmers can obtain the irrigation decision support when irrigation is needed and how much water is required verification results shows that the system initialization method is reasonable and widssli can accurately simulate the dynamics of soil water content widssli is deployed in the internet and its mobile version is also developed for ease of use keywords scientific irrigation decision support soil water balance farmer internet 1 introduction irrigation has been a priority for agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions due to the great difference between precipitation and crop water requirement agricultural water consumption increased dramatically in the past decades to meet the growing food demand and insure the food security additionally because of the urbanization and the improvement of living standard domestic and industrial water consumption increased and amount of water were allocated to non agricultural uses agriculture water shortage becomes a great issue in terms of limited water resources peng 2011 however agriculture is still the largest user of water and irrigation water cannot be reduced simply without the risk of food security kang et al 2017 to reduce the wastage of water energy and labor caused by extensive irrigation there is an urgent need to improve agricultural water productivity irrigation decision support system idss can provide scientific and reasonable suggestions for efficient irrigation management wang et al 2017 idsss have been extensively studied and developed in the past 20 years in many domains of agriculture water management based on a simple water balance model mateos et al 2002 developed a scheme irrigation management information system simis to improve irrigation efficiency using a bio decisional model and a spatial database adeaumis simulation platform can provide real time water management based on daily timescale and can even be used under extreme weather conditions leenhardt et al 2004a b mirrg was developed to provide guidance on the design and evaluation of micro irrigation systems by integrating the optimization model technical economic and environmental criterias together pedras and pereira 2004 pedras et al 2009 due to the fact that idsss can only be used in special areas or particular crops yang et al yang et al 2017 developed a flexible decision support system for irrigation scheduling fis dss cropwat developed by fao is a widely used decision support tool for water management in many countries yet it is regarded more suitable as a research tool due to the required parameters operation complexity and system functions guo et al 2016 song et al 2016 the maturity of internet has expanded the function of idss and provides potential for farmers to get access to the software many web based idsss were therefore developed based on collaborating web servers and subscription system pl nteinfo was developed to provide real time user tailored advice to farmers according to the information from different distribution sources jensen et al 2000 washington irrigation scheduling expert wise supports cross platform operation and real time data e g weather data updating the producer oriented design makes it user friendly and can be used without the guidance from consultants leib et al 2001 as an online decision support system for irrigation planteinfo irrigation manager can provide farmers with irrigation advice and explanation in the forms of tables and graphics thysen and detlefsen 2006 after the irrigation manager inputs required field data and the farmer initiates the system based on water balance model and supported by real time in field monitoring stations wang et al 2017 widss is a web based decision support system for canal irrigation management and can utilize the network resources maximally agriculture water use occupies nearly 62 5 of the total water consumption in china in the past few years china 2016 thus plays a key role in influencing water security however not much research focus specifically on the practical application of idss and the knowledge of irrigation water management must be improved with the impact of rural household contract responsibility system arable land was divided into small plots family based diversified small scale operation therefore hindered the investment of modern agricultural equipment even the soil moisture sensor which is required by most idsss for the model initialization can hardly be found in the field additionally information needed by idsss such as soil water content and irrigation amount cannot be obtained from farmers furthermore little knowledge about software or inaccessible to internet from farmers impose restrictions on the application of idsss what mentioned above motivate the need for developing a simplified and user friendly decision support system in this paper a web based irrigation decision support system with limited inputs widssli was developed to support the family diversified irrigation management in north china plain ncp with winter wheat summer corn rotation system as the target this decision support system was implemented using the browser server mode by comparison between soil water balance simulated by the widssli and the lower irrigation limits of crops at different stages decision making supporting information for irrigation can be obtained by using internet or smartphone farmers can easily get the support of scientific guidance on when to irrigate and how much water is required 2 method 2 1 system structure the structure of the widssli is shown in fig 1 there are three components deployed on the server side ui models and database farmers live in any place can get access to the ui of widssli via web browsers through the internet ui includes 4 steps webpages the first and second step get the information of cropland by the interaction with farmers thus providing the filter conditions to select the parameters from database for the models then the soil water dynamic is simulated by the soil water balance model and the results current soil moisture and irrigation requirement are shown in the third webpage the fourth step provides the forecast of the irrigation in the near future the models are run in the server side and simulation results are sent to the farmer s browser because farmers can only provide very limited information much work must be done by the administrator of widssli parameters setting interface is further provided for the administrator to update the database online weather data update system wdus is developed to download weather data from available internet sources everyday automatically 2 2 data requirements widssli is designed for irrigation management of winter wheat and summer corn in the ncp hebei province and five types of data fig 1 required by the system are stored in the database 2 2 1 weather data maximum average and minimum air temperature average wind speed m s relative humidity and precipitation mm d data are required for calculating evapotranspiration et which is taken as water loss in the soil water balance model to get weather data from as many weather stations as possible wdus was developed and installed on the server there is a table embedded in the system and information of the available weather stations are stored in it in the form of name longitude latitude and url the weather stations mainly come from weather bureau of hebei province china national ecosystem observation and research network and noaa s national climatic data center ncdc weather data of these stations are stored in different formats and units wdus downloads the data from urls at midnight while the server is free all the data are converted to specific format and reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated using the method of hargreaves liang et al 2008 at the same time the processed data are stored in the database of the weather station since there may be several days delay in weather data updating in some weather stations daily average values of these weather data in the past five years are calculated for these weather stations and stored in database respectively when widssli is started the missing data are replaced by these average values 2 2 2 crop parameters crop parameters in the widssli include basal crop coefficient root depth m vegetation coverage and height m in this study crop parameters of winter wheat and summer corn were set according to the recommendations of fao 56 allen et al 1998 and local field experiment zhang 1999 the ui of parameters setting provides a form by which all the parameters value at key growing phases can be filled in fig 2 with this form linear interpolation is used to obtain daily values of basal crop coefficient vegetation coverage and height day by day cumulative method is used for the calculation of root depth at each day during crop growing stage the ui enables a graph visualization of the changes of each parameter over time which is great helpful for administrators to adjust the parameters 2 2 3 soil parameters in the soil water balance model adopted in this study the soil is divided into 5 layers i e 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 200 cm the attributes of different layers are required and need to be prepared in advance regarding to soil water content at field capacity and wilting point m3 m 3 allen et al 1998 to keep the spatial heterogeneity of soil each research unit e g each county is linked to a kind of soil correspondingly based on soil distribution maps 2 2 4 lower limit for irrigation the irrigation decision support i e whether to irrigate and if yes how much water is obtained based on the field water availability and the lower limit of the soil moisture for irrigation at that growing stage for a specific crop type winter wheat or summer corn field water availability can be estimated by the soil water balance model the lower irrigation limits of winter wheat and summer corn are derived from literature where the relationship between yield and water use efficiency were studied based on the field experimentations zhang et al 2002 using the lower limit of relative soil water contents at the key growing stages of winter wheat and summer corn daily lower limit is therefore calculated and stored in the database using the method of linear interpolation 2 2 5 other parameters other parameters include user types depth of the surface soil layer m where evaporation occurs and average irrigation amount per time mm widssli was developed for farms and the system administrator for farmers only the irrigation decision information is shown for the administrator parameters used by the system will be shown in the webpage and can be adjusted online additionally intermediate results generated by the model can be displayed and downloaded and can be used for the model calibration 0 1 0 15 m is recommended as the range of depth of the surface soil layer m by fao 56 allen et al 1998 yet 0 1 m is adopted in this study according to field survey of irrigation water quantity difference between farmers zhao et al 2007 average irrigation amount per time is set to 100 mm 2 3 system implement 2 3 1 system initialization the system initialization information is provided by farmer through the first and second webpage in the first webpage the farmer is asked to select the location of his cropland from drop down lists according to the location of the cropland weather data and soil parameters can be derived from database and in the second webpage as shown in fig 3 the previous possible irrigation managements of winter wheat and summer corn have been set for the farmer to select in the days selected by the farmer 100 mm irrigation water will be added to the precipitation soil water content at the beginning is primarily needed to initiate the idss system thysen and detlefsen 2006 wang et al 2017 however there is no soil moisture sensor in the cropland to support the widssli in the day to sow winter wheat or summer corn the soil moisture is usually very high caused by previous precipitation or irrigation in order to ensure the higher seedling emergence and in the day while the field is irrigated soil water content is also very high therefore widssli starts the decision process from the earliest day of these days while the crop was sown or cropland was irrigated meanwhile the soil water contents at 5 layers are all set at field capacity allen et al 1998 additionally weather data and the lower limit of the soil moisture for irrigation will be read in from the database the adoption of this method to initialize the soil water balance model is due to data availability and the uncertainties of this method will be presented later in this paper 2 3 2 evaluation of real time soil water condition fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach is adopted for the simulation of soil water balance of the root zone on a daily basis allen et al 1998 as groundwater table is very deep in ncp zhang et al 2017 and less surface runoff can be generated on the cropland surface the surface flow subsurface flow and capillary rise from shallow water table are therefore neglected in the model system soil water balance of the root zone is calculated by 1 d r i d r i 1 p i i i e t c i d p i where dr i and dr i 1 indicate soil water depletion at day i and i 1 pi and ii represent precipitation and irrigation amount respectively etc i indicates crop evapotranspiration and dpi is the water loss from deep percolation units of these parameters are mm the key to solve the eq 1 is the calculations of etc i and dpi etc can be calculated as 2 e t c k e k s k c b e t o where ke indicates the soil evaporation coefficient kcb and ks indicate the basal crop coefficient and the water stress coefficient on crop transpiration respectively the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach was used for the calculation of evaporation component keeto and transpiration kskcbeto respectively allen et al 1998 in this paper transpiration component is calculated based on different soil layers and root depth kang et al 1992 the flow chart of calculation process in the soil layer 1 is shown as an example fig 4 in fig 4 dr1 i 1 indicates water depletion of layer 1 at the end of day i 1 mm and is initialized to 0 at the beginning kcb i and rli are basal crop coefficient and the root depth m at the day i θfc1 and θwp1 are soil water content of the layer 1 at field capacity and wilting point m3 m 3 in the soil of layer 1 where occupied by the root raw1 ks1 i and taw1 are readily available soil water mm transpiration reduction factor on day i and total available soil water mm respectively kcb1 i is basal crop coefficient of the layer 1 allocated from kcb i according to the distribution of the root density kang et al 1992 the amount of transpiration etc1 i mm comes from layer 1 is kcb1 iks1 ieto i if there is precipitation pi mm or irrigation ii mm deep percolation dr1 i mm from layer 1 to layer 2 may be produced if pi ii etc1 i dr1 i 1 0 and the dr1 i water depletion of layer 1 at the end of day i is calculated based on the inputs and outputs in the layer 1 water balance in different soil layers are calculated based on the same method fig 4 deep percolation from upper soil layers are the input water sources for lower soil layers since transpiration calculation is limited only in the root zone and etc i can be calculated as 3 e t c i j 1 5 e t c j i k e i e t o i relative soil water content of the root zone at the end of day i rswci can be calculated as 4 r s w c i 100 1 j 1 k d r j i j 1 k 1000 θ f c j l j l k r l i j k 1 l j where k is the total number of soil layers where the root exists lj is the depth of layer j m in widssli irrigation decision support is evaluated based on soil water availability in the root zone of the crop and the lower irrigation limit when soil moisture decreases to the irrigation lower limit irrigation water less than or equal to the water depletion of root zone is needed based on the results of the simulation real time irrigation demand can be provided as shown in fig 5 the current state of soil moisture and precipitation in the past days are visualized on the webpage the reasonable irrigation amount i e cumulative water depletion is illustrated as well 2 3 3 irrigation forecast irrigation forecast is also based on the simulation of soil water balance in the future and the length of the forecast depends on the available weather forecast data for the estimation of eto 7 days weather forecast data can be downloaded from weather china www weather com cn using a specific query expression wang et al 2017 it is worth noting that the wind scale and precipitation level forecasted by weather china should be converted to wind speed m s and daily precipitation mm d according to a certain look up tables cai et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 in the irrigation forecast the model is initialized with the current values which were obtained from real time soil water condition evaluation based on the results of simulation irrigation decision support in the coming days can be provided to farmers if the soil moisture is lower than the irrigation lower limit irrigation amount i e cumulative water depletion in root zone will be recommend 3 verification and application 3 1 verification to show the reasonability of the initialization method and the accuracy of simulation the results simulated by widssli are compared with the measured data from irrigation experiment the experiment was carried out at the luancheng agroecosystem experimental station 37 53 n 114 40 e which is located in the northern part of ncp winter wheat and summer corn were sowed on 2015 10 1 and 2016 6 1 respectively based on the local irrigation tradition the field was irrigated on 2015 12 1 2016 4 3 2016 5 3 2016 7 22 and 2016 8 15 and the amount of irrigation was 90 mm water each time because crop roots and evapotranspiration are mainly concentrated in the root layer of 0 80 cm soil water contents in top 4 layers were measured using neutron probe and the first observation time was on 2015 10 28 two kinds of initialization method were compared by the simulation of soil water content at different layers one was started at 2015 10 28 and initialized to the observation data of the same day hereinafter referred to as m1 the other was initialized to field capacity and started at 2015 10 1 while the winter wheat was sown hereinafter referred to as m2 compared to the observation data of the whole period fig 6 the maximum deviations of m1 results are 0 05 0 04 0 03 and 0 03 m3 m 3 in 4 layers from top to bottom respectively it shows that the water balances for different layers were well simulated by the method of m1 the great difference between the results of m1 and m2 only exists in the surface layer 0 20 cm at the beginning of simulation period the soil water contents of the other 3 layers were relatively high and close to each other on 2015 10 28 it means that the soil water content was also very high on the sowing date of winter wheat so the initialization method of m2 is reasonable after the first irrigation on 2015 12 1 the results of m2 were consistent with that of m1 in all layers until the end of the simulation irrigation or heavy rain can increase the soil water content in the root zone close or equal to the field capacity and the model did the same thing at the same time these events will enable the simulation to synchronize with the reality therefore the selection of the day while the crop was sowed with high soil moisture or the cropland was irrigated as the first day of the simulation is reasonable 3 2 application hebei province is a big agricultural province in ncp with severe water shortage due to groundwater table decrease zhang et al 2017 scientific irrigation is highly required for saving water energy and labor in addition the implementation of agricultural mechanization has given farmers more time to engage in other tasks irrigation forecast information is urgently needed by farmers to arrange their work according to these needs widssli was developed and obtained the software copyright register certificate 2016sr027794 in 2016 it has been deployed on the website www casbhlc com and was introduced to farmers by agricultural technique extension departments the function of the system attracted the farmers and practical application results indicated that the accuracy of the prediction was acceptable meanwhile some opinions and suggestions were accepted to improve the system with the increasing popularity of smartphones more and more people go online by their mobile phones using the same database stored in the server mobile phone version of widssli was developed and provided to farmers more easily 4 conclusion in the condition of more and more shortages in water resources every water user should be involved in the conservation of water resources for farmers the simplest way is to be informed the time and amount of irrigation and even reason in order to provide support for farmers irrigation decision in ncp a web based irrigation decision support system widssli was developed in this study the design of the system took into account a number of constraints for instance without soil moisture monitoring system limited information provided by farmers simpler and friendlier ui brower server architecture was adopted and farmers just need to interact with ui most data required by the models were prepared by the system administrator based on the local situation while the weather data was updated automatically by wdus the soil was divided into 5 layers and its water balances were simulated by the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach respectively irrigation decision was made according to the soil water content and corresponding lower limit verification based on the field irrigation experiments showed the initialization method was reasonable and the simulation results were accurate using weather forecast on internet irrigation forecast can be provided based on the changes of soil moisture in the coming days the application of widssli particularly the mobile phone version makes it very convenient for farmers to obtain the irrigation forecast information including the time and the amount of irrigation however the system still needs to be improved for instance automatically searching the heavy rain date in the past for the initialization of model the establishment of soil data base with high spatial resolution introduction of the web gis and so on acknowledgements this study was supported by national key r

irrigation decision is obtained by the comparison between the field water availability simulated by the system and the lower limit of the soil moisture for irrigation by which farmers can obtain the irrigation decision support when irrigation is needed and how much water is required verification results shows that the system initialization method is reasonable and widssli can accurately simulate the dynamics of soil water content widssli is deployed in the internet and its mobile version is also developed for ease of use keywords scientific irrigation decision support soil water balance farmer internet 1 introduction irrigation has been a priority for agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions due to the great difference between precipitation and crop water requirement

initiates the system based on water balance model and supported by real time in field monitoring stations wang et al 2017 widss is a web based decision support system for canal irrigation management and can utilize the network resources maximally agriculture water use occupies nearly 62 5 of the total water consumption in china in the past few years china 2016 thus plays a key role in influencing water security however not much research focus specifically on the practical application of idss and the knowledge of irrigation water management must be improved with the impact of rural household

moisture sensor which is required by most idsss for the model initialization can hardly be found in the field additionally information needed by idsss such as soil water content and irrigation amount cannot be obtained from farmers furthermore little knowledge about software or inaccessible to internet from farmers impose restrictions on the application of idsss what mentioned above motivate the need for developing a simplified and user friendly decision support system in this paper a web based irrigation decision support system with limited inputs widssli was developed to support the family diversified irrigation management in north china plain ncp with winter wheat summer corn rotation system as the target this decision support system was implemented using the browser server mode by comparison between soil water balance simulated by the widssli and the lower irrigation limits of crops at different stages decision making supporting information for irrigation can be obtained by using internet or smartphone farmers can easily get the support of scientific guidance on when to irrigate and how much water is required 2 method 2 1 system structure the structure of the widssli is shown in fig 1 there are three components deployed on the server side ui models and database farmers live in any place can get access to the ui of widssli via web browsers through the internet ui includes 4 steps webpages the first and second step get the information of cropland by the interaction with farmers thus providing the filter conditions to select the parameters from database for the models then the soil water dynamic is simulated by the soil water balance model and the results current soil moisture and irrigation requirement are shown in the third webpage the fourth step provides the forecast of the irrigation in the near future the models are run in the server side and simulation results are sent to the farmer s browser because farmers can only provide very limited information much work must be done by the administrator of widssli parameters setting interface is further provided for the administrator to update the database online weather data update system wdus is developed to download weather data from available internet sources everyday automatically 2 2 data requirements widssli is designed for irrigation management of winter wheat and summer corn in the ncp hebei province and five types of data fig 1 required by the system are stored in the database 2 2 1 weather data maximum average and minimum air temperature average wind speed m s relative humidity and precipitation mm d data are required for calculating evapotranspiration et which is taken as water loss in the soil water balance model to get weather data from as many weather stations as possible wdus was developed and installed on the server there is a table embedded in the system and information of the available weather stations are stored in it in the form of name longitude latitude and url the weather stations mainly come from weather bureau of hebei province china national ecosystem observation and research network and noaa s national climatic data center ncdc weather data of these stations are stored in different formats and units wdus downloads the data from urls at midnight while the server is free all the data are converted to specific format and reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated using the method of hargreaves liang et al 2008 at the same time the processed data are stored in the database of the weather station since there may be several days delay in weather data updating in some weather stations daily average values of these weather data in the past five years are calculated for these weather stations and stored in database respectively when widssli is started the missing data are replaced by these average values 2 2 2 crop parameters crop parameters in the widssli include basal crop coefficient root depth m vegetation coverage and height m in this study crop parameters of winter wheat and summer corn were set according to the recommendations of fao 56 allen et al 1998 and local field experiment zhang 1999 the ui of parameters setting provides a form by which all the parameters value at key growing phases can be filled in fig 2 with this form linear interpolation is used to obtain daily values of basal crop coefficient vegetation coverage and height day by day cumulative method is used for the calculation of root depth at each day during crop growing stage the ui enables a graph visualization of the changes of each parameter over time which is great helpful for administrators to adjust the parameters 2 2 3 soil parameters in the soil water balance model adopted in this study the soil is divided into 5 layers i e 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 200 cm the attributes of different layers are required and need to be prepared in advance regarding to soil water content at field capacity and wilting point m3 m 3 allen et al 1998 to keep the spatial heterogeneity of soil each research unit e g each county is linked to a kind of soil correspondingly based on soil distribution maps 2 2 4 lower limit for irrigation the irrigation decision support i e whether to irrigate and if yes how much water is obtained based on the field water availability and the lower limit of the soil moisture for irrigation at that growing stage for a specific crop type winter wheat or summer corn field water availability can be estimated by the soil water balance model the lower irrigation limits of winter wheat and summer corn are derived from literature where the relationship between yield and water use efficiency were studied based on the field experimentations zhang et al 2002 using the lower limit of relative soil water contents at the key growing stages of winter wheat and summer corn daily lower limit is therefore calculated and stored in the database using the method of linear interpolation 2 2 5 other parameters other parameters include user types depth of the surface soil layer m where evaporation occurs and average irrigation amount per time mm widssli was developed for farms and the system administrator for farmers only the irrigation decision information is shown for the administrator parameters used by the system will be shown in the webpage and can be adjusted online additionally intermediate results generated by the model can be displayed and downloaded and can be used for the model calibration 0 1 0 15 m is recommended as the range of depth of the surface soil layer m by fao 56 allen et al 1998 yet 0 1 m is adopted in this study according to field survey of irrigation water quantity difference between farmers zhao et al 2007 average irrigation amount per time is set to 100 mm 2 3 system implement 2 3 1 system initialization the system initialization information is provided by farmer through the first and second webpage in the first webpage the farmer is asked to select the location of his cropland from drop down lists according to the location of the cropland weather data and soil parameters can be derived from database and in the second webpage as shown in fig 3 the previous possible irrigation managements of winter wheat and summer corn have been set for the farmer to select in the days selected by the farmer 100 mm irrigation water will be added to the precipitation soil water content at the beginning is primarily needed to initiate the idss system thysen and detlefsen 2006 wang et al 2017 however there is no soil moisture sensor in the cropland to support the widssli in the day to sow winter wheat or summer corn the soil moisture is usually very high caused by previous precipitation or irrigation in order to ensure the higher seedling emergence and in the day while the field is irrigated soil water content is also very high therefore widssli starts the decision process from the earliest day of these days while the crop was sown or cropland was irrigated meanwhile the soil water contents at 5 layers are all set at field capacity allen et al 1998 additionally weather data and the lower limit of the soil moisture for irrigation will be read in from the database the adoption of this method to initialize the soil water balance model is due to data availability and the uncertainties of this method will be presented later in this paper 2 3 2 evaluation of real time soil water condition fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach is adopted for the simulation of soil water balance of the root zone on a daily basis allen et al 1998 as groundwater table is very deep in ncp zhang et al 2017 and less surface runoff can be generated on the cropland surface the surface flow subsurface flow and capillary rise from shallow water table are therefore neglected in the model system soil water balance of the root zone is calculated by 1 d r i d r i 1 p i i i e t c i d p i where dr i and dr i 1 indicate soil water depletion at day i and i 1 pi and ii represent precipitation and irrigation amount respectively etc i indicates crop evapotranspiration and dpi is the water loss from deep percolation units of these parameters are mm the key to solve the eq 1 is the calculations of etc i and dpi etc can be calculated as 2 e t c k e k s k c b e t o where ke indicates the soil evaporation coefficient kcb and ks indicate the basal crop coefficient and the water stress coefficient on crop transpiration respectively the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach was used for the calculation of evaporation component keeto and transpiration kskcbeto respectively allen et al 1998 in this paper transpiration component is calculated based on different soil layers and root depth kang et al 1992 the flow

decreases to the irrigation lower limit irrigation water less than or equal to the water depletion of root zone is needed based on the results of the simulation real time irrigation demand can be provided as shown in fig 5 the current state of soil moisture and precipitation in the past days are visualized on the webpage the reasonable irrigation amount i e cumulative water depletion is illustrated as well 2 3 3 irrigation forecast irrigation forecast is also based on the simulation of soil water balance in the future and the length of the forecast depends on the available weather forecast data for the estimation of eto 7 days weather forecast data can be downloaded from weather china www weather com cn using a specific query expression wang et al 2017 it is worth noting that the wind scale and precipitation level forecasted by weather china should be converted to wind speed m s and daily precipitation mm d according to a certain look up tables cai et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 in the irrigation forecast the model is initialized with the current values which were obtained from real time soil water condition evaluation based on the results of simulation irrigation decision support in the coming days can be provided to farmers if the soil moisture is lower than the irrigation lower limit irrigation amount i e cumulative water depletion in root zone will be recommend 3 verification and application 3 1 verification to show the reasonability of the initialization method and the accuracy of simulation the results simulated by widssli are compared with the measured data from irrigation experiment the experiment was carried out at the luancheng agroecosystem experimental station 37 53 n 114 40 e which is located in the northern part of ncp winter wheat and summer corn were sowed on 2015 10 1 and 2016 6 1 respectively based on the local irrigation tradition the field was irrigated on 2015 12 1 2016 4 3 2016 5 3 2016 7 22 and 2016 8 15 and the amount of irrigation was 90 mm water each time because crop roots and evapotranspiration are mainly concentrated in the root layer of 0 80 cm soil water contents in top 4 layers were measured using neutron probe and the first observation time was on 2015 10 28 two kinds of initialization method were compared by the simulation of soil water content at different layers one was started at 2015 10 28 and initialized to the observation data of the same day hereinafter referred to as m1 the other was initialized to field capacity and started at 2015 10 1 while the winter wheat was sown hereinafter referred to as m2 compared to the observation data of the whole period fig 6 the maximum deviations of m1 results are 0 05 0 04 0 03 and 0 03 m3 m 3 in 4 layers from top to bottom respectively it shows that the water balances for different layers were well simulated by the method of m1 the great difference between the results of m1 and m2 only exists in the surface layer 0 20 cm at the beginning of simulation period the soil water contents of the other 3 layers were relatively high and close to each other on 2015 10 28 it means that the soil water content was also very high on the sowing date of winter wheat so the initialization method of m2 is reasonable after the first irrigation on 2015 12 1 the results of m2 were consistent with that of m1 in all layers until the end of the simulation irrigation or heavy rain can increase the soil water content in the root zone close or equal to the field capacity and the model did the same thing at the same time these events will enable the simulation to synchronize with the reality therefore the selection of the day while the crop was sowed with high soil moisture or the cropland was irrigated as the first day of the simulation is reasonable 3 2 application hebei province is a big agricultural province in ncp with severe water shortage due to groundwater table decrease zhang et al 2017 scientific irrigation is highly required for saving water energy and labor in addition the implementation of agricultural mechanization has given farmers more time to engage in other tasks irrigation forecast information is urgently needed by farmers to arrange their work according to these needs widssli was developed and obtained the software copyright register certificate 2016sr027794 in 2016 it has been deployed on the website www casbhlc com and was introduced to farmers by agricultural technique extension departments the function of the system attracted the farmers and practical application results indicated that the accuracy of the prediction was acceptable meanwhile some opinions and suggestions were accepted to improve the system with the increasing popularity of smartphones more and more people go online by their mobile phones using the same database stored in the server mobile phone version of widssli was developed and provided to farmers more easily 4 conclusion in the condition of more and more shortages in water resources every water user should be involved in the conservation of water resources for farmers the simplest way is to be informed the time and amount of irrigation and even reason in order to provide support for farmers irrigation decision in ncp a web based irrigation decision support system widssli was developed in this study the design of the system took into account a number of constraints for instance without soil moisture monitoring system limited information provided by farmers simpler and friendlier ui brower server architecture was adopted and farmers just need to interact with ui most data required by the models were prepared by the system administrator based on the local situation while the weather data was updated automatically by wdus the soil was divided into 5 layers and its water balances were simulated by the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach respectively irrigation decision was made according to the soil water content and corresponding lower limit verification based on the field irrigation experiments showed the initialization method was reasonable and the simulation results were accurate using weather forecast on internet irrigation forecast can be provided based on the changes of soil moisture in the coming days the application of widssli particularly the mobile phone version makes it very convenient for farmers to obtain the irrigation forecast information including the time and the amount of irrigation however the system still needs to be improved for instance automatically searching the heavy rain date in the past for the initialization of model the establishment of soil data base with high spatial resolution introduction of the web gis and so on acknowledgements this study was supported by national key r

11326,spate irrigation represents the main source of livelihood for rural population of many communities living in arid and semi arid areas of the world the area of raya valley ethiopia is one such example that is used here to analyse the importance of participatory approach in making this irrigation technique sustainable effective and durable spate irrigation development projects realised in raya valley during the last twenty years led to a partial failure due to the low involvement of local farmers who have experience of the local environment and who have been practising the techniques from centuries this paper describes the implementation of a participatory methodology based on the integration of participatory rural appraisal and participatory design for the design of effective improvements in a traditional spate irrigation system in raya valley water is harvested from seasonal floods of wadis ephemeral rivers using diversion bunds made by local materials or concrete farmers participation allowed to defining gabions as a suitable solution and to realise a technical design of improved structures the design of an improved diversion structure and a gabion wall against bank erosion was completed the structures resulted in line with operation and maintenance strategy and with traditional spate irrigation management new insights from local farmers knowledge to be

cross section wetted area as a function of flow depth y 1 introduction spateirrigation is an ancient and complex form of water management based on the diversion of water flows from ephemeral rivers located in arid areas wadis the so called spate flows are produced in the mountainous zones of wadi catchments by intense and scattered precipitation and are deviated to irrigated areas by using artificial earthen bunds built within the river bed the technique was originally born in yemen around five thousand years ago today it covers around 3 million hectares of irrigated land around the world in areas distributed in arid and semi arid zone of near east africa south and central asia and latin america ghebremariam and van steenbergen 2007 mehari et al 2005b tesfai and stroosnijder 2001 van steenbergen et al 2010 zimmerer 2011 in these contexts spate irrigation is the most important source of water available for food production and represent one of the main sources of livelihood for the poorest part of rural population hagos et al 2014b komakech et al 2011 van steenbergen et al 2010 differently from irrigation systems on perennial rivers that are working by abstracting a moderate amount of water from a river where discharge is always present spate irrigation systems relies on episodic and intense rainfall that generate occasional and violent flows within dry river beds komakech et al 2011 the spate flows are characterized by a high degree of unpredictability ghebremariam and van steenbergen 2007 van steenbergen 1997 and by an exceptional sediment load embaye et al 2012 van steenbergen et al 2010 communities dependant on spate systems have developed consistent knowledge of wadi systems and management strategies appropriated to these unpredictable flows and extreme conditions castelli and bresci 2017 mehari et al 2007 2005b van steenbergen 1997 on the other hand spate irrigation despite its relevance for rural livelihoods and food security in arid wadi catchments has not received the same attention of perennial irrigation by scholars development agencies and local governments komakech et al 2011 mehari et al 2007 van steenbergen 1997 taking the arid parts of the ethiopia as a typical example of the above extreme conditions spate irrigation has been practiced from generations and represents a fundamental resource for rural livelihoods van steenbergen et al 2011 in the zone of raya valley a dryland plateau bordered by mountains located in the south of tigray region spate irrigation has been practiced from centuries in the last two decades the government of the region has made strong efforts for the modernisation of spate irrigated agriculture in the area kidane 2009 van steenbergen et al 2011 the modernisation process based on the design criteria of irrigation systems for perennial rivers resulted in disappointing outcomes as indicated by the report of the flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 the average efficiency of spate schemes modernised with the perennial river approach was about 9 with 7 system out of 11 analysed that have completely failed in the traditional spate systems of raya valley local rules and regulations allow to manage the unpredictability of spate flows traditional spate systems include multiple diversion structures made by local materials allowing to distribute risk and benefits and not to be dependent on the operating conditions of a single structure farmers have the technical capabilities to reconstruct damaged diversions and to operate maintenance to have the system ready at the beginning of each flow event according to hagos et al 2014a local farmers have developed considerable technical skills in the use of seasonal flows for productive purposes and they have developed well structured irrigation rules appropriated to the environmental context and perceived as fair by local communities as a matter of fact most of modernised irrigation system of raya valley have failed or have been modified autonomously by local farmers for being operative and traditional spate systems are still functioning and represent the very source of water for local farmers hagos et al 2014a the main reason leading to the unsuitability of the modernisation process has been the lack of involvement of beneficiary farmers their technical knowledge institutional agreements and management operations have never been implemented in spate irrigation modernisation and planning this resulted in a reduced knowledge base for technical design a lower participation of the farmers lower sense of ownership of the modernised structures embaye et al 2013 hagos et al 2014a kidane 2009 recently three new schemes oda mersa and guguf have been constructed with hybrid diversion intakes hybrid intakes have been realised by considering the opinion of local farmers and a first assessment of hybridized system efficiency defined as the ratio between the actual command area and the command area planned in the design phase showed an average value of 88 for 2016 confirming the promising adoption of mixed traditional modernised solutions however efficiency analysis has been realised only for one year and there is a need of new insights for increasing the body of knowledge supporting spate irrigation development and management flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 thus the aim of this work has been to select and design effective improvements in spate irrigation systems with a participatory approach the study was carried out in the traditional spate system of harosha tigray region a participatory methodology was realised by the integration of participatory rural appraisal techniques and participatory design methodology a participatory analysis of the problems of the scheme was realised problems were ranked and suitable solutions were designed 2 evolution of spate irrigation in raya valley the first modernised spate system in raya valley was hara system realised in 1998 followed by tirke system in 2004 the design of both systems was based on the conventional approach for perennial rivers neglecting the characteristics of spate flows diversion structures were realised with diversion weirs closed intakes and works in concrete masonry while the canal system was equipped with modern water distribution structures canals and pipes street crossings embaye et al 2013 flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 these systems became completely unused after the first rainy season due to the complete siltation of the system as designers didn t take into account the exceptional sediment load of wadi catchments libsekal et al 2015 after the failure of modernised structures farmers in hara began to divert water with traditional diversion structures located upstream but in 2010 the entire scheme stopped functioning kidane 2009 mehari et al 2013 new spate irrigation schemes were built in fokisa beryu and burka in 2005 trying a different approach farmers were consulted about their knowledge and their preferences but their involvement in the design was limited to the choice of the diversion angle and the off take type following farmers indications the main changes in design from hara and tirke schemes were the change of the off take to open the change of the diversion angle from 90 to 120 the removal of crossing structures with pipes and the enlargement of the canal size this approach avoided the complete siltation of the diversion structures but some siltation problems remained unsolved in addition to this two errors were present in the design an irrigation time of 24 h was considered even if in seasonal rivers flows are only present for 4 5 h in the calculation of irrigation requirements availability of mean effective rainfall was considered due to the extreme variability of rainfall this led to a frequent underestimation of water requirements in dry years libsekal et al 2015 mehari et al 2005a however in 2016 only fokisa system showed an appreciable efficiency of about 30 while the other two substantially failed flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 further spate schemes were constructed in 2006 in ula ula buffie tengago and dayu in these schemes the irrigation requirements were calculated considering 4 h irrigation time neglecting the effect of rainfall by safe side and the design was limited to the main canal siltation problems were not solved however dayu system has kept working with half of the command area in 2011 the design of the new schemes of agbe and shiwata schemes was undertaken assessing flood duration and frequency by interviewing the farmers and command areas were calculated for being fully irrigated with a single flood embaye et al 2013 however only a limited percent of the design command area is actually being irrigated flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 the more recent mersa oda and guguf spate systems were realised with hybrid diversion intakes considering a diversion angle of 135 irrigation water management was planned without affecting the existing traditional institutional setup of the system while the command area has been determined by calculating the annual water amount available at the diversion point flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 table 1 and 2 show a resume of modernisation interventions on spate systems in raya valley 3 area of study the spate system analysed here in detail is situated in the harele tabia municipality in alamata wereda district the wereda is in tigray region around 120 km south of the city of mekelle raya valley is located between 39 22 to 39 25 north latitude and 12 17 to 12 15 east longitude covering the south east of tigray region and the north eastern part of amhara region in tigray it comprehends the whole area of alamata and raya azebo weredas and the eastern highlands of ofla and endamekoni weredas the main crops produced in the area are teff eragrostis tef and sorghum only farmers that have access to groundwater grow also vegetables spate irrigated areas around harosha river extend over the flat area portion of the river basin fig 1 the spate system comprehends a total of 13 diversion structures 4 large diversions are located upstream and 9 smaller ones are located in the downstream part the villages of harele tabia are situated in the right side of the river upstream from the smaller diversions and downstream the larger ones the command area of the 4 larger upstream diversions was chosen as study area the command area covers around 80 ha and includes a small portion of the northern lemaat tabia the area of study is shown in figure the scheme is part of the distributary system of harosha river the first upstream diversion is located before the first ramification of the riverbed which splits in two branches while the other ones are built on the left side of the left branch 4 materials and methods the methodology utilised for the study was based on the framework of diagnostic analysis a structured investigation method for the analysis of a system and the identification of its values and constraints lowdermilk et al 1983 its objective is to identify system problems in order to define appropriate solutions for effective improvements bresci and letterio 2007 the participatory process was composed by 5 phases 1 system analysis analysis of the irrigation system 2 problems analysis inventory of the main problems and constraints of the system 3 problems ranking selection of most relevant problems and constraints 4 selection of solutions selection of technical and or management solutions for removing or attenuating problems and constraints of the system 5 design design of proposed solutions the analysis of the system was realised with the participatory rural appraisal pra methodology pra is based on the idea of learning by local people who are expert of the rural system and capable of carrying on their own analysis the role of the researcher is to act as facilitator for the analysis of the system and the elaboration of information which are shared with the local population chambers 1994 pra activity is carried out using a various range of techniques such as participatory maps semi structured interviews ssis field walks and trend lines which should be triangulated cross checking same information with different techniques chambers 1994 and integrated with secondary data analysis campbell 2001 the design phase was undertaken using the participatory design methodology defined by spinuzzi 2005 the methodology aims to allow designers and users to cooperate in the design of a certain technology or system for the designer the objective of the methodology is the tacit knowledge of users namely the knowledge represented by everyday routines and by the work experience which should be incorporated into design participatory design is divided in three consecutives parts the discovery process in which designers and users explore the system and working routines with the aim of developing a common language for the design phase the initial exploration of works in which the main goals and criteria for the design are defined the prototyping in which the proper design activity is carried out with an iterative process for the development of a prototype a technical refinement should follow the prototyping the two approaches were used in combination the initial exploration of works has been carried out by using a full range of pra techniques phase 1 system analysis the prioritization of users goal and preferences was conducted starting from the analysis of the result of the appraisal problems were identified phase 2 problems analysis and prioritised phase 3 problems ranking after that users goals were defined by selecting suitable solutions phase 4 selection of solutions the prototyping part of participatory design was then performed it was developed starting from the results of phase 4 followed by a better definition of a preliminary design of technical artefacts phase 5 design in addition to phase 1 pra techniques were also used for the facilitation of phases 2 5 table 3 reports the pra techniques utilised in the present work the techniques were divided according to the classification provided by tesfai and de graaff 2000 techniques focusing on spatial aspects of spate irrigation system techniques focusing on temporal aspects of spate irrigation system and techniques focusing on socio economical aspects of spate irrigation system adding a last category techniques focusing on spatiotemporal aspects for a detailed description of the pra techniques utilised in the work see castelli and bresci 2017 the methodology is synthetized by the graphical representation in fig 2 the field activity took place from the 25th of april 2014 to the 13th of june 2014 initially some formal meetings were held with the representatives of alamata wereda water resources bureau administrative bureau agricultural bureau and with the representatives in harele tabia for general information and formal authorizations then the participatory rural appraisal was undertaken participatory analysis was realised involving around 50 farmers field supervisions were realised with groups of 3 or 4 farmers in harosha system men take care of agricultural and breeding activities however female farmers alone and widows are considered active water users pra techniques on the field were realised with male farmers while women farmers participated to focus group discussions and to design discussions 5 problem analysis problem analysis was realised using pra techniques during the discovery process of participatory design the final ranking of the problems was defined in a community meeting with most of the farmers involved the identified problems and their ranking are shown in table 4 6 design during the participatory work it was decided to work out a preliminary design for technical solutions for the two main problems identified for the weakness of the diversion structures new diversion structures were proposed for the lateral erosion a new gabion protection structure was investigated 6 1 diversion structures 6 1 1 initial exploration of works analysis the diversions of harosha spate system belong to the spur type deflector class a diversion bund which works as a discharge separator is built parallel to the flow and deviates water into the primary canal van steenbergen et al 2010 the spatial analysis of the system revealed that farmers build fuse appendices at the end of diversion structure during high flow period farmers amount earth piles at the intake of diversion channel partially blocking the entrance of the irrigation system to violent flows during low flow periods they build an additional bund with the objective of intercepting low flow channels mapping of the systems revealed an average command area of 17 5 ha per diversion interestingly each household owns multiple parcels located in diverse command areas diversions usually are damaged in the upstream part of the bund which is often washed away by high flows the analysis of the structure also shows that farmers avoid sedimentation in the irrigation system by realising diversion channels with upward slope this solution which was developed autonomously by local farmers allows the deposition of the most of sediment load in the first part of diversion channel avoiding sedimentation within the distribution system the upward channel is then cleaned during and after flow events temporal analysis showed that all the diversions of the system were rebuilt after a big flood occurred in august 2010 starting from 2011 ethiopian government started delivering gabions for the reinforcement and rebuilding of irrigation structures farmers who can do regular maintenance on the gabions completed the installation the third and the fourth diversions of the system were rebuilt utilising gabions and they have shown higher resistance to the effect of major flow events the socio economic analysis of the system showed that the institutional structure of irrigation rules was in line with the management structures and with the operation of the system for each diversion one or two abo mais fathers of the river are elected the duties of abo mais are to represent farmers to direct irrigation operations and to define irrigation turns and apply sanctions the water delivery order is determined by the hours of labour contribution for each farmer farmers get water rights only if they participate to collective maintenance works women alone old people and ill farmers could access water rights even without participating to the work if a woman farmer participates to the work she gets the right to have water first regardless of the hours of contribution for each diversion all the secondary canals receive water at the same time and a distribution order is established within each secondary canal if there is not enough water the lists are aggregate and the water delivery is alternated farmers manage water in canals using micro diversion bunds micro diversion bunds are built to block the water flowing in the main channel to deviate the flow in the fields after the due amount of water is delivered the bund is destroyed and water reaches the downstream fields farmers reported that the system is working with good performance fig 3 6 1 2 discovery process design priorities and criteria from the participatory process it emerged that the present shape of diversion spurs allows good performances the main problem of the diversion structures is the weakness of the upstream part of the bund farmers reported that gabions are a suitable solution for structural improvement and that they are capable of installation and maintenance there is no immediate need of intervention in the irrigation canals systems considering the analysis it was decided to design a spur type deflector using gabions which should be resistant to the lateral drag shear stress of the flow and which should have adequate foundation depth for avoiding local scour under the structure figure this solution allows performing traditional management strategy and the coexistence of farmer developed technical solutions fuse structures and upward diversion channel the structure has a foundation depth of 2 5 m for the first 8 m of length a height of 1 5 m and a width of 1 m fig 4 6 1 3 prototyping design 6 1 3 1 hydrological and sediment parameters the hydrology of harosha river was analysed by combining local knowledge and interviews with secondary data analysis a group of farmers expert on water management comprehending abo mais was interviewed about historical water levels the cross section for the analysis was located in the left branch of harosha river distributary system the level of the maximum discharge within living memory and the average of the maximum yearly levels within living memory were selected for the hydraulic design of diversion structures the correspondent discharge was calculated with the slope area method van steenbergen et al 2010 assuming a manning s n value of 0 035 and a slope measured as 0 0015 m m eq 1 1 q 1 n ω y r y 2 3 s 1 2 for correcting the discharge for the full catchment eq 2 was applied 2 q f q where f is calculated considering a discharge division related to the width of left branch l1 and the width of right branch l2 fig 5 as 3 f l 1 l 2 l 1 table 5 presents the results of slope area calculations for the selected cross section and the values for full catchment discharge for the selected hydrological conditions the hydrological analysis of the harsoha catchment was realised starting from srtm digital elevation model nasa 2000 the basin area is 135 4 km2 covering alamata wereda at north and amhara region at south it is located between coordinate 540 000 m and 560 000 m e and 1 355 000 m and 1 370 000 m n in utm wgs84 projected coordinates system the altitude ranges from a minimum of 1523 m a s l to 3051 m a s l while the mean altitude is 2120 m a s l the position of the catchment and rain gauges of the area are shown in fig 6 waja and alamata stations were used for the analysis the total rainfall depth for the catchment was calculated with the method of thiessen polygons table 6 the mean annual flood peak discharge maf is estimated using empirical formulas according to the methodology proposed by van steenbergen et al 2010 results are shown in table 7 where a 135 4 km2 elev 2119 64 m msl 1 394 km map 720 mm eq 6 and eq 7 underestimate the value of maf because of an underestimation of map which is calculated with rainfall data relative to the lowland part of the basin while most of the rainfall occurs in the highland part eq 4 which was derived for wadis of southern yemen overestimate maf value this effect is linked with the geomorphologic configuration of the basin which presents well defined streams even in the early stages of drainage network leading to a low value of msl the discharge obtained with eq 5 can be considered in line with the annual value calculated with the information given by local farmers the discharge calculated with the slope area method using local information from experienced farmers was used for the design the return period of the maximum discharge within living memory was calculated according to van steenbergen et al 2010 for each return period the discharge can be calculated as 8 q t m a f g t the maximum discharge within living memory is correspondent to a gt of 2 75 which corresponds to a return period of around 17 years van steenbergen et al 2010 for the analysis of the size distribution of bed material a proximity criterion was adopted by assuming for harosha wadi the sediment size distribution analysed by libsekal gebremariam 2014 for dayu basin the position of dayu river with respect to harosha river is shown in fig 7 6 1 3 2 calculation of design parameters the local scour calculation was performed with the method proposed by richardson and richardson 2007 for pipe pier scour excavation with eq 9 9 s y 2 0 k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 a y 0 65 f r 0 43 for the specific case of a diversion the structure was approximated as a pier of infinite length the hydraulic characteristics of the flow were calculated for the cross section selected for the slope area analysis considering the maximum discharge within living memory as limit condition considering the discharge for a section of the northern branch the results of the analysis are shown in table 8 hydraulic shear stress check is performed to verify if the gabions can resist to the flow drag the shear stress of the flow τ f l o w is calculated as 10 τ f l o w γ w s y the critical shear stress for gabion wall is calculated according to bongio 2012 11 τ c θ g a b χ d e f γ s γ w d g a b where θ g a b 0 12 χ d e f it is safely assumed equal to 1 γ s is considered 20 n m3 d g a b 0 15 m results are reported in table 9 the results shown that the designed structure is stable for an event of a return period of 17 years 6 2 gabion wall 6 2 1 initial exploration of works analysis the presence of lateral erosion and collapse of river banks were considered the second most relevant problem in the system spatial analysis and field walks revealed the presence of lateral erosion field walks and transect lines along the wadi showed that the river bank portions located between the fourth and the third diversion are more stable due to gabions installation made autonomously by local farmers temporal analysis and in particular trend lines showed the presence of high lateral erosion during the highest flow recorded socio economical techniques revealed how the problem of bank erosion was perceived by all the farmers of the system regardless the position of their field in the command area spatio temporal analysis however showed that the farmers who own fields besides the bank have considerable crop production losses during the years of high soil erosion having lost around the 30 40 of their cropping area in the last 5 years 6 2 2 discovery process design priorities and criteria a simple gabion wall with adequate foundation was selected together with the farmers the use of gabion was considered suitable as described in the diversion discovery process section the scheme of a section of the gabion wall is shown in fig 8 6 2 3 prototyping design the design of the left bank reinforcement of the harosha river through gabions has been carried out through the use of macstars w software developed by officine maccaferri s p a 2009 the software allows the design of gabion walls under different conditions of terrain geometry and geology soil properties aquifer level and gabions filling material the effect of shear stress along the gabion wall was also considered for the design macstars allows the calculation of multiple safety checks utilising different safety standards in absence of a clear regulation for the design of gabions and retaining walls in the framework of ethiopian building laws the safety checks were realised with the european standard eurocode 7 considering the multiplier combination a1 m1 r2 the stability analysis has been carried out for no flow conditions and maximum flow condition i e during the occurrence of qmax this case has been simulated by using an aquifer situated 4 m above the river bed level corresponding to the maximum discharge within living memory the considered parameters are shown in table 10 the results of the analysis in table 11 detailed calculations are shown in castelli 2014 for the shear stress analysis the results are the same of the prototype of diversion structure as shown in table 9 the safety checks were satisfied for the selected gabion wall section considering that the flow analysed conditions are the maximum within living memory the gabion wall is stable for a return period of 17 years 7 discussion the proposed methodology revealed that the main problem of the spate system of harosha is represented by the weakness of traditional diversion structures made in earth and wood as confirmed by a large number of studies erkossa et al 2014 komakech et al 2011 van steenbergen et al 2010 the second most relevant problem is represented by the frequent collapsed of lateral river bank in contrast with mainstream spate irrigation literature embaye et al 2012 erkossa et al 2014 komakech et al 2011 zenebe et al 2015 sedimentation is not perceived as a major constraint 6th place in the ranking indicating a good performance of the traditional solution of uphill diversion canals adopted by local farmers the combination of pra within the participatory design framework allowed to gain a better knowledge about the system castelli and bresci 2017 and to establish an enabling framework for the participatory design of improved diversion structures considering farmers preferences and allowing the integration of best traditional practices developed by the farmers in centuries of work in particular an improved diversion structure has been designed allowing the integration of the technical solution with two local techniques the use of fuse structures for intake protection and upward diversion channel for sediment management gabions were selected as a suitable construction solution considering the technical skills of the farmers who are capable of installing and maintaining them the design approach followed in the present paper allows the traditional management of the canal system and of irrigation water like the approach proposed by the report of flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 however the participatory approach suggested a diversion setting with multiple diversion intakes considering that each household owns multiple plots located in different command areas farmers can cope with the collapse of one or even two diversion structures rather than relying on only one diversion intake interestingly also the average size of each command area 17 5 ha differs from large schemes implementation settings pra allowed also to establish a fast methodology for flows estimation considering local knowledge that has been evaluated in line with hydrological estimation suggested by fao spate irrigation guidelines van steenbergen et al 2010 considering the well known unpredictability connected with spate irrigation management ghebremariam and van steenbergen 2007 komakech et al 2011 van steenbergen et al 2010 the method used for hydrological estimation represents a fast tool to support small to medium spate systems development the approach reversed the methodology followed by previous studies adopting a diagnostic analysis approach for the full system rather than a consultation of farmers finalized to improve diversion design this helped firstly to identify and design the scheme of a gabion wall considering the described observation on material gabions and hydrological analysis apart from that the emergence of flood related problems lateral erosion 2nd flood risk for villages 3rd flood risk for fields 4th revealed that rather than an approach focusing only on irrigation structures an integrated approach considering both irrigation and flood risk can be more appropriated for poverty alleviation and development in spate dependant areas 8 conclusions a participatory methodology realised by the combination of pra chambers 1994 and participatory design spinuzzi 2005 was applied in the traditional farmers managed system of harosha in raya valley in order to design technical improvements for the traditional system and to gain new insights from traditional well established local knowledge about spate irrigation a new improved diversion structure prototype was developed in order to solve the problem of the frequent damage to diversion structures a gabion wall was designed in order to reduce the effect of bank collapses the prototype of the new spur type diversion structure allows performing traditional management strategy and the application of farmer developed technical solutions the integration with local knowledge allowed to identify an appropriate solution gabions and to design structures that can resist to a flow with return period of 17 years with low maintenance needs the designed structures can be inserted in the present system setting without altering traditional management the participatory analysis presented in this paper revealed major insights to be considered for future spate irrigation development project traditional irrigation water management within the systems performs at a satisfactory level diversion structures with uphill slope can be analysed in the future design being reported to be effective in sediment management for harosha spate system permanent structures that in the common modernisation approach are exposed to violent flows can be substituted by fuse structures managed by farmers gabions represent a suitable solution for spate irrigation structures construction multiple intakes allow to cope with damaging flows as each household owns multiple land plots located downstream different diversions and the collapse of one or even two diversions does not represent a limiting factor for a base line production rather than an approach focusing only on irrigation development an approach integrating flood risk management and irrigation structures modernisation is suggested for framing future development strategies acknowledgements the authors reserve a grateful acknowledgment to the economic commitment of the international fund for

11326,spate irrigation represents the main source of livelihood for rural population of many communities living in arid and semi arid areas of the world the area of raya valley ethiopia is one such example that is used here to analyse the importance of participatory approach in making this irrigation technique sustainable effective and durable spate irrigation development projects realised in raya valley during the last twenty years led to a partial failure due to the low involvement of local farmers who have experience of the local environment and who have been practising the techniques from centuries this paper describes the implementation of a participatory methodology based on the integration of participatory rural appraisal and participatory design for the design of effective improvements in a traditional spate irrigation system in raya valley water is harvested from seasonal floods of wadis ephemeral rivers using diversion bunds made by local materials or concrete farmers participation allowed to defining gabions as a suitable solution and to realise a technical design of improved structures the design of an improved diversion structure and a gabion wall against bank erosion was completed the structures resulted in line with operation and maintenance strategy and with traditional spate irrigation management new insights from local farmers knowledge to be considered for future spate irrigation development projects are analysed and presented keywords participatory design participatory rural appraisal ethiopia gabions diversion headworks list of symbols

cross section wetted area as a function of flow depth y 1 introduction spateirrigation is an ancient and complex form of water management based on the diversion of water flows from ephemeral rivers located in arid areas wadis the so called spate flows are produced in the mountainous zones of wadi catchments by intense and scattered precipitation and are deviated to irrigated areas by using artificial earthen bunds built within the river bed the technique was originally born in yemen around five thousand years ago today it covers around 3 million hectares of irrigated land around the world in areas distributed in arid and semi arid zone of near east africa south and central asia and latin america ghebremariam and van steenbergen 2007 mehari et al 2005b tesfai and stroosnijder 2001 van steenbergen et al 2010 zimmerer 2011 in these contexts spate irrigation is the most important source of water available for food production and represent one of the main sources of livelihood for the poorest part of rural population hagos et al 2014b komakech et al 2011 van steenbergen et al 2010 differently from irrigation systems on perennial rivers that are working by abstracting a moderate amount of water from a river where discharge is always present spate irrigation systems relies on episodic and intense rainfall that generate occasional and violent flows within dry river beds komakech et al 2011 the spate flows are characterized by a high degree of unpredictability ghebremariam and van steenbergen 2007 van steenbergen 1997 and by an exceptional sediment load embaye et al 2012 van steenbergen et al 2010 communities dependant on spate systems have developed consistent knowledge of wadi systems and management strategies appropriated to these unpredictable flows and extreme conditions castelli and bresci 2017 mehari et al 2007 2005b van steenbergen 1997 on the other hand spate irrigation despite its relevance for rural livelihoods and food security in arid wadi catchments has not received the same attention of perennial irrigation by scholars development agencies and local governments komakech et al 2011 mehari et al 2007 van steenbergen 1997 taking the arid parts of the ethiopia as a typical example of the above extreme conditions spate irrigation has been practiced from generations and represents a fundamental resource for rural livelihoods van steenbergen et al 2011 in the zone of raya valley a dryland plateau bordered by mountains located in the south of tigray region spate irrigation has been practiced from centuries in the last two decades the government of the region has made strong efforts for the modernisation of spate irrigated agriculture in the area kidane 2009 van steenbergen et al 2011 the modernisation process based on the design criteria of irrigation systems for perennial rivers resulted in disappointing outcomes as indicated by the report of the flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 the average efficiency of spate schemes modernised with the perennial river approach was about 9 with 7 system out of 11 analysed that have completely failed in the traditional spate systems of raya valley local rules and regulations allow to manage the unpredictability of spate flows traditional spate systems include multiple diversion structures made by local materials allowing to distribute risk and benefits and not to be dependent on the operating conditions of a single structure farmers have the technical capabilities to reconstruct damaged diversions and to operate maintenance to have the system ready at the beginning of each flow event according to hagos et al 2014a local farmers have developed considerable technical skills in the use of seasonal flows for productive purposes and they have developed well structured irrigation rules appropriated to the environmental context and perceived as fair by local communities as a matter of fact most of modernised irrigation system of raya valley have failed or have been modified autonomously by local farmers for being operative and traditional spate systems are still functioning and represent the very source of water for local farmers hagos et al 2014a the main reason leading to the unsuitability of the modernisation process has been the lack of involvement of beneficiary farmers their technical knowledge institutional agreements and management operations have never been implemented in spate irrigation modernisation and planning this resulted in a reduced knowledge base for technical design a lower participation of the farmers lower sense of ownership of the modernised structures embaye et al 2013 hagos et al 2014a kidane 2009 recently three new schemes oda mersa and guguf have been constructed with hybrid diversion intakes hybrid intakes have been realised by considering the opinion of local farmers and a first assessment of hybridized system efficiency defined as the ratio between the actual command area and the command area planned in the design phase showed an average value of 88 for 2016 confirming the promising adoption of mixed traditional modernised solutions however efficiency analysis has been realised only for one year and there is a need of new insights for increasing the body of knowledge supporting spate irrigation development and management flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 thus the aim of this work has been to select and design effective improvements in spate irrigation systems with a participatory approach the study was carried out in the traditional spate system of harosha tigray region a participatory methodology was realised by the integration of participatory rural appraisal techniques and participatory design methodology a participatory analysis of the problems of the scheme was realised problems were ranked and suitable solutions were designed 2 evolution of spate irrigation in raya valley the first modernised spate system in raya valley was hara system realised in 1998 followed by tirke system in 2004 the design of both systems was based on the conventional approach for perennial rivers neglecting the characteristics of spate flows diversion structures were realised with diversion weirs closed intakes and works in concrete masonry while the canal system was equipped with modern water distribution structures canals and pipes street crossings embaye et al 2013 flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 these systems became completely unused after the first rainy season due to the complete siltation of the system as designers didn t take into account the exceptional sediment load of wadi catchments libsekal et al 2015 after the failure of modernised structures farmers in hara began to divert water with traditional diversion structures located upstream but in 2010 the entire scheme stopped functioning kidane 2009 mehari et al 2013 new spate irrigation schemes were built in fokisa beryu and burka in 2005 trying a different approach farmers were consulted about their knowledge and their preferences but their involvement in the design was limited to the choice of the diversion angle and the off take type following farmers indications the main changes in design from hara and tirke schemes were the change of the off take to open the change of the diversion angle from 90 to 120 the removal of crossing structures with pipes and the enlargement of the canal size this approach avoided the complete siltation of the diversion structures but some siltation problems remained unsolved in addition to this two errors were present in the design an irrigation time of 24 h was considered even if in seasonal rivers flows are only present for 4 5 h in the calculation of irrigation requirements availability of mean effective rainfall was considered due to the extreme variability of rainfall this led to a frequent underestimation of water requirements in dry years libsekal et al 2015 mehari et al 2005a however in 2016 only fokisa system showed an appreciable efficiency of about 30 while the other two substantially failed flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 further spate schemes were constructed in 2006 in ula ula buffie tengago and dayu in these schemes the irrigation requirements were calculated considering 4 h irrigation time neglecting the effect of rainfall by safe side and the design was limited to the main canal siltation problems were not solved however dayu system has kept working with half of the command area in 2011 the design of the new schemes of agbe and shiwata schemes was undertaken assessing flood duration and frequency by interviewing the farmers and command areas were calculated for being fully irrigated with a single flood embaye et al 2013 however only a limited percent of the design command area is actually being irrigated flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 the more recent mersa oda and guguf spate systems were realised with hybrid diversion intakes considering a diversion angle of 135 irrigation water management was planned without affecting the existing traditional institutional setup of the system while the command area has been determined by calculating the annual water amount available at the diversion point flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 table 1 and 2 show a resume of modernisation interventions on spate systems in raya valley 3 area of study the spate system analysed here in detail is situated in the harele tabia municipality in alamata wereda district the wereda is in tigray region around 120 km south of the city of mekelle raya valley is located between 39 22 to 39 25 north latitude and 12 17 to 12 15 east longitude covering the south east of tigray region and the north eastern part of amhara region in tigray it comprehends the whole area of alamata and raya azebo weredas and the eastern highlands of ofla and endamekoni weredas the main crops produced in the area are teff eragrostis tef and sorghum only farmers that have access to groundwater grow also vegetables spate irrigated areas around harosha river extend over the flat area portion of the river basin fig 1 the spate system comprehends a total of 13 diversion structures 4 large diversions are located upstream and 9 smaller ones are located in the downstream part the villages of harele tabia are situated in the right side of the river upstream from the smaller diversions and downstream the larger ones the command area of the 4 larger upstream diversions was chosen as study area the command area covers around 80 ha and includes a small portion of the northern lemaat tabia the area of study is shown in figure the scheme is part of the distributary system of harosha river the first upstream diversion is located before the first ramification of the riverbed which splits in two branches while the other ones are built on the left side of the left branch 4 materials and methods the methodology utilised for the study was based on the framework of diagnostic analysis a structured investigation method for the analysis of a system and the identification of its values and constraints lowdermilk et al 1983 its objective is to identify system problems in order to define appropriate solutions for effective improvements bresci and letterio 2007 the participatory process was composed by 5 phases 1 system analysis analysis of the irrigation system 2 problems analysis inventory of the main problems and constraints of the system 3 problems ranking selection of most relevant problems and constraints 4 selection of solutions selection of technical and or management solutions for removing or attenuating problems and constraints of the system 5 design design of proposed solutions the analysis of the system was realised with the participatory rural appraisal pra methodology pra is based on the idea of learning by local people who are expert of the rural system and capable of carrying on their own analysis the role of the researcher is to act as facilitator for the analysis of the system and the elaboration of information which are shared with the local population chambers 1994 pra activity is carried out using a various range of techniques such as participatory maps semi structured interviews ssis field walks and trend lines which should be triangulated cross checking same information with different techniques chambers 1994 and integrated with secondary data analysis campbell 2001 the design phase was undertaken using the participatory design methodology defined by spinuzzi 2005 the methodology aims to allow designers and users to cooperate in the design of a certain technology or system for the designer the objective of the methodology is the tacit knowledge of users namely the knowledge represented by everyday routines and by the work experience which should be incorporated into design participatory design is divided in three consecutives parts the discovery process in which designers and users explore the system and working routines with the aim of developing a common language for the design phase the initial exploration of works in which the main goals and criteria for the design are defined the prototyping in which the proper design activity is carried out with an iterative process for the development of a prototype a technical refinement should follow the prototyping the two approaches were used in combination the initial exploration of works has been carried out by using a full range of pra techniques phase 1 system analysis the prioritization of users goal and preferences was conducted starting from the analysis of the result of the appraisal problems were identified phase 2 problems analysis and prioritised phase 3 problems ranking after that users goals were defined by selecting suitable solutions phase 4 selection of solutions the prototyping part of participatory design was then performed it was developed starting from the results of phase 4 followed by a better definition of a preliminary design of technical artefacts phase 5 design in addition to phase 1 pra techniques were also used for the facilitation of phases 2 5 table 3 reports the pra techniques utilised in the present work the techniques were divided according to the classification provided by tesfai and de graaff 2000 techniques focusing on spatial aspects of spate irrigation system techniques focusing on temporal aspects of spate irrigation system and techniques focusing on socio economical aspects of spate irrigation system adding a last category techniques focusing on spatiotemporal aspects for a detailed description of the pra techniques utilised in the work see castelli and bresci 2017 the methodology is synthetized by the graphical representation in fig 2 the field activity took place from the 25th of april 2014 to the 13th of june 2014 initially some formal meetings were held with the representatives of alamata wereda water resources bureau administrative bureau agricultural bureau and with the representatives in harele tabia for general information and formal authorizations then the participatory rural appraisal was undertaken participatory analysis was realised involving around 50 farmers field supervisions were realised with groups of 3 or 4 farmers in harosha system men take care of agricultural and breeding activities however female farmers alone and widows are considered active water users pra techniques on the field were realised with male farmers while women farmers participated to focus group discussions and to design discussions 5 problem analysis problem analysis was realised using pra techniques during the discovery process of participatory design the final ranking of the problems was defined in a community meeting with most of the farmers involved the identified problems and their ranking are shown in table 4 6 design during the participatory work it was decided to work out a preliminary design for technical solutions for the two main problems identified for the weakness of the diversion structures new diversion structures were proposed for the lateral erosion a new gabion protection structure was investigated 6 1 diversion structures 6 1 1 initial exploration of works analysis the diversions of harosha spate system belong to the spur type deflector class a diversion bund which works as a discharge separator is built parallel to the flow and deviates water into the primary canal van steenbergen et al 2010 the spatial analysis of the system revealed that farmers build fuse appendices at the end of diversion structure during high flow period farmers amount earth piles at the intake of diversion channel partially blocking the entrance of the irrigation system to violent flows during low flow periods they build an additional bund with the objective of intercepting low flow channels mapping of the systems revealed an average command area of 17 5 ha per diversion interestingly each household owns multiple parcels located in diverse command areas diversions usually are damaged in the upstream part of the bund which is often washed away by high flows the analysis of the structure also shows that farmers avoid sedimentation in the irrigation system by realising diversion channels with upward slope this solution which was developed autonomously by local farmers allows the deposition of the most of sediment load in the first part of diversion channel avoiding sedimentation within the distribution system the upward channel is then cleaned during and after flow events temporal analysis showed that all the diversions of the system were rebuilt after a big flood occurred in august 2010 starting from 2011 ethiopian government started delivering gabions for the reinforcement and rebuilding of irrigation structures farmers who can do regular maintenance on the gabions completed the installation the third and the fourth diversions of the system were rebuilt utilising gabions and they have shown higher resistance to the effect of major flow events the socio economic analysis of the system showed that the institutional structure of irrigation rules was in line with the management structures and with the operation of the system for each diversion one or two abo mais fathers of the river are elected the duties of abo mais are to represent farmers to direct irrigation operations and to define irrigation turns and apply sanctions the water delivery order is determined by the hours of labour contribution for each farmer farmers get water rights only if they participate to collective maintenance works women alone old people and ill farmers could access water rights even without participating to the work if a woman farmer participates to the work she gets the right to have water first regardless of the hours of contribution for each diversion all the secondary canals receive water at the same time and a distribution order is established within each secondary canal if there is not enough water the lists are aggregate and the water delivery is alternated farmers manage water in canals using micro diversion bunds micro diversion bunds are built to block the water flowing in the main channel to deviate the flow in the fields after the due amount of water is delivered the bund is destroyed and water reaches the downstream fields farmers reported that the system is working with good performance fig 3 6 1 2 discovery process design priorities and criteria from the participatory process it emerged that the present shape of diversion spurs allows good performances the main problem of the diversion structures is the weakness of the upstream part of the bund farmers reported that gabions are a suitable solution for structural improvement and that they are capable of installation and maintenance there is no immediate need of intervention in the irrigation canals systems considering the analysis it was decided to design a spur type deflector using gabions which should be resistant to the lateral drag shear stress of the flow and which should have adequate foundation depth for avoiding local scour under the structure figure this solution allows performing traditional management strategy and the coexistence of farmer developed technical solutions fuse structures and upward diversion channel the structure has a foundation depth of 2 5 m for the first 8 m of length a height of 1 5 m and a width of 1 m fig 4 6 1 3 prototyping design 6 1 3 1 hydrological and sediment parameters the hydrology of harosha river was analysed by combining local knowledge and interviews with secondary data analysis a group of farmers expert on water management comprehending abo mais was interviewed about historical water levels the cross section for the analysis was located in the left branch of harosha river distributary system the level of the maximum discharge within living memory and the average of the maximum yearly levels within living memory were selected for the hydraulic design of diversion structures the correspondent discharge was calculated with the slope area method van steenbergen et al 2010 assuming a manning s n value of 0 035 and a slope measured as 0 0015 m m eq 1 1 q 1 n ω y r y 2 3 s 1 2 for correcting the discharge for the full catchment eq 2 was applied 2 q f q where f is calculated considering a discharge division related to the width of left branch l1 and the width of right branch l2 fig 5 as 3 f l 1 l 2 l 1 table 5 presents the results of slope area calculations for the selected cross section and the values for full catchment discharge for the selected hydrological conditions the hydrological analysis of the harsoha catchment was realised starting from srtm digital elevation model nasa 2000 the basin area is 135 4 km2 covering alamata wereda at north and amhara region at south it is located between coordinate 540 000 m and 560 000 m e and 1 355 000 m and 1 370 000 m n in utm wgs84 projected coordinates system the altitude ranges from a minimum of 1523 m a s l to 3051 m a s l while the mean altitude is 2120 m a s l the position of the catchment and rain gauges of the area are shown in fig 6 waja and alamata stations were used for the analysis the total rainfall depth for the catchment was calculated with the method of thiessen polygons table 6 the mean annual flood peak discharge maf is estimated using empirical formulas according to the methodology proposed by van steenbergen et al 2010 results are shown in table 7 where a 135 4 km2 elev 2119 64 m msl 1 394 km map 720 mm eq 6 and eq 7 underestimate the value of maf because of an underestimation of map which is calculated with rainfall data relative to the lowland part of the basin while most of the rainfall occurs in the highland part eq 4 which was derived for wadis of southern yemen overestimate maf value this effect is linked with the geomorphologic configuration of the basin which presents well defined streams even in the early stages of drainage network leading to a low value of msl the discharge obtained with eq 5 can be considered in line with the annual value calculated with the information given by local farmers the discharge calculated with the slope area method using local information from experienced farmers was used for the design the return period of the maximum discharge within living memory was calculated according to van steenbergen et al 2010 for each return period the discharge can be calculated as 8 q t m a f g t the maximum discharge within living memory is correspondent to a gt of 2 75 which corresponds to a return period of around 17 years van steenbergen et al 2010 for the analysis of the size distribution of bed material a proximity criterion was adopted by assuming for harosha wadi the sediment size distribution analysed by libsekal gebremariam 2014 for dayu basin the position of dayu river with respect to harosha river is shown in fig 7 6 1 3 2 calculation of design parameters the local scour calculation was performed with the method proposed by richardson and richardson 2007 for pipe pier scour excavation with eq 9 9 s y 2 0 k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 a y 0 65 f r 0 43 for the specific case of a diversion the structure was approximated as a pier of infinite length the hydraulic characteristics of the flow were calculated for the cross section selected for the slope area analysis considering the maximum discharge within living memory as limit condition considering the discharge for a section of the northern branch the results of the analysis are shown in table 8 hydraulic shear stress check is performed to verify if the gabions can resist to the flow drag the shear stress of the flow τ f l o w is calculated as 10 τ f l o w γ w s y the critical shear stress for gabion wall is calculated according to bongio 2012 11 τ c θ g a b χ d e f γ s γ w d g a b where θ g a b 0 12 χ d e f it is safely assumed equal to 1 γ s is considered 20 n m3 d g a b 0 15 m results are reported in table 9 the results shown that the designed structure is stable for an event of a return period of 17 years 6 2 gabion wall 6 2 1 initial exploration of works analysis the presence of lateral erosion and collapse of river banks were considered the second most relevant problem in the system spatial analysis and field walks revealed the presence of lateral erosion field walks and transect lines along the wadi showed that the river bank portions located between the fourth and the third diversion are more stable due to gabions installation made autonomously by local farmers temporal analysis and in particular trend lines showed the presence of high lateral erosion during the highest flow recorded socio economical techniques revealed how the problem of bank erosion was perceived by all the farmers of the system regardless the position of their field in the command area spatio temporal analysis however showed that the farmers who own fields besides the bank have considerable crop production losses during the years of high soil erosion having lost around the 30 40 of their cropping area in the last 5 years 6 2 2 discovery process design priorities and criteria a simple gabion wall with adequate foundation was selected together with the farmers the use of gabion was considered suitable as described in the diversion discovery process section the scheme of a section of the gabion wall is shown in fig 8 6 2 3 prototyping design the design of the left bank reinforcement of the harosha river through gabions has been carried out through the use of macstars w software developed by officine maccaferri s p a 2009 the software allows the design of gabion walls under different conditions of terrain geometry and geology soil properties aquifer level and gabions filling material the effect of shear stress along the gabion wall was also considered for the design macstars allows the calculation of multiple safety checks utilising different safety standards in absence of a clear regulation for the design of gabions and retaining walls in the framework of ethiopian building laws the safety checks were realised with the european standard eurocode 7 considering the multiplier combination a1 m1 r2 the stability analysis has been carried out for no flow conditions and maximum flow condition i e during the occurrence of qmax this case has been simulated by using an aquifer situated 4 m above the river bed level corresponding to the maximum discharge within living memory the considered parameters are shown in table 10 the results of the analysis in table 11 detailed calculations are shown in castelli 2014 for the shear stress analysis the results are the same of the prototype of diversion structure as shown in table 9 the safety checks were satisfied for the selected gabion wall section considering that the flow analysed conditions are the maximum within living memory the gabion wall is stable for a return period of 17 years 7 discussion the proposed methodology revealed that the main problem of the spate system of harosha is represented by the weakness of traditional diversion structures made in earth and wood as confirmed by a large number of studies erkossa et al 2014 komakech et al 2011 van steenbergen et al 2010 the second most relevant problem is represented by the frequent collapsed of lateral river bank in contrast with mainstream spate irrigation literature embaye et al 2012 erkossa et al 2014 komakech et al 2011 zenebe et al 2015 sedimentation is not perceived as a major constraint 6th place in the ranking indicating a good performance of the traditional solution of uphill diversion canals adopted by local farmers the combination of pra within the participatory design framework allowed to gain a better knowledge about the system castelli and bresci 2017 and to establish an enabling framework for the participatory design of improved diversion structures considering farmers preferences and allowing the integration of best traditional practices developed by the farmers in centuries of work in particular an improved diversion structure has been designed allowing the integration of the technical solution with two local techniques the use of fuse structures for intake protection and upward diversion channel for sediment management gabions were selected as a suitable construction solution considering the technical skills of the farmers who are capable of installing and maintaining them the design approach followed in the present paper allows the traditional management of the canal system and of irrigation water like the approach proposed by the report of flood based livelihood network foundation 2016 however the participatory approach suggested a diversion setting with multiple diversion intakes considering that each household owns multiple plots located in different command areas farmers can cope with the collapse of one or even two diversion structures rather than relying on only one diversion intake interestingly also the average size of each command area 17 5 ha differs from large schemes implementation settings pra allowed also to establish a fast methodology for flows estimation considering local knowledge that has been evaluated in line with hydrological estimation suggested by fao spate irrigation guidelines van steenbergen et al 2010 considering the well known unpredictability connected with spate irrigation management ghebremariam and van steenbergen 2007 komakech et al 2011 van steenbergen et al 2010 the method used for hydrological estimation represents a fast tool to support small to medium spate systems development the approach reversed the methodology followed by previous studies adopting a diagnostic analysis approach for the full system rather than a consultation of farmers finalized to improve diversion design this helped firstly to identify and design the scheme of a gabion wall considering the described observation on material gabions and hydrological analysis apart from that the emergence of flood related problems lateral erosion 2nd flood risk for villages 3rd flood risk for fields 4th revealed that rather than an approach focusing only on irrigation structures an integrated approach considering both irrigation and flood risk can be more appropriated for poverty alleviation and development in spate dependant areas 8 conclusions a participatory methodology realised by the combination of pra chambers 1994 and participatory design spinuzzi 2005 was applied in the traditional farmers managed system of harosha in raya valley in order to design technical improvements for the traditional system and to gain new insights from traditional well established local knowledge about spate irrigation a new improved diversion structure prototype was developed in order to solve the problem of the frequent damage to diversion structures a gabion wall was designed in order to reduce the effect of bank collapses the prototype of the new spur type diversion structure allows performing traditional management strategy and the application of farmer developed technical solutions the integration with local knowledge allowed to identify an appropriate solution gabions and to design structures that can resist to a flow with return period of 17 years with low maintenance needs the designed structures can be inserted in the present system setting without altering traditional management the participatory analysis presented in this paper revealed major insights to be considered for future spate irrigation development project traditional irrigation water management within the systems performs at a satisfactory level diversion structures with uphill slope can be analysed in the future design being reported to be effective in sediment management for harosha spate system permanent structures that in the common modernisation approach are exposed to violent flows can be substituted by fuse structures managed by farmers gabions represent a suitable solution for spate irrigation structures construction multiple intakes allow to cope with damaging flows as each household owns multiple land plots located downstream different diversions and the collapse of one or even two diversions does not represent a limiting factor for a base line production rather than an approach focusing only on irrigation development an approach integrating flood risk management and irrigation structures modernisation is suggested for framing future development strategies acknowledgements the authors reserve a grateful acknowledgment to the economic commitment of the international fund for

absorption good crop nutritional status though can increase the tolerance of crops to drought and increase crop wue the production of biomass is dependent on the co limitation relationship between the availability of water and fertilizer sadras 2004 co limitation implies that crop growth responds more to water and fertilizer than to either single factor indicating that the strategies to optimize crop growth should ensure that both resources are equally available water deficit has been shown to remarkably decrease the n translocation ratio from the soil and to adversely affect the contribution

effect of water and n input on tomato yield wue and nue such a quantitative analysis is necessary for improving the recommendations of water and n inputs in tomato cultivation the specific objectives of the current study were to 1 collect and analyze the results of studies on water and n on yield wue and nue in tomato and 2 to provide suggestions for improved yield with increased resource use efficiency our study uniquely examined the interactions of water and n input on yield wue and nue in tomato which has been overlooked in many previous studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we used google scholar web of science and sciencedirect search engines to search the literature for relevant citations using the keywords tomato water and or nitrogen evapotranspiration and irrigation or fertilization we excluded non english papers and conference proceedings and had a cut off date of 31 january 2018 the literature was screened by the following criteria 1 contained data for tomato yield and water and n inputs 2 year and experimental site were provided and 3 temperature and rainfall during the growing season were documented using these criteria we included 49 studies from 10 countries totaling 733 yield observations 2 2 definitions wue kg m 3 was calculated as 1 w u e y w 100 where y is the tomato yield t ha 1 and w is the total amount of irrigation water and rainfall mm representing total water input because surface runoff and belowground drainage can occur w can be larger than et we did not account for potential changes in soil moisture across time nue kg kg 1 was calculated as 2 n u e y n 1000 where y is tomato yield t ha 1 and n is the input of n fertilizer to the soil kg ha 1 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 estimating the mean effect of multiple independent variables we used rstudio software https www rstudio com to build a linear fitting model for the effects of n water and temperature on yield wue and nue in tomato crops 3 l α β 1 w β 2 n β 3 t β 4 w n where l represents the independent variables including yield t ha 1 wue kg m 3 and nue kg kg 1 w is the total water input mm n is the n fertilizer input kg ha 1 t is the mean temperature during the growing season c w n is the interaction between water and n and β 1 4 are coefficients of the variables 2 3 2 relationships and sub group analysis the optimal inputs of water and n are the minimum inputs of water and n that produced the highest yield high water w and low water w would be defined that the water inputs were higher supra optimal and lower sub optimal than the optimal water input respectively high n n and low n n would be defined that the n inputs were higher supra optimal and lower sub optimal than the optimal n input respectively we conducted sub group analysis by comparing the slopes and intercepts of regression lines for low and high n fertilizer input across the relationships between water and the independent variables of yield nue and wue we repeated this process for low and high water inputs across the relationship between n and the independent variables we used ordinary least squares to conduct linear regression for each sub group data set 2 3 3 estimation of the effects of n and water inputs we defined as optimal water and n levels which maximized yield while minimizing input inputs above supra optimal and below sub optimal these levels can decrease yield wue and nue we performed pairwise comparisons between observed and maximum yield for each experimental year of each study to assess how much yield wue and nue were reduced by non optimal inputs these pairwise comparisons were conducted mainly because tomato yield varied greatly among years even in the same study our data set contained at least two n inputs and or two water inputs for the pairwise comparisons the data set was therefore divided into two sub data sets one for water input containing 332 observations from 32 studies and one for n input containing 167 observations from 15 studies of these 234 data points were eliminated because the treatments were water and n interactions and could thus not be separated into the water or n sub data sets for each study we calculated effect size of non optimal inputs as the natural log of the response ratio r hedges et al 1999 4 l n r y l n y o b s y m a x where y obs is the observed yield for one year in a given study and y max is the maximum yield which was set as the control extent of non optimal input of water or n on wue and nue was calculated as 5 l n r w u e l n w u e o b s w u e m a x 6 l n r n u e l n n u e o b s n u e m a x where wue obs and nue obs are the observed values for wue and nue in one year of a study while wue max and nue max are the wue and nue values associated with optimal water and n input 2 3 4 estimating the water and n saving potentials previous studies have reported that some decrease in water and n input does not decrease tomato yield compared to conventional farming practices e g full and or slightly supra high water and n input du et al 2017 elia and conversa 2012 the extent of conservation of water and n may vary largely among countries we include an estimate of the potential for conserving water and n the water saving potential wsp was calculated as 7 w s p w w o p t where w is supra optimal input of water and wopt is the optimal input that maximizes yield the percent wsp was calculated as 8 w s p w w o p t w m a x 100 n saving potential nsp was calculated according to the formula 9 n s p n n o p t where n is supra optimal input of n and nopt is the optimal input that maximizes yield the percent nsp was calculated as 10 n s p n n o p t n m a x 100 3 results 3 1 overview of tomato yield wue and nue tomato yield wue nue input of irrigation water total water input n input and air temperature were all highly variable due in large part to the variability in studied cultivar geographic location and growing seasons fig 2 all data were roughly normally distributed tomato yield ranged from 2 35 to 305 56 t ha 1 wue from 0 58 to 87 08 kg m 3 nue from 10 47 to 3004 kg kg 1 irrigation water input was between 0 and 1122 mm total water input irrigation rainfall fell between 56 and 1369 5 mm n input varied from 0 to 1550 kg ha 1 and air temperature varied from 12 2 to 29 7 median yield ranged from 41 75 to 130 59 t ha 1 in different countries which was significantly higher than the global average range of 16 43 to 37 02 t ha 1 figs 1 and 3 median wue ranged from 7 09 to 34 63 kg m 3 and median nue ranged from 208 1 to 2050 kg kg 1 the variations in yield wue and nue were higher among studies than countries countries with high yields generally had high wues and nues e g portugal spain and canada 3 2 relationships of water and n inputs with tomato yield wue and nue the results of the linear fitting are shown in table 1 inputs of water and n and their interaction correlated positively with yield temperature however had a significantly negative effect on yield as expected mean temperature had a significant effect on the yield but the effect was negative perhaps because high temperatures inhibit tomato growth during specific stages such as flowering and fruit setting wue was correlated positively with n input but negatively with water input and the interaction between water and n inputs the effect of water input on nue was positively significant but the relationships between n input and interaction between water and n input was negative the relationships between water and n inputs and yield wue and nue are shown in fig 4 total water input was correlated positively with yield under low n inputs while under high n input a negative relationship was found between yield and total water input yield differed significantly between high and low inputs of n fig 4a wue decreased with increasing total water input and differed significantly between high and low inputs of n fig 4b nue increased with total water input under low input of n while under high n input the total water input had no significant effect on nue fig 4c yield increased with n input but did not differ significantly between high and low inputs of water fig 4d wue was positively correlated with input of n and increased more rapidly under low than with a high input of water fig 4e nue decreased as n input increased and differed significantly between high and low inputs of water fig 4f 3 3 wsp and nsp supra optimal water input significantly decreased nue wue and yield by 3 7 19 6 and 9 8 respectively fig 5 a sub optimal water input decreased nue and yield by 18 7 and 35 3 respectively but decreased wue by only 5 supra optimal n input significantly decreased nue wue and yield by 50 5 6 3 and 5 6 respectively fig 5b sub optimal n input decreased nue wue and yield by 13 8 19 7 and 36 5 respectively table 2 shows estimated wsp for various countries the mean optimal water input mean n input mean wue and mean nue for the countries were 195 mm 200 kg ha 1 54 kg m 3 and 649 kg kg 1 respectively the overall mean wsp in each country ranged from 0 to 83 mean 41 indicating that the water input can decrease by 41 without decreasing yield wsp varied greatly in all countries e g from 0 to 73 32 for bangladesh from 0 to 84 mean 42 for india and from 0 to 50 mean 50 for egypt the estimated nsp for each country are shown in table 3 mean optimal n input was 100 kg ha 1 mean water input was 430 mm mean yield was 86 t ha 1 mean wue was 23 kg m 3 and mean nue was 1068 kg kg 1 the overall mean nsp for each country varied between 0 and 67 mean 37 indicating that decreasing the n input by 37 did not decrease yield each country had a different nsp e g from 0 to 77 mean 77 for china from 0 to 90 mean 50 for italy and from 0 to 49 mean 20 for india 4 discussion the extreme shortage of water resources and the contamination of aquifers caused by excessive n application are two major agricultural problems facing the world today tomato production however requires a large consumption of water tomato et varies from 185 to 320 mm in different growing seasons sun et al 2013 li et al 2017b du et al 2017 et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration total water inputs larger than 320 mm in the present study accounted for two thirds of the observations which was larger than the upper limit of tomato et indicating that water input could be further optimized the largest plant n uptake was 470 kg ha 1 about 10 of the n inputs exceeded the maximum plant n uptake supra optimal n input causes an imbalance between vegetative and reproductive growth and excessive n uptake can decrease crop yield and nue tei et al 2002 hocking et al 1987 consistent with our results fig 4 and 5 our analysis suggest that reducing supra optimal water to optimal could increase tomato yield wue and nue by 9 8 19 6 and 3 7 respectively and reducing supra optimal n management to optimal could increase tomato yield wue and nue by 5 6 6 3 and 50 5 respectively fig 5 over optimal water input leads to drainage and n leaching losses and thereby to low wue and nue vázquez et al 2006 reported that water input decreased to 80 of etc could reduce nitrate leaching and may increase nue sun et al 2013 however sub optimal water and n input leads to a reduction in yield due to the inability to meet the crop growth requirements and thereby also to a reduction in wue and nue this is similar to our present study showing that increasing the sub optimal water input to optimal could increase yield wue and nue by 35 3 5 and 18 7 respectively and could increase sub optimal n inputs to optimal level could increase yield wue and nue by 36 5 19 7 and 13 8 these results highlight the importance of optimal water and n inputs analysis of the current data indicated that the mean global optimal water and n input rates were 195 mm and 100 kg ha 1 respectively water and n inputs had an interactive effect on yield wue and nue table 1 fig 4 indicating that water and n inputs must be optimized simultaneously in tomato cultivation disregarding interactions could decrease yield wue and nue which would ultimately waste resources and pollute the environment we concluded that increasing the total water input would decrease yield wue under high n input while increase yield and nue under low n input fig 4a b and c perhaps because a high n input would increase losses of soil nitrates by leaching and produce soil conditions favoring n denitrification thereby decreasing crop nue and wue quemada and gabriel 2016 decreasing n input significantly increased nue but also decreased yield and wue fig 4d e and f improvement of water and n efficiency requires consideration of yield wue and nue simultaneously quemada and gabriel 2016 reported that less n should be applied when the yield was reduced due to deficit irrigation to match the crop demand adjusting water and n input to meet crop demand was very effective for optimizing water and n inputs median tomato yield 41 75 130 59 t ha 1 wue 7 09 34 63 kg m 3 and nue 208 1 2050 kg kg 1 varied widely among countries in our study fig 2 different temperatures due to the different growing seasons and different cultivars management strategies e g weeding pesticide application and tillage and especially water and n inputs can contribute to this variation wang et al 2015 warner et al 2004 soto et al 2015 candido et al 2015 consistency between yield wue and nue also varied among the countries yield wue and nue were all relatively low in egypt and usa perhaps because the supra optimal water and n inputs far exceeded the demands for plant growth and no longer contributed to plant physiological processes but caused the inefficient consumption of water and n zotarelli et al 2009 du et al 2017 supra optimal water and n inputs led to higher yields but lower wues and nues e g china indicating that the higher yield obtained from high inputs of water and n but produced less crop per unit of water both above situations generally required the optimization of water and n inputs by saving water and n simultaneously increasing yield wue and nue fig 4 crops with low yields had higher wues and nues e g india this efficiency of water and n use may not be truly high due to poor management and the lack of water and n inputs similar results were obtained in a study in india which found that the tomato yield reached only 31 5 t ha 1 at the n application rate of 48 kg ha 1 but nue rose to 656 3 kg ha 1 optimizing the inputs of water and n by decreasing supra optimal inputs of water and n to optimal inputs or by increasing sub optimal inputs of water and n to optimal inputs to ensure high yield wue and nue simultaneously are thus necessary our study included the results of 49 studies with 733 total observations from across 10 countries large amounts of data are needed to conduct a meta analysis experimental designs often include farming practices as a treatment others simply include different inputs of water and or n and some include improved or optimal management practices many previous studies have only examined the effect a single factor either water or n input the target level of irrigation may thus be obtained from a supra or sub optimal n input similarly the target n input may be derived from a supra or sub optimal water input in the present study larger variations were found in the wsp and nsp among different countries in spain there existed no further wsp and nsp relating to its higher yield wue and nue as compared with other countries fig 3 for most countries however including china italy india turkey egypt and the usa wsp and nsp varied to different degrees in addition our study showed that portugal only had wsp while canada had only nsp fig 3 table 2 and 3 in general large wsp and nsp are still available for the global cultivation of tomato ongoing study of related data is required to further hone these results additionally data from certain countries may be more representative and can be used for global level estimates our analysis indicated that the global wsp and nsp could be reduced by 41 240 mm and 37 138 kg n ha 1 respectively table 2 and 3 suggesting that the water and n inputs could be reduced by 41 and 37 respectively without decreasing tomato yields these results provide scientific and theoretical recommendations for water and n inputs for farmers in tomato cultivation 5 conclusions we conducted a global meta analysis of the literature on water and n inputs on yield wue and nue in tomato using 733 observations from 49 studies in 10 countries most of the studies optimized either water or n input and only a few studies simultaneously optimized inputs of both water and n the median tomato yield ranged from 41 75 to 130 59 t ha 1 median wue varied from 7 09 to 34 63 kg m 3 and the median nue ranged from 208 1 to 2050 kg kg 1 improvements in efficiency must include the effects of both water and n as well as the effects of their interactions simultaneously optimizing water and n inputs can greatly affect wsp and nsp which could be increased by 41 and 37 respectively our results also indicated that decreasing a supra optimal input of water to an optimal input could increase yield by 9 8 improve wue by 19 6 and increase nue by 3 7 and that decreasing a supra optimal input of n to an optimal input would increase yield by 5 6 wue by 6 3 and nue by 50 5 these results provide practical guidelines for water and n inputs in tomato cultivation acknowledgements

more water and improving wue are therefore urgently needed especially for tomatoes which have the highest planted areas of all vegetables worldwide ho 1996 tomato evapotranspiration et ranges from 284 to 735 mm ozbahce and tari 2010 soto et al 2015 patanè et al 2011 topcu et al 2007 vázquez et al 2006 and water input during the growing season ranges between 0 mm greenhouse and 168 mm wang et al 2015 patanè et al 2011 ngouajio et al 2007 mukherjee et al 2012 vázquez et al 2006 farnesellia et al 2015 irrigation is necessary for tomatoes due to the large gap between rainfall and et and is needed in important areas of tomato cultivation such as the united states china and italy the amount of supplemental irrigation water varies from 100 to 500 mm farnesellia et al 2015 ngouajio et al 2007 patanè et al 2011 wang et al 2015 agricultural irrigation is responsible for 85 of global freshwater consumption van schilfgaarde 1994 and even a small amount of water saved can be used for other purposes optimizing irrigation management and decreasing the use of irrigation water as much as possible are thus necessary cossani et al 2012 reported that water deficits will reduce crop yield and n absorption good crop nutritional status though can increase the tolerance of crops to drought and increase crop wue the production of biomass is dependent on the co limitation relationship between the availability of water and fertilizer sadras 2004 co limitation implies that crop growth responds more to water and fertilizer than to either single factor indicating that the strategies to optimize crop growth should ensure that both resources are equally available water deficit has been shown to remarkably decrease the n translocation ratio from the soil and to adversely affect the contribution of n in various organs hamzei 2011 sun et al 2013 showed that the best management practices under furrow irrigation for tomato cultivation are irrigation with 300 mm and n application rate of 150 kg ha 1 in the autumn winter season or irrigation with 300 mm and n application rate of 250 kg ha 1 in the spring summer season however kuscu et al 2014 indicated that the irrigation regime of 75 percent of the pan evaporation and n supply at 120 kg ha 1 or 180 kg ha 1 could be considered optimal under drip irrigation although previous studies have examined the potential to use water and n fertilizer more efficiently for tomato production most only examined the role of one or the other factor optimizing the supply of water and n simultaneously depends on many factors e g irrigation and fertilization techniques crop varieties and soil types chen et al 2014 li et al 2017a b zhang et al 2017 reported that the application of irrigation water at a rate of 80 et did not decrease tomato yield compared with 100 et a decrease in water input to 60 et however decreased tomato yield by 13 63 water deficits at different growth stages can also differentially affect tomato yield a study by chen et al 2014 found that certain tomato life stages such as the flowering and fruiting stages were more susceptible to water stress than was the seedling stage n requirements also vary among tomato cultivars yield increased with n input 160 kg ha 1 resulted in a yield of 88 8 t ha 1 while 300 kg ha 1 gave a maximum yield of 129 5 t ha 1 farnesellia et al 2015 erdal et al 2006 the reported differences in water and n use between different studies is large so it is not clear what the actual water and n saving potential is for tomato cultivation globally there have not been systematic analyses of the impact of water and n saving on crops potentially filling this gap meta analysis is a statistical model used to analyze datapoints from separate empirical studies stanley and jarrell 1989 meta analysis has the advantage of being able to systematically evaluate and summarize results from multiple independent research projects that have the same subject allowing meta analysis researchers to draw conclusions from concatenated datasets meta analysis is widely used in agricultural research worldwide carrijo et al 2017 applied a meta analysis to examine the effect of alternate wetting and drying on rice yields and water use globally biederman and harple 2013 applied a meta analysis to examine the effect of biochar on plant productivity and nutrient cycling similar research was conducted by adu et al 2018 and linquist et al 2013 using meta analysis methods in the present study a meta analysis was also applied to systematically analyze the available information on the effect of water and n input on tomato yield wue and nue such a quantitative analysis is necessary for improving the recommendations of water and n inputs in tomato cultivation the specific objectives of the current study were to 1 collect and analyze the results of studies on water and n on yield wue and nue in tomato and 2 to provide suggestions for improved yield with increased resource use efficiency our study uniquely examined the interactions of water and n input on yield wue and nue in tomato which has been overlooked in many previous studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we used google scholar web of science and sciencedirect search engines to search the literature for relevant citations using the keywords tomato water and or nitrogen evapotranspiration and irrigation or fertilization we excluded non english papers and conference proceedings and had a cut off date of 31 january 2018 the literature was screened by the following criteria 1 contained data for tomato yield and water and n inputs 2 year and experimental site were provided and 3 temperature and rainfall during the growing season were documented using these criteria we included 49 studies from 10 countries totaling 733 yield observations 2 2 definitions wue kg m 3 was calculated as 1 w u e y w 100 where y is the tomato yield t ha 1 and w is the total amount of irrigation water and rainfall mm representing total water input because surface runoff and belowground drainage can occur w can be larger than et we did not account for potential changes in soil moisture across time nue kg kg 1 was calculated as 2 n u e y n 1000 where y is tomato yield t ha 1 and n is the input of n fertilizer to the soil kg ha 1 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 estimating the mean effect of multiple independent variables we used rstudio software https www rstudio com to build a linear fitting model for the effects of n water and temperature on yield wue and nue in tomato crops 3 l α β 1 w β 2 n β 3 t β 4 w n where l represents the independent variables including yield t ha 1 wue kg m 3 and nue kg kg 1 w is the total water input mm n is the n fertilizer input kg ha 1 t is the mean temperature during the growing season c w n is the interaction between water and n and β 1 4 are coefficients of the variables 2 3 2 relationships and sub group analysis the optimal inputs of water and n are the minimum inputs of water and n that produced the highest yield high water w and low water w would be defined that the water inputs were higher supra optimal and lower sub optimal than the optimal water input respectively high n n and low n n would be defined that the n inputs were higher supra optimal and lower sub optimal than the optimal n input respectively we conducted sub group analysis by comparing the slopes and intercepts of regression lines for low and high n fertilizer input across the relationships between water and the independent variables of yield nue and wue we repeated this process for low and high water inputs across the relationship between n and the independent variables we used ordinary least squares to conduct linear regression for each sub group data set 2 3 3 estimation of the effects of n and water inputs we defined as optimal water and n levels which maximized yield while minimizing input inputs above supra optimal and below sub optimal these levels can decrease yield wue and nue we performed pairwise comparisons between observed and maximum yield for each experimental year of each study to assess how much yield wue and nue were reduced by non optimal inputs these pairwise comparisons were conducted mainly because tomato yield varied greatly among years even in the same study our data set contained at least two n inputs and or two water inputs for the pairwise comparisons the data set was therefore divided into two sub data sets one for water input containing 332 observations from 32 studies and one for n input containing 167 observations from 15 studies of these 234 data points were eliminated because the treatments were water and n interactions and could thus not be separated into the water or n sub data sets for each study we calculated effect size of non optimal inputs as the natural log of the response ratio r hedges et al 1999 4 l n r y l n y o b s y m a x where y obs is the observed yield for one year in a given study and y max is the maximum yield which was set as the control extent of non optimal input of water or n on wue and nue was calculated as 5 l n r w u e l n w u e o b s w u e m a x 6 l n r n u e l n n u e o b s n u e m a x where wue obs and nue obs are the observed values for wue and nue in one year of a study while wue max and nue max are the wue and nue values associated with optimal water and n input 2 3 4 estimating the water and n saving potentials previous studies have reported that some decrease in water and n input does not decrease tomato yield compared to conventional farming practices e g full and or slightly supra high water and n input du et al 2017 elia and conversa 2012 the extent of conservation of water and n may vary largely among countries we include an estimate of the potential for conserving water and n the water saving potential wsp was calculated as 7 w s p w w o p t where w is supra optimal input of water and wopt is the optimal input that maximizes yield the percent wsp was calculated as 8 w s p w w o p t w m a x 100 n saving potential nsp was calculated according to the formula 9 n s p n n o p t where n is supra optimal input of n and nopt is the optimal input that maximizes yield the percent nsp was calculated as 10 n s p n n o p t n m a x 100 3 results 3 1 overview of tomato yield wue and nue tomato yield wue nue input of irrigation water total water input n input and air temperature were all highly variable due in large part to the variability in studied cultivar geographic location and growing seasons fig 2 all data were roughly normally distributed tomato yield ranged from 2 35 to 305 56 t ha 1 wue from 0 58 to 87 08 kg m 3 nue from 10 47 to 3004 kg kg 1 irrigation water input was between 0 and 1122 mm total water input irrigation rainfall fell between 56 and 1369 5 mm n input varied from 0 to 1550 kg ha 1 and air temperature varied from 12 2 to 29 7 median yield ranged from 41 75 to 130 59 t ha 1 in different countries which was significantly higher than the global average range of 16 43 to 37 02 t ha 1 figs 1 and 3 median wue ranged from 7 09 to 34 63 kg m 3 and median nue ranged from 208 1 to 2050 kg kg 1 the variations in yield wue and nue were higher among studies than countries countries with high yields generally had high wues and nues e g portugal spain and canada 3 2 relationships of water and n inputs with tomato yield wue and nue the results of the linear fitting are shown in table 1 inputs of water and n and their interaction correlated positively with yield temperature however had a significantly negative effect on yield as expected mean temperature had a significant effect on the yield but the effect was negative perhaps because high temperatures inhibit tomato growth during specific stages such as flowering and fruit setting wue was correlated positively with n input but negatively with water input and the interaction between water and n inputs the effect of water input on nue was positively significant but the relationships between n input and interaction between water and n input was negative the relationships between water and n inputs and yield wue and nue are shown in fig 4 total water input was correlated positively with yield under low n inputs while under high n input a negative relationship was found between yield and total water input yield differed significantly between high and low inputs of n fig 4a wue decreased with increasing total water input and differed significantly between high and low inputs of n fig 4b nue increased with total water input under low input of n while under high n input the total water input had no significant effect on nue fig 4c yield increased with n input but did not differ significantly between high and low inputs of water fig 4d wue was positively correlated with input of n and increased more rapidly under low than with a high input of water fig 4e nue decreased as n input increased and differed significantly between high and low inputs of water fig 4f 3 3 wsp and nsp supra optimal water input significantly decreased nue wue and yield by 3 7 19 6 and 9 8 respectively fig 5 a sub optimal water input decreased nue and yield by 18 7 and 35 3 respectively but decreased wue by only 5 supra optimal n input significantly decreased nue wue and yield by 50 5 6 3 and 5 6 respectively fig 5b sub optimal n input decreased nue wue and yield by 13 8 19 7 and 36 5 respectively table 2 shows estimated wsp for various countries the mean optimal water input mean n input mean wue and mean nue for the countries were 195 mm 200 kg ha 1 54 kg m 3 and 649 kg kg 1 respectively the overall mean wsp in each country ranged from 0 to 83 mean 41 indicating that the water input can decrease by 41 without decreasing yield wsp varied greatly in all countries e g from 0 to 73 32 for bangladesh from 0 to 84 mean 42 for india and from 0 to 50 mean 50 for egypt the estimated nsp for each country are shown in table 3 mean optimal n input was 100 kg ha 1 mean water input was 430 mm mean yield was 86 t ha 1 mean wue was 23 kg m 3 and mean nue was 1068 kg kg 1 the overall mean nsp for each country varied between 0 and 67 mean 37 indicating that decreasing the n input by 37 did not decrease yield each country had a different nsp e g from 0 to 77 mean 77 for china from 0 to 90 mean 50 for italy and from 0 to 49 mean 20 for india 4 discussion the extreme shortage of water resources and the contamination of aquifers caused by excessive n application are two major agricultural problems facing the world today tomato production however requires a large consumption of water tomato et varies from 185 to 320 mm in different growing seasons sun et al 2013 li et al 2017b du et al 2017 et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration total water inputs larger than 320 mm in the present study accounted for two thirds of the observations which was larger than the upper limit of tomato et indicating that water input could be further optimized the largest plant n uptake was 470 kg ha 1 about 10 of the n inputs exceeded the maximum plant n uptake supra optimal n input causes an imbalance between vegetative and reproductive growth and excessive n uptake can decrease crop yield and nue tei et al 2002 hocking et al 1987 consistent with our results fig 4 and 5 our analysis suggest that reducing supra optimal water to optimal could increase tomato yield wue and nue by 9 8 19 6 and 3 7 respectively and reducing supra optimal n management to optimal could increase tomato yield wue and nue by 5 6 6 3 and 50 5 respectively fig 5 over optimal water input leads to drainage and n leaching losses and thereby to low wue and nue vázquez et al 2006 reported that water input decreased to 80 of etc could reduce nitrate leaching and may increase nue sun et al 2013 however sub optimal water and n input leads to a reduction in yield due to the inability to meet the crop growth requirements and thereby also to a reduction in wue and nue this is similar to our present study showing that increasing the sub optimal water input to optimal could increase yield wue and nue by 35 3 5 and 18 7 respectively and could increase sub optimal n inputs to optimal level could increase yield wue and nue by 36 5 19 7 and 13 8 these results highlight the importance of optimal water and n inputs analysis of the current data indicated that the mean global optimal water and n input rates were 195 mm and 100 kg ha 1 respectively water and n inputs had an interactive effect on yield wue and nue table 1 fig 4 indicating that water and n inputs must be optimized simultaneously in tomato cultivation disregarding interactions could decrease yield wue and nue which would ultimately waste resources and pollute the environment we concluded that increasing the total water input would decrease yield wue under high n input while increase yield and nue under low n input fig 4a b and c perhaps because a high n input would increase losses of soil nitrates by leaching and produce soil conditions favoring n denitrification thereby decreasing crop nue and wue quemada and gabriel 2016 decreasing n input significantly increased nue but also decreased yield and wue fig 4d e and f improvement of water and n efficiency requires consideration of yield wue and nue simultaneously quemada and gabriel 2016 reported that less n should be applied when the yield was reduced due to deficit irrigation to match the crop demand adjusting water and n input to meet crop demand was very effective for optimizing water and n inputs median tomato yield 41 75 130 59 t ha 1 wue 7 09 34 63 kg m 3 and nue 208 1 2050 kg kg 1 varied widely among countries in our study fig 2 different temperatures due to the different growing seasons and different cultivars management strategies e g weeding pesticide application and tillage and especially water and n inputs can contribute to this variation wang et al 2015 warner et al 2004 soto et al 2015 candido et al 2015 consistency between yield wue and nue also varied among the countries yield wue and nue were all relatively low in egypt and usa perhaps because the supra optimal water and n inputs far exceeded the demands for plant growth and no longer contributed to plant physiological processes but caused the inefficient consumption of water and n zotarelli et al 2009 du et al 2017 supra optimal water and n inputs led to higher yields but lower wues and nues e g china indicating that the higher yield obtained from high inputs of water and n but produced less crop per unit of water both above situations generally required the optimization of water and n inputs by saving water and n simultaneously increasing yield wue and nue fig 4 crops with low yields had higher wues and nues e g india this efficiency of water and n use may not be truly high due to poor management and the lack of water and n inputs similar results were obtained in a study in india which found that the tomato yield reached only 31 5 t ha 1 at the n application rate of 48 kg ha 1 but nue rose to 656 3 kg ha 1 optimizing the inputs of water and n by decreasing supra optimal inputs of water and n to optimal inputs or by increasing sub optimal inputs of water and n to optimal inputs to ensure high yield wue and nue simultaneously are thus necessary our study included the results of 49 studies with 733 total observations from across 10 countries large amounts of data are needed to conduct a meta analysis experimental designs often include farming practices as a treatment others simply include different inputs of water and or n and some include improved or optimal management practices many previous studies have only examined the effect a single factor either water or n input the target level of irrigation may thus be obtained from a supra or sub optimal n input similarly the target n input may be derived from a supra or sub optimal water input in the present study larger variations were found in the wsp and nsp among different countries in spain there existed no further wsp and nsp relating to its higher yield wue and nue as compared with other countries fig 3 for most countries however including china italy india turkey egypt and the usa wsp and nsp varied to different degrees in addition our study showed that portugal only had wsp while canada had only nsp fig 3 table 2 and 3 in general large wsp and nsp are still available for the global cultivation of tomato ongoing study of related data is required to further hone these results additionally data from certain countries may be more representative and can be used for global level estimates our analysis indicated that the global wsp and nsp could be reduced by 41 240 mm and 37 138 kg n ha 1 respectively table 2 and 3 suggesting that the water and n inputs could be reduced by 41 and 37 respectively without decreasing tomato yields these results provide scientific and theoretical recommendations for water and n inputs for farmers in tomato cultivation 5 conclusions we conducted a global meta analysis of the literature on water and n inputs on yield wue and nue in tomato using 733 observations from 49 studies in 10 countries most of the studies optimized either water or n input and only a few studies simultaneously optimized inputs of both water and n the median tomato yield ranged from 41 75 to 130 59 t ha 1 median wue varied from 7 09 to 34 63 kg m 3 and the median nue ranged from 208 1 to 2050 kg kg 1 improvements in efficiency must include the effects of both water and n as well as the effects of their interactions simultaneously optimizing water and n inputs can greatly affect wsp and nsp which could be increased by 41 and 37 respectively our results also indicated that decreasing a supra optimal input of water to an optimal input could increase yield by 9 8 improve wue by 19 6 and increase nue by 3 7 and that decreasing a supra optimal input of n to an optimal input would increase yield by 5 6 wue by 6 3 and nue by 50 5 these results provide practical guidelines for water and n inputs in tomato cultivation acknowledgements

11328,understanding root growth characteristics is important for on farm water management the objectives of this study were to determine the root growth of barley under different irrigation water managements and planting systems raised bed rb and conventional flat f planting systems subjected to full fi and deficit irrigations di managements and rainfed rf conditions were applied the fi addressed 100 crop evapotranspiration et according to the penman monteith equation while the di received 60 fi and the rf just received precipitation in the rb system three rows of crops were grown on 60 cm wide beds that were 80 cm center to center apart the height of each bed was 20 cm in the f system there was no land configuration in total there were nine barley rows separated 30 cm from each other in the f and rb systems the f and rb systems were irrigated as basin irrigation and furrow irrigation respectively root growth traits and characteristics soil water depletion and the total grain yields from the middle three rows were assessed the rb significantly outperformed f in terms of root production under fi however this difference between rb and f was not significant under water stress conditions di and rf the specific root length srl decreased as soil water content decreased in the water stressed treatments through elevated soil water deficit progression after imposing irrigation treatments root development was considerable under all irrigation treatments and planting systems because rld was at least 1 cm cm 3 at the 90 100 cm soil depth which is recommended as the threshold for potential water uptake and indicates that the barley fasih cultivar produced more than 1 cm cm 3 of root length over the entire effective rooting zone of 0 100 cm under all experimental treatments this might imply excess root production further analysis revealed that total grain yields were correlated with the rld nevertheless the excess root growth might have negatively affected grain yield because more carbon and assimilate were translocated to the root system instead of grains under water limited conditions it is thought to be important for barley crops that do not produce very large amount of roots but rather produce less roots that do not negatively suppress grain yield keywords root length density root mass density specific root length irrigation managements planting systems barley grain yield 1 introduction roots are considered as the main components of the second green revolution for increasing crop production particularly in regions where fresh water resources are limited and soil nutrient reserve is poor lynch 2011 understanding the complexities of root growth distribution and function across plant species and soil characteristics has been a challenging field of research in spite of the highly recognized importance of roots on crop production skaggs and shouse 2008 gregory and kirkegaard 2017 bishopp and lynch 2015 suggested that while the substantial increases in crop yields in the 20th century has been attributed to application of chemical fertilizers and management of the aboveground of the plants more attention should be paid to manage belowground of the plants i e roots to address food demand in the 21st century in arid and semi arid regions where fresh water resources are limited and knowledge of root growth behavior helps for improved irrigation water management and water productivity lv et al 2010 ahmadi et al 2017 in these areas conservative agricultural practices and planting systems are recommended to prevent excess water use and optimize soil water content however soil water uptake under different soil moisture regimes is a function of root growth where under unfavorable soil water conditions plants improve their ability to increase water uptake by extensive root growth and proliferation in the soil matrix passioura 1983 palta and watt 2009 in this regard spatial and temporal variations of soil water content soil texture and soil structure have major impacts on root growth and distribution in soil matrix dexter 2004 ahmadi et al 2011 root length density rld cm root per cm3 soil and root mass density rmd g dry root per cm3 soil traits are the common root properties extensively assessed and reported e g carvalho et al 2014 white et al 2015 ahmadi et al 2011 2017 when plants are exposed to water stress higher root growth implies substantial metabolic costs of soil exploration by root system lambers et al 2002 lynch and ho 2005 this metabolic cost implies a trade off between root growth to capture water on the one hand i e rld and translocation of more assimilates to the root i e rmd rather than the shoot on the other hand this is a trade off in root response to soil water variations and specific root length srl m root per g dry root mass is a widely used trait to study root length and size in soil under this trade off eissenstat 1991 in fact higher srl means longer and thinner roots and vice versa corneo et al 2017 indicating more root proliferation compared to lower srl among the conservative agricultural practices raised bed rb planting system is implemented worldwide to improve productivity and reduction of irrigation water requirement sayre et al 2005 zhang et al 2007 he et al 2015 in the rb system plants are grown on narrow raised beds which range in width from 45 to 100 cm sayre and hobbs 2004 depending on wheel track width of the tractor or harvester he et al 2008 rb has been introduced as a suitable alternative for rainfed systems in the arid and semi arid regions because they could hold rainfall prevent runoff and promote water infiltration govaerts et al 2007 since barley is grown under irrigated or rainfed systems in the semi arid conditions in iran suffering from fresh water resources and erratic precipitation rojhani shirazi and ahmadi 2016 it is an idea to determine how barley grows under rb conditions and whether rb would change the soil water status and barley root growth characteristics which would affect total grain yield indeed barley is a dominant crop in many regions of iran and according to the recent data survey ministry of agriculture jihad 2016 it is the second widely cultivated cereal ca 21 after wheat ca 70 as fresh water resources are however very limited in most parts of iran barley is mainly cultivated as rainfed ca 105 700 ha compared to irrigated system ca 70 500 ha in the recent decades groundwater resources as the dominant irrigation water source of the fars province have been extensively depleted due to severe and long term drought conditions therefore it is needed to plan for growing crops that are drought tolerant and could use rainfall more effectively than other crops barley is the crop that is suitable for such water scarcity conditions based on our recent study which revealed that many parts of the fars province are suitable for extensive production of barley compared to wheat rojhani shirazi and ahmadi 2016 so far the majority of the rb studies have focused on yield and agronomic responses of the field crops mainly wheat maize and rice and soil physical characteristics sayre et al 2005 he et al 2008 2012 however too little is known about the effect of rb on root growth of barley crop though gorny and patyna 1984 and lugg et al 1988 studied the root growth of barley crops subject to irrigation levels there are a few studies which briefly reported that rb improved root growth of wheat on the beds he et al 2008 2015 kong et al 2010 but there are no detailed studies of root growth under rb to our knowledge in addition no detailed report is available on the effect of rb on barley that is a common crop in arid and semi arid regions due to its greater tolerance to drought stress compared to wheat since knowledge of root distribution pattern under irrigated and rainfed conditions is important for accurate water management therefore the objectives of this study were to determine the root growth of winter barley under rb and conventional flat f planting systems subject to different irrigation managements and rainfed conditions the hypothesis was that the rb and f would show different root growth under different water management that eventually affect grain yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 site specification a field experiment was conducted during the growing season 2013 2014 at the experimental farm of faculty of agriculture shiraz university shiraz iran the farm is located at 52 32 e and 29 36 n and 1810 m above mean sea level the study area has a warm climate with annual average rainfall of about 386 mm ahmadi et al 2017 the required meteorological data are collected from a nearby station located ca 20 m from the research field fig 1 illustrates the meteorological data during the growing season table 1 summarizes the physical and chemical properties of the cultivated soil ahmadi et al 2017 barzegari et al 2017 2 2 experiment details and treatments a factorial experiment in randomized complete block design rcbd with four replications was conducted the locally bred barley cultivar fasih was used in the experiment the experimental plots were 2 7 m 2 7 m and plot borders were separated by ca 2 m wide protection area to prevent any interference between treatments in total there were 24 plots barley was seeded on november 18 2013 at the rate of 200 kg ha 1 in each plot in nine rows the experimental factors were the irrigation treatments in three levels and the planting systems in two levels the three irrigation treatments were full irrigation fi that addressed 100 crop evapotranspiration et deficit irrigation di that received 60 fi and no irrigation as rainfed rf irrigation treatment started on march 18 2014 122 dap days after planting and was repeated every 10 days until last irrigation on may 31 2014 195 dap however the fi and di were equally irrigated 81 mm on december 5 2013 17 dap to ensure uniform seedlings and crop establishment the rf treatments were only rainfed throughout the whole growing season first rain occurred just a day after sowing and continued for 4 days that summed up 38 mm this caused uniform germination and crop establishment in all plots irrigation requirement was determined by calculating crop evapotranspiration etc based on the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto equation allen et al 1998 and the locally determined kc values of 0 6 1 2 and 0 2 for the initial middle and end growth stages of barley hashemi tame 2013 as etc eto kc in each irrigation event the preceding 10 day etc was summed as the irrigation depth for the fi the volume of irrigation water was determined based on the plot area and was applied using a hand held water meter in total the fi and di treatments received 824 and 527 mm during the growing season and rf treatment received 225 mm that is the total rainfall during the growing season the planting systems were raised bed rb and conventional flat f in the rb system there were three 60 cm wide beds that were 80 cm center to center apart the height of each bed measured from bottom of the furrows was 20 cm in total there were four furrows that were used for irrigation on top of each bed three rows of barley were planted there were nine rows of barley separated 30 cm from each other in the f and rb system due to the plot configurations of f system where there were no ridges and furrows the f was irrigated as basin irrigation but rb was irrigated as furrow irrigation during the growing season 150 kg n ha 1 was applied in three events before seeding 21 kg n ha 1 was applied as ammonium phosphate 21 46 0 npk second and third n application at the rate of 100 kg n ha 1 and 29 kg n ha 1 as urea 46 0 0 npk were applied on march 5 and march 18 2014 2 3 soil water content soil water content swc was gravimetrically measured seven times after starting the irrigation treatments in the center of plot between two plant rows and in 20 cm depth intervals down to 100 cm that resulted in five measurements per soil profile measurements were made one day before irrigation event in the two replications of each treatment gravimetric swc was converted to volumetric swc m3 m 3 by multiplying soil bulk density table 1 depleted soil water dsw was then calculated as the difference between the volumetric swc and the volumetric amount of water held at field capacity fc m3 m 3 when required to pool the measurement days for further analysis the dsws of the seven days were averaged the fraction of depleted available water fdaw m3 m 3 for any soil layer was calculated as eq 1 for each measurement day the fdaw values were then averaged over the seven measurement days for each soil layer for further

at the final harvest on june 26 2014 222 dap the 1 meter length of the three middle rows from each plot were harvested for total grain yields determination on 223 dap soil cores were collected for root studies a hand driven auger with 6 cm diameter and 100 cm long was used for soil sampling on one plant row in all 24 plots after pulling out the auger the soil column was divided into ten 10 cm section and each one was placed in a separate plastic bag and stored at 6 c in a freezer for later analysis in total 240 root samples were collected the soil samples were submerged in a large pot for 24 h then the roots were separated from the soaked soil by gently stirring the mixture in the pot the floating roots were collected in a 250 μm mesh size sieve to ensure that no root was left and trapped in the soil mixture additional water was added frequently and the preceding root collection procedure was repeated until no more floating roots were observed ahmadi et al 2011 2017 after separating the living roots from the organic debris and dead roots in an appropriate tray the individual fresh root samples were collected by a 250 μm mesh size sieve the fresh root were placed in a small plastic bottle and preserved by adding 10 acetic acid solution to the bottles ahmadi et al 2011 2017 the samples were again stored at 6 c for further root analysis the root length cm was determined by the newman method 1966 and then converted to rld cm cm 3 based on the associated soil volume 242 74 cm3 for 10 cm soil section after determining the root length the root sample was oven dried at 60 c for 24 h to calculate root mass density rmd mg cm 3 as the ratio of root dry mass mg precision 0 1 mg to the associated soil sample volume 242 74 cm3 for 10 cm soil section the srl was finally calculated as the ratio of root length and dry root mass m g 1 2 5 statistical analyses data were subjected to the two way analysis of variance anova using the proc glm procedure of sas software version 9 0 sas institute 2002 to test the statistical effect of irrigation treatments and planting systems on root growth parameters based on the guidelines given by gomez and gomez 1986 for a factorial experiment as rcbd in four replications the least significant difference lsd at the probability level of p 0 05 was used for the mean comparisons the r software r core team 2017 version 3 4 1 and the nls package were also used to fit the non linear equations to the data the root distribution data were fitted to the gerwitz and page 1974 model as r l d α e x p γ d where d is the soil depth cm corresponding to rld cm cm 3 and α and γ are the fitted parameters indicating that a larger α value refers to a larger rld in the upper soil layer and the lower γ value indicates the tendency for deeper root growth cumulative rld fraction was calculated as the fraction of the total rld rld100 in each soil depth d and was fitted to the gale and grigal 1987 model as δ 1 β d where δ is the cumulative rld fraction r l d d r l d 100 from the soil surface to the depth d cm and β is the fitted parameter known as extinction coefficient of root distribution the 3d lorentzian model eq 1 was fitted to the data of rld rmd and fdaw as eq 2 2 z j 1 x x 0 k 2 1 y y 0 l 2 where z is the rmd mg cm 3 x is the fdaw and y is the rld cm cm 3 the parameters j k l x0 and y0 are fitted parameters and are 216 28 0 19 0 78 0 77 and 21 59 respectively the logistic model eq 3 was fitted to the data of grain yield and rld and rmd the equation is as follows 3 f t 1 e x p s 0 s r where f is the total grain yield mg ha 1 t r and s0 are the fitted parameters and s is the weighted average of rld cm cm 3 or rmd mg cm 3 over the 0 100 cm rooting zone computed by eq 4 ahmadi et al 2017 4 r l d r l d i w i w i where i 10 20 30 100 and w i 1 i this weighing approach ensures proper weighting to the rld or rmd of the shallower soil layers that contribute more to water uptake and crop yield production janz and stonier 1995 steduto et al 2012 kumar et al 2015 ahmadi et al 2017 3 results 3 1 root length density fig 2 shows rld distribution in different water managements and planting systems in the fi the rld in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm reached to ca 16 and ca 12 cm cm 3 in rb and f respectively rb produced significantly higher rld than f in fi particularly in the 0 70 cm of soil profile that accounts for almost two or three times higher rld than f the rld at the deepest layer of 90 100 cm was almost 3 and 1 5 cm cm 3 in rb and f respectively which means rb doubled root length in the deepest layer notably rld of rb was at least 6 cm cm 3 in 60 70 cm soil profile that was much larger than the reported in depth rld in the previous studies on barley soon 1988 in the di root growth pattern was however different from fi although rb had significantly higher rld than f at the top 0 20 cm rld had no significant difference below the 0 20 cm soil depth except at 60 70 cm and 90 100 cm soil layers this implies that planting systems might not affect root length below 0 20 cm soil layer under water stress managements therefore rb shows its main effect on root length under well watered condition over the top rooting zone rld decreased sharply below 0 20 cm under di which varied between ca 6 8 cm cm 3 at 20 30 cm and ca 2 cm cm 3 at 90 100 cm depth however statistically comparing fi and di in fig 2 it is clear that the significant differences between these two irrigation managements were mostly observed in the 30 80 cm soil layer where the planting systems showed their major effects on rld in this 30 80 cm rooting zone the rb and f under fi showed significant differences but under di they were not significant except at 60 70 cm this region of soil profile is where soil water will be mostly depleted and roots are active fig 3 due to their relations with high rld soon 1988 bonachela 1996 carvalho et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 cai et al 2017 hartmann et al 2017 in this regard fig 4 shows the depleted soil water dsw in different irrigation treatments and planting systems across different days after planting dap it is clear that the dsw of di increased during the latest growth period compared to fi both figs 3 and 4 imply that the barley roots experienced higher water stress in the f than rb under all irrigation managements based on higher depleted soil water interestingly root length distribution in the rf was obviously different from fi and di in contrast to fi and di the highest rld was observed in f ca 8 cm cm 3 compared to rb ca 6 cm cm 3 under rf condition f had significantly higher rld than rb in the top 0 20 soil layer below which the differences were not significant except at 90 100 cm depth where f had significantly higher rld than rb the rlds in rf ranged between ca 3 4 cm cm 3 in the 20 30 cm and ca 1 2 cm cm 3 in the 90 100 cm depth that shows a slight change in rld over the rooting zone 3 2 cumulative rld distribution fig 5 shows the cumulative rld distribution with depth in rb and f in different water regimes it is clear that the relationship between cumulative rld and depth is exponential on average ca 55 and 75 of the total root length distributed in the top 0 30 and 0 50 cm respectively it means that cumulative rld distribution with depth of this barley cultivar was fairly conservative across all planting systems and irrigation managements indicating that higher root fractions are mostly observed in the top 0 50 cm of soil profile the fitted β values of the gale and grigal 1987 model for the fi di and rf under rb and f are 0 973 0 969 0 970 and 0 971 0 968 0 972 respectively carvalho et al 2014 reported β values of 0 976 and 0 982 for barley and wheat respectively and king et al 2003 reported β 0 970 for wheat β is an index of the shape of rooting distribution and greater β means a more uniform root distribution with depth or a greater proportion of roots at soil depth lower β indicates greater proportion of root near the soil surface jackson et al 1996 therefore it is observed that di has lower β values which indicate the di tendency to accumulate more roots in the upper soli layers 3 3 root mass density in the fi the rmd varied between ca 5 mg cm 3 and 0 1 mg cm 3 and between ca 2 mg cm 3 and 0 03 mg cm 3 in the top 0 10 cm and deep 90 100 cm layers of rb respectively fig 2 overall rb had significantly higher rmd than f in the majority of soil depths under fi the major differences were observed in the top 0 70 cm where root mass differences between the planting systems were considerable deeper than 60 70 cm soil layer the differences were small though they were significant in the di the rb produced significantly higher root mass than f in the deep layers of 50 100 cm while in the upper layers 0 50 cm the differences were not significant except at 10 20 cm this shows that rb produced more vigorous root system than f in the deeper layers of the di which indicates under water saving irrigation management the rb tends to produce stronger root system and invests more carbon cost in the deeper layers to extract water it is also noteworthy that in the rb root mass of di ca 2 mg cm 3 in the top 0 10 cm considerably reduced compared with fi ca 5 mg cm 3 however this root mass behavior was not observed in the f system this means that root mass of the topsoil layer of 0 10 cm was highly affected by the planting system such that rb outperformed f in the rf however the rmd pattern was completely different from di the significant differences between f and rb were only observed at topsoil layer of 0 30 cm where rb significantly produced stronger roots than f these interesting differences between di as water saving irrigation management and rf as no irrigation management show that root production in the rb and f might basically depend on soil water regime and its distribution which consequently affect root mass production however f suppresses root mass production in the top soil layers of 0 40 cm than rb 3 4 rld rmd srl and yield relationships the relationship between dsw and srl is illustrated in fig 6 srl exponentially decreased with dsw this means shows that when dsw 0 and there is no water stress srl of ca 555 m g 1 is expected as higher srl indicates thinner and longer root vs lower srl that indicates thicker and shorter roots it is concluded that roots became thicker sharply as soil water deficit increased fig 7 shows rmd as a function of rld and fdaw this relationship depends on the regions where roots may experience no water stress and water stress each point in fig 7 represents the corresponding measurement in each 20 cm soil depth interval 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm so for each treatment five data points is available such relationship has not been reported before to the best of our knowledge fig 8 illustrates the functional inter relationships between measured total grain yield and its corresponding weighted average rld or rmd in each plot eq 3 the logistic model fitted quite well to rld r2 0 97 and fairly well to rmd r2 0 61 the logistic model has been widely used to fit to the yield data subject to irrigation water management scenarios sepaskhah et al 2011 mahbod et al 2014 and to the best of our knowledge no previous study has been already published to describe the relationship between grain yield and root traits of barley using the logistic model in order to increase the accuracy of regression fitting the average grain yields of the replications was not used in the regression the average grain yield and the associated standard errors se for fi di and rf in rb and f are 4 3 0 041 4 1 0 048 0 58 0 048 and 4 0 0 15 3 9 0 15 0 56 0 10 respectively the relationship between srl and grain yield of each plot is shown in fig 9 the data are categorized as the irrigated fi and di and rf data there is no relationship between srl and grain yield in the rf condition but a poor r2 0 16 p 0 09 relationship is observed between the grain yield and srl under the irrigated conditions however it was expected that srl would show a good correlation with grain yield gahoonia and nielsen 2004 paula and pausas 2011 kramer walter et al 2016 corneo et al 2017 but unexpectedly the relationship was very poor this implies that the root length rld or root mass rmd would have solely relationship with grain yield fig 8 but if the root length would be normalized with the root mass this correlation disappears 4 discussion 4 1 root growth the barley cultivar in this study was genetically able to produce large amount of root in the top soil layer though generally in cereals rld of topsoil reaches 2 10 cm cm 3 hoad et al 2001 manske and vlek 2002 or 5 10 cm cm 3 in temperate cereal crops gregory and kirkegaard 2017 the highest rld ca 16 cm cm 3 under irrigated conditions fi and di was observed in rb compared with f ca 12 cm cm 3 fig 2 however under rainfed condition f produced longer roots than rb in the shallow layers these apparent differences show that planting systems have distinct effects on root production under different irrigation managements generally longer roots in shallow depths are associated with higher water and nutrient uptake gao et al 2016 hodgkinson et al 2017 rb proved greater tendency to produce more vigorous root system than f which is attributed to improved soil physical conditions such as lower bulk density and greater soil water content he et al 2008 2015 kong et al 2010 sayre and hobbs 2004 increased area to absorb solar radiation and higher soil temperature zhang et al 2007 sharratt 1991 he et al 2008 2012 and improved microclimate conditions in the canopy leading to better growth conditions fahong et al 2005 indeed better soil water status figs 3 and 4 in the rb compared to the f implies a favorable root growth media in rb rb produced more roots in deep soil layers 70 100 cm under water stressed condition di than f this means that rb induces a better root growth condition under deficit irrigation to explore water in deeper soil layers than f manschadi et al 2006 described adaptations of root growth of wheat and barley to cope with soil water limitations through deep root system to increases access to soil water in deeper layers during the reproductive stage moreover gao et al 2016 argued that high water status at deep layers reduces soil strength higher bulk density table 1 and more roots may potentially penetrate to explore water therefore it implies that rb modifies soil water condition in the deeper soil layers than f fig 4 nevertheless f system improved root production compared to rb under rf condition particularly in the deepest 80 100 cm and shallowest 0 20 cm soil layers where longer roots were significantly produced fig 2 armstong et al 2015 and limon ortega and sayre 2012 reported that rainfall is a limiting factor for successful rb system in wheat and barley production they explicitly reported that water stress under rb is detrimental for this planting system which would affect the variables that mostly affect yield production such as efficient root growth to take up water robinson 1999 cooley et al 2007 indeed due to the rb configuration and the probable runoff over the beds towards the furrows rainfall would likely infiltrates into deeper layers rather than the upper soil layers which is unlikely in f where seed bed is flat higher root mass in the shallow depths of rb fig 2 would result in thicker and stronger root system fig 6 that facilitates deeper rooting potential for extracting deep stored water beneath the furrows or beds hodgkinson et al 2017 corneo et al 2017 therefore when configuring the rb system it is important to consider the soil moisture dynamics under rf condition because growth of barley under rf depends on using the growing season rainfall and stored water use beneath the beds cooper et al 1987 manschadi et al 2006 gregory 2006 4 2 root distribution and modeling conservative root growth through proliferation of roots in shallow depth is a crop strategy to capture most of the stored water in topsoil layer carvalho et al 2014 our results confirm the conservative root growth of barley where nearly 55 of the total root length distributed in the top 0 30 cm fig 5 other studies on barley confirmed that 67 76 of the total root of barley accumulated in the upper 0 30 cm gregory 2006 carvalho et al 2014 fan et al 2016 no previous study has determined β for barley under rb and f planting systems and diverse irrigation management higher β values in fi 0 973 and 0 971 in rb and f and rf 0 970 and 0 972 in rb and f revealed more uniform root distribution than di in both rb 0 969 and f 0 968 the reason might be that under fi root zone was fully wetted and the crops developed roots in the soil profile to take up water whereas in rf the crops extended roots to deep layers to extract water schenk 2008 proposed that root distributions are generally as shallow as possible to fulfill the required transpiration as shallow roots have more competitive benefits over the deep roots generally root densities will be high in the soil layers where larger soil water uptake happens schenk 2008 however mcculley et al 2004 proposed that deep roots are important for water uptake when the upper soil layers starts drying it is observed that di accumulated higher root fractions in the top 30 cm of rb than fi and rf fig 5 circled area but it accumulated higher root fractions in the deep layers of 50 80 cm of f than fi and rf this indicates that management of water and nutrient uptake under deficit irrigation scenarios should consider planting systems such that under rb more roots would concentrate in shallow depths but under f condition more would accumulate in deeper layers 4 3 specific root length our results showed that there was not a linear relationship between rld and rmd as was suggested by løes and gahoonia 2004 but instead rmd exponentially increased by rld with r2 0 83 fig 10 therefore srl was calculated to deal with the integrated effect of non linear relationship between rld and rmd under planting systems and soil water regimes srl becomes smaller thicker roots as soil becomes drier i e dsw increases fig 6 which means that under water stress conditions di and rf roots have been shorter and thicker smaller srl and under wet and fully irrigated conditions fi roots have been generally longer and thinner higher srl in fact higher srl i e thinner roots is more associated with more root branching gao et al 2016 and higher capacity for water uptake because of increased root surface area of contact with the surrounding soil eissenstat et al 2000 however crops with lower srl thicker roots in the topsoil layers are likely able to penetrate to deeper soil layers due to their improved root elongation ability materechera et al 1991 gao et al 2016 corneo et al 2017 which provide more opportunity for water uptake that is not accessible to other crops with thinner roots in the topsoil via the pre existing pores gao et al 2016 that demonstrates greater potential to access water and nutrient from deeper soil layers under drought and water stress conditions root growth parameters of rld and rmd responded differently and non linearly to soil water status bonachela 1996 pardales et al 2000 xue et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 ostonen et al 2007 man et al 2016 ahmadi et al 2017 this reveals that root traits have multidimensional growth conditions and therefore it is important to determine that how the root traits and their governing soil conditions are interrelated kramer walter et al 2016 this multidimensional analysis is observed in fig 7 that illustrates the effect of rld and fdaw of each 20 cm soil layer 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm on rmd the 3d lorentzian model fitted very well r2 0 89 se 0 271 mg cm 3 to the measured data to our knowledge this study presents the first multidimensional data analysis on the root growth parameters of barley subject to soil water status corresponding to different soil layers the lower fdaw that occurred at deeper soil layers mostly at 60 100 cm fig 3 is attributed to lower rmd fig 7 however more or less irrespective of the experimental treatments but at higher fdaw that occurred at top soil layers the variations of rmd in different treatments were strongly governed by rld and fdaw this would imply that higher rmd would be observed at the soil layers that root were active for water uptake fig 3 which is obviously correlated to rld soon 1988 kumar et al 2015 cai et al 2017 further analysis on fig 7 depicts that for any specific rld the rmd increases up to ca fdaw 0 77 and then beyond the value of 0 77 as a threshold rmd would decrease again this indicates that the thickest roots were possibly produced where ca 77 of the available soil water was extracted that interestingly corresponds to soil layers of 40 60 cm in the rf 60 80 cm in the di and 80 100 cm in the fi treatments this shows that under water stress conditions barley crop intends to invest higher root production as shallow as possible that supports schenk 2008 these findings indicate the lowest srl thickest roots at fdaw 0 77 which implies that barley crops would translocate the assimilate to the roots z physiological costs as soil becomes drier down to the limit of fdaw 0 77 these arguments reveal that the barley show more flexibility to construct their specific root trait with a variety of different other traits and environmental combinations that may improve their fitness under diverse environmental conditions kramer walter et al 2016 4 4 grain yield and root characteristics grain yield correlated better with rld than rmd fig 8 grain yield production is basically related to water uptake and water uptake is also partially attributed to rld zhang and hu 2013 however a reason of fair relationship between grain yield and rmd is that root mass generally declines after anthesis particularly in the shallow soil layers but rld remains constant probably due to new root development brown 2007 however in this study there were only three irrigation managements of fi di and rf because di treatment did not generally affect grain yield production compared to fi p 0 05 data not shown it is concluded that soil water regime in di should have been in the range of recommended management allowed soil water depletion of around 0 5 0 65 simpson and siddique 1994 hanson et al 2000 plants that were under fi or the imposed di level fell within the range of management allowed soil water depletion fig 7 maintained high grain yields according to fig 8 it is observed that as far as rld was above 8 cm cm 3 high grain yields were maintained and there was neither mild nor severe water stress grain yields in f100 f60 and rb60 were not significant at p 0 05 but rb100 was significantly higher than these ones although extended root systems are believed to potentially increase accessibility to water and nutrients mcculley et al 2004 schenk 2008 our results showed that not only a very extended root system might not necessarily result in increased yield but also an optimized smaller root system would induce higher yield lambers et al 2002 lynch 2013 bishopp and lynch 2015 in a recent study aziz et al 2017 reported that reduction of root system size rld and rmd was associated to higher grain yield of wheat they attributed this to increasing the efficiency of the modern root system in capturing resources instead of vigorous root system therefore excess and luxury allocation of aboveground assimilates to root system just increases root size and would eventually reduce yield palta and watt 2009 palta et al 2011 grain yield did not change as srl increased in rf treatments fig 9 it is probably related to the role of longer roots development i e the ratio of root length to root mass increased to aid in extracting soil water therefore increased srl in rf could prevent yield loss by investment in developing longer and thinner roots for branching and proliferation for water uptake and partially alleviating water stress a similar finding has been also reported for the australia rainfed wheat aziz et al 2017 as modern wheat cultivars had significantly higher srl roots longer and thinner roots than those of old cultivars because thinner roots have higher access to water and nutrient uptake melino et al 2015 however and in contrast to the rf grain yield decreased in the irrigated conditions as srl increased though the relationship was significant at p 0 09 fig 9 although this relationship was not strong this could be partially explained by mobilization and translocation of shoot dry matter to belowground to increase root length this hypothesis needs more investigations 5 conclusion this study showed that raised bed planting system rb significantly produced higher root length density rld and root mass density rmd than flat planting system f under full irrigation fi but the differences between rb and f became weaker as water stress developed root development was considerable under all the experimental treatments and rld was at least 1 cm cm 3 at 90 100 cm soil depth specific root length srl and the depleted soil water were exponentially correlated and srl decreased as soil became drier which implied that under water stress conditions roots were shorter in length and thicker in size and had lower srl grain yield was obviously correlated with rld the data showed that the barley cultivar in this study produced a vigorous and very large amount of roots ca 2 16 cm cm 3 in the irrigated plots and ca 1 8 cm cm 3 in the rainfed plots in the whole root zone of 0 100 cm under all irrigation treatments and planting systems indicating that excess amount of root might have been produced considering rld 1 cm cm 3 as the threshold value recommended for water uptake of cereals luxury root production might have negatively affected grain yield because of more carbon investment and assimilate translocation to root instead of grains therefore under water limited conditions it is important to consider growing barley crops that do not invest extensively on root production but rather produce fewer roots but more grains acknowledgements this research was

11328,understanding root growth characteristics is important for on farm water management the objectives of this study were to determine the root growth of barley under different irrigation water managements and planting systems raised bed rb and conventional flat f planting systems subjected to full fi and deficit irrigations di managements and rainfed rf conditions were applied the fi addressed 100 crop evapotranspiration et according to the penman monteith equation while the di received 60 fi and the rf just received precipitation in the rb system three rows of crops were grown on 60 cm wide beds that were 80 cm center to center apart the height of each bed was 20 cm in the f system there was no land configuration in total there were nine barley rows separated 30 cm from each other in the f and rb systems the f and rb systems were irrigated as basin irrigation and furrow irrigation respectively root growth traits and characteristics soil water depletion and the total grain yields from the middle three rows were assessed the rb significantly outperformed f in terms of root production under fi however this difference between rb and f was not significant under water stress conditions di and rf the specific root length srl decreased as soil water content decreased in the water stressed treatments through elevated soil water deficit progression after imposing irrigation treatments root development was considerable under all irrigation treatments and planting systems because rld was at least 1 cm cm 3 at the 90 100 cm soil depth which is recommended as the threshold for potential water uptake and indicates that the barley fasih cultivar produced more than 1 cm cm 3 of root length over the entire effective rooting zone of 0 100 cm under all experimental treatments this might imply excess root production further analysis revealed that total grain yields were correlated with the rld nevertheless the excess root growth might have negatively affected grain yield because more carbon and assimilate were translocated to the root system instead of grains under water limited conditions it is thought to be important for barley crops that do not produce very large amount of roots but rather produce less roots that do not negatively suppress grain yield keywords root length density root mass density specific root length irrigation managements planting systems barley grain yield 1 introduction roots are considered as the main components of the second green revolution for increasing crop production particularly in regions where fresh water resources are limited and soil nutrient reserve is poor lynch 2011 understanding the complexities of root growth distribution and function across plant species and soil characteristics has been a challenging field of research in spite of the highly recognized importance of roots on crop production skaggs and shouse 2008 gregory and kirkegaard 2017 bishopp and lynch 2015 suggested that while the substantial increases in crop yields in the 20th century has been attributed to application of chemical fertilizers and management of the aboveground of the plants more attention should be paid to manage belowground of the plants i e roots to address food demand in the 21st century in arid and semi arid regions where fresh water resources are limited and knowledge of root growth behavior helps for improved irrigation water management and water productivity lv et al 2010 ahmadi et al 2017 in these areas conservative agricultural practices and planting systems are recommended to prevent excess water use and optimize soil water content however soil water uptake under different soil moisture regimes is a function of root growth where under unfavorable soil water conditions plants improve their ability to increase water uptake by extensive root growth and proliferation in the soil matrix passioura 1983 palta and watt 2009 in this regard spatial and temporal variations of soil water content soil texture and soil structure have major impacts on root growth and distribution in soil matrix dexter 2004 ahmadi et al 2011 root length density rld cm root per cm3 soil and root mass density rmd g dry root per cm3 soil traits are the common root properties extensively assessed and reported e g carvalho et al 2014 white et al 2015 ahmadi et al 2011 2017 when plants are exposed to water stress higher root growth implies substantial metabolic costs of soil exploration by root system lambers et al 2002 lynch and ho 2005 this metabolic cost implies a trade off between root growth to capture water on the one hand i e rld and translocation of more assimilates to the root i e rmd rather than the shoot on the other hand this is a trade off in root response to soil water variations and specific root length srl m root per g dry root mass is a widely used trait to study root length and size in soil under this trade off eissenstat 1991 in fact higher srl means longer and thinner roots and vice versa corneo et al 2017 indicating more root proliferation compared to lower srl among the conservative agricultural practices raised bed rb planting system is implemented worldwide to improve productivity and reduction of irrigation water requirement sayre et al 2005 zhang et al 2007 he et al 2015 in the rb system plants are grown on narrow raised beds which range in width from 45 to 100 cm sayre and hobbs 2004 depending on wheel track width of the tractor or harvester he et al 2008 rb has been introduced as a suitable alternative for rainfed systems in the arid and semi arid regions because they could hold rainfall prevent runoff and promote water infiltration govaerts et al 2007 since barley is grown under irrigated or rainfed systems in the semi arid conditions in iran suffering from fresh water resources and erratic precipitation rojhani shirazi and ahmadi 2016 it is an idea to determine how barley grows under rb conditions and whether rb would change the soil water status and barley root growth characteristics which would affect total grain yield indeed barley is a dominant crop in many regions of iran and according to the recent data survey ministry of agriculture jihad 2016 it is the second widely cultivated cereal ca 21 after wheat ca 70 as fresh water resources are however very limited in most parts of iran barley is mainly cultivated as rainfed ca 105 700 ha compared to irrigated system ca 70 500 ha in the recent decades groundwater resources as the dominant irrigation water source of the fars province have been extensively depleted due to severe and long term drought conditions therefore it is needed to plan for growing crops that are drought tolerant and could use rainfall more effectively than other crops barley is the crop that is suitable for such water scarcity conditions based on our recent study which revealed that many parts of the fars province are suitable for extensive production of barley compared to wheat rojhani shirazi and ahmadi 2016 so far the majority of the rb studies have focused on yield and agronomic responses of the field crops mainly wheat maize and rice and soil physical characteristics sayre et al 2005 he et al 2008 2012 however too little is known about the effect of rb on root growth of barley crop though gorny and patyna 1984 and lugg et al 1988 studied the root growth of barley crops subject to irrigation levels there are a few studies which briefly reported that rb improved root growth of wheat on the beds he et al 2008 2015 kong et al 2010 but there are no detailed studies of root growth under rb to our knowledge in addition no detailed report is available on the effect of rb on barley that is a common crop in arid and semi arid regions due to its greater tolerance to drought stress compared to wheat since knowledge of root distribution pattern under irrigated and rainfed conditions is important for accurate water management therefore the objectives of this study were to determine the root growth of winter barley under rb and conventional flat f planting systems subject to different irrigation managements and rainfed conditions the hypothesis was that the rb and f would show different root growth under different water management that eventually affect grain yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 site specification a field experiment was conducted during the growing season 2013 2014 at the experimental farm of faculty of agriculture shiraz university shiraz iran the farm is located at 52 32 e and 29 36 n and 1810 m above mean sea level the study area has a warm climate with annual average rainfall of about 386 mm ahmadi et al 2017 the required meteorological data are collected from a nearby station located ca 20 m from the research field fig 1 illustrates the meteorological data during the growing season table 1 summarizes the physical and chemical properties of the cultivated soil ahmadi et al 2017 barzegari et al 2017 2 2 experiment details and treatments a factorial experiment in randomized complete block design rcbd with four replications was conducted the locally bred barley cultivar fasih was used in the experiment the experimental plots were 2 7 m 2 7 m and plot borders were separated by ca 2 m wide protection area to prevent any interference between treatments in total there were 24 plots barley was seeded on november 18 2013 at the rate of 200 kg ha 1 in each plot in nine rows the experimental factors were the irrigation treatments in three levels and the planting systems in two levels the three irrigation treatments were full irrigation fi that addressed 100 crop evapotranspiration et deficit irrigation di that received 60 fi and no irrigation as rainfed rf irrigation treatment started on march 18 2014 122 dap days after planting and was repeated every 10 days until last irrigation on may 31 2014 195 dap however the fi and di were equally irrigated 81 mm on december 5 2013 17 dap to ensure uniform seedlings and crop establishment the rf treatments were only rainfed throughout the whole growing season first rain occurred just a day after sowing and continued for 4 days that summed up 38 mm this caused uniform germination and crop establishment in all plots irrigation requirement was determined by calculating crop evapotranspiration etc based on the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto equation allen et al 1998 and the locally determined kc values of 0 6 1 2 and 0 2 for the initial middle and end growth stages of barley hashemi tame 2013 as etc eto kc in each irrigation event the preceding 10 day etc was summed as the irrigation depth for the fi the volume of irrigation water was determined based on the plot area and was applied using a hand held water meter in total the fi and di treatments received 824 and 527 mm during the growing season and rf treatment received 225 mm that is the total rainfall during the growing season the planting systems were raised bed rb and conventional flat f in the rb system there were three 60 cm wide beds that were 80 cm center to center apart the height of each bed measured from bottom of the furrows was 20 cm in total there were four furrows that were used for irrigation on top of each bed three rows of barley were planted there were nine rows of barley separated 30 cm from each other in the f and rb system due to the plot configurations of f system where there were no ridges and furrows the f was irrigated as basin irrigation but rb was irrigated as furrow irrigation during the growing season 150 kg n ha 1 was applied in three events before seeding 21 kg n ha 1 was applied as ammonium phosphate 21 46 0 npk second and third n application at the rate of 100 kg n ha 1 and 29 kg n ha 1 as urea 46 0 0 npk were applied on march 5 and march 18 2014 2 3 soil water content soil water content swc was gravimetrically measured seven times after starting the irrigation treatments in the center of plot between two plant rows and in 20 cm depth intervals down to 100 cm that resulted in five measurements per soil profile measurements were made one day before irrigation event in the two replications of each treatment gravimetric swc was converted to volumetric swc m3 m 3 by multiplying soil bulk density table 1 depleted soil water dsw was then calculated as the difference between the volumetric swc and the volumetric amount of water held at field capacity fc m3 m 3 when required to pool the measurement days for further analysis the dsws of the seven days were averaged the fraction of depleted available water fdaw m3 m 3 for any soil layer was calculated as eq 1 for each measurement day the fdaw values were then averaged over the seven measurement days for each soil layer for further analysis 1 f d a w d d s w d a w d f c d s w c d f c d p w p d where d represents any of the soil depth interval of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm 2 4 root sampling and grain yield measurements at the final harvest on june 26 2014 222 dap the 1 meter length of the three middle rows from each plot were harvested for total grain yields determination on 223 dap soil cores were collected for root studies a hand driven auger with 6 cm diameter and 100 cm long was used for soil sampling on one plant row in all 24 plots after pulling out the auger the soil column was divided into ten 10 cm section and each one was placed in a separate plastic bag and stored at 6 c in a freezer for later analysis in total 240 root samples were collected the soil samples were submerged in a large pot for 24 h then the roots were separated from the soaked soil by gently stirring the mixture in the pot the floating roots were collected in a 250 μm mesh size sieve to ensure that no root was left and trapped in the soil mixture additional water was added frequently and the preceding root collection procedure was repeated until no more floating roots were observed ahmadi et al 2011 2017 after separating the living roots from the organic debris and dead roots in an appropriate tray the individual fresh root samples were collected by a 250 μm mesh size sieve the fresh root were placed in a small plastic bottle and preserved by adding 10 acetic acid solution to the bottles ahmadi et al 2011 2017 the samples were again stored at 6 c for further root analysis the root length cm was determined by the newman method 1966 and then converted to rld cm cm 3 based on the associated soil volume 242 74 cm3 for 10 cm soil section after determining the root length the root sample was oven dried at 60 c for 24 h to calculate root mass density rmd mg cm 3 as the ratio of root dry mass mg precision 0 1 mg to the associated soil sample volume 242 74 cm3 for 10 cm soil section the srl was finally calculated as the ratio of root length and dry root mass m g 1 2 5 statistical analyses data were subjected to the two way analysis of variance anova using the proc glm procedure of sas software version 9 0 sas institute 2002 to test the statistical effect of irrigation treatments and planting systems on root growth parameters based on the guidelines given by gomez and gomez 1986 for a factorial experiment as rcbd in four replications the least significant difference lsd at the probability level of p 0 05 was used for the mean comparisons the r software r core team 2017 version 3 4 1 and the nls package were also used to fit the non linear equations to the data the root distribution data were fitted to the gerwitz and page 1974 model as r l d α e x p γ d where d is the soil depth cm corresponding to rld cm cm 3 and α and γ are the fitted parameters indicating that a larger α value refers to a larger rld in the upper soil layer and the lower γ value indicates the tendency for deeper root growth cumulative rld fraction was calculated as the fraction of the total rld rld100 in each soil depth d and was fitted to the gale and grigal 1987 model as δ 1 β d where δ is the cumulative rld fraction r l d d r l d 100 from the soil surface to the depth d cm and β is the fitted parameter known as extinction coefficient of root distribution the 3d lorentzian model eq 1 was fitted to the data of rld rmd and fdaw as eq 2 2 z j 1 x x 0 k 2 1 y y 0 l 2 where z is the rmd mg cm 3 x is the fdaw and y is the rld cm cm 3 the parameters j k l x0 and y0 are fitted parameters and are 216 28 0 19 0 78 0 77 and 21 59 respectively the logistic model eq 3 was fitted to the data of grain yield and rld and rmd the equation is as follows 3 f t 1 e x p s 0 s r where f is the total grain yield mg ha 1 t r and s0 are the fitted parameters and s is the weighted average of rld cm cm 3 or rmd mg cm 3 over the 0 100 cm rooting zone computed by eq 4 ahmadi et al 2017 4 r l d r l d i w i w i where i 10 20 30 100 and w i 1 i this weighing approach ensures proper weighting to the rld or rmd of the shallower soil layers that contribute more to water uptake and crop yield production janz and stonier 1995 steduto et al 2012 kumar et al 2015 ahmadi et al 2017 3 results 3 1 root length density fig 2 shows rld distribution in different water managements and planting systems in the fi the rld in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm reached to ca 16 and ca 12 cm cm 3 in rb and f respectively rb produced significantly higher rld than f in fi particularly in the 0 70 cm of soil profile that accounts for almost two or three times higher rld than f the rld at the deepest layer of 90 100 cm was almost 3 and 1 5 cm cm 3 in rb and f respectively which means rb doubled root length in the deepest layer notably rld of rb was at least 6 cm cm 3 in 60 70 cm soil profile that was much larger than the reported in depth rld in the previous studies on barley soon 1988 in the di root growth pattern was however different from fi although rb had significantly higher rld than f at the top 0 20 cm rld had no significant difference below the 0 20 cm soil depth except at 60 70 cm and 90 100 cm soil layers this implies that planting systems might not affect root length below 0 20 cm soil layer under water stress managements therefore rb shows its main effect on root length under well watered condition over the top rooting zone rld decreased sharply below 0 20 cm under di which varied between ca 6 8 cm cm 3 at 20 30 cm and ca 2 cm cm 3 at 90 100 cm depth however statistically comparing fi and di in fig 2 it is clear that the significant differences between these two irrigation managements were mostly observed in the 30 80 cm soil layer where the planting systems showed their major effects on rld in this 30 80 cm rooting zone the rb and f under fi showed significant differences but under di they were not significant except at 60 70 cm this region of soil profile is where soil water will be mostly depleted and roots are active fig 3 due to their relations with high rld soon 1988 bonachela 1996 carvalho et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 cai et al 2017 hartmann et al 2017 in this regard fig 4 shows the depleted soil water dsw in different irrigation treatments and planting systems across different days after planting dap it is clear that the dsw of di increased during the latest growth period compared to fi both figs 3 and 4 imply that the barley roots experienced higher water stress in the f than rb under all irrigation managements based on higher depleted soil water interestingly root length distribution in the rf was obviously different from fi and di in contrast to fi and di the highest rld was observed in f ca 8 cm cm 3 compared to rb ca 6 cm cm 3 under rf condition f had significantly higher rld than rb in the top 0 20 soil layer below which the differences were not significant except at 90 100 cm depth where f had significantly higher rld than rb the rlds in rf ranged between ca 3 4 cm cm 3 in the 20 30 cm and ca 1 2 cm cm 3 in the 90 100 cm depth that shows a slight change in rld over the rooting zone 3 2 cumulative rld distribution fig 5 shows the cumulative rld distribution with depth in rb and f in different water regimes it is clear that the relationship between cumulative rld and depth is exponential on average ca 55 and 75 of the total root length distributed in the top 0 30 and 0 50 cm respectively it means that cumulative rld distribution with depth of this barley cultivar was fairly conservative across all planting systems and irrigation managements indicating that higher root fractions are mostly observed in the top 0 50 cm of soil profile the fitted β values of the gale and grigal 1987 model for the fi di and rf under rb and f are 0 973 0 969 0 970 and 0 971 0 968 0 972 respectively carvalho et al 2014 reported β values of 0 976 and 0 982 for barley and wheat respectively and king et al 2003 reported β 0 970 for wheat β is an index of the shape of rooting distribution and greater β means a more uniform root distribution with depth or a greater proportion of roots at soil depth lower β indicates greater proportion of root near the soil surface jackson et al 1996 therefore it is observed that di has lower β values which indicate the di tendency to accumulate more roots in the upper soli layers 3 3 root mass density in the fi the rmd varied between ca 5 mg cm 3 and 0 1 mg cm 3 and between ca 2 mg cm 3 and 0 03 mg cm 3 in the top 0 10 cm and deep 90 100 cm layers of rb respectively fig 2 overall rb had significantly higher rmd than f in the majority of soil depths under fi the major differences were observed in the top 0 70 cm where root mass differences between the planting systems were considerable deeper than 60 70 cm soil layer the differences were small though they were significant in the di the rb produced significantly higher root mass than f in the deep layers of 50 100 cm while in the upper layers 0 50 cm the differences were not significant except at 10 20 cm this shows that rb produced more vigorous root system than f in the deeper layers of the di which indicates under water saving irrigation management the rb tends to produce stronger root system and invests more carbon cost in the deeper layers to extract water it is also noteworthy that in the rb root mass of di ca 2 mg cm 3 in the top 0 10 cm considerably reduced compared with fi ca 5 mg cm 3 however this root mass behavior was not observed in the f system this means that root mass of the topsoil layer of 0 10 cm was highly affected by the planting system such that rb outperformed f in the rf however the rmd pattern was completely different from di the significant differences between f and rb were only observed at topsoil layer of 0 30 cm where rb significantly produced stronger roots than f these interesting differences between di as water saving irrigation management and rf as no irrigation management show that root production in the rb and f might basically depend on soil water regime and its distribution which consequently affect root mass production however f suppresses root mass production in the top soil layers of 0 40 cm than rb 3 4 rld rmd srl and yield relationships the relationship between dsw and srl is illustrated in fig 6 srl exponentially decreased with dsw this means shows that when dsw 0 and there is no water stress srl of ca 555 m g 1 is expected as higher srl indicates thinner and longer root vs lower srl that indicates thicker and shorter roots it is concluded that roots became thicker sharply as soil water deficit increased fig 7 shows rmd as a function of rld and fdaw this relationship depends on the regions where roots may experience no water stress and water stress each point in fig 7 represents the corresponding measurement in each 20 cm soil depth interval 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm so for each treatment five data points is available such relationship has not been reported before to the best of our knowledge fig 8 illustrates the functional inter relationships between measured total grain yield and its corresponding weighted average rld or rmd in each plot eq 3 the logistic model fitted quite well to rld r2 0 97 and fairly well to rmd r2 0 61 the logistic model has been widely used to fit to the yield data subject to irrigation water management scenarios sepaskhah et al 2011 mahbod et al 2014 and to the best of our knowledge no previous study has been already published to describe the relationship between grain yield and root traits of barley using the logistic model in order to increase the accuracy of regression fitting the average grain yields of the replications was not used in the regression the average grain yield and the associated standard errors se for fi di and rf in rb and f are 4 3 0 041 4 1 0 048 0 58 0 048 and 4 0 0 15 3 9 0 15 0 56 0 10 respectively the relationship between srl and grain yield of each plot is shown in fig 9 the data are categorized as the irrigated fi and di and rf data there is no relationship between srl and grain yield in the rf condition but a poor r2 0 16 p 0 09 relationship is observed between the grain yield and srl under the irrigated conditions however it was expected that srl would show a good correlation with grain yield gahoonia and nielsen 2004 paula and pausas 2011 kramer walter et al 2016 corneo et al 2017 but unexpectedly the relationship was very poor this implies that the root length rld or root mass rmd would have solely relationship with grain yield fig 8 but if the root length would be normalized with the root mass this correlation disappears 4 discussion 4 1 root growth the barley cultivar in this study was genetically able to produce large amount of root in the top soil layer though generally in cereals rld of topsoil reaches 2 10 cm cm 3 hoad et al 2001 manske and vlek 2002 or 5 10 cm cm 3 in temperate cereal crops gregory and kirkegaard 2017 the highest rld ca 16 cm cm 3 under irrigated conditions fi and di was observed in rb compared with f ca 12 cm cm 3 fig 2 however under rainfed condition f produced longer roots than rb in the shallow layers these apparent differences show that planting systems have distinct effects on root production under different irrigation managements generally longer roots in shallow depths are associated with higher water and nutrient uptake gao et al 2016 hodgkinson et al 2017 rb proved greater tendency to produce more vigorous root system than f which is attributed to improved soil physical conditions such as lower bulk density and greater soil water content he et al 2008 2015 kong et al 2010 sayre and hobbs 2004 increased area to absorb solar radiation and higher soil temperature zhang et al 2007 sharratt 1991 he et al 2008 2012 and improved microclimate conditions in the canopy leading to better growth conditions fahong et al 2005 indeed better soil water status figs 3 and 4 in the rb compared to the f implies a favorable root growth media in rb rb produced more roots in deep soil layers 70 100 cm under water stressed condition di than f this means that rb induces a better root growth condition under deficit irrigation to explore water in deeper soil layers than f manschadi et al 2006 described adaptations of root growth of wheat and barley to cope with soil water limitations through deep root system to increases access to soil water in deeper layers during the reproductive stage moreover gao et al 2016 argued that high water status at deep layers reduces soil strength higher bulk density table 1 and more roots may potentially penetrate to explore water therefore it implies that rb modifies soil water condition in the deeper soil layers than f fig 4 nevertheless f system improved root production compared to rb under rf condition particularly in the deepest 80 100 cm and shallowest 0 20 cm soil layers where longer roots were significantly produced fig 2 armstong et al 2015 and limon ortega and sayre 2012 reported that rainfall is a limiting factor for successful rb system in wheat and barley production they explicitly reported that water stress under rb is detrimental for this planting system which would affect the variables that mostly affect yield production such as efficient root growth to take up water robinson 1999 cooley et al 2007 indeed due to the rb configuration and the probable runoff over the beds towards the furrows rainfall would likely infiltrates into deeper layers rather than the upper soil layers which is unlikely in f where seed bed is flat higher root mass in the shallow depths of rb fig 2 would result in thicker and stronger root system fig 6 that facilitates deeper rooting potential for extracting deep stored water beneath the furrows or beds hodgkinson et al 2017 corneo et al 2017 therefore when configuring the rb system it is important to consider the soil moisture dynamics under rf condition because growth of barley under rf depends on using the growing season rainfall and stored water use beneath the beds cooper et al 1987 manschadi et al 2006 gregory 2006 4 2 root distribution and modeling conservative root growth through proliferation of roots in shallow depth is a crop strategy to capture most of the stored water in topsoil layer carvalho et al 2014 our results confirm the conservative root growth of barley where nearly 55 of the total root length distributed in the top 0 30 cm fig 5 other studies on barley confirmed that 67 76 of the total root of barley accumulated in the upper 0 30 cm gregory 2006 carvalho et al 2014 fan et al 2016 no previous study has determined β for barley under rb and f planting systems and diverse irrigation management higher β values in fi 0 973 and 0 971 in rb and f and rf 0 970 and 0 972 in rb and f revealed more uniform root distribution than di in both rb 0 969 and f 0 968 the reason might be that under fi root zone was fully wetted and the crops developed roots in the soil profile to take up water whereas in rf the crops extended roots to deep layers to extract water schenk 2008 proposed that root distributions are generally as shallow as possible to fulfill the required transpiration as shallow roots have more competitive benefits over the deep roots generally root densities will be high in the soil layers where larger soil water uptake happens schenk 2008 however mcculley et al 2004 proposed that deep roots are important for water uptake when the upper soil layers starts drying it is observed that di accumulated higher root fractions in the top 30 cm of rb than fi and rf fig 5 circled area but it accumulated higher root fractions in the deep layers of 50 80 cm of f than fi and rf this indicates that management of water and nutrient uptake under deficit irrigation scenarios should consider planting systems such that under rb more roots would concentrate in shallow depths but under f condition more would accumulate in deeper layers 4 3 specific root length our results showed that there was not a linear relationship between rld and rmd as was suggested by løes and gahoonia 2004 but instead rmd exponentially increased by rld with r2 0 83 fig 10 therefore srl was calculated to deal with the integrated effect of non linear relationship between rld and rmd under planting systems and soil water regimes srl becomes smaller thicker roots as soil becomes drier i e dsw increases fig 6 which means that under water stress conditions di and rf roots have been shorter and thicker smaller srl and under wet and fully irrigated conditions fi roots have been generally longer and thinner higher srl in fact higher srl i e thinner roots is more associated with more root branching gao et al 2016 and higher capacity for water uptake because of increased root surface area of contact with the surrounding soil eissenstat et al 2000 however crops with lower srl thicker roots in the topsoil layers are likely able to penetrate to deeper soil layers due to their improved root elongation ability materechera et al 1991 gao et al 2016 corneo et al 2017 which provide more opportunity for water uptake that is not accessible to other crops with thinner roots in the topsoil via the pre existing pores gao et al 2016 that demonstrates greater potential to access water and nutrient from deeper soil layers under drought and water stress conditions root growth parameters of rld and rmd responded differently and non linearly to soil water status bonachela 1996 pardales et al 2000 xue et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 ostonen et al 2007 man et al 2016 ahmadi et al 2017 this reveals that root traits have multidimensional growth conditions and therefore it is important to determine that how the root traits and their governing soil conditions are interrelated kramer walter et al 2016 this multidimensional analysis is observed in fig 7 that illustrates the effect of rld and fdaw of each 20 cm soil layer 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm on rmd the 3d lorentzian model fitted very well r2 0 89 se 0 271 mg cm 3 to the measured data to our knowledge this study presents the first multidimensional data analysis on the root growth parameters of barley subject to soil water status corresponding to different soil layers the lower fdaw that occurred at deeper soil layers mostly at 60 100 cm fig 3 is attributed to lower rmd fig 7 however more or less irrespective of the experimental treatments but at higher fdaw that occurred at top soil layers the variations of rmd in different treatments were strongly governed by rld and fdaw this would imply that higher rmd would be observed at the soil layers that root were active for water uptake fig 3 which is obviously correlated to rld soon 1988 kumar et al 2015 cai et al 2017 further analysis on fig 7 depicts that for any specific rld the rmd increases up to ca fdaw 0 77 and then beyond the value of 0 77 as a threshold rmd would decrease again this indicates that the thickest roots were possibly produced where ca 77 of the available soil water was extracted that interestingly corresponds to soil layers of 40 60 cm in the rf 60 80 cm in the di and 80 100 cm in the fi treatments this shows that under water stress conditions barley crop intends to invest higher root production as shallow as possible that supports schenk 2008 these findings indicate the lowest srl thickest roots at fdaw 0 77 which implies that barley crops would translocate the assimilate to the roots z physiological costs as soil becomes drier down to the limit of fdaw 0 77 these arguments reveal that the barley show more flexibility to construct their specific root trait with a variety of different other traits and environmental combinations that may improve their fitness under diverse environmental conditions kramer walter et al 2016 4 4 grain yield and root characteristics grain yield correlated better with rld than rmd fig 8 grain yield production is basically related to water uptake and water uptake is also partially attributed to rld zhang and hu 2013 however a reason of fair relationship between grain yield and rmd is that root mass generally declines after anthesis particularly in the shallow soil layers but rld remains constant probably due to new root development brown 2007 however in this study there were only three irrigation managements of fi di and rf because di treatment did not generally affect grain yield production compared to fi p 0 05 data not shown it is concluded that soil water regime in di should have been in the range of recommended management allowed soil water depletion of around 0 5 0 65 simpson and siddique 1994 hanson et al 2000 plants that were under fi or the imposed di level fell within the range of management allowed soil water depletion fig 7 maintained high grain yields according to fig 8 it is observed that as far as rld was above 8 cm cm 3 high grain yields were maintained and there was neither mild nor severe water stress grain yields in f100 f60 and rb60 were not significant at p 0 05 but rb100 was significantly higher than these ones although extended root systems are believed to potentially increase accessibility to water and nutrients mcculley et al 2004 schenk 2008 our results showed that not only a very extended root system might not necessarily result in increased yield but also an optimized smaller root system would induce higher yield lambers et al 2002 lynch 2013 bishopp and lynch 2015 in a recent study aziz et al 2017 reported that reduction of root system size rld and rmd was associated to higher grain yield of wheat they attributed this to increasing the efficiency of the modern root system in capturing resources instead of vigorous root system therefore excess and luxury allocation of aboveground assimilates to root system just increases root size and would eventually reduce yield palta and watt 2009 palta et al 2011 grain yield did not change as srl increased in rf treatments fig 9 it is probably related to the role of longer roots development i e the ratio of root length to root mass increased to aid in extracting soil water therefore increased srl in rf could prevent yield loss by investment in developing longer and thinner roots for branching and proliferation for water uptake and partially alleviating water stress a similar finding has been also reported for the australia rainfed wheat aziz et al 2017 as modern wheat cultivars had significantly higher srl roots longer and thinner roots than those of old cultivars because thinner roots have higher access to water and nutrient uptake melino et al 2015 however and in contrast to the rf grain yield decreased in the irrigated conditions as srl increased though the relationship was significant at p 0 09 fig 9 although this relationship was not strong this could be partially explained by mobilization and translocation of shoot dry matter to belowground to increase root length this hypothesis needs more investigations 5 conclusion this study showed that raised bed planting system rb significantly produced higher root length density rld and root mass density rmd than flat planting system f under full irrigation fi but the differences between rb and f became weaker as water stress developed root development was considerable under all the experimental treatments and rld was at least 1 cm cm 3 at 90 100 cm soil depth specific root length srl and the depleted soil water were exponentially correlated and srl decreased as soil became drier which implied that under water stress conditions roots were shorter in length and thicker in size and had lower srl grain yield was obviously correlated with rld the data showed that the barley cultivar in this study produced a vigorous and very large amount of roots ca 2 16 cm cm 3 in the irrigated plots and ca 1 8 cm cm 3 in the rainfed plots in the whole root zone of 0 100 cm under all irrigation treatments and planting systems indicating that excess amount of root might have been produced considering rld 1 cm cm 3 as the threshold value recommended for water uptake of cereals luxury root production might have negatively affected grain yield because of more carbon investment and assimilate translocation to root instead of grains therefore under water limited conditions it is important to consider growing barley crops that do not invest extensively on root production but rather produce fewer roots but more grains acknowledgements this research was

11329,although the impacts of climate change on crop yield and production in china have been studied the potential impacts on nitrate leaching are less well known in this study we considered how climate change and crop genotypes with different n uptake capacities could affect soil water drainage nitrate leaching and grain yield under currently optimized irrigation and fertilization practices in the spring maize system of northwest china after testing the performance of the whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator model a total number of 420 simulations spanning representative climate projections 2036 2065 genotypes and time spans led to three key findings first the projected climate changes had no significant effects on soil water drainage and thus no impact on nitrate leaching because the latter was primarily influenced by drainage second the effects of genotype changes on reducing nitrate leaching via increasing n uptake were marginal over the whole growth period again because these had no significant effect on soil water drainage finally the projected yield reduction around 6 5 occurred only in the hottest climate scenario rcp8 5 in which transpiration was

although modern crop science has increased the grain yield per unit of applied n research has yet to fully consider how crop varieties with different n uptake capacity could reduce nitrate leaching in

while a field lysimeter study conducted by carey et al 2017 used two crops with different n uptake capacities to test their effect on nitrate leaching their results showed that crop type could

the effect of different agricultural management practices on crop yield and n use efficiency li et al 2015 liang et al 2018 2016b as nitrate leaching is affected by both water flow and n transformation the whcns model is suitable for characterizing the response of nitrate leaching to climate and genotype change under the study area s agricultural cropping system a particularly strong point of the model is its detailed description of soil ea crop transpiration ta soil water movement soil temperature soil inorganic n immobilization in biomass nitrification and crop growth liang et al 2016a this allows the whcns model to analyze the effects of various agricultural management practices such as sowing date crop rotation irrigation and fertilizer application on water and n dynamics along with crop growth as previous studies have described the model s main framework and presented its parameters along with a sensitivity analysis liang et al 2016a we do not provide further detail here 2 3 model calibration evaluation and statistical analyses the whcns model was calibrated and evaluated using a two year 2008 2009 field experiment with different irrigation and fertilizer treatments presented in our previous study liang et al 2016b the basic crop parameters for modeling listed in table 2 were adopted from hu et al 2008 three statistical indices were used to evaluate model performance first the root mean square error rmse was used to summarize the total differences between observed and simulated values second the index of agreement 0 d 1 was used as a descriptive measure as it is both a relative and bounded measure willmott 1982 the closer the value of d is to 1 the better the model performance third a paired t test conducted by sas proc ttest software sas

glm software sas 2009 2 4 model development historical daily weather measurements from 1981 to 2010 were obtained from the china meteorological data service center point data set http data cma cn we used daily weather variables precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature humidity solar radiation for the current climate baseline years 1981 2010 and followed the methods described by lobell et al 2015 to develop the future climate we also used three general circulation models gcms bcc csm1 1 m csiro mk3 6 0 and hadgem2 ao that were proven by the fifth coupled model inter comparison project to be suitable for capturing temperature and precipitation tendency in china ying and chong hai 2012 two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used with a future climate time horizon of 2050 2036 2065 considering the data availability for climate scenarios we assumed that the weather inputs for modeling were the same as the baseline scenario except for temperature and precipitation the co2 concentration for the future climate was held at the baseline value 354 ppm the annual mean temperature and accumulative precipitation for the growing season are shown in fig 1 and the main model parameters are shown in table 2 for spring maize we used two levels of n uptake genotypes the current level n uptake 1 1 and an increased level n uptake 1 3 2 5 simulation design after comprehensively considering the impact of climate and genotype in our study area we defined 4 simulation runs combining varying amounts of climate and genotype change 3 gsms 2 climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2 genotypes 30 years one baseline 2 genotypes 30 years 420 the relevant field management practices are shown in table 3 practices such as irrigation and fertilization are time dependent and critical for water and nitrogen balance the scheme for spring maize in our case was adopted from hu et al 2008 and takes the timing of seeding irrigation and fertilization into consideration in the optimization criteria the pure nitrogen fertilizer rate is 138 n kg ha 1 which is within a reasonable range compared to the locally recommended fertilization rate for spring maize li et al 2012 the n that leached out of the root zone 120 cm could not be easily utilized by crops again however it is possible for upward soil water movement to carry nitrogen back to the root zone therefore we set the soil profile as 180 cm for a robust simulation based on the soil profile structure it was assumed that the nitrogen that moved beyond this depth could not be utilized by the crop the nitrogen content in the seeds was about 20 g kg 1 while the seeding rate in our case was 30 kg ha 1 the nitrogen input from seeds is less than 1 kg ha 1 and therefore ignored in the nitrogen balance calculations the initial soil water content and nitrate concentration in the soil profile was fixed for each climate genotype year run and the field management was fixed based on optimized recommendations defined by previous research liang et al 2016b although in reality such practices could change over time as plant breeding and agronomic research develops this approach was intended to provide a projected baseline for the future 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial model performance fig 2 shows the measured and simulated soil water content and nitrate concentration with calibrated model parameters using 2008 field data in general the simulated values agreed well with the measured values at all depths the model parameters were further evaluated using three statistical indices and 2009 field data table 4 the whcns model accurately predicted soil water content and nitrate concentration and produced good results with regard to biomass and grain yield these results demonstrated that the model is acceptable for simulating soil water n movement and crop growth in the study area so we proceeded to an analysis of the soil water drainage crop n uptake nitrate n leaching and yield with regard to changes in climate and genotype 3 2 climate change and genotype effects on water drainage and water balance changes in climate rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 did not affect soil water drainage significantly anova p value 0 0813 table 5 this result fell within our expectations because individual rainfall events in the region seldom exceed 10 mm under any climate scenario and total growing season precipitation only accounts for around 1 3 of the total water input therefore irrigation is the main driving factor for soil drainage as mentioned above our previous research in this area had aimed to minimize soil water drainage due to excessive irrigation while maintaining high crop yields liang et al 2016b the minor effect of climate change on soil water drainage indicates that the current water management methods are also appropriate in future climate scenarios in this context table 6 shows the modeling results across the 1 8 m soil profile under the different climate and genotype scenarios climate change had a significant effect on the soil water balance although there was more water input from increased precipitation and less net water loss from ea and drainage the soil water balance decreased with increasing temperature which we mainly attribute to reduced crop water consumption ta this result agreed with the finding of hawkins et al 2013 that the amount of ta was directly associated with temperature increase therefore in regard to the maximization of water use it is necessary to further investigate how to cope with decreased ta due to temperature increase we did not consider this in the current study the changes in genotype had no significant effect on soil water drainage water balance and other water related items an interactive effect between the genotype and these items was also not apparent table 5 the amount of drainage for each climate under the same genotype showed no difference demonstrating that crop n uptake procedure had a marginal effect on water dynamics drainage ea and ta in our cropping system under current optimized irrigation and fertilizer input levels table 6 this can be explained by the fact that these two genotypes are the same in most crop parameters except for in n uptake because these two genotypes share the same parameters within the leaf index their performance in terms of evapotranspiration and drainage are similar especially when n stress is low these results matched those of carey et al 2017 who reported that crops with different n uptake potential had no significant effect on soil water drainage when n supply was not limited 3 3 climate change and genotype effects on n uptake nitrate leaching and n balance the mean crop n uptake was significantly higher in the future genotype 311 6 kg n ha 1 as compared to the current genotype 271 3 kg n ha 1 anova p values 0 05 this increase was expected because the nmin minimum crop n concentrations when n is non limited a sensitive parameter for the process of n remobilization adopted from the daisy model hansen et al 1991 is critical for determining the final n concentrations at the end of crop growth this result was also in agreement with the finding of stockle and debaeke 1997 that crop n uptake was tightly associated with nmin stockle and debaeke 1997 the crop n uptake between the baseline and climate scenarios decreased as temperature increased table 6 the present crop model regarding n uptake is based on the thermal unit concept which implies that crop development from emergence to harvest can be described in terms of a temperature sum hansen et al 1991 temperature increases can aggravate abiotic stress for the process of nitrogen transportation from the soil to the shoot which could reduce the crop s n concentration hansen et al 1991 this reduction in n uptake occurs in combination with lower above ground biomass data not shown and yield in the future climate scenarios the changes in the climate rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 had no significant effect on nitrate n leaching table 6 however these results did not conform to the findings of several other studies that higher temperature would result in lower nitrate leaching due to an increase in evapotranspiration eta and soil mineralization rates thus accelerating the rates of n uptake and crop growth schweigert et al 2004 wick et al 2012 similarly jabloun et al 2015 also suggested that n leaching would increase with an increase in temperature due to an increase in mineralization jabloun et al 2015 the simulated nitrogen leaching was around 110 kg n ha 1 table 6 which is within a similar range to the results from another field study equipped with a lysimeter for maize jia et al 2014 precipitation field management practices and genotype theoretically all affect crop growth water balance nitrogen balance and thus nitrate n leaching through the soil in our case neither the climate and genotype nor their interactions had a significant effect on nitrate n leaching table 5 the disagreement of our results with those of prior research could be due to the following two reasons first climate change did not significantly influence soil water drainage which has a dominant effect on nitrate leaching in our case as growing season precipitation only accounted for 1 3 of the total water input and individual rainfall events in the region seldom exceed 10 mm irrigation become the main impetus for drainage unlike studies in other regions second although the increase in growing season precipitation for the climate scenarios was 13 from the 1981 2010 baseline climate ea was projected to increase by 16 leading to a relatively small decrease approximately 10 in drainage similar studies conducted in semi arid irrigated conditions also found that nitrate leaching through the soil was mainly influenced by irrigation chilundo et al 2018 tarkalson et al 2006 yahdjian and sala 2010 the effects of genotype change on n leaching via increasing n uptake seemed marginal over the whole crop growth period this differed from our expected hypothesis that increasing n uptake could reduce nitrate leaching however as mentioned above the nitrate leaching is dominated by soil water drainage and so n uptake capacity did not affect the processes of soil water use and drainage a field study by wiesler and horst 1993 observed that maize cultivars showed differences in the utilization of soil nitrate and thus nitrate leaching via different sowing dates instead of the genetic improvement of n uptake potential applied in our study wiesler and horst 1993 considered the n uptake behavior of cultivars with regard to the timing of maturity this mitigation strategy may not be suitable in our study area as the optimal sowing window is very narrow however this consideration inspired us to further conduct a detailed genotype environment management study that considered changes in heat and precipitation caused by climate change both changes in climate and genotype had a significant effect anova p 0 0001 on the n balance which we mainly attribute to their effect on n uptake table 5 the n balance was negative under most climate genotype conditions except for the current genotype under the rcp8 5 climate pathway illustrating that the current optimized irrigation fertilizer methods work well for minimizing nitrate leaching and stabilizing the n balance this also indicates that nitrate leaching has reached an optimized balance where the small amount of leaching seems inevitable based on our current knowledge regarding cropping systems 3 4 climate change and genotype effects on yield among the three climate conditions only the hottest rcp8 5 had a significant influence on yield table 5 unlike the dominance of nitrate leaching by drainage the effect of climate change on crops is complex a number of recent studies have quantitatively evaluated the direct effects of climate change on maize yield at the field scale using simulation models showing that a combination of changes in temperature and precipitation can bring either positive or negative effects jones and thornton 2003 li et al 2011 xiong et al 2007 van der velde et al 2014 also evaluated the indirect effects of climate change by quantifying the impacts of changing fertilizer use efficiency under future climates finding that phosphorus applications would have to increase to close yield gaps due to climate change although precipitation in our arid study area is very valuable resource for crop production its limited availability means that it meets only 15 of crop water demands hu et al 2008 liang et al 2016b therefore crops in the rcp8 5 climate could not benefit from the modeled small increase in precipitation as a combined effect ta has been used as an indicator of maize yield as it is dominated by temperature and available water irrigation and precipitation fig 3 djaman et al 2013 concluded that ta had a strong positive relationship with maize yield based on a two year field test araya et al 2017 found that reductions in ta were mainly caused by a shortening growing period similarly the ta in our study showed a high correlation coefficient with yield 0 679 and 0 696 for the current and future genotype respectively fig 3 therefore ta is probably a major parameter influencing yield differences between the three climate scenarios in addition significant yield reductions might occur due to the combined effects of heat stress and a shortening growing period data not shown the yield between baseline and mild climate change rcp4 5 was not significant indicating that maize yields will be only mildly affected by changes in climate that are less conducive to maize production overall in our growing setting although high n uptake is favorable for crop yields when n supply is limited the genotype changes in our study did not affect yield significantly under any climate conditions table 5 probably due to the maize reaching its actual potential when n is already being managed under an optimized balance in addition the yield was a combined function of water fertilizer and climate in our study fertilizer n and irrigation were used together to maximum maize yield in which case higher n uptake could not contribute to yield increase when the water supply was otherwise the limiting factor the complex genotype environment interaction in our model may not have fully represented the relationship between n uptake and yield since we did not calibrate and evaluate the model with different genotypes however we consider the simulated result to be reasonable because 1 the designed future genotype with high n uptake is within a suitable range compared to the previously developed daisy model hansen et al 1991 2 a 13 increase in n uptake for a local breeding program is also feasible when compared to the commercially released cultivars in north china chen et al 2013 the overall integration of climate change impacts on maize yield as expressed in terms of genotype changes in which local farmers can participate is clearly extremely complex however although this study was not designed to build an ideal type for future climate settings our results can provide useful guidance for future agronomic breeding research in the study area 4 conclusions nitrate leaching has long been a focus of agricultural field management research in northwestern china s spring maize cropping system given the high risk of water pollution in this area one aspect of this has been the development of crop models with the robust treatment of water nitrogen dynamics and crop growth after establishing the good performance of the whcns model for these purposes we simulated nitrate leaching and other processes in the soil plant system under baseline and climate change conditions with two genotypes that have different n uptake capacity our results showed that climate changes had no significant effect on soil water drainage in the arid irrigation dominated study area as drainage is the predominant driver of nitrate leaching the latter was not impacted by climate change these results indicate that the current optimized irrigation fertilizer practices work well to minimize nitrate leaching and stabilize the n balance for projected climate changes they also indicate that nitrate leaching has reach an optimized balance where a small amount of leaching seems inevitable based on current knowledge of the cropping system our study shows that the effect of genotype change on reducing nitrate leaching via increasing n uptake is marginal over the full growth period which did not match our expectations however this result is reasonable as the genotype change did not affect the dominant process of soil water drainage therefore reducing nitrate leaching via genetic improvement of crop n uptake may not be a priority for research on mitigation strategies for climate change significant yield reductions were only predicted to occur in the hottest scenario in which the ta was probably a major parameter leading to yield difference between the climate scenarios therefore from the point view of maximizing efficient water use further research should investigate ways to cope with decreased ta due to temperature increases finally the whcns model may not fully represent the complex genotype environment interactions for the relationship between n uptake and yield since we did not calibrate and evaluate the model with different genotypes even though the simulated n uptake was within a reasonable range as a final caveat we note that the whcns model does not characterize the crop n distribution within above ground biomass e g straw and grain n further

11329,although the impacts of climate change on crop yield and production in china have been studied the potential impacts on nitrate leaching are less well known in this study we considered how climate change and crop genotypes with different n uptake capacities could affect soil water drainage nitrate leaching and grain yield under currently optimized irrigation and fertilization practices in the spring maize system of northwest china after testing the performance of the whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator model a total number of 420 simulations spanning representative climate projections 2036 2065 genotypes and time spans led to three key findings first the projected climate changes had no significant effects on soil water drainage and thus no impact on nitrate leaching because the latter was primarily influenced by drainage second the effects of genotype changes on reducing nitrate leaching via increasing n uptake were marginal over the whole growth period again because these had no significant effect on soil water drainage finally the projected yield reduction around 6 5 occurred only in the hottest climate scenario rcp8 5 in which transpiration was probably a more significant parameter leading to yield differences between climates we conclude that to offset the projected yield reduction due to temperature increases improved agricultural technologies and practices will be needed to cope with decreased crop transpiration in addition reducing nitrate leaching through genetic improvement of n uptake should not be considered a research

total growing season precipitation only accounts for around 1 3 of the total water input therefore irrigation is the main driving factor for soil drainage as mentioned above our previous research in this area had aimed to minimize soil water drainage due to excessive irrigation while maintaining high crop yields liang et al 2016b the minor effect of climate change on soil water drainage indicates that the current water management methods are also appropriate in future climate scenarios in this context table 6 shows the modeling results across the 1 8 m soil profile under the different climate and genotype scenarios climate change had a significant effect on the soil water balance although there was more water input from increased precipitation and less net water loss from ea and drainage the soil water balance decreased with increasing temperature which we mainly attribute to reduced crop water consumption ta this result agreed with the finding of hawkins et al 2013 that the amount of ta was directly associated with temperature increase therefore in regard to the maximization of water use it is necessary to further investigate how to cope with decreased ta due to temperature increase we did not consider this in the current study the changes in genotype had no significant effect on soil water drainage water balance and other water related items an interactive effect between the genotype and these items was also not apparent table 5 the amount of drainage for each climate under the same genotype showed no difference demonstrating that crop n uptake procedure had a marginal effect on water dynamics drainage ea and ta in our cropping system under current optimized irrigation and fertilizer input levels table 6 this can be explained by the fact that these two genotypes are the same in most crop parameters except for in n uptake because these two genotypes share the same parameters within the leaf index their performance in terms of evapotranspiration and drainage are similar especially when n stress is low these results matched those of carey et al 2017 who reported that crops with different n uptake potential had no significant effect on soil water drainage when n supply was not limited 3 3 climate change and genotype effects on n uptake nitrate leaching and n balance the mean crop n uptake was significantly higher in the future genotype 311 6 kg n ha 1 as compared to the current genotype 271 3 kg n ha 1 anova p values 0 05 this increase was expected because the nmin minimum crop n concentrations when n is non limited a sensitive parameter for the process of n remobilization adopted from the daisy model hansen et al 1991 is critical for determining the final n concentrations at the end of crop growth this result was also in agreement with the finding of stockle and debaeke 1997 that crop n uptake was tightly associated with nmin stockle and debaeke 1997 the crop n uptake between the baseline and climate scenarios decreased as temperature increased table 6 the present crop model regarding n uptake is based on the thermal unit concept which implies that crop development from emergence to harvest can be described in terms of a temperature sum hansen et al 1991 temperature increases can aggravate abiotic stress for the process of nitrogen transportation from the soil to the shoot which could reduce the crop s n concentration hansen et al 1991 this reduction in n uptake occurs in combination with lower above ground biomass data not shown and yield in the future climate scenarios the changes in the climate rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 had no significant effect on nitrate n leaching table 6 however these results did not conform to the findings of several other studies that higher temperature would result in lower nitrate leaching due to an increase in evapotranspiration eta and soil mineralization rates thus accelerating the rates of n uptake and crop growth schweigert et al 2004 wick et al 2012 similarly jabloun et al 2015 also suggested that n leaching would increase with an increase in temperature due to an increase in mineralization jabloun et al 2015 the simulated nitrogen leaching was around 110 kg n ha 1 table 6 which is within a similar range to the results from another field study equipped with a lysimeter for maize jia et al 2014 precipitation field management practices and genotype theoretically all affect crop growth water balance nitrogen balance and thus nitrate n leaching through the soil in our case neither the climate and genotype nor their interactions had a significant effect on nitrate n leaching table 5 the disagreement of our results with those of prior research could be due to the following two reasons first climate change did not significantly influence soil water drainage which has a dominant effect on nitrate leaching in our case as growing season precipitation only accounted for 1 3 of the total water input and individual rainfall events in the region seldom exceed 10 mm irrigation become the main impetus for drainage unlike studies in other regions second although the increase in growing season precipitation for the climate scenarios was 13 from the 1981 2010 baseline climate ea was projected to increase by 16 leading to a relatively small decrease approximately 10 in drainage similar studies conducted in semi arid irrigated conditions also found that nitrate leaching through the soil was mainly influenced by irrigation chilundo et al 2018 tarkalson et al 2006 yahdjian and sala 2010 the effects of genotype change on n leaching via increasing n uptake seemed marginal over the whole crop growth period this differed from our expected hypothesis that increasing n uptake could reduce nitrate leaching however as mentioned above the nitrate leaching is dominated by soil water drainage and so n uptake capacity did not affect the processes of soil water use and drainage a field study by wiesler and horst 1993 observed that maize cultivars showed differences in the utilization of soil nitrate and thus nitrate leaching via different sowing dates instead of the genetic improvement of n uptake potential applied in our study wiesler and horst 1993 considered the n uptake behavior of cultivars with regard to the timing of maturity this mitigation strategy may not be suitable in our study area as the optimal sowing window is very narrow however this consideration inspired us to further conduct a detailed genotype environment management study that considered changes in heat and precipitation caused by climate change both changes in climate and genotype had a significant effect anova p 0 0001 on the n balance which we mainly attribute to their effect on n uptake table 5 the n balance was negative under most climate genotype conditions except for the current genotype under the rcp8 5 climate pathway illustrating that the current optimized irrigation fertilizer methods work well for minimizing nitrate leaching and stabilizing the n balance this also indicates that nitrate leaching has reached an optimized balance where the small amount of leaching seems inevitable based on our current knowledge regarding cropping systems 3 4 climate change and genotype effects on yield among the three climate conditions only the hottest rcp8 5 had a significant influence on yield table 5 unlike the dominance of nitrate leaching by drainage the effect of climate change on crops is complex a number of recent studies have quantitatively evaluated the direct effects of climate change on maize yield at the field scale using simulation models showing that a combination of changes in temperature and precipitation can bring either positive or negative effects jones and thornton 2003 li et al 2011 xiong et al 2007 van der velde et al 2014 also evaluated the indirect effects of climate change by quantifying the impacts of changing fertilizer use efficiency under future climates finding that phosphorus applications would have to increase to close yield gaps due to climate change although precipitation in our arid study area is very valuable resource for crop production its limited availability means that it meets only 15 of crop water demands hu et al 2008 liang et al 2016b therefore crops in the rcp8 5 climate could not benefit from the modeled small increase in precipitation as a combined effect ta has been used as an indicator of maize yield as it is dominated by temperature and available water irrigation and precipitation fig 3 djaman et al 2013 concluded that ta had a strong positive relationship with maize yield based on a two year field test araya et al 2017 found that reductions in ta were mainly caused by a shortening growing period similarly the ta in our study showed a high correlation coefficient with yield 0 679 and 0 696 for the current and future genotype respectively fig 3 therefore ta is probably a major parameter influencing yield differences between the three climate scenarios in addition significant yield reductions might occur due to the combined effects of heat stress and a shortening growing period data not shown the yield between baseline and mild climate change rcp4 5 was not significant indicating that maize yields will be only mildly affected by changes in climate that are less conducive to maize production overall in our growing setting although high n uptake is favorable for crop yields when n supply is limited the genotype changes in our study did not affect yield significantly under any climate conditions table 5 probably due to the maize reaching its actual potential when n is already being managed under an optimized balance in addition the yield was a combined function of water fertilizer and climate in our study fertilizer n and irrigation were used together to maximum maize yield in which case higher n uptake could not contribute to yield increase when the water supply was otherwise the limiting factor the complex genotype environment interaction in our model may not have fully represented the relationship between n uptake and yield since we did not calibrate and evaluate the model with different genotypes however we consider the simulated result to be reasonable because 1 the designed future genotype with high n uptake is within a suitable range compared to the previously developed daisy model hansen et al 1991 2 a 13 increase in n uptake for a local breeding program is also feasible when compared to the commercially released cultivars in north china chen et al 2013 the overall integration of climate change impacts on maize yield as expressed in terms of genotype changes in which local farmers can participate is clearly extremely complex however although this study was not designed to build an ideal type for future climate settings our results can provide useful guidance for future agronomic breeding research in the study area 4 conclusions nitrate leaching has long been a focus of agricultural field management research in northwestern china s spring maize cropping system given the high risk of water pollution in this area one aspect of this has been the development of crop models with the robust treatment of water nitrogen dynamics and crop growth after establishing the good performance of the whcns model for these purposes we simulated nitrate leaching and other processes in the soil plant system under baseline and climate change conditions with two genotypes that have different n uptake capacity our results showed that climate changes had no significant effect on soil water drainage in the arid irrigation dominated study area as drainage is the predominant driver of nitrate leaching the latter was not impacted by climate change these results indicate that the current optimized irrigation fertilizer practices work well to minimize nitrate leaching and stabilize the n balance for projected climate changes they also indicate that nitrate leaching has reach an optimized balance where a small amount of leaching seems inevitable based on current knowledge of the cropping system our study shows that the effect of genotype change on reducing nitrate leaching via increasing n uptake is marginal over the full growth period which did not match our expectations however this result is reasonable as the genotype change did not affect the dominant process of soil water drainage therefore reducing nitrate leaching via genetic improvement of crop n uptake may not be a priority for research on mitigation strategies for climate change significant yield reductions were only predicted to occur in the hottest scenario in which the ta was probably a major parameter leading to yield difference between the climate scenarios therefore from the point view of maximizing efficient water use further research should investigate ways to cope with decreased ta due to temperature increases finally the whcns model may not fully represent the complex genotype environment interactions for the relationship between n uptake and yield since we did not calibrate and evaluate the model with different genotypes even though the simulated n uptake was within a reasonable range as a final caveat we note that the whcns model does not characterize the crop n distribution within above ground biomass e g straw and grain n further simulations should be conducted to investigate the relationship between n uptake and nitrate leaching in more detail acknowledgements the study was funded by the national key research and development
