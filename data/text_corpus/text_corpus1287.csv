6435,reservoir operation plays an important role in the coevolution of the nexus across water supply power generation and environment wpe systems this paper aims to contribute to the state of the art in how multi objective reservoir operation can be modeled within the framework of the wpe nexus by incorporating the interactions among reservoirs operation stakeholders decision preferences and wpe systems specifically five ordinary differential equations are used to describe the dynamics of wpe states these dynamics are driven by a multi objective optimization model that optimizes reservoir operation decisions two novel response linkages that describe how the reservoir operational decisions influence socio economic variables and how the environmental awareness influences stakeholders preference for reservoir operation are proposed in this study the middle route of china s south to north water transfer project is selected as the case study the results show that 1 response linkages are effective in describing the interactions between reservoir operational decisions and wpe systems 2 tradeoffs across wpe systems and reservoir operational decisions shift from stage to stage because of the changing socio economic conditions and 3 the control parameter that dominates the shift in stable levels of a given variable can be identified these results highlight the importance of re evaluating involved tradeoff effects and updating of operational policies periodically and how our modeling approach can be used to detect and guide such adaptions keywords adaptive reservoir operation wpe nexus response linkage coevolution 1 introduction reservoirs are essential components of interconnected water supply power generation and environment wpe systems hunt et al 2018 perrone and hornberger 2016 uen et al 2018 conventionally a reservoir is operated by specifying the water available for each individual subsystem beh et al 2015 li et al 2014 and the tradeoff and synergistic effects between subsystems can be explored by examining the reservoir behaviors perrone and hornberger 2016 uen et al 2018 recently the significance of reservoirs has been highlighted in the context of interconnected systems with their interdependencies intensified by human activities e g population growth and increased demands on water and power feng et al 2016 perrone and hornberger 2016 sivapalan et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 thus reservoir operations should be adapted to a nexus framework such that these interconnected subsystems can be better investigated feng et al 2016 sivapalan et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 within the nexus framework attention should be paid not only to how reservoir operations will determine the evolution of related subsystems which has been widely investigated in existing literature liu et al 2011a rheinheimer et al 2016 yang et al 2015 yin et al 2011 but also to how the involved subsystems will affect reservoir operations which has been less explored hoff 2011 montanari 2015 montanari et al 2013 the need to study this feedback linkage from subsystems to reservoir operations motivates our research on how reservoirs can be operated more properly by incorporating the influences of the connected subsystems the interconnected systems have been investigated in various frameworks such as integrated water resources management iwrm eum et al 2012 yaeger et al 2014 coupled human nature systems chns liu et al 2007a liu et al 2007b and socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 within these frameworks reservoir models generally fit in one of two categories i e 1 static models where the reservoir operating rules or optimization strategies are fixed and prescribed by stakeholders and managers eum and simonovic 2010 rheinheimer et al 2016 yang et al 2015 zhou and guo 2013 2 adaptive dynamic models where the operating rules or optimization strategies can adjust evolve adaptively as responses to the changes of other systems baldassarre et al 2015 di baldassarre et al 2017 wang et al 2014 specifically static reservoir models connect other systems simply by input output relationships and the impacts of other systems on reservoirs are usually examined by scenario analysis eum et al 2012 perrone and hornberger 2016 rheinheimer et al 2016 in contrast dynamic reservoir models behave like endogenous components of holistic systems and they connect other systems by two way feedbacks baldassarre et al 2015 di baldassarre et al 2017 in this way the performance of reservoirs can not only change but also be changed by the behaviors of other systems di baldassarre et al 2017 notably the changes in reservoir behaviors are mainly attributed to the evolution of human values and norms di baldassarre et al 2017 roobavannan et al 2017 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 which is the key to modelling reservoirs as dynamic components within the nexus framework within the nexus framework most reservoirs are embedded in a multi objective context and are operated to mediate the conflicts of water demands from multiple sectors e g water supply power generation goicoechea et al 1982 liu et al 2009 liu et al 2014 marler and arora 2009 yang et al 2015 in this context the evolution in human values and norms is reflected by changes in the preferences on different objectives baldassarre et al 2015 di baldassarre et al 2017 mason et al 2018 roobavannan et al 2017 swartz 2006 in particular mason et al 2018 presented the choice of best decisions as a negotiation process and pointed out the changes in decision preferences when the reservoir system is exposed to changing external forcing such as extreme drought and flood events di baldassarre et al 2017 modelled the changes in preferences on flood control and water conservation based on the dynamics of community s memories on flood and drought events generally the dynamics of human values and norms driven by both natural and human systems are now commonly modelled in the context of socio hydrology see more examples in elshafei et al 2014 elshafei et al 2015b chen et al 2016 and roobavannan et al 2017 following the framework proposed in elshafei et al 2014 the dynamics of decision preferences on multiple objectives are incorporated into the interconnected systems such that reservoirs can be adapted to the nexus modelling the interaction between water demands from multiple sectors and reservoir operational consequences is another issue to be addressed for the purpose of adapting reservoir operations to the nexus modelling in contrast to conventional studies where water demands are external inputs that cannot be affected by reservoir operations liu et al 2011a yang et al 2015 in the nexus modelling water demands perform as endogenous components and may change and be changed by reservoir operational decisions elshafei et al 2014 montanari et al 2013 van emmerik et al 2014 for instance feng et al 2016 revealed that water and power uses coevolve continuously and result in emergent behaviors within the wpe nexus rheinheimer et al 2016 emphasized that newly accounted environmental flow requires the re design of reservoir operations in the context of multi objective reservoirs the changes in the tradeoffs across multiple objectives can be quantified to understand behaviors of involved reservoirs hurford et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 therefore within the nexus framework the behaviors of multi objective reservoirs are investigated by assessing the shifts in tradeoffs across objectives which is complicated by the endogenous dynamics of water demands that are interacting with operation decisions this paper aims to adapt reservoir operations to the wpe nexus by capturing both the endogenous dynamics of water demands and decision preferences in this study trajectories of wpe states in the near future are projected by a system dynamics model which is a simple formal way of capturing the dynamics and feedbacks across different systems baldassarre et al 2015 feng et al 2016 forrester 1971 qi and chang 2011 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 wang et al 2012 a multi objective reservoir optimization model is used to assess the tradeoffs across different objectives as well as to select the best decision considering the preferences of stakeholders following the concepts of response functions in studies of van emmerik et al 2014 and elshafei et al 2014 two novel response linkages are proposed to capture the interactions across wpe systems reservoir operation and stakeholders preferences as a result the reservoir operations are explored specifically in the context of the wpe nexus where the reservoir is operated dynamically by considering the dynamics of water demands and decision preferences this study aims to provide an exploratory tool that can better inform policy makers regarding how the complex interconnections involved in the wpe subsystems and reservoir operation shape future possibilities in the wpe nexus the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study area of the middle route of south to north water transfer project mr snwtp is introduced in section 3 the wpe nexus is established with three main components i e governing equations for wpe systems a multi objective optimization model and two response linkages in section 4 behaviors of the above three components for the wpe nexus are analyzed in section 5 sensitivity analysis of model parameters is conducted to verify how different parameters behave to control the coevolution trajectories of the wpe nexus further the impacts of decision preference uncertainty and the simplification of endogenous dynamics are also discussed finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 study area the context of our study is provided by the case of the mr snwtp fig 1 in china which delivers water from water rich south china to arid north china via a 1432 km long canal feng et al 2007 wang et al 2006 wang and ma 1999 zhang 2009 our study system is composed of the water supply system in water recipient regions i e the north china plain the hydropower system of the danjiangkou reservoir i e power generation system and the downstream hydrological regime i e environment system which is investigated as a wpe nexus furthermore the danjiangkou reservoir is the reservoir that connects these three subsystems and thus should be operated dynamically within the framework of a nexus approach the mr snwtp diverts water from the danjiangkou reservoir on the han river which is the largest tributary of the yangtze river to the water stressed areas of the north china plain and it has an annual average water diversion capacity of 9 5 billion m3 yang et al 2015 zhou and guo 2013 the beneficial area of the mr snwtp covers 17 cities in four provinces municipalities feng et al 2007 wang and ma 1999 which are listed in supplementary material s1 the danjiangkou reservoir is located in the middle reach of the han river and plays an important role in flood control water supply and power generation with its relevant parameters shown in table 1 the han river passes through the shanxi and hubei provinces and joins the yangtze river at wuhan city with a length of 1570 km and an area of 159 000 km2 the basin has a sub tropical monsoon climate with the annual precipitation varying from 700 to 1100 mm of which 70 80 of the total amount occurs in the wet season from may to september 2 1 system conceptualization the operation of the danjiangkou reservoir aims to mediate the potential water conflicts involved in the wpe systems as specified above in response to reservoir operations the wpe system states e g population power use quota water use quota and etc change with time in return the reservoir operation is also affected by the changes in wpe states which reflect not only the changing demands but also the changing preferences of involved stakeholders the interactions between wpe states and the danjiangkou reservoir can be described by a series of feedbacks which form closed feedback loops as illustrated in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 our study system involves two feedback loops which are formed by decision state d s and environmental awareness preference e α response linkages respectively delineated by the red dashed arrows the first feedback loop describes the iterative feedback between the operations of the danjiangkou reservoir and wpe states the danjiangkou reservoir decides the amounts of water for the water recipient regions hydropower generation and environment systems which change the wpe states such as population levels carrying capacity and quotas of water and power use in return these state variables together update the demands for water power and environment which are major components of the objectives of the reservoir optimization model in this way the reservoir decisions in previous periods affect the decisions in the subsequent process through the feedback loop the second feedback loop describes the two way feedbacks between the reservoir operations and stakeholders preferences one of the direct consequences of reservoir operations is the alteration in hydrological regimes e g eutrophication chen and zhang 2015 peng et al 2016 after perceiving the degraded environment human community change their attitudes towards different systems accordingly in the reservoir operations decision preferences for different objectives will be changed dynamically human attitudes are captured by the concept of environmental awareness see details in section 3 1 4 which is a variable that increases as the environment degrades and decreases otherwise 2 2 data sources the main data available and their sources are presented in supplementary material s2 the socio economic data originate from the yearbooks and bulletins and can be obtained through the statistical database of china s economic and social development http data cnki net these historical data are used to predict future trajectories of the socio economic variables e g population quotas of power and water use for the danjiangkou reservoir 56 years of streamflow data 1955 2010 are available since the impounding of the danjiangkou reservoir started from 1967 certainly changes the natural flow regime streamflow statistics i e mean variance seasonality and etc after the impounding 1968 2010 are inconsistent with those before the impounding 1955 1967 the streamflow data for 1968 2010 needs restoration to mitigate the impacts of reservoir operations on streamflow such that the streamflow statistics before and after the impounding are consistent more details of the restoration from regulated to natural streamflow can be found in deng et al 2015 it should be noticed that the commissioning of the mr snwtp started from the end of 2014 and thus the data describing the related feedbacks in the wpe nexus are not yet available therefore our goal is to explore plausible future possibility of wpe nexus by incorporating hypothetical feedbacks that are reasonable but ignored in conventional practices as a result this study provides an exploratory tool for stakeholders or policy makers by considering the complex interconnections which is distinguished from a tool that helps understand the exact details of the local wpe nexus 3 methods our wpe nexus model consists of three main components fig 3 1 a system dynamics model of wpe systems describing the dynamics of wpe states 2 a multi objective reservoir optimization model optimizing decisions that consider the tradeoffs across multiple objectives 3 two response linkages describing the interactions and feedbacks between wpe states reservoir operations and stakeholders preferences 3 1 wpe systems the dynamics of wpe states are described by five ordinary differential equations with each describing the variation of a specific system state the five state variables of wpe systems are summarized in table 2 specifically population and water use quotas are defined for four different water recipient regions in this section the impacts of reservoir operations on wpe states are not taken into consideration which will be further addressed in section 3 3 3 1 1 reservoir system the wpe systems are intrinsically linked by the water balance equation of the danjiangkou reservoir which indicates that the variation of reservoir storage equals the difference between inflow and outflow i e 1 dv dt i d v p v l e where v is the reservoir storage that changes with time t i is the reservoir inflow dv is the total water delivery for water recipient regions pv is the water used for hydropower generation l is the spilled water that is released when the storage exceeds its capacity which cannot be used for any beneficial uses such as water supply or hydropower generation e is the evaporation and seepage for the danjiangkou reservoir the evaporation and seepage e is considered as a function of reservoir storage or water surface area which is provided in the supplementary material table s6 1 since the water used for hydropower generation is non consumptive i e it is also released to downstream the water available to maintain the downstream ecological environment equals the sum of the water used for hydropower generation and reservoir spill the amounts of water releases i e dv pv and l are determined by a multi objective optimization model that is elaborated in section 3 2 3 1 2 water supply system the water supply system refers to the water recipient regions along the mr snwtp the province or municipality is taken as the unit of water recipient region for the analysis for each of the water recipient regions the dynamics of the population and water use quota are formulated as two differential equations to track their trajectories 3 1 2 1 population equation the logistic model has been widely used to describe population dynamics with limited resources feng et al 2016 jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 kingsland 1982 meyer and ausubel 1999 increasingly constrained by water resources availability the population dynamics in water recipient regions fit within the scope of the logistic model thus the population dynamics for a particular water recipient region can be represented as follows 2 d n s w dt r s n n s w 1 n s w k s s t 1 where n s w is the population of water recipient region s k s s t 1 is the average carrying capacity of water recipient region s during the planning stage st 1 with one stage time lag that describes the legacy effect of the carrying capacity on the population r s n is the natural growth rate of population within water recipient region s which is set as time variant because the natural growth of population is closely related to the continuously changing socio economic conditions this time variant natural growth rate is obtained by fitting from historical data of populations in each water recipient region see results in table 4 i e socio economic conditions are specified exogenously 3 1 2 2 water use equation because of the complexity in the variations in water use quota which may involve various socio economic factors such as population levels technology infrastructure and education here for simplicity we attempt to project the level and trend observed from historical data of water use per capita to those of water use quota as shown in fig s3 2 in supplementary material historical data indicate that the water use per capita is decreasing and the changing rate is also decreasing i e the first derivative is negative and the second derivative is positive the observed trends can be explained as follows 1 the water use per capita is decreasing because of advances in technology and other incentives that help save water 2 the decreasing changing rate is caused by the increasing difficulty of saving water in light of the need to maintain living conditions with the above observations the trajectory of water use quota can be modeled by the following differential equations 3 d u s dt r s w e φ w t where us is the water use quota r s w is the nominal growth rate of water use quota and e φ w t is used to depict the water saving effect of advanced technology which is assumed to be decreasing with time t if the application of newly introduced technology cannot cause the revolution in water consumption it is reasonable to assume that water use quota is decreased to a basic level which represents the minimum water demands at the end of the study horizon i e time t meanwhile the decreasing rate of water use quota is approaching zero technological development is therefore exogenously determined in this model at time t the reduction in water use quota can be described by a percentage τ s w such that the terminal conditions can be formulated as follows 4 d u s dt t t 0 u s t 1 τ s w u s 0 where u s t and u s 0 are the water use quotas of water recipient region s at time t and initial time respectively with conditions specified in eq 4 the analytical solution of eq 3 can be resolved approximately as follows 5 u s t u s 0 τ s w u s 0 1 e 2 996 t t where u s t is the water use quota of water recipient region s at time t in eq 5 the reduction percentage τ s w is the only parameter to be estimated 3 1 3 power generation system for a given power generation system the power can be conveyed to any region in china through the national power grid such that the boundary of this system is difficult to ascertain to overcome this difficulty a concept of virtual community is proposed to describe the scale of the power generation system the virtual community of a given power generation system is defined as a group of people that consumes the power generated from this system and it can be characterized by its population size and power use per capita 3 1 3 1 population of virtual community empirically the hydropower generated from the danjiangkou reservoir is mainly consumed by people in hubei province such that the population size of corresponding virtual community can be estimated through historical data i e the annual average power generation of the danjiangkou reservoir and power use per capita of hubei province moreover the population size of the virtual community can be assumed to be invariant based on the following observations 1 the natural growth rate of the population in hubei province is small i e average value of 3 5 over year 2000 2014 2 the increase in power demand is mainly attributed to the increase of power use per capita that is related to domestic agricultural and industrial factors li et al 2010 3 1 3 2 power use equation the variation of power use quota is caused by the combined effect of various factors such as domestic agricultural and industrial power uses for simplicity power use quota is assumed to capture the changing pattern of power use per capita observed from historical data as shown in fig s3 3 in supplementary material the historical data indicate increases in power use per capita of hubei province and china but decreases in their changing rates this changing pattern can be explained as follows 1 the power use increases due to the improvement of the living standard 2 the changing rate decreases because of the higher power saving awareness with better living condition and decreasing importance of marginal power needs with above observations the trajectory of power use quota in the near future can be modeled by the following differential equation 6 dg dt r g e φ g t where g is the power use quota r g is the nominal growth rate and e φ g t describes the power saving effects which decrease the growth rate and changes with time t similar to the case for the water use quota if the application of newly introduced technology does not lead to a revolution in power consumption the power use quota reaches its maximum level at time t meanwhile the changing rate approaches zero the increased power use quota can be expressed by a percentage τ g such that the terminal conditions can be formulated as follows 7 g t 1 τ g g 0 dg dt t t 0 where g 0 and g t are the power use quota at initial time and time t respectively with this terminal condition as specified in eq 7 the analytical solution to eq 6 can be obtained approximately as follows 8 g t g 0 τ g g 0 1 e 2 996 t t where g t is the power use quota at time t as indicated by eq 8 τ g is the only parameter to be estimated 3 1 3 3 power generation the power output is determined by the equation pg max γ p v h p max h where pv is the water volume in unit time supplied for hydropower generation h is the net water head and p max gives the maximum power output that is constrained by the turbine generator unit γ is the comprehensive hydropower coefficient and has been widely used in the field of reservoir operations it describes the efficiency of the turbine generator unit with the same unit as gravitational acceleration feng et al 2017 liu et al 2011b liu et al 2014 3 1 4 environmental system the operations of the danjiangkou reservoir have caused the degradation of the downstream aquatic environment and the reduction in faunal diversity chen and zhang 2015 peng et al 2016 one possible indicator is the annual proportional flow deviation apfd a measure that describes the degree of regulation of a river gehrke et al 1995 white and ladson 1999 yin et al 2011 moreover the apfd was found to be negatively correlated with fish species diversity in 4 regulated rivers in the new south wales portion of the murray darling basin gehrke et al 1995 as shown in the work of gehrke et al 1995 the square of the deviation between natural and regulated flow i e r r i i 2 is the evaluation of apfd for a given instant and thus is adopted here to reflect the instant streamflow regulation by reservoir operations the environmental quality or ecosystem service could also be quantified based on a 7 year moving average of fish species richness fsr as in the work of roobavannan et al 2017 essentially these two indicators both quantify the extent of regulation of a particular river and can be used to evaluate the environment quality in this study the instant evaluation of apfd is adopted because it is simple and does not introduce additional parameters environmental awareness and community sensitivity are two terms that indicate a community s attitude towards external conditions e g climate politics and economics elshafei et al 2015a elshafei et al 2014 feng et al 2016 van emmerik et al 2014 community sensitivity describes people s attitudes towards human activity and environmental restoration chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017 environmental awareness describes the perceived threat of system collapse and it accumulates when the system performance is below a threshold but lapses otherwise van emmerik et al 2014 environmental awareness is considered to be more specific than community sensitivity it is adopted here with its dynamics formulated as follows 9 de dt κ r r crit η r r crit ω e r r crit where e is environmental awareness r crit is the critical value of r above which the environmental deterioration would be perceived κ and η are the perception factors describing the community s ability to identify threats of degradation ω is the lapse factor representing a decreasing rate of environmental awareness over time 3 2 multi objective reservoir optimization model 3 2 1 objectives for the reservoir optimization model three objectives are formulated 1 water shortage index wsi 2 power shortage index psi and 3 hydrological alteration index hai this multi objective model is established to 1 assess the tradeoffs across wpe systems with the pareto frontier and 2 determine the best operational decision at each time step with given decision preferences shortage indices hsu and cheng 2002 tu et al 2008 zhao et al 2012 are used to formulate the objectives of water supply and power generation systems which are shown as follows 10 min w s i 1 t r 0 t r ws wd 2 d t 11 min p s i 1 t r 0 t r ps pd 2 d t where t r is the time length of reservoir operation horizon ws and wd are water shortage and demand respectively ps and pd are power shortage and demand respectively both wsi and psi are calculated in relative terms water and power demand are obtained by multiplying population n s w and n p and use quotas u s and g for the water recipient region virtual community as calculated in section 3 3 1 therefore taking into account impacts of water and power shortages in previous stages the formulas for the calculation of water and power demands are presented as follows 12 wd s 1 4 w d s w d s n s w u s 13 pd n p g power shortage is simply the shortfall between demand and generation 14 ps max pd p g 0 water shortage is the sum of shortages from four water recipient regions which needs to take into account both the local water availability and water delivery i e 15 ws s 1 4 w s s w s s max w d s a w s d v s 0 where w s s w d s a w s and d v s are water shortage water demand and locally available water and local water delivery respectively for water recipient regions s 1 2 3 and 4 corresponding to henan province hebei province beijing municipality and tianjin municipality respectively in particular the local water delivery d v s is determined by distributing the total water delivery to water recipient regions which is proportional to the contribution of local water shortages i e the shortfall between local water demand and available water to the total water shortage i e 16 d v s w d s a w s s 1 4 w d s a w s d v it should be noticed that water deliveries for each region eq 16 are used directly in the calculation of carrying capacity section 3 3 1 and the total water delivery dv is reduced by the water losses in the main channel of the mr snwtp which is accounted by multiplying with a reduction coefficient i e 0 7356 the details of the reduction coefficient are provided in the supplementary material s6 following the work of wu and zhang 2002 the apfd is an ecologically embedded index reflecting the degree of hydrological alteration in aquatic environment thus it is selected as the environmental objective and can be simply termed as hydrological alteration index hai 17 min h a i 1 l 2 0 l 2 0 l 1 r i i 2 d l 1 1 2 d l 2 where r and i are the regulated and natural river flow respectively l 1 and l 2 are the time length of a single year and the number of the years in the reservoir operation horizon respectively in addition the product of parameters l 1 and l 2 equals the reservoir operation horizon t r i e t r l 1 l 2 3 2 2 tradeoffs and operational decisions 3 2 2 1 evaluation of the tradeoffs across systems the tradeoff across wpe systems can be evaluated effectively by using a pareto frontier which describes a set of non dominated optimal solutions where none is better than any other on all objectives i e for a given pareto optimal solution any one of the three objectives cannot be improved without sacrificing the other objectives beh et al 2015 burke and kendall 2014 liu et al 2009 liu et al 2011a reddy and kumar 2007 yang et al 2015 generally three main methods can be used to obtain the pareto frontiers evolutionary algorithms liu et al 2011a reddy and kumar 2007 the ε constraint method haimes et al 1971 and the weighted sum method burke and kendall 2014 marler and arora 2009 although all three methods have the capability of finding the pareto optimal solutions the weighted sum method is adopted here because 1 the evolutionary algorithms are time consuming and prone to converging to local optima burke and kendall 2014 liu et al 2011a 2 the continuous curve surface of pareto frontiers are difficult to obtain with ε constraint methods with the weighted sum method the pareto optimal solutions is resolved by repeating the optimization process of the weighted objective with the weights varied for each run marler and arora 2009 the weighted objective can be formulated as follows 18 min 1 α β wsi w s i min ws i max w s i min β psi p s i min ps i max p s i min α hai h a i min ha i max h a i min where α and β are the decision preferences for environmental protection and power generation respectively ws i max and ws i min are the maximum and minimum of water shortage indices respectively ps i max and ps i min are the maximum and minimum of power shortage indices respectively ha i max and ha i min are the maximum and minimum of hydrological alteration indices respectively as indicated by eqs 10 11 and 17 all above three indices i e wsi psi and hai range between 0 and 1 thus the maximum and minimum of these three indices are set as 1 and 0 respectively previous literature showed that the optimized solution of the weighted objective eq 18 is always pareto optimal provided that 1 all the objectives are concave and 2 the weights are all positive goicoechea et al 1982 marler and arora 2009 zadeh 1963 since the objectives are difficult to be proven as concave or convex the pareto optimal solutions can be screened out by applying the non dominated sorting process to candidate solutions that are preliminarily obtained by optimizing eq 18 the decision preferences α and β can be generated randomly with the conditions of 0 α β α β 1 a value of one for α β or 1 α β indicates the complete preference on one objective over the other two for a given combination of decision preferences the weighted objective is optimized by using dynamic programming the detailed formulation of the dynamic programming for the above optimization problem is provided in the supplementary material s4 3 2 2 2 operational decisions with preferences for each time step a single best decision is selected among all non dominated alternatives on the pareto optimal frontier to transfer system states from current to consecutive time step this best operational decision is selected with given decision preferences which may change as the wpe systems coevolve the variation of decision preference α is closely related to the environmental awareness e with their relationship conceptualized as an e α response linkage that is elaborated in section 3 3 2 the decision preferences on power generation β and water supply 1 α β also change as the wpe systems coevolve and their variations are related to α by a parameter θ 0 θ 1 the priority of power generation over water supply systems θ 0 indicates a complete preference on water supply against power generation while θ 1 represents a complete preference on power generation against water supply for a given preference for the environment α the preferences for power generation and water supply can therefore be specified as β θ 1 α and 1 α β 1 θ 1 α respectively considering the fact that water supply to north china is more important than hydropower generation β 1 3 1 α is initially selected to explore the behaviors of the wpe nexus since the priority level will certainly affect the coevolution of the wpe systems different levels of priority θ are adopted to assess the impacts of uncertainty from these two decision preferences as shown in section 5 2 3 3 response linkages two response linkages d s and e α are established to describe the interactions between reservoir operations and wpe states closing the feedback loops of the wpe nexus as shown in fig 2 3 3 1 response link the d s response link describes how the operational decision d affects the wpe states s which includes the carrying capacity of the water recipient regions and quotas of water and power use the carrying capacity k s in the water recipient region s is closely related to its water availability which is increased by the water delivery d v s from the mr snwtp harris and kennedy 1999 hui 2006 meyer and ausubel 1999 seidl and tisdell 1999 intuitively carrying capacity would be the size of the population whose needs quotas can be satisfied 19 k s s t a w s dv s s t u s where k s s t is the carrying capacity of the water recipient region s in stage st dv s s t is the average water delivery in stage st denoting the original carrying capacity of water recipient region s as k s 0 i e k s 0 a w s u s eq 19 can be further expressed as follows 20 k s s t a w s dv s s t a w s a w s u s 1 dv s s t a w s k s 0 however this relationship might be altered by socio economic effects the changes in carrying capacity could be modeled as a logistic process by taking the adaption into consideration meyer and ausubel 1999 but for simplicity the adaption process is neglected herein to decrease the model complexity such that the carrying capacity can be formulated as a nonlinear function of resource availability i e 21 k s s t 1 dv s s t a w s σ s k s 0 the parameter σ s 0 σ s 1 reflects the socio economic effects on the carrying capacity if σ s equals 1 the carrying capacity is linearly proportional to water availability and eq 21 is equivalent to eq 20 or 19 otherwise the socio economic factors affect the carrying capacity of water recipient regions negatively the increases in the water resource have a less than proportional effect on carrying capacity moreover a smaller σ s indicates a larger impact of socio economic factors on the carrying capacity the shortages in previous time periods affect subsequent water and power use quotas which can be formulated as follows 22 u s w 1 w e λ w wsi st 1 u s 23 g w 1 w e λ g psi st 1 g where u s and u s are the water use quotas for water recipient region s with and without considering the impacts of previous water shortage respectively g and g are the power use quotas with and without considering the impacts of previous power shortage respectively wsi st 1 and psi st 1 are the average water and power shortage indices respectively at stage st 1 the one stage time lag reflects the legacy effect of the impacts of shortages λ w and λ g are the scaling factors for the quotas of water and power uses respectively w is the parameter that specifies the ratio of minimum acceptable water power use quota to its predicted value i e w u s and wg are the minimum acceptable water and power use quotas respectively the minimum acceptable water power use quota refers to the level that should be kept to sustain basic living conditions 3 3 2 response link the e α response linkage depicts the relationship between environmental awareness e and decision preference α following the prototype framework proposed in the work of elshafei et al 2014 empirically a community with a higher environmental awareness is prone to focus more on environment centric rather than anthropocentric actions water supply and power generation thus a hypothetical relationship between environmental awareness e and decision preference α is assumed as follows 24 α 1 1 α 0 exp ε e e crit e e crit α 0 e e crit where ε is the factor describing the changing rate of the preference with respective to environmental awareness this hypothetical relationship is illustrated intuitively in fig 4 i e α 0 is the minimum level of α which remains unchanged when environmental awareness is below a critical value e crit otherwise the preference α increases to its maximum value i e 1 3 4 implementation of the wpe nexus model before implementing our wpe nexus model the following two aspects need to be clarified 1 the time horizons involved in the wpe nexus and 2 the setting of reservoir inflow the time horizons in the wpe nexus include the study horizon planning horizon i e planning stage and reservoir operation horizon the study horizon is the time period within which the coevolution of the wpe nexus is studied it is set as the year 2016 2050 because the near future impacts of the mr snwtp are of great concern the planning horizon refers to the time period within which the decision preferences remain unchanged it is set as 5 years corresponding to the reality of stage wise adjustments in macro scale policies in china the reservoir operation horizon refers to the time period for one single run of the multi objective optimization model and it is set as the time length of the streamflow data the historical streamflow observations split by year are taken as an ensemble of predictions of the reservoir inflow in the near future assuming that the characteristics of future streamflow are captured by the historical data that is for a particular year 56 year streamflow data 1955 2010 are utilized as all possible reservoir inflows and the annual average values of optimization results e g water delivery hydropower generation and shortage indices are obtained to assess the average levels of tradeoffs and operational decisions the wpe nexus model is then run stage by stage with a schematic describing two consecutive stages shown in fig 5 the detailed procedures can be elaborated as follows 1 initializing the wpe nexus the state variables in the wpe nexus are initialized based on historical data the model parameters are obtained by the trial and error method or estimated empirically such that the trends of simulated trajectories match well with those indicated by factual data 2 updating the carryover variables at the beginning of the stage the carryover variables refer to the variables that are obtained from previous stage and will certainly affect the coevolution of wpe nexus in the subsequent stage here the carryover variables consist of the average shortage indices of water and power and decision preference i e wsi psi and α 3 simulating the trajectories of wpe states with the updated carryover variables the wpe states within the current stage are simulated with the system dynamics model 4 optimizing reservoir behaviors within the stage the tradeoffs across wpe systems are identified by resolving the pareto frontiers the operational decisions are selected from the pareto frontier with the given decision preferences 5 repeating steps from 2 to 4 until all the stages are finished for ease of implementation the continuous form of wpe nexus is discretized and attached in appendix a meanwhile the continuous form of the wpe nexus is summarized in supplementary material s7 4 results the proposed model is implemented to obtain the coevolutionary behaviors of the wpe nexus the state variables are initialized as in table 2 the parameters are set in table 3 and the detailed functions describing the variations in state variables are presented in table 4 as a result the shifts in reservoir behaviors are addressed and the feedbacks related to response linkages are illustrated 4 1 coevolution of the wpe nexus the coevolution trajectories of the wpe nexus are obtained and illustrated in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 for a particular state variable the pattern of change is constant within in a single stage i e 5 years but varies for different stages and finally converges to a stable or quasi stable state at the end of the simulation time horizon i e the variations of system states are small and near zero the convergence of the wpe nexus to a quasi stable state occurs because a the exogenous force of streamflow is set as stationary i e for a particular year the 56 year streamflow data 1955 2010 are utilized as all possible reservoir inflows b the rates of change in power and water use quotas are approaching zero as specified by eq 7 this means that the rates of change in exogeneous driving force and certain endogenous components are small at the end of the study horizon which allows a stable or quasi stable state to be achieved the final stable state also implies the balance of these two feedback loops that drive reservoir operations to two opposite directions as indicated by fig 2 the variation in changing patterns can be explained by the co evolving strategies when the carryover variables are updated at the beginning of each stage furthermore three important observations are obtained as follows firstly the water supply system competes for water for the power generation and environment systems as shown in fig 6 b a small wsi is accompanied by large hai and psi revealing the competition of water uses between water supply and power generation environment system a small wsi indicates a high satisfaction degree of the demands in water recipient regions i e a large part of water that was originally for sustaining the environment and generating hydropower is transferred by the snwtp thus the environment system deteriorates and power demands cannot be satisfied resulting in large values of hai and psi the trade off between water supply and power generation and or the environment protection can be obtained by optimization and the extent of trade off denoted by spread range of the pareto frontier between these two objectives is expected to be reduced with co evolved decision preferences i e more equal decision preferences imply fewer extreme points on the pareto frontier the simultaneous changes in psi and hai either increase or decrease can be explained by the fact that the water used for hydropower generation is also released to sustain the downstream ecological health secondly a legacy effect across different wpe states can be observed in the coevolution trajectories which is in accordance with our experiences and the existing literature elshafei et al 2015a feng et al 2016 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 the legacy effect is reflected by a 5 year time delay i e a planning stage between the operational results wsi psi and hai and the evolution of wpe systems a large value of wsi fig 6b is followed by a decrease in population levels fig 6c and an acceleration in the decrease of water use quota indicated by the increases in the slope of the water use quota curves fig 6d similarly a large value of psi fig 6b is followed by a decrease in power use quota fig 6e conversely a small value of wsi indicates the subsequent increase in population and decrease in the changing rate of water use quota a small value of psi indicates the subsequent increase in the changing rate of power use quota thirdly this wpe nexus model has the capability of mimicking the stage wise adjustments in policy as shown in fig 6 the stage wise behaviors are obvious in the coevolution trajectories revealing that the related policies are adjusted stage by stage essentially the policy is indicated by response linkages which is incorporated into the modeling process by updating carryover variables at the beginning of each stage moreover the changing decision preferences result in a need to adjust the operating policy for the danjiangkou reservoir fig 6 a shows the continuous change in the decision preference α but operating policy does not change continuously because of the high expense of doing so in practice 4 2 shifts of reservoir behaviors within the framework of the wpe nexus reservoir behaviors change as wpe systems coevolve which is reflected by 1 the shifts in tradeoffs across systems and 2 the shifts in operational decisions as a preliminary example the pareto optimal solutions in year 2016 fig 7 are illustrated to show the tradeoffs across objectives of wpe systems as shown in fig 7 a one of the objectives is improved by sacrificing either of the other two objectives fig 7 b d show the tradeoffs of pair wise objectives with the third objective depicted by color the relationship across these three objectives can be stated as 1 both wsi and psi decrease as the hai increases and 2 either the decrease in wsi or psi will increase the hai though with a non linear relationship the shifts in tradeoffs across wpe systems are illustrated by the evolving pareto frontiers fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a e the pareto frontiers in different stages reveal quantitative changes in the tradeoff relations in general the change in tradeoffs may be attributed to 1 the changes in reservoir inflow and or 2 the change in the demands quantified by the wpe states in our study the streamflow is set as the same for the operations of all the years i e for each year 56 year streamflow data are taken as the input to evaluate the average performance thus the changes in wpe states are the main cause of shifts in pareto frontiers for each stage the operational decision of the danjiangkou reservoir is selected as a point on corresponding pareto frontier given a combination of decision preferences fig 9 shows the shifts in operational decisions from stage to stage as illustrated by the changing locations of circled points on pareto frontiers the shifts in operational decisions are mainly attributed to 1 the changes in wpe states and 2 the dynamic variation of decision preference the changes in wpe states cause the transformation in the shape and change in the location of pareto frontiers while the dynamic variation of decision preference changes the relative location of the decision on corresponding frontiers the shifts of reservoir behaviors highlight for policy makers that both tradeoffs across systems and operational decisions should be re evaluated every several years so that the proposed policy can satisfy the demands at the stage 4 3 response linkages in feedbacks loops in this section the role of response linkages in the coevolution of wpe nexus is illustrated by their corresponding feedback loops the d s response linkage is illustrated by feedback loops related to the carrying capacity fig 10 and water use quota fig 11 the variables in hebei province depicted by the red lines are taken as an example to show these two feedback loops as shown in fig 10 the feedback loop of carrying capacity involves variations in population water demand water supply and carrying capacity at the beginning of coevolution the population is smaller than the carrying capacity and the gap between carrying capacity and population drives the population to approach the capacity in the second stage the increased population level intensifies the water demand meanwhile higher preference is focused on environment protection fig 6 a such that the water supply is decreased here the response linkage takes effect as that the decreased water supply will contribute to the decrease in the carrying capacity of the hebei province consequently the newly induced gap between carrying capacity and population will drive the population to change adaptively indicating a new round of feedback the feedbacks for the other three provinces municipalities can be interpreted similarly as shown in fig 11 the feedback loop of water use quota is composed of variations in water use quota water demand water shortage and wsi in the first stage it is observed that the changes in water demand are consistent with the variation in water use quota in the second stage the water demand is increased although the water use quota decreases and this is caused by the significant increase in population as shown in fig 10 a the increase in water demand intensifies the water shortage as indicated by the significant increase in the wsi in fig 11 d here the response linkage takes effect as a high wsi will decrease the water use quota in the subsequent stage the e α response linkage is illustrated by the feedback loop of decision preference α fig 12 the decision preference α is changing continuously fig 12 a but only affects decision making at the beginning of a stage the e α response linkage is visible in that the trend of decision preference is similar to that of environment awareness in the first stage the initial decision preference is small i e 0 3 and a high preference is put on exploiting more water resources to satisfy the demands of water supply and power generation systems in this stage water supply is kept at a relatively high level and power generation is kept at relatively low level their changes are mainly attributed to the changes in corresponding demand as a result the downstream hydrological regime degrades indicated by a high hai in fig 12 d such that environmental awareness is increased sharply and the decision preference on environment is driven to a high level in the second stage a high preference on environment protection is adopted and consequently the water supply is decreased while the power generation is increased the hydrological regime is improved greatly indicated by a small hai in fig 12 b and d the stage wise changes in water supply and hai are simultaneous indicating that the water supply has a higher influence on the environment than hydropower generation water supply reduces the amount of water released to downstream directly but the hydropower generation only changes the timing of the downstream streamflow 5 discussions 5 1 sensitivity analysis of model parameters sensitivity analysis is conducted to verify the impacts of model parameters on the coevolution trajectories by identifying alternative future scenarios corresponding to various parameters elshafei et al 2014 feng et al 2016 zajac et al 2017 the parameter setting for the sensitivity analysis is presented in table 5 each parameter is varied once by an increment with the other parameters fixed the parameters are varied within the intervals specified by the maximum and minimum values only part of parameters listed in table 3 are selected for analysis because these parameters exert significant influences on model results and are selected based on our experiences the trajectories of environmental awareness are selected as an example which is illustrated in fig 13 the trajectories of power use quota and population in beijing are shown in supplementary material s5 fig s5 1 and s5 2 respectively as shown in fig 13 the trajectories are sensitive to most of these selected parameters implying that the parameters in one system will change the trajectories of state variables in the other systems this illustrates how the wpe systems interact requiring them to be conceptualized as a nexus by comparing the trajectories of different variables two observations can be obtained firstly for a given variable different parameters show different patterns in affecting its trajectory as shown in fig 13 parameters κ and η have more impacts on the trajectory of environmental awareness when it is approaching its peak parameters w and τ s w have more impacts on the trajectory when the it is decreased to a low level parameters α 0 and τ g has little or no impacts on the trajectory critical hydrological alteration r crit and critical environmental awareness e crit are identified as the two most sensitive parameters that change the trajectory in a global pattern a higher e crit drives the trajectory of environmental awareness to evolve to higher values for a higher e crit the decision preference α is more likely to be kept at the initial low level such that more water is utilized for water supply and power generation systems thus the hydrological regimes are degraded and environmental awareness is driven to a high level a higher r crit drives the trajectory to evolve to a lower value a higher r crit indicates higher difficulty in perceiving and capturing the alterations in hydrological regimes such that the environment awareness is more likely to be decreased or driven to a lower level similarly the impacts of these parameters on the other variables can also be observed and interpreted according to figs s5 1 and s5 2 for the power use quota parameters w and τ g are the most sensitive parameters that change the trajectory in a global pattern for the population in beijing parameter w is the most sensitive parameter that changes the trajectory significantly secondly the control parameters that dominate the changes in stable levels of different variables can be identified at the end of the study period the wpe systems and reservoir behaviors are approaching stable states where the states stop changing as indicated by figs 7 and 8 as shown in fig 13 most of the involved parameters can change the stable state of environment awareness and the critical instant hydrological alteration r crit and critical environmental awareness e crit are identified as the most effective parameters for power use quota fig s5 1 although evolving processes are affected by most of parameters only two parameters i e the minimum acceptable percentage for water use quota w and the total reduction in power use quota τ g have the ability to change the stable state similarly for the population in beijing municipality fig s5 2 parameter w is identified as the control parameter that can change the stable state in particular the population in beijing is shifted from high level to low level states as the parameter w decreases by adopting appropriate socio economic measures the stable state of wpe systems and reservoir operations could be controlled and unexpected shifts in the stable states can be avoided 5 2 impacts of decision preferences uncertainty in the current study operational decisions are selected among the alternatives provided by the pareto optimal solutions with given environmental decision preference α and water use priority θ since the decision preference α is determined by the e α response linkage the uncertainty of decision preferences is mainly embedded in the priority θ thus the impacts of uncertainty of decision preferences is examined by comparing the co evolution trajectories with different levels of priority θ from 1 4 to 3 4 fig 14 as observed in fig 14 the general patterns of changes for the trajectories for a given variable are similar with different priorities θ at the beginning each variable has an identical trajectory the population and power use quota start to respond to different levels of priorities at the earliest time followed by the water use quota environmental awareness and preference α for environmental awareness e and decision preference α the priority exerts more impact on their ending levels for other variables the priority exerts more impacts on the middle of changing processes the trajectories of involved variables are insensitive to the priority θ when the adopted decision preference α is large and sensitive to the priority θ only when decision preference α is small the contributions of water shortage power shortage and hydrological alteration to the weighted objective are more controlled by the decision preference α than priority θ intuitively indicated by their definitions which is especially true with the fact that the water release to maintain the hydrological regime ensured by the decision preference α can be simultaneously used for power generation the details can be explained as follows when the decision preference α is large the natural hydrological regime is expected to be maintained by the reservoir release since the water release to maintain the hydrological regime can also be used for power generation there is a large amount of power generation surplus in the flood season and a power generation deficit in non flood season in this manner the power shortage occurs only in the non flood season while the water shortage occurs in the whole year such that the contribution of power shortage to the weighted objective is quite small regardless of the priority level θ as a result the weighted objective is more dominated by the decision preference α and less controlled by the priority θ when the decision preference α is small water release is highly regulated to satisfy the water and power demands where the priority θ plays a significant role in allocating the available water between water supply and power generation moreover the priority θ can also change the hydrological alteration because the water release for power generation is also used to maintain the hydrological regime thus the contributions of water shortage power shortage and hydrological alteration to the weighted objective can all be affected by the priority θ as a result the weighted objective is controlled by both the decision preference α and priority θ 5 3 simplification of endogenous dynamics in the proposed model both the endogenous dynamics of water supply and power generation systems are simplified greatly compared to the existing socio hydrological cases e g pande et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017 pande and pandit 2018 all these simplifications of the endogenous dynamics are based on the primary goal of this study i e to explore future possibilities of reservoir operations within the nexus framework rather than to predict the exact trajectories of the nexus in the near future based on this goal this study attempts to provide policy makers with an explanatory tool to understand the reservoir behaviors within the wpe nexus by incorporating the dynamics of multiple demands and decision preferences the details and implications of these simplifications are discussed as below in particular the dynamics of water use quotas in water recipient regions ignore their dependence on population growth rates which is in contrast to the findings in pande and pandit 2018 this can be justified in two ways 1 water use quota is a designed quantity provided by managers or policy makers to quantify the water demand of a given region and further to determine how much water should be supplied and 2 modelling water use quota as an independent variable is accurate enough for the purpose of projecting water demands in the near future even so the simulation results show that higher population typically results in a higher water demand and a higher water shortage which will cause a larger reduction in water use quota in subsequent stages as shown in figs 6 and 11 this implies that the negative relationship between water use quota and population growth is implicitly embedded in the simulation model which is contrast to the explicit quantification in the work of pande and pandit 2018 the dynamics of water power use quota depicts the impacts of technology simply by using a single parameter rather than describing the interactions between the technology and water power use quota as endogenous dynamics for the dynamics of water use quota the rationale of this simplification on technology is 1 it is representative enough for the purpose of exploring water demands in the near future 2 the primary goal of this study is different to that of pande et al 2014 which aims to test the impacts of endogenous change of technology on the society s response 3 the endogenous dynamics of technology cannot be established and further validated in the water recipient regions due to lack of data for the power use quota its dependence on technology or gdp is justified by the empirically observed positive relationship between power use quota and gdp water supply and power generation are coupled primarily through the regulation of the danjiangkou reservoir additionally the similarities in the improvement rates of water and power use quotas are also likely to be captured because technological development in water and power quotas are both derived from historical data other possible coupling relationships between water supply and power generation are neglected for example power and water use equations may be coupled when the power and water are supplied to the same group of residents however in this study the power is supplied to residents living in the danjiangkou region whereas the water is transferred to water recipient regions in north china plain i e the interconnections between power and water use equations are relatively weak 6 conclusions this study attempts to incorporate the feedbacks among the states of water supply power generation and environment wpe systems reservoir decisions and stakeholders preferences into the wpe nexus to explore the operation of reservoirs dynamically within the nexus framework our efforts for obtaining coevolution trajectories of the wpe nexus involve the following 1 five differential equations are established to describe the dynamics of wpe states 2 a multi objective optimization model is used to optimize the reservoir behavior and 3 two response linkages are formulated to depict interactions between operational decisions and wpe systems the middle route of south to north water transfer project mr snwtp is used as a study system to examine the coevolution properties of the wpe nexus furthermore the shifts in reservoir behaviors are evaluated the role of response linkages in feedback loops are verified and the sensitivity of the model parameters is analyzed finally the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the legacy effects of interactions feedbacks and stage wise performance in the connected wpe systems can be modelled by using the proposed response linkages the legacy effects imply that long term effects of reservoir operations should be considered carefully in the planning and management of water resources systems the stage wise performance of connected wpe systems highlights the importance of periodical adjustments or updating in reservoir operation policies 2 the changes in wpe states and decision preferences result in the shifting in reservoir behaviors i e the tradeoffs across wpe systems and operational decisions this highlights the importance of re evaluating the tradeoffs and updating the policies for the danjiangkou reservoir periodically and on a regular basis 3 different parameters change the trajectory of a particular variable in different patterns moreover the control parameter that may change the stable state of a particular variable can be identified with these control parameters the stable states of wpe systems and reservoir behaviors could be controlled and unexpected shifts in the stable states can be avoided for instance the population in beijing is shifted from high level to low level states as the minimum acceptable percentage for water power use quota w decreases the wpe nexus for the case of the mr snwtp is modeled by incorporating the interactions between the involved wpe systems and the danjiangkou reservoir the response linkages are established to describe the interactions and feedbacks based on empirical experiences and hypothetical assumptions thus the goal of this study is to explore the future possibility space of reservoir operations within the nexus framework although realistic data are not available to capture the details of these response linkages since the commissioning of the middle route of the snwtp started at the end of year 2014 the established model provides a plausible approach to think about how reservoir operations can be adapted to the nexus framework to better simulate this wpe nexus the interactions and feedbacks between the danjiangkou reservoir and the involved wpe systems require

6435,reservoir operation plays an important role in the coevolution of the nexus across water supply power generation and environment wpe systems this paper aims to contribute to the state of the art in how multi objective reservoir operation can be modeled within the framework of the wpe nexus by incorporating the interactions among reservoirs operation stakeholders decision preferences and wpe systems specifically five ordinary differential equations are used to describe the dynamics of wpe states these dynamics are driven by a multi objective optimization model that optimizes reservoir operation decisions two novel response linkages that describe how the reservoir operational decisions influence socio economic variables and how the environmental awareness influences stakeholders preference for reservoir operation are proposed in this study the middle route of china s south to north water transfer project is selected as the case study the results show that 1 response linkages are effective in describing the interactions between reservoir operational decisions and wpe systems 2 tradeoffs across wpe systems and reservoir operational decisions shift from stage to stage because of the changing socio economic conditions and 3 the control parameter that dominates the shift in stable levels of a given variable can be identified these results highlight the importance of re evaluating involved tradeoff effects and updating of operational policies periodically and how our modeling approach can be used to detect and guide such adaptions keywords adaptive reservoir operation wpe nexus response linkage coevolution 1 introduction reservoirs are essential components of interconnected water supply power generation and environment wpe systems hunt et al 2018 perrone and hornberger 2016 uen et al 2018 conventionally a reservoir is operated by specifying the water available for each individual subsystem beh et al 2015 li et al 2014 and the tradeoff and synergistic effects between subsystems can be explored by examining the reservoir behaviors perrone and hornberger 2016 uen et al 2018 recently the significance of reservoirs has been highlighted in the context of interconnected systems with their interdependencies intensified by human activities e g population growth and increased demands on water and power feng et al 2016 perrone and hornberger 2016 sivapalan et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 thus reservoir operations should be adapted to a nexus framework such that these interconnected subsystems can be better investigated feng et al 2016 sivapalan et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 within the nexus framework attention should be paid not only to how reservoir operations will determine the evolution of related subsystems which has been widely investigated in existing literature liu et al 2011a rheinheimer et al 2016 yang et al 2015 yin et al 2011 but also to how the involved subsystems will affect reservoir operations which has been less explored hoff 2011 montanari 2015 montanari et al 2013 the need to study this feedback linkage from subsystems to reservoir operations motivates our research on how reservoirs can be operated more properly by incorporating the influences of the connected subsystems the interconnected systems have been investigated in various frameworks such as integrated water resources management iwrm eum et al 2012 yaeger et al 2014 coupled human nature systems chns liu et al 2007a liu et al 2007b and socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 within these frameworks reservoir models generally fit in one of two categories i e 1 static models where the reservoir operating rules or optimization strategies are fixed and prescribed by stakeholders and managers eum and simonovic 2010 rheinheimer et al 2016 yang et al 2015 zhou and guo 2013 2 adaptive dynamic models where the operating rules or optimization strategies can adjust evolve adaptively as responses to the changes of other systems baldassarre et al 2015 di baldassarre et al 2017 wang et al 2014 specifically static reservoir models connect other systems simply by input output relationships and the impacts of other systems on reservoirs are usually examined by scenario analysis eum et al 2012 perrone and hornberger 2016 rheinheimer et al 2016 in contrast dynamic reservoir models behave like endogenous components of holistic systems and they connect other systems by two way feedbacks baldassarre et al 2015 di baldassarre et al 2017 in this way the performance of reservoirs can not only change but also be changed by the behaviors of other systems di baldassarre et al 2017 notably the changes in reservoir behaviors are mainly attributed to the evolution of human values and norms di baldassarre et al 2017 roobavannan et al 2017 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 which is the key to modelling reservoirs as dynamic components within the nexus framework within the nexus framework most reservoirs are embedded in a multi objective context and are operated to mediate the conflicts of water demands from multiple sectors e g water supply power generation goicoechea et al 1982 liu et al 2009 liu et al 2014 marler and arora 2009 yang et al 2015 in this context the evolution in human values and norms is reflected by changes in the preferences on different objectives baldassarre et al 2015 di baldassarre et al 2017 mason et al 2018 roobavannan et al 2017 swartz 2006 in particular mason et al 2018 presented the choice of best decisions as a negotiation process and pointed out the changes in decision preferences when the reservoir system is exposed to changing external forcing such as extreme drought and flood events di baldassarre et al 2017 modelled the changes in preferences on flood control and water conservation based on the dynamics of community s memories on flood and drought events generally the dynamics of human values and norms driven by both natural and human systems are now commonly modelled in the context of socio hydrology see more examples in elshafei et al 2014 elshafei et al 2015b chen et al 2016 and roobavannan et al 2017 following the framework proposed in elshafei et al 2014 the dynamics of decision preferences on multiple objectives are incorporated into the interconnected systems such that reservoirs can be adapted to the nexus modelling the interaction between water demands from multiple sectors and reservoir operational consequences is another issue to be addressed for the purpose of adapting reservoir operations to the nexus modelling in contrast to conventional studies where water demands are external inputs that cannot be affected by reservoir operations liu et al 2011a yang et al 2015 in the nexus modelling water demands perform as endogenous components and may change and be changed by reservoir operational decisions elshafei et al 2014 montanari et al 2013 van emmerik et al 2014 for instance feng et al 2016 revealed that water and power uses coevolve continuously and result in emergent behaviors within the wpe nexus rheinheimer et al 2016 emphasized that newly accounted environmental flow requires the re design of reservoir operations in the context of multi objective reservoirs the changes in the tradeoffs across multiple objectives can be quantified to understand behaviors of involved reservoirs hurford et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 therefore within the nexus framework the behaviors of multi objective reservoirs are investigated by assessing the shifts in tradeoffs across objectives which is complicated by the endogenous dynamics of water demands that are interacting with operation decisions this paper aims to adapt reservoir operations to the wpe nexus by capturing both the endogenous dynamics of water demands and decision preferences in this study trajectories of wpe states in the near future are projected by a system dynamics model which is a simple formal way of capturing the dynamics and feedbacks across different systems baldassarre et al 2015 feng et al 2016 forrester 1971 qi and chang 2011 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 wang et al 2012 a multi objective reservoir optimization model is used to assess the tradeoffs across different objectives as well as to select the best decision considering the preferences of stakeholders following the concepts of response functions in studies of van emmerik et al 2014 and elshafei et al 2014 two novel response linkages are proposed to capture the interactions across wpe systems reservoir operation and stakeholders preferences as a result the reservoir operations are explored specifically in the context of the wpe nexus where the reservoir is operated dynamically by considering the dynamics of water demands and decision preferences this study aims to provide an exploratory tool that can better inform policy makers regarding how the complex interconnections involved in the wpe subsystems and reservoir operation shape future possibilities in the wpe nexus the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study area of the middle route of south to north water transfer project mr snwtp is introduced in section 3 the wpe nexus is established with three main components i e governing equations for wpe systems a multi objective optimization model and two response linkages in section 4 behaviors of the above three components for the wpe nexus are analyzed in section 5 sensitivity analysis of model parameters is conducted to verify how different parameters behave to control the coevolution trajectories of the wpe nexus further the impacts of decision preference uncertainty and the simplification of endogenous dynamics are also discussed finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 study area the context of our study is provided by the case of the mr snwtp fig 1 in china which delivers water from water rich south china to arid north china via a 1432 km long canal feng et al 2007 wang et al 2006 wang and ma 1999 zhang 2009 our study system is composed of the water supply system in water recipient regions i e the north china plain the hydropower system of the danjiangkou reservoir i e power generation system and the downstream hydrological regime i e environment system which is investigated as a wpe nexus furthermore the danjiangkou reservoir is the reservoir that connects these three subsystems and thus should be operated dynamically within the framework of a nexus approach the mr snwtp diverts water from the danjiangkou reservoir on the han river which is the largest tributary of the yangtze river to the water stressed areas of the north china plain and it has an annual average water diversion capacity of 9 5 billion m3 yang et al 2015 zhou and guo 2013 the beneficial area of the mr snwtp covers 17 cities in four provinces municipalities feng et al 2007 wang and ma 1999 which are listed in supplementary material s1 the danjiangkou reservoir is located in the middle reach of the han river and plays an important role in flood control water supply and power generation with its relevant parameters shown in table 1 the han river passes through the shanxi and hubei provinces and joins the yangtze river at wuhan city with a length of 1570 km and an area of 159 000 km2 the basin has a sub tropical monsoon climate with the annual precipitation varying from 700 to 1100 mm of which 70 80 of the total amount occurs in the wet season from may to september 2 1 system conceptualization the operation of the danjiangkou reservoir aims to mediate the potential water conflicts involved in the wpe systems as specified above in response to reservoir operations the wpe system states e g population power use quota water use quota and etc change with time in return the reservoir operation is also affected by the changes in wpe states which reflect not only the changing demands but also the changing preferences of involved stakeholders the interactions between wpe states and the danjiangkou reservoir can be described by a series of feedbacks which form closed feedback loops as illustrated in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 our study system involves two feedback loops which are formed by decision state d s and environmental awareness preference e α response linkages respectively delineated by the red dashed arrows the first feedback loop describes the iterative feedback between the operations of the danjiangkou reservoir and wpe states the danjiangkou reservoir decides the amounts of water for the water recipient regions hydropower generation and environment systems which change the wpe states such as population levels carrying capacity and quotas of water and power use in return these state variables together update the demands for water power and environment which are major components of the objectives of the reservoir optimization model in this way the reservoir decisions in previous periods affect the decisions in the subsequent process through the feedback loop the second feedback loop describes the two way feedbacks between the reservoir operations and stakeholders preferences one of the direct consequences of reservoir operations is the alteration in hydrological regimes e g eutrophication chen and zhang 2015 peng et al 2016 after perceiving the degraded environment human community change their attitudes towards different systems accordingly in the reservoir operations decision preferences for different objectives will be changed dynamically human attitudes are captured by the concept of environmental awareness see details in section 3 1 4 which is a variable that increases as the environment degrades and decreases otherwise 2 2 data sources the main data available and their sources are presented in supplementary material s2 the socio economic data originate from the yearbooks and bulletins and can be obtained through the statistical database of china s economic and social development http data cnki net these historical data are used to predict future trajectories of the socio economic variables e g population quotas of power and water use for the danjiangkou reservoir 56 years of streamflow data 1955 2010 are available since the impounding of the danjiangkou reservoir started from 1967 certainly changes the natural flow regime streamflow statistics i e mean variance seasonality and etc after the impounding 1968 2010 are inconsistent with those before the impounding 1955 1967 the streamflow data for 1968 2010 needs restoration to mitigate the impacts of reservoir operations on streamflow such that the streamflow statistics before and after the impounding are consistent more details of the restoration from regulated to natural streamflow can be found in deng et al 2015 it should be noticed that the commissioning of the mr snwtp started from the end of 2014 and thus the data describing the related feedbacks in the wpe nexus are not yet available therefore our goal is to explore plausible future possibility of wpe nexus by incorporating hypothetical feedbacks that are reasonable but ignored in conventional practices as a result this study provides an exploratory tool for stakeholders or policy makers by considering the complex interconnections which is distinguished from a tool that helps understand the exact details of the local wpe nexus 3 methods our wpe nexus model consists of three main components fig 3 1 a system dynamics model of wpe systems describing the dynamics of wpe states 2 a multi objective reservoir optimization model optimizing decisions that consider the tradeoffs across multiple objectives 3 two response linkages describing the interactions and feedbacks between wpe states reservoir operations and stakeholders preferences 3 1 wpe systems the dynamics of wpe states are described by five ordinary differential equations with each describing the variation of a specific system state the five state variables of wpe systems are summarized in table 2 specifically population and water use quotas are defined for four different water recipient regions in this section the impacts of reservoir operations on wpe states are not taken into consideration which will be further addressed in section 3 3 3 1 1 reservoir system the wpe systems are intrinsically linked by the water balance equation of the danjiangkou reservoir which indicates that the variation of reservoir storage equals the difference between inflow and outflow i e 1 dv dt i d v p v l e where v is the reservoir storage that changes with time t i is the reservoir inflow dv is the total water delivery for water recipient regions pv is the water used for hydropower generation l is the spilled water that is released when the storage exceeds its capacity which cannot be used for any beneficial uses such as water supply or hydropower generation e is the evaporation and seepage for the danjiangkou reservoir the evaporation and seepage e is considered as a function of reservoir storage or water surface area which is provided in the supplementary material table s6 1 since the water used for hydropower generation is non consumptive i e it is also released to downstream the water available to maintain the downstream ecological environment equals the sum of the water used for hydropower generation and reservoir spill the amounts of water releases i e dv pv and l are determined by a multi objective optimization model that is elaborated in section 3 2 3 1 2 water supply system the water supply system refers to the water recipient regions along the mr snwtp the province or municipality is taken as the unit of water recipient region for the analysis for each of the water recipient regions the dynamics of the population and water use quota are formulated as two differential equations to track their trajectories 3 1 2 1 population equation the logistic model has been widely used to describe population dynamics with limited resources feng et al 2016 jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 kingsland 1982 meyer and ausubel 1999 increasingly constrained by water resources availability the population dynamics in water recipient regions fit within the scope of the logistic model thus the population dynamics for a particular water recipient region can be represented as follows 2 d n s w dt r s n n s w 1 n s w k s s t 1 where n s w is the population of water recipient region s k s s t 1 is the average carrying capacity of water recipient region s during the planning stage st 1 with one stage time lag that describes the legacy effect of the carrying capacity on the population r s n is the natural growth rate of population within water recipient region s which is set as time variant because the natural growth of population is closely related to the continuously changing socio economic conditions this time variant natural growth rate is obtained by fitting from historical data of populations in each water recipient region see results in table 4 i e socio economic conditions are specified exogenously 3 1 2 2 water use equation because of the complexity in the variations in water use quota which may involve various socio economic factors such as population levels technology infrastructure and education here for simplicity we attempt to project the level and trend observed from historical data of water use per capita to those of water use quota as shown in fig s3 2 in supplementary material historical data indicate that the water use per capita is decreasing and the changing rate is also decreasing i e the first derivative is negative and the second derivative is positive the observed trends can be explained as follows 1 the water use per capita is decreasing because of advances in technology and other incentives that help save water 2 the decreasing changing rate is caused by the increasing difficulty of saving water in light of the need to maintain living conditions with the above observations the trajectory of water use quota can be modeled by the following differential equations 3 d u s dt r s w e φ w t where us is the water use quota r s w is the nominal growth rate of water use quota and e φ w t is used to depict the water saving effect of advanced technology which is assumed to be decreasing with time t if the application of newly introduced technology cannot cause the revolution in water consumption it is reasonable to assume that water use quota is decreased to a basic level which represents the minimum water demands at the end of the study horizon i e time t meanwhile the decreasing rate of water use quota is approaching zero technological development is therefore exogenously determined in this model at time t the reduction in water use quota can be described by a percentage τ s w such that the terminal conditions can be formulated as follows 4 d u s dt t t 0 u s t 1 τ s w u s 0 where u s t and u s 0 are the water use quotas of water recipient region s at time t and initial time respectively with conditions specified in eq 4 the analytical solution of eq 3 can be resolved approximately as follows 5 u s t u s 0 τ s w u s 0 1 e 2 996 t t where u s t is the water use quota of water recipient region s at time t in eq 5 the reduction percentage τ s w is the only parameter to be estimated 3 1 3 power generation system for a given power generation system the power can be conveyed to any region in china through the national power grid such that the boundary of this system is difficult to ascertain to overcome this difficulty a concept of virtual community is proposed to describe the scale of the power generation system the virtual community of a given power generation system is defined as a group of people that consumes the power generated from this system and it can be characterized by its population size and power use per capita 3 1 3 1 population of virtual community empirically the hydropower generated from the danjiangkou reservoir is mainly consumed by people in hubei province such that the population size of corresponding virtual community can be estimated through historical data i e the annual average power generation of the danjiangkou reservoir and power use per capita of hubei province moreover the population size of the virtual community can be assumed to be invariant based on the following observations 1 the natural growth rate of the population in hubei province is small i e average value of 3 5 over year 2000 2014 2 the increase in power demand is mainly attributed to the increase of power use per capita that is related to domestic agricultural and industrial factors li et al 2010 3 1 3 2 power use equation the variation of power use quota is caused by the combined effect of various factors such as domestic agricultural and industrial power uses for simplicity power use quota is assumed to capture the changing pattern of power use per capita observed from historical data as shown in fig s3 3 in supplementary material the historical data indicate increases in power use per capita of hubei province and china but decreases in their changing rates this changing pattern can be explained as follows 1 the power use increases due to the improvement of the living standard 2 the changing rate decreases because of the higher power saving awareness with better living condition and decreasing importance of marginal power needs with above observations the trajectory of power use quota in the near future can be modeled by the following differential equation 6 dg dt r g e φ g t where g is the power use quota r g is the nominal growth rate and e φ g t describes the power saving effects which decrease the growth rate and changes with time t similar to the case for the water use quota if the application of newly introduced technology does not lead to a revolution in power consumption the power use quota reaches its maximum level at time t meanwhile the changing rate approaches zero the increased power use quota can be expressed by a percentage τ g such that the terminal conditions can be formulated as follows 7 g t 1 τ g g 0 dg dt t t 0 where g 0 and g t are the power use quota at initial time and time t respectively with this terminal condition as specified in eq 7 the analytical solution to eq 6 can be obtained approximately as follows 8 g t g 0 τ g g 0 1 e 2 996 t t where g t is the power use quota at time t as indicated by eq 8 τ g is the only parameter to be estimated 3 1 3 3 power generation the power output is determined by the equation pg max γ p v h p max h where pv is the water volume in unit time supplied for hydropower generation h is the net water head and p max gives the maximum power output that is constrained by the turbine generator unit γ is the comprehensive hydropower coefficient and has been widely used in the field of reservoir operations it describes the efficiency of the turbine generator unit with the same unit as gravitational acceleration feng et al 2017 liu et al 2011b liu et al 2014 3 1 4 environmental system the operations of the danjiangkou reservoir have caused the degradation of the downstream aquatic environment and the reduction in faunal diversity chen and zhang 2015 peng et al 2016 one possible indicator is the annual proportional flow deviation apfd a measure that describes the degree of regulation of a river gehrke et al 1995 white and ladson 1999 yin et al 2011 moreover the apfd was found to be negatively correlated with fish species diversity in 4 regulated rivers in the new south wales portion of the murray darling basin gehrke et al 1995 as shown in the work of gehrke et al 1995 the square of the deviation between natural and regulated flow i e r r i i 2 is the evaluation of apfd for a given instant and thus is adopted here to reflect the instant streamflow regulation by reservoir operations the environmental quality or ecosystem service could also be quantified based on a 7 year moving average of fish species richness fsr as in the work of roobavannan et al 2017 essentially these two indicators both quantify the extent of regulation of a particular river and can be used to evaluate the environment quality in this study the instant evaluation of apfd is adopted because it is simple and does not introduce additional parameters environmental awareness and community sensitivity are two terms that indicate a community s attitude towards external conditions e g climate politics and economics elshafei et al 2015a elshafei et al 2014 feng et al 2016 van emmerik et al 2014 community sensitivity describes people s attitudes towards human activity and environmental restoration chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017 environmental awareness describes the perceived threat of system collapse and it accumulates when the system performance is below a threshold but lapses otherwise van emmerik et al 2014 environmental awareness is considered to be more specific than community sensitivity it is adopted here with its dynamics formulated as follows 9 de dt κ r r crit η r r crit ω e r r crit where e is environmental awareness r crit is the critical value of r above which the environmental deterioration would be perceived κ and η are the perception factors describing the community s ability to identify threats of degradation ω is the lapse factor representing a decreasing rate of environmental awareness over time 3 2 multi objective reservoir optimization model 3 2 1 objectives for the reservoir optimization model three objectives are formulated 1 water shortage index wsi 2 power shortage index psi and 3 hydrological alteration index hai this multi objective model is established to 1 assess the tradeoffs across wpe systems with the pareto frontier and 2 determine the best operational decision at each time step with given decision preferences shortage indices hsu and cheng 2002 tu et al 2008 zhao et al 2012 are used to formulate the objectives of water supply and power generation systems which are shown as follows 10 min w s i 1 t r 0 t r ws wd 2 d t 11 min p s i 1 t r 0 t r ps pd 2 d t where t r is the time length of reservoir operation horizon ws and wd are water shortage and demand respectively ps and pd are power shortage and demand respectively both wsi and psi are calculated in relative terms water and power demand are obtained by multiplying population n s w and n p and use quotas u s and g for the water recipient region virtual community as calculated in section 3 3 1 therefore taking into account impacts of water and power shortages in previous stages the formulas for the calculation of water and power demands are presented as follows 12 wd s 1 4 w d s w d s n s w u s 13 pd n p g power shortage is simply the shortfall between demand and generation 14 ps max pd p g 0 water shortage is the sum of shortages from four water recipient regions which needs to take into account both the local water availability and water delivery i e 15 ws s 1 4 w s s w s s max w d s a w s d v s 0 where w s s w d s a w s and d v s are water shortage water demand and locally available water and local water delivery respectively for water recipient regions s 1 2 3 and 4 corresponding to henan province hebei province beijing municipality and tianjin municipality respectively in particular the local water delivery d v s is determined by distributing the total water delivery to water recipient regions which is proportional to the contribution of local water shortages i e the shortfall between local water demand and available water to the total water shortage i e 16 d v s w d s a w s s 1 4 w d s a w s d v it should be noticed that water deliveries for each region eq 16 are used directly in the calculation of carrying capacity section 3 3 1 and the total water delivery dv is reduced by the water losses in the main channel of the mr snwtp which is accounted by multiplying with a reduction coefficient i e 0 7356 the details of the reduction coefficient are provided in the supplementary material s6 following the work of wu and zhang 2002 the apfd is an ecologically embedded index reflecting the degree of hydrological alteration in aquatic environment thus it is selected as the environmental objective and can be simply termed as hydrological alteration index hai 17 min h a i 1 l 2 0 l 2 0 l 1 r i i 2 d l 1 1 2 d l 2 where r and i are the regulated and natural river flow respectively l 1 and l 2 are the time length of a single year and the number of the years in the reservoir operation horizon respectively in addition the product of parameters l 1 and l 2 equals the reservoir operation horizon t r i e t r l 1 l 2 3 2 2 tradeoffs and operational decisions 3 2 2 1 evaluation of the tradeoffs across systems the tradeoff across wpe systems can be evaluated effectively by using a pareto frontier which describes a set of non dominated optimal solutions where none is better than any other on all objectives i e for a given pareto optimal solution any one of the three objectives cannot be improved without sacrificing the other objectives beh et al 2015 burke and kendall 2014 liu et al 2009 liu et al 2011a reddy and kumar 2007 yang et al 2015 generally three main methods can be used to obtain the pareto frontiers evolutionary algorithms liu et al 2011a reddy and kumar 2007 the ε constraint method haimes et al 1971 and the weighted sum method burke and kendall 2014 marler and arora 2009 although all three methods have the capability of finding the pareto optimal solutions the weighted sum method is adopted here because 1 the evolutionary algorithms are time consuming and prone to converging to local optima burke and kendall 2014 liu et al 2011a 2 the continuous curve surface of pareto frontiers are difficult to obtain with ε constraint methods with the weighted sum method the pareto optimal solutions is resolved by repeating the optimization process of the weighted objective with the weights varied for each run marler and arora 2009 the weighted objective can be formulated as follows 18 min 1 α β wsi w s i min ws i max w s i min β psi p s i min ps i max p s i min α hai h a i min ha i max h a i min where α and β are the decision preferences for environmental protection and power generation respectively ws i max and ws i min are the maximum and minimum of water shortage indices respectively ps i max and ps i min are the maximum and minimum of power shortage indices respectively ha i max and ha i min are the maximum and minimum of hydrological alteration indices respectively as indicated by eqs 10 11 and 17 all above three indices i e wsi psi and hai range between 0 and 1 thus the maximum and minimum of these three indices are set as 1 and 0 respectively previous literature showed that the optimized solution of the weighted objective eq 18 is always pareto optimal provided that 1 all the objectives are concave and 2 the weights are all positive goicoechea et al 1982 marler and arora 2009 zadeh 1963 since the objectives are difficult to be proven as concave or convex the pareto optimal solutions can be screened out by applying the non dominated sorting process to candidate solutions that are preliminarily obtained by optimizing eq 18 the decision preferences α and β can be generated randomly with the conditions of 0 α β α β 1 a value of one for α β or 1 α β indicates the complete preference on one objective over the other two for a given combination of decision preferences the weighted objective is optimized by using dynamic programming the detailed formulation of the dynamic programming for the above optimization problem is provided in the supplementary material s4 3 2 2 2 operational decisions with preferences for each time step a single best decision is selected among all non dominated alternatives on the pareto optimal frontier to transfer system states from current to consecutive time step this best operational decision is selected with given decision preferences which may change as the wpe systems coevolve the variation of decision preference α is closely related to the environmental awareness e with their relationship conceptualized as an e α response linkage that is elaborated in section 3 3 2 the decision preferences on power generation β and water supply 1 α β also change as the wpe systems coevolve and their variations are related to α by a parameter θ 0 θ 1 the priority of power generation over water supply systems θ 0 indicates a complete preference on water supply against power generation while θ 1 represents a complete preference on power generation against water supply for a given preference for the environment α the preferences for power generation and water supply can therefore be specified as β θ 1 α and 1 α β 1 θ 1 α respectively considering the fact that water supply to north china is more important than hydropower generation β 1 3 1 α is initially selected to explore the behaviors of the wpe nexus since the priority level will certainly affect the coevolution of the wpe systems different levels of priority θ are adopted to assess the impacts of uncertainty from these two decision preferences as shown in section 5 2 3 3 response linkages two response linkages d s and e α are established to describe the interactions between reservoir operations and wpe states closing the feedback loops of the wpe nexus as shown in fig 2 3 3 1 response link the d s response link describes how the operational decision d affects the wpe states s which includes the carrying capacity of the water recipient regions and quotas of water and power use the carrying capacity k s in the water recipient region s is closely related to its water availability which is increased by the water delivery d v s from the mr snwtp harris and kennedy 1999 hui 2006 meyer and ausubel 1999 seidl and tisdell 1999 intuitively carrying capacity would be the size of the population whose needs quotas can be satisfied 19 k s s t a w s dv s s t u s where k s s t is the carrying capacity of the water recipient region s in stage st dv s s t is the average water delivery in stage st denoting the original carrying capacity of water recipient region s as k s 0 i e k s 0 a w s u s eq 19 can be further expressed as follows 20 k s s t a w s dv s s t a w s a w s u s 1 dv s s t a w s k s 0 however this relationship might be altered by socio economic effects the changes in carrying capacity could be modeled as a logistic process by taking the adaption into consideration meyer and ausubel 1999 but for simplicity the adaption process is neglected herein to decrease the model complexity such that the carrying capacity can be formulated as a nonlinear function of resource availability i e 21 k s s t 1 dv s s t a w s σ s k s 0 the parameter σ s 0 σ s 1 reflects the socio economic effects on the carrying capacity if σ s equals 1 the carrying capacity is linearly proportional to water availability and eq 21 is equivalent to eq 20 or 19 otherwise the socio economic factors affect the carrying capacity of water recipient regions negatively the increases in the water resource have a less than proportional effect on carrying capacity moreover a smaller σ s indicates a larger impact of socio economic factors on the carrying capacity the shortages in previous time periods affect subsequent water and power use quotas which can be formulated as follows 22 u s w 1 w e λ w wsi st 1 u s 23 g w 1 w e λ g psi st 1 g where u s and u s are the water use quotas for water recipient region s with and without considering the impacts of previous water shortage respectively g and g are the power use quotas with and without considering the impacts of previous power shortage respectively wsi st 1 and psi st 1 are the average water and power shortage indices respectively at stage st 1 the one stage time lag reflects the legacy effect of the impacts of shortages λ w and λ g are the scaling factors for the quotas of water and power uses respectively w is the parameter that specifies the ratio of minimum acceptable water power use quota to its predicted value i e w u s and wg are the minimum acceptable water and power use quotas respectively the minimum acceptable water power use quota refers to the level that should be kept to sustain basic living conditions 3 3 2 response link the e α response linkage depicts the relationship between environmental awareness e and decision preference α following the prototype framework proposed in the work of elshafei et al 2014 empirically a community with a higher environmental awareness is prone to focus more on environment centric rather than anthropocentric actions water supply and power generation thus a hypothetical relationship between environmental awareness e and decision preference α is assumed as follows 24 α 1 1 α 0 exp ε e e crit e e crit α 0 e e crit where ε is the factor describing the changing rate of the preference with respective to environmental awareness this hypothetical relationship is illustrated intuitively in fig 4 i e α 0 is the minimum level of α which remains unchanged when environmental awareness is below a critical value e crit otherwise the preference α increases to its maximum value i e 1 3 4 implementation of the wpe nexus model before implementing our wpe nexus model the following two aspects need to be clarified 1 the time horizons involved in the wpe nexus and 2 the setting of reservoir inflow the time horizons in the wpe nexus include the study horizon planning horizon i e planning stage and reservoir operation horizon the study horizon is the time period within which the coevolution of the wpe nexus is studied it is set as the year 2016 2050 because the near future impacts of the mr snwtp are of great concern the planning horizon refers to the time period within which the decision preferences remain unchanged it is set as 5 years corresponding to the reality of stage wise adjustments in macro scale policies in china the reservoir operation horizon refers to the time period for one single run of the multi objective optimization model and it is set as the time length of the streamflow data the historical streamflow observations split by year are taken as an ensemble of predictions of the reservoir inflow in the near future assuming that the characteristics of future streamflow are captured by the historical data that is for a particular year 56 year streamflow data 1955 2010 are utilized as all possible reservoir inflows and the annual average values of optimization results e g water delivery hydropower generation and shortage indices are obtained to assess the average levels of tradeoffs and operational decisions the wpe nexus model is then run stage by stage with a schematic describing two consecutive stages shown in fig 5 the detailed procedures can be elaborated as follows 1 initializing the wpe nexus the state variables in the wpe nexus are initialized based on historical data the model parameters are obtained by the trial and error method or estimated empirically such that the trends of simulated trajectories match well with those indicated by factual data 2 updating the carryover variables at the beginning of the stage the carryover variables refer to the variables that are obtained from previous stage and will certainly affect the coevolution of wpe nexus in the subsequent stage here the carryover variables consist of the average shortage indices of water and power and decision preference i e wsi psi and α 3 simulating the trajectories of wpe states with the updated carryover variables the wpe states within the current stage are simulated with the system dynamics model 4 optimizing reservoir behaviors within the stage the tradeoffs across wpe systems are identified by resolving the pareto frontiers the operational decisions are selected from the pareto frontier with the given decision preferences 5 repeating steps from 2 to 4 until all the stages are finished for ease of implementation the continuous form of wpe nexus is discretized and attached in appendix a meanwhile the continuous form of the wpe nexus is summarized in supplementary material s7 4 results the proposed model is implemented to obtain the coevolutionary behaviors of the wpe nexus the state variables are initialized as in table 2 the parameters are set in table 3 and the detailed functions describing the variations in state variables are presented in table 4 as a result the shifts in reservoir behaviors are addressed and the feedbacks related to response linkages are illustrated 4 1 coevolution of the wpe nexus the coevolution trajectories of the wpe nexus are obtained and illustrated in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 for a particular state variable the pattern of change is constant within in a single stage i e 5 years but varies for different stages and finally converges to a stable or quasi stable state at the end of the simulation time horizon i e the variations of system states are small and near zero the convergence of the wpe nexus to a quasi stable state occurs because a the exogenous force of streamflow is set as stationary i e for a particular year the 56 year streamflow data 1955 2010 are utilized as all possible reservoir inflows b the rates of change in power and water use quotas are approaching zero as specified by eq 7 this means that the rates of change in exogeneous driving force and certain endogenous components are small at the end of the study horizon which allows a stable or quasi stable state to be achieved the final stable state also implies the balance of these two feedback loops that drive reservoir operations to two opposite directions as indicated by fig 2 the variation in changing patterns can be explained by the co evolving strategies when the carryover variables are updated at the beginning of each stage furthermore three important observations are obtained as follows firstly the water supply system competes for water for the power generation and environment systems as shown in fig 6 b a small wsi is accompanied by large hai and psi revealing the competition of water uses between water supply and power generation environment system a small wsi indicates a high satisfaction degree of the demands in water recipient regions i e a large part of water that was originally for sustaining the environment and generating hydropower is transferred by the snwtp thus the environment system deteriorates and power demands cannot be satisfied resulting in large values of hai and psi the trade off between water supply and power generation and or the environment protection can be obtained by optimization and the extent of trade off denoted by spread range of the pareto frontier between these two objectives is expected to be reduced with co evolved decision preferences i e more equal decision preferences imply fewer extreme points on the pareto frontier the simultaneous changes in psi and hai either increase or decrease can be explained by the fact that the water used for hydropower generation is also released to sustain the downstream ecological health secondly a legacy effect across different wpe states can be observed in the coevolution trajectories which is in accordance with our experiences and the existing literature elshafei et al 2015a feng et al 2016 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 the legacy effect is reflected by a 5 year time delay i e a planning stage between the operational results wsi psi and hai and the evolution of wpe systems a large value of wsi fig 6b is followed by a decrease in population levels fig 6c and an acceleration in the decrease of water use quota indicated by the increases in the slope of the water use quota curves fig 6d similarly a large value of psi fig 6b is followed by a decrease in power use quota fig 6e conversely a small value of wsi indicates the subsequent increase in population and decrease in the changing rate of water use quota a small value of psi indicates the subsequent increase in the changing rate of power use quota thirdly this wpe nexus model has the capability of mimicking the stage wise adjustments in policy as shown in fig 6 the stage wise behaviors are obvious in the coevolution trajectories revealing that the related policies are adjusted stage by stage essentially the policy is indicated by response linkages which is incorporated into the modeling process by updating carryover variables at the beginning of each stage moreover the changing decision preferences result in a need to adjust the operating policy for the danjiangkou reservoir fig 6 a shows the continuous change in the decision preference α but operating policy does not change continuously because of the high expense of doing so in practice 4 2 shifts of reservoir behaviors within the framework of the wpe nexus reservoir behaviors change as wpe systems coevolve which is reflected by 1 the shifts in tradeoffs across systems and 2 the shifts in operational decisions as a preliminary example the pareto optimal solutions in year 2016 fig 7 are illustrated to show the tradeoffs across objectives of wpe systems as shown in fig 7 a one of the objectives is improved by sacrificing either of the other two objectives fig 7 b d show the tradeoffs of pair wise objectives with the third objective depicted by color the relationship across these three objectives can be stated as 1 both wsi and psi decrease as the hai increases and 2 either the decrease in wsi or psi will increase the hai though with a non linear relationship the shifts in tradeoffs across wpe systems are illustrated by the evolving pareto frontiers fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a e the pareto frontiers in different stages reveal quantitative changes in the tradeoff relations in general the change in tradeoffs may be attributed to 1 the changes in reservoir inflow and or 2 the change in the demands quantified by the wpe states in our study the streamflow is set as the same for the operations of all the years i e for each year 56 year streamflow data are taken as the input to evaluate the average performance thus the changes in wpe states are the main cause of shifts in pareto frontiers for each stage the operational decision of the danjiangkou reservoir is selected as a point on corresponding pareto frontier given a combination of decision preferences fig 9 shows the shifts in operational decisions from stage to stage as illustrated by the changing locations of circled points on pareto frontiers the shifts in operational decisions are mainly attributed to 1 the changes in wpe states and 2 the dynamic variation of decision preference the changes in wpe states cause the transformation in the shape and change in the location of pareto frontiers while the dynamic variation of decision preference changes the relative location of the decision on corresponding frontiers the shifts of reservoir behaviors highlight for policy makers that both tradeoffs across systems and operational decisions should be re evaluated every several years so that the proposed policy can satisfy the demands at the stage 4 3 response linkages in feedbacks loops in this section the role of response linkages in the coevolution of wpe nexus is illustrated by their corresponding feedback loops the d s response linkage is illustrated by feedback loops related to the carrying capacity fig 10 and water use quota fig 11 the variables in hebei province depicted by the red lines are taken as an example to show these two feedback loops as shown in fig 10 the feedback loop of carrying capacity involves variations in population water demand water supply and carrying capacity at the beginning of coevolution the population is smaller than the carrying capacity and the gap between carrying capacity and population drives the population to approach the capacity in the second stage the increased population level intensifies the water demand meanwhile higher preference is focused on environment protection fig 6 a such that the water supply is decreased here the response linkage takes effect as that the decreased water supply will contribute to the decrease in the carrying capacity of the hebei province consequently the newly induced gap between carrying capacity and population will drive the population to change adaptively indicating a new round of feedback the feedbacks for the other three provinces municipalities can be interpreted similarly as shown in fig 11 the feedback loop of water use quota is composed of variations in water use quota water demand water shortage and wsi in the first stage it is observed that the changes in water demand are consistent with the variation in water use quota in the second stage the water demand is increased although the water use quota decreases and this is caused by the significant increase in population as shown in fig 10 a the increase in water demand intensifies the water shortage as indicated by the significant increase in the wsi in fig 11 d here the response linkage takes effect as a high wsi will decrease the water use quota in the subsequent stage the e α response linkage is illustrated by the feedback loop of decision preference α fig 12 the decision preference α is changing continuously fig 12 a but only affects decision making at the beginning of a stage the e α response linkage is visible in that the trend of decision preference is similar to that of environment awareness in the first stage the initial decision preference is small i e 0 3 and a high preference is put on exploiting more water resources to satisfy the demands of water supply and power generation systems in this stage water supply is kept at a relatively high level and power generation is kept at relatively low level their changes are mainly attributed to the changes in corresponding demand as a result the downstream hydrological regime degrades indicated by a high hai in fig 12 d such that environmental awareness is increased sharply and the decision preference on environment is driven to a high level in the second stage a high preference on environment protection is adopted and consequently the water supply is decreased while the power generation is increased the hydrological regime is improved greatly indicated by a small hai in fig 12 b and d the stage wise changes in water supply and hai are simultaneous indicating that the water supply has a higher influence on the environment than hydropower generation water supply reduces the amount of water released to downstream directly but the hydropower generation only changes the timing of the downstream streamflow 5 discussions 5 1 sensitivity analysis of model parameters sensitivity analysis is conducted to verify the impacts of model parameters on the coevolution trajectories by identifying alternative future scenarios corresponding to various parameters elshafei et al 2014 feng et al 2016 zajac et al 2017 the parameter setting for the sensitivity analysis is presented in table 5 each parameter is varied once by an increment with the other parameters fixed the parameters are varied within the intervals specified by the maximum and minimum values only part of parameters listed in table 3 are selected for analysis because these parameters exert significant influences on model results and are selected based on our experiences the trajectories of environmental awareness are selected as an example which is illustrated in fig 13 the trajectories of power use quota and population in beijing are shown in supplementary material s5 fig s5 1 and s5 2 respectively as shown in fig 13 the trajectories are sensitive to most of these selected parameters implying that the parameters in one system will change the trajectories of state variables in the other systems this illustrates how the wpe systems interact requiring them to be conceptualized as a nexus by comparing the trajectories of different variables two observations can be obtained firstly for a given variable different parameters show different patterns in affecting its trajectory as shown in fig 13 parameters κ and η have more impacts on the trajectory of environmental awareness when it is approaching its peak parameters w and τ s w have more impacts on the trajectory when the it is decreased to a low level parameters α 0 and τ g has little or no impacts on the trajectory critical hydrological alteration r crit and critical environmental awareness e crit are identified as the two most sensitive parameters that change the trajectory in a global pattern a higher e crit drives the trajectory of environmental awareness to evolve to higher values for a higher e crit the decision preference α is more likely to be kept at the initial low level such that more water is utilized for water supply and power generation systems thus the hydrological regimes are degraded and environmental awareness is driven to a high level a higher r crit drives the trajectory to evolve to a lower value a higher r crit indicates higher difficulty in perceiving and capturing the alterations in hydrological regimes such that the environment awareness is more likely to be decreased or driven to a lower level similarly the impacts of these parameters on the other variables can also be observed and interpreted according to figs s5 1 and s5 2 for the power use quota parameters w and τ g are the most sensitive parameters that change the trajectory in a global pattern for the population in beijing parameter w is the most sensitive parameter that changes the trajectory significantly secondly the control parameters that dominate the changes in stable levels of different variables can be identified at the end of the study period the wpe systems and reservoir behaviors are approaching stable states where the states stop changing as indicated by figs 7 and 8 as shown in fig 13 most of the involved parameters can change the stable state of environment awareness and the critical instant hydrological alteration r crit and critical environmental awareness e crit are identified as the most effective parameters for power use quota fig s5 1 although evolving processes are affected by most of parameters only two parameters i e the minimum acceptable percentage for water use quota w and the total reduction in power use quota τ g have the ability to change the stable state similarly for the population in beijing municipality fig s5 2 parameter w is identified as the control parameter that can change the stable state in particular the population in beijing is shifted from high level to low level states as the parameter w decreases by adopting appropriate socio economic measures the stable state of wpe systems and reservoir operations could be controlled and unexpected shifts in the stable states can be avoided 5 2 impacts of decision preferences uncertainty in the current study operational decisions are selected among the alternatives provided by the pareto optimal solutions with given environmental decision preference α and water use priority θ since the decision preference α is determined by the e α response linkage the uncertainty of decision preferences is mainly embedded in the priority θ thus the impacts of uncertainty of decision preferences is examined by comparing the co evolution trajectories with different levels of priority θ from 1 4 to 3 4 fig 14 as observed in fig 14 the general patterns of changes for the trajectories for a given variable are similar with different priorities θ at the beginning each variable has an identical trajectory the population and power use quota start to respond to different levels of priorities at the earliest time followed by the water use quota environmental awareness and preference α for environmental awareness e and decision preference α the priority exerts more impact on their ending levels for other variables the priority exerts more impacts on the middle of changing processes the trajectories of involved variables are insensitive to the priority θ when the adopted decision preference α is large and sensitive to the priority θ only when decision preference α is small the contributions of water shortage power shortage and hydrological alteration to the weighted objective are more controlled by the decision preference α than priority θ intuitively indicated by their definitions which is especially true with the fact that the water release to maintain the hydrological regime ensured by the decision preference α can be simultaneously used for power generation the details can be explained as follows when the decision preference α is large the natural hydrological regime is expected to be maintained by the reservoir release since the water release to maintain the hydrological regime can also be used for power generation there is a large amount of power generation surplus in the flood season and a power generation deficit in non flood season in this manner the power shortage occurs only in the non flood season while the water shortage occurs in the whole year such that the contribution of power shortage to the weighted objective is quite small regardless of the priority level θ as a result the weighted objective is more dominated by the decision preference α and less controlled by the priority θ when the decision preference α is small water release is highly regulated to satisfy the water and power demands where the priority θ plays a significant role in allocating the available water between water supply and power generation moreover the priority θ can also change the hydrological alteration because the water release for power generation is also used to maintain the hydrological regime thus the contributions of water shortage power shortage and hydrological alteration to the weighted objective can all be affected by the priority θ as a result the weighted objective is controlled by both the decision preference α and priority θ 5 3 simplification of endogenous dynamics in the proposed model both the endogenous dynamics of water supply and power generation systems are simplified greatly compared to the existing socio hydrological cases e g pande et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017 pande and pandit 2018 all these simplifications of the endogenous dynamics are based on the primary goal of this study i e to explore future possibilities of reservoir operations within the nexus framework rather than to predict the exact trajectories of the nexus in the near future based on this goal this study attempts to provide policy makers with an explanatory tool to understand the reservoir behaviors within the wpe nexus by incorporating the dynamics of multiple demands and decision preferences the details and implications of these simplifications are discussed as below in particular the dynamics of water use quotas in water recipient regions ignore their dependence on population growth rates which is in contrast to the findings in pande and pandit 2018 this can be justified in two ways 1 water use quota is a designed quantity provided by managers or policy makers to quantify the water demand of a given region and further to determine how much water should be supplied and 2 modelling water use quota as an independent variable is accurate enough for the purpose of projecting water demands in the near future even so the simulation results show that higher population typically results in a higher water demand and a higher water shortage which will cause a larger reduction in water use quota in subsequent stages as shown in figs 6 and 11 this implies that the negative relationship between water use quota and population growth is implicitly embedded in the simulation model which is contrast to the explicit quantification in the work of pande and pandit 2018 the dynamics of water power use quota depicts the impacts of technology simply by using a single parameter rather than describing the interactions between the technology and water power use quota as endogenous dynamics for the dynamics of water use quota the rationale of this simplification on technology is 1 it is representative enough for the purpose of exploring water demands in the near future 2 the primary goal of this study is different to that of pande et al 2014 which aims to test the impacts of endogenous change of technology on the society s response 3 the endogenous dynamics of technology cannot be established and further validated in the water recipient regions due to lack of data for the power use quota its dependence on technology or gdp is justified by the empirically observed positive relationship between power use quota and gdp water supply and power generation are coupled primarily through the regulation of the danjiangkou reservoir additionally the similarities in the improvement rates of water and power use quotas are also likely to be captured because technological development in water and power quotas are both derived from historical data other possible coupling relationships between water supply and power generation are neglected for example power and water use equations may be coupled when the power and water are supplied to the same group of residents however in this study the power is supplied to residents living in the danjiangkou region whereas the water is transferred to water recipient regions in north china plain i e the interconnections between power and water use equations are relatively weak 6 conclusions this study attempts to incorporate the feedbacks among the states of water supply power generation and environment wpe systems reservoir decisions and stakeholders preferences into the wpe nexus to explore the operation of reservoirs dynamically within the nexus framework our efforts for obtaining coevolution trajectories of the wpe nexus involve the following 1 five differential equations are established to describe the dynamics of wpe states 2 a multi objective optimization model is used to optimize the reservoir behavior and 3 two response linkages are formulated to depict interactions between operational decisions and wpe systems the middle route of south to north water transfer project mr snwtp is used as a study system to examine the coevolution properties of the wpe nexus furthermore the shifts in reservoir behaviors are evaluated the role of response linkages in feedback loops are verified and the sensitivity of the model parameters is analyzed finally the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the legacy effects of interactions feedbacks and stage wise performance in the connected wpe systems can be modelled by using the proposed response linkages the legacy effects imply that long term effects of reservoir operations should be considered carefully in the planning and management of water resources systems the stage wise performance of connected wpe systems highlights the importance of periodical adjustments or updating in reservoir operation policies 2 the changes in wpe states and decision preferences result in the shifting in reservoir behaviors i e the tradeoffs across wpe systems and operational decisions this highlights the importance of re evaluating the tradeoffs and updating the policies for the danjiangkou reservoir periodically and on a regular basis 3 different parameters change the trajectory of a particular variable in different patterns moreover the control parameter that may change the stable state of a particular variable can be identified with these control parameters the stable states of wpe systems and reservoir behaviors could be controlled and unexpected shifts in the stable states can be avoided for instance the population in beijing is shifted from high level to low level states as the minimum acceptable percentage for water power use quota w decreases the wpe nexus for the case of the mr snwtp is modeled by incorporating the interactions between the involved wpe systems and the danjiangkou reservoir the response linkages are established to describe the interactions and feedbacks based on empirical experiences and hypothetical assumptions thus the goal of this study is to explore the future possibility space of reservoir operations within the nexus framework although realistic data are not available to capture the details of these response linkages since the commissioning of the middle route of the snwtp started at the end of year 2014 the established model provides a plausible approach to think about how reservoir operations can be adapted to the nexus framework to better simulate this wpe nexus the interactions and feedbacks between the danjiangkou reservoir and the involved wpe systems require

6436,a number of past studies have investigated the influence of various teleconnections such as el niño southern oscillation enso the north atlantic oscillation nao and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo on precipitation and streamflow these studies however have not focused on analyzing the combined influence of the different phases of these teleconnections and the simultaneous influence of these teleconnections at differing time frequency scales the present study addresses this issue by exploring the use of wavelet based methods in combination with non parametric approaches to analyze individual and combined influences involving enso nao and pdo on monthly precipitation and streamflow data from watersheds in alberta ontario and newfoundland in canada this study is the first time that multiscale and multivariate analyses of enso nao and pdo along with their different phases are used to explain the variability of streamflow and precipitation in a watershed generally the positive and negative phases particularly of enso and nao were respectively associated with lower and higher precipitation streamflow while the neutral phase showed similar behavior to that of the negative phase the results of the bivariate and multivariate wavelet coherences revealed that there were consistent increases in the average wavelet coherence awc and the percentage of significant coherence posp for all watersheds from using only one factor to two and three teleconnection factors the ranges of awc for one two and three factors were 0 31 0 40 0 56 0 66 and 0 77 0 81 respectively the ranges of posp for one two and three factors were 3 54 14 3 28 38 47 29 and 69 28 76 71 respectively this implies that three factor combinations enso nao pdo were needed to explain the variability of precipitation and streamflow in all watersheds keywords multiscale and multivariate analysis wavelet transform wavelet coherence streamflow and precipitation variability teleconnections canada 1 introduction a changing climate can manifest itself through changes in teleconnections teleconnections are naturally occurring phenomena driven by fluctuations in sea surface temperature sst and sea level pressure slp gaucherel 2010 keener et al 2010 kahya 2011 that have oscillatory patterns and recurring periodicities ranging from inter annual to inter decadal scales their multiscale influence can be seen in global and regional scales and is reflected in the variability of many hydrological components such as precipitation and streamflow regonda et al 2005 tremblay et al 2011 schulte et al 2016 lee and julien 2016 steirou et al 2017 the present study examines precipitation and streamflow variability in three canadian watersheds in relation to the el niño southern oscillation enso the north atlantic oscillation nao and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo which are among the main teleconnections affecting canada s climate coulibaly and burn 2004 bonsal et al 2006 whitfield et al 2010 st jacques et al 2014 newton et al 2014 asnaashari et al 2015 islam and gan 2016 more specifically the study focuses on assessing and understanding the influence of the different phases of the teleconnections as well as the combined influence of multiple teleconnections on precipitation and streamflow fluctuations in teleconnections are considered part of the long term natural variation in climate these fluctuations are associated with high and low index values resulting from differences in values recorded between centres measuring anomalies in slp or sst these fluctuations reflect the different states of teleconnections normally categorized as the positive negative and neutral phases for example positive negative nao phases result from high low differences in values produced between the high pressure system near the azores and low pressure system near iceland hurrell 1995 hurrell et al 2003 coleman and budikova 2013 filippi et al 2014 positive negative enso phases which are called el niño la niña refer mainly to the high low sst anomalies in the east central equatorial pacific ocean rasmusson and carpenter 1982 wang et al 2008 ouyang et al 2014 singh et al 2016 past studies have revealed that the responses of precipitation and streamflow to these different teleconnection phases tend to be asymmetrical and generally do not portray linear behaviour hoerling et al 1997 gobena and gan 2006 gobena et al 2013 cannon 2015 for example gobena and gan 2006 concluded that most basins in southwest canada had wet and dry streamflow conditions following the onset of la niña and el niño periods respectively this was particularly apparent for spring and summer seasons with consistencies higher than 75 similarly in a more confined basin scale gobena et al 2013 found that significant below average streamflow in the canadian columbia river basin occurring as a response to the positive phases of enso and pdo existed for a longer period as compared to the response of streamflow to the negative phases thus different influences associated with the different phases of these teleconnections have important implications on the availability of water resources aside from the effects of these different phases variability in precipitation and streamflow can be simultaneously influenced by more than one teleconnection verdon et al 2004 bonsal et al 2006 gobena and gan 2006 2009 in fact during certain periods teleconnection activities are interconnected huang et al 1998 serreze et al 2000 a number of recent studies have focused on understanding the implications resulting from the coupled or combined influence of multiple teleconnections on hydrological variables e g silva et al 2011 johnson et al 2013 ouyang et al 2014 wang et al 2014 sagarika et al 2015 singh et al 2015 for example enhanced precipitation and streamflow can be intensified when enso and pdo are in phase verdon et al 2004 wang et al 2014 observed that el niño caused more severe droughts during the warm or positive phase of pdo over areas in northern north america northern south america sub saharan africa the mediterranean basin northeastern asia and eastern siberia contrarily it caused wetter conditions in areas such as southwestern north america uruguay the middle east and southern china when enso and pdo were in phase the influence on dry wet global changes appeared to be magnified and extended poleward where changes are typically affected by enso alone and when they were out of phase the influence weakened or even disappeared wang et al 2014 similarly gobena and gan 2006 found that the strength of enso f relationships in parts of western canada was modulated or influenced by inter decadal variations in the pdo phases to analyze the influence of these teleconnections non linear behaviour and multiscale relationships must be considered as common oscillatory behaviour between teleconnections and hydrological variables occurs at various timescales and their relationships tend to have a non linear nature e g wu et al 2006 hsieh et al 2006 fleming et al 2007 gobena and gan 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014a cannon 2015 sagarika et al 2015 consequently the use of standard composite or correlation analysis alone is not ideal because such methods do not distinguish variations at differing timescales nor do they accommodate non monotonic and non linear relationships wu et al 2006 fleming and dahlke 2014a many recent studies particularly after the work carried out by torrence and compo 1998 demonstrated that spectral analysis methods based on the use of the wavelet transform wt were promising tools to analyze multiscale relationships in hydroclimatic variables e g grinsted et al 2004 andreo et al 2006 fu et al 2012 fierro and leslie 2013 nalley et al 2016 niu and chen 2016 schulte et al 2017 li et al 2018 the wavelet basis function is scaled as it is shifted along the analyzed time series decomposing these time series into a two dimensional time frequency format composed of a series of scaled and shifted versions of the mother wavelet drago and boxall 2002 loboda et al 2006 the wt is preferred over conventional spectral analysis methods such as the fourier analysis because the wavelets are localized in time and frequency domains the wt is therefore better able to identify important features or events such as discontinuities sharp jumps and shifts and modes of dominant variability in a signal at the exact temporal locations labat 2005 rehman and siddiqi 2009 yuan et al 2010 using wt significant periodicities in a signal and how they fluctuate over time can therefore be revealed and possibly linked to physical mechanisms such as teleconnection activities nalley et al 2016 pathak et al 2017 schulte et al 2016 to quantify the relationships between two hydroclimatic variables at differing timescales bivariate wavelet coherency wtc which is based on the continuous wavelet transform cwt has been used e g andreo et al 2006 keener et al 2010 perez valdivia et al 2012 nalley et al 2016 as teleconnections typically display strong activities at certain periodic scales e g enso at 2 7 years pdo at 15 25 and 50 70 years similar oscillatory behaviour between a teleconnection and hydrological variables such as precipitation and streamflow can be identified at these timescales using wtc as the name implies the applications of wtc are limited to two variables moreover while past studies have provided significant information on many aspects of the interactions between various teleconnections and hydrologic variables most have focused solely on bivariate relationships since processes affecting precipitation and streamflow variability may simultaneously involve multiple scale dependant climatic factors the wtc method cannot be used when the purpose is to investigate localized relationships involving more than two variables hu and si 2016 hu and si 2016 compared the performance of methods used to analyze multivariate relationships in geoscience data namely multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd multiple spectral coherence msc and their newly proposed method based on cwt multiple wavelet coherence mwc hu and si 2016 showed that mwc outperformed the other methods due to the method s ability to localize multiscale relationships using multiple predictor variables particularly for non stationary data both memd and msc underestimated the variance or coherence when multiple predictor variables were simultaneously involved for a response variable hu and si 2016 the mwc is important and useful in the present study since it has the ability to assess the influence of more than one teleconnection simultaneously at various timescales in a canadian context no studies to date have specifically analyzed the influence of the different phases of enso nao and pdo together with their combined influence at differing time frequency scales in light of this the main goal of this research was to use wt based methods to analyze the individual and combined or simultaneous influences of enso nao and pdo on monthly precipitation and streamflow variability the methodology used involves the combination of cwt wtc mwc and non parametric statistical tests to address the following specific objectives 1 to assess the individual influence of enso nao and pdo based on a the multiscale relationships between each teleconnection and either precipitation or streamflow and b the amounts of precipitation and streamflow associated with the different phases of each teleconnection 2 to assess the combined influence of the teleconnections using mwc by simultaneously considering two factors i e enso nao enso pdo and nao pdo and three factors i e enso nao pdo to demonstrate the application of the methods in addressing the objectives of the present study data from three canadian watersheds in three distinct climatic regions were used the watersheds are located in alberta ab ontario on and newfoundland nf this study is the first to provide an assessment of multiscale and multivariate analyses based on wt involving enso nao and pdo and how these teleconnections can be used to explain the variability of precipitation and streamflow 2 study sites and data 2 1 precipitation and streamflow data monthly total precipitation and monthly average streamflow data from three watersheds in ab on and nf canada were used in this study total precipitation data were recorded by meteorological stations and were obtained from the adjusted precipitation second generation dataset the details of the adjustment procedures are found in mekis and vincent 2011 streamflow data were obtained from gauging stations that belonged to the reference hydrometric basin network rhbn a network containing stations that best represent areas of natural and stable hydrological conditions monk et al 2011 and which had at least 20 years of high quality data zhang et al 2001 since the present study only focuses on the influence of natural climate phenomena through teleconnections it does not consider human activities therefore rhbn sites representing pristine conditions were suitable for the purpose of this study for the ab watershed waterton served as the gauging station while lethbridge and crowsnest served as the meteorological stations for the on watershed missinaibi and kapuskasing were the gauging and meteorological stations respectively for the nf watershed gander and gander s international airport were the gauging and meteorological stations respectively fig 1 shows the locations of these watersheds and their respective meteorological and gauging stations the watersheds were selected based on the availability of gauging and meteorological stations within the watersheds and the length of the available precipitation and streamflow data since one of the objectives of this study was to assess the simultaneous influences of multiple teleconnections on precipitation and streamflow the locations of the meteorological and gauging stations were chosen so that they were within the same watershed or at least in relatively close proximity to each other ideally multiple meteorological stations for each of the gauging stations would be used as physiographic conditions may differ even within a watershed especially in large sized watersheds burn 1997 smakhtin 2001 burn 2008 however there was only a limited number of meteorological stations with appropriate data lengths within the watersheds used this excluded the possibility of using multiple meteorological stations for each watershed only the ab watershed had two meteorological stations additionally the watersheds used were relatively small with the missinaibi river in the on watershed being the largest with a drainage area of 8574 km2 it can therefore be assumed that no significant differences in physiographic conditions exist furthermore since the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the uses of wt based multivariate and multiscale approaches using a limited number of representative meteorological stations was considered sufficient as it was necessary to provide details on the findings obtained from applying the proposed approaches for each watershed streamflow data ranged from 64 to 93 years precipitation data ranged from 31 to 103 years 31 years of precipitation data from the crowsnest station in the ab watershed is short for capturing the low frequency periodicities of pdo e g 50 years the other set of precipitation data had a length of 103 years which is sufficient to capture the main periodicities of enso nao and pdo that range from intra annual to inter decadal scales similarly for the on watershed the length of the first precipitation dataset of kapuskasing station was 34 years but the second set was 60 years for the nf watershed the lengths of all datasets were greater than 64 years missing values were only found in precipitation data at the kapuskasing station on where several monthly records from 1979 were missing since continuous data with a constant sampling interval is necessary for the wt computation kapuskasing s data were divided into two periods 1919 1978 and 1980 2013 and 1979 was excluded 2 2 enso nao and pdo data the length of teleconnection data used varied according to the length of precipitation and streamflow data for each watershed 2 2 1 enso enso describes the movement of water in the equatorial pacific ocean associated with variations in the sst and coupled with fluctuations in atmospheric pressure patterns in the tropical indian and pacific oceans related to the pacific trade winds it has well known recurring periodicities of 2 7 years the measure of enso intensity used in this study was based on the averaged sst anomaly over niño region 3 4 5 n 5 120 w 170 w the 3 month averaged sst anomaly data were calculated for 12 overlapping seasons per year starting from december january february then january february march and so on the sst anomaly data prior to 1950 were obtained from the international research institute for climate and society http iridl ldeo columbia edu and data as of january 1950 were obtained from the national weather service climate prediction centre http www cpc ncep noaa gov 2 2 2 nao the nao is represented by the normalized slp difference between high pressure centres in gibraltar and low pressure centres in southwest iceland hurrell and van loon 1997 jones et al 1997 the nao index is calculated based on the normalized slp difference between the high and low pressure centres hurrell and van loon 1997 the nao data were obtained from the national center for environmental information http www ngdc noaa gov 2 2 3 pdo the pdo is a large scale climate pattern of sst fluctuations between cool sst anomalies in the east central north pacific and warm sst anomalies around the central west coast of north america the periodicity of pdo is understood to recur at inter decadal around 15 25 years to multi decadal scales around 50 70 years mantua et al 1997 compared to enso and nao the pdo has longer cycles that can last around 20 30 years mantua et al 1997 minobe 1997 the pdo is measured as the monthly mean sst anomaly based on the 1901 2000 period for the north pacific north of 20 n the pdo data were obtained from the earth system research laboratory physical sciences division of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration http www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices 3 methodology and theoretical background this study performed multiscale analyses of the individual and combined influences of enso nao and pdo on precipitation and streamflow for the individual influence the analysis was conducted for one teleconnection at a time on the entire dataset and on the datasets extracted according to the different phases of the teleconnections for the combined influence the analysis was conducted using two factors simultaneously i e enso nao enso pdo and nao pdo or all three factors simultaneously i e enso nao pdo correlation analyses non parametric tests to compare two samples and wt based methods were used and carried out in matlab according to procedures outlined below sections 3 1 3 4 the analytical framework of the procedures is given in fig 2 3 1 applying the continuous wavelet transform the cwt was performed on the precipitation streamflow enso nao and pdo data to determine their dominant mode s of variability applying cwt decomposes the time series into all possible and continuous scales and produces a two dimensional wavelet spectrum that reveals the temporal evolution and variability of each periodicity torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2007 the morlet wavelet a commonly used wavelet in hydrological studies was used in this study for its ability to adequately describe the shape of hydrological type data labat 2005 2006 furthermore it has a better frequency resolution than other wavelets mi et al 2005 massei et al 2011 mi et al 2005 found that the morlet wavelet was better at detecting and localizing different events in ecological data compared to other wavelets such as the mexican hat paul and daubechies wavelets the complex part of the morlet s wavelet coefficients produces the amplitude and phase of the analyzed time series to assess the coherence between two signals the morlet wavelet can be expressed as torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 1 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where i 1 the value of ω0 which is the frequency localization is commonly chosen to be 6 for the morlet wavelet because it gives a good balance between time and frequency localizations torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 the cwt on a time series can then be written as grinsted et al 2004 2 w t x s δ t s t 0 t 1 x t ψ 0 t t δ t s where xt is the analyzed time series that is recorded in a discrete time sequence t with a uniform interval of δt and s represents the scaling factor of the mother wavelet the mother wavelet depends on a time variable η s t which normalizes the cwt to have unit energy this normalization allows all scales to be directly comparable to each other finally the wavelet coefficients wψ of the cwt on a time series with the scaled and translated wavelet ψ and a translation factor for the centre of the window function θ is written as the asterisk is the complex conjugate function torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 3 w ψ s θ 1 s x t ψ t θ s δ t liu et al 2007 showed that an underestimation of energy in the high frequency or lower scale components occurs because the conventional cwt calculation does not include the inverse of the scale to correct this bias the calculation of the wavelet power should include the inverse of the scale which is done by dividing the conventional power by the corresponding scale liu et al 2007 this present study adopted this bias correction procedure 4 e n s x n s 2 s 3 2 determining the phases of enso nao and pdo 3 2 1 enso s phases el niño positive la niña negative and neutral there is no universal method used for categorizing the el niño positive enso and la niña negative enso events in this study following the procedures used in fu et al 2007 and ouyang et al 2014 the el niño and la niña events were defined when the 5 month running means of the recorded sst anomalies consecutively for at least 6 months exceeded 0 4 c and fell below 0 4 c respectively the running mean values between 0 4 and 0 4 were categorized as the neutral phase 3 2 2 nao s phases positive negative and neutral positive and negative nao phases were taken when the recorded values were above and below one standard deviation from the overall mean respectively wettstein and mearns 2002 o malley 2006 afzal et al 2013 values in between were categorized into the neutral phase 3 2 3 pdo s phases positive and negative since the cycle of pdo is mainly inter decadal 11 year running means were used to reflect its variability a procedure similar to the one used in wang et al 2014 the running mean values above and below zero indicated positive and negative pdo phases respectively wang et al 2006 2014 3 2 4 extracting the precipitation and streamflow data according to the phases of teleconnections once the threshold or range values for the phases of enso nao and pdo were determined each monthly record of these teleconnections was then assigned either a positive negative or neutral phase then each precipitation and streamflow record corresponding to the teleconnection was assigned the same phase accordingly data that belonged to the same phase were then grouped together in an ascending order of time producing positive negative and neutral datasets 3 3 determining the individual influence of enso nao and pdo 1 spearman s rank correlation coefficients r values were calculated for each enso nao and pdo with precipitation and with streamflow the r values were calculated for the entire dataset prior to the determination of phases and for the datasets of the different phases i e positive negative and neutral datasets 2 the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test was then applied to determine whether the differences in the amount of precipitation and streamflow were significant between any two phases positive negative positive neutral and negative neutral 3 the amount of precipitation and streamflow during the positive negative and neutral phases was individually compared to the respective variable s long term average these measurements were presented as percent changes steps 1 3 were used as a measure of how the different phases of enso nao and pdo affected the amount of precipitation and streamflow 4 bivariate wtcs were applied on the entire dataset to assess the multiscale relationships of a teleconnection with precipitation or streamflow the spectra produced revealed and delineated significant coherence between enso nao pdo and precipitation or streamflow only the non parametric approaches wilcoxon rank sum test and the spearman s rank correlation and the percent change measures were used when assessing the influence of the positive negative and neutral phases of the teleconnections on the precipitation and streamflow data extracted to the different phases accordingly the bivariate wtc and mwc approaches were not used in the assessment of the different phases due to two factors short data length and unequal time intervals short data length might affect the interpretations of the wavelet analysis when computing the cwt on a time series with a finite length the issue of border distortion effect is introduced which occurs when the convolution process cannot occur outside the ends of signals where there is no information available su et al 2011 the zero padding procedure can be used to extend the time series bringing the data length up to the next dyadic power of two level strang and nguyen 1997 the convolution operation then involves artificial values which results in the cone of influence coi an area near the edges in the power spectrum where the wavelet power might be weaker than actually indicated torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 kallache et al 2005 as understood from section 3 2 determining the phases of enso nao and pdo the extracted streamflow and precipitation data following the positive negative and neutral phases of the teleconnections may only contain short time series at a time before the phase changes this was particularly noticeable for enso and nao phases where each phase may only exist for a few years or less thus the computation of the cwt and the bivariate wtc and mwc which are based on the cwt on short time series might result in extensive coi regions which would not allow for meaningful interpretation or proper feature extractions at least from a practical point of view furthermore uniform time intervals are required for the cwt computation see eqs 2 and 3 again the extracted streamflow and precipitation data according to the positive negative and neutral phases section 3 2 did not always have uniform time intervals because a phase was interrupted by the existence of the other phase s as such the computation of the cwt would not work on the extracted precipitation and streamflow data for the same reason the wtc and mwc could not be computed on the extracted data 3 3 1 spearman s rank correlation the time series for a teleconnection and either precipitation or streamflow were represented by xt t 1 n and yt t 1 n respectively the records in xt and yt were then ranked and the ranks were represented by rx1 rx2 rxn and ry1 ry2 ryn respectively the spearman s rank correlation coefficient r was calculated using sneyers 1990 5 r 1 6 d 2 n 3 n where n is the number of pairs d is the difference between ranks of a teleconnection and either p or f for a specific recording time t 3 3 2 wilcoxon rank sum test the wilcoxon rank sum test is a non parametric test used to determine whether two sets of samples have the same distribution each run of the test was applied to two datasets the extracted precipitation or streamflow data during positive negative positive neutral and negative neutral phases of each teleconnection since the samples were larger than 10 the normal approximation z statistic was used to compute the p value for two samples of either precipitation or streamflow yt1 t1 1 n1 and yt2 t2 1 n2 where n1 n2 the calculated z value was mann and whitney 1947 hollander and wolfe 1999 6 z u e u σ u u n 1 n 2 n 1 n 1 1 2 0 5 s i g n u e u n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 σ a d j 12 z values 1 96 or 1 96 indicated p values that were 0 05 α 5 these were used to indicate a significant difference between the two phases analyzed 7 u r yn n n 1 2 r yn is the sum of ranks in the sample eq 7 was applied to n1 and n2 and the smaller of u1 or u2 was chosen as u the σ a d j was adjusted when there were ties in ranks as follows mann and whitney 1947 hollander and wolfe 1999 8 σ a d j 2 t i e d r a n k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 where n3 n1 n2 tj represents the number of points having rank j and k is the number of untied ranks 3 3 3 bivariate wavelet coherence bivariate wtc measures the intensity of covariance between two time series one teleconnection and either precipitation or streamflow in time frequency domains wtc is based on the smoothed auto and cross wavelet power spectra between the two variables where wavelet coefficients are calculated for the different time and scales for each variable involved torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 bivariate wtc between a teleconnection xt and either precipitation or streamflow yt is torrence and webster 1999 grinsted et al 2004 9 r t 2 s s s 1 w t xy s 2 s s 1 w t x s 2 s s 1 w t y s 2 w t x and w t y are the cwt of xt and yt respectively w t xy is the cross wavelet spectrum and s is the smoothing operator which is 10 s w s scale s time w t s sscale and stime are the smoothing along the wavelet scale and time respectively the smoothing operator for the morlet wavelet is torrence and webster 1999 11 s time w s w t s n c 1 t 2 2 s 2 s w t s n c 2 0 6 s t where nc1 and nc2 are the normalization constants which are determined numerically when the convolution processes are completed discretely π is the rectangle function and 0 6 represents the scale decorrelation length factor for the morlet wavelet which was empirically determined by torrence and compo 1998 the phase of the bivariate wtc is calculated as follows hu and si 2016 12 θ tan 1 i w yt x t s t r e w yt x t s t i and re are the imaginary and real components of w t y x s t respectively 3 4 determining the combined influences of enso nao and pdo multiple wavelet coherences were used to determine the periodicities of significant coherence when two and three teleconnections were simultaneously involved the two factor cases included enso nao enso pdo and nao pdo while the three factor case included all teleconnections enso nao pdo 3 4 1 multiple wavelet coherence like the wtc the mwc is also based on auto and cross wavelet power spectra among the analyzed variables the response variable yt was either precipitation or streamflow and there were either two or three predictor variables xt xenso xnao xpdo the mwc ρ m 2 s t at scale s and time t is expressed as hu and si 2016 13 ρ m 2 s t w t y x s t w t y x s t w t x x s t w t y y s t w t y x s t is the matrix of the smoothed cross wavelet power between the response and predictor variables w t x x s t is the matrix of the smoothed auto and cross wavelet power among the multiple predictor variables and w t y y s t is the matrix of the smoothed wavelet power of the response variable the w t y x s t represents the complex conjugate of w t y x s t the 95 significance level and the confidence intervals of all wt cwt wtc and mwc were calculated using a monte carlo repetition 1000 repetitions based on the first order autocorrelation coefficient for more detail on calculating the 95 significance level and the confidence intervals using a monte carlo method readers can refer to studies such as torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 hu and si 2016 in the present study for each wtc or mwc computation the average power of wavelet coherence awc and the percentage of the numbers of power that were significant at the 95 significance level posp over all scales were calculated the awc and posp were used as measurements to examine the relative dominance of individual teleconnections or combinations of teleconnections on precipitation and streamflow variability in each watershed the awc was calculated by averaging the wavelet coherence produced over all scales according to the coherence values produced in the wtc computation and in the mwc computation the posp was obtained by calculating the ratio of the number of significant values of power over the total number of values of the power produced in the wtc computation and in the mwc computation significant power occurs when the ratio of the power over the significance level is greater than 1 higher overall awc and posp values indicated more dominance hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 this implies that the teleconnection s involved in the wtc and mwc computations were needed to explain the variation in the respective precipitation or streamflow dataset analyzed although an additional explanatory variable i e the teleconnections may increase the coherence with precipitation or streamflow the increase in posp by at least 5 should be observed before concluding the additional explanatory variable has a practical significance hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 4 results and discussions 4 1 individual and combined influences of enso nao and pdo the individual influence was assessed using non parametric analysis involving the wilcoxon rank sum test the spearman s rank correlation percent change measures and the wtc while the combined influence was assessed using the mwc method due to space limitations only the wavelet spectra cwt wtc and mwc for precipitation and streamflow from the ab watershed are presented in the results section to illustrate the methods used and how the results were used to achieve the goals of this study the corresponding wavelet spectra for the on and nf watersheds are given in the appendix section 4 1 1 non parametric analyses to assess the influence of the phases of teleconnections the effects of the positive and negative phases were generally opposite to each other fig 3 the effect of the neutral phase was almost always in agreement with that of the negative phase fig 3 and there were no significant differences in the amount between the negative and neutral phases except for nao p at lethbridge ab z 2 87 p 0 05 table 1 the positive phase especially of enso and nao was mainly associated with negative precipitation and streamflow percent changes while negative phases were mostly associated with positive percent changes fig 3 these observations were supported by the correlation values table 2 where significant negative and positive r values were shown mainly for the positive phase and negative phase respectively fig 3 and table 2 therefore indicate that positive enso and positive nao were more likely associated with or caused drier conditions whereas negative enso and negative nao were associated with wetter conditions similar results have previously been observed in other studies for canada e g shabbar et al 1997 mengistu et al 2013 where higher enso values were associated with a warmer and drier climate leading to lower precipitation and streamflow the responses of the positive and negative phases however were not mirror images nor were they linear fig 3 table 2 the causes of nonlinearity during particularly strong el niño episodes have been attributed to physical mechanisms stemming from the initiation of deep convection in the tropical pacific as a result of the sst threshold hoerling et al 1997 2001 this causes an asymmetry in the magnitude of tropical convection and a phase shift leading to non linear and non mirror images in response to the opposite phases of enso hoerling et al 1997 2001 the response of precipitation and streamflow to enso in the northern hemisphere has been identified in several studies to be quadratic polynomial e g wu et al 2005 fleming and dahlke 2014a b significant differences in the amount of precipitation and streamflow among the different phases particularly between the positive and negative and between the positive and neutral were evident fig 3 table 2 however this was more noticeable for enso and nao less so for pdo in the ab and on watersheds where positive enso and positive nao were clearly associated with negative percent changes fig 3a and b table 1 for the nf watershed the differences in the amounts of precipitation and streamflow and in the percent change especially between the positive and negative phases were not as striking as they were for the other two watersheds fig 3c table 1 for pdo it appeared inconclusive as to whether positive or negative phases were strongly associated with lower or higher amounts of precipitation and streamflow respectively significant negative correlations were only found for pdo and they were seen for precipitation at kapuskasing on during 1980 2013 for positive pdo r 0 13 p 0 05 and precipitation at crowsnest ab during 1963 1993 for negative pdo r 0 24 p 0 05 table 2 it was also noted that compared to enso and nao the percent changes in pdo s positive and negative phases were generally low all percent changes absolute values in pdo were 5 except for f at waterton ab 6 2 and precipitation at lethbridge ab 5 1 both during the positive pdo again this may indicate that the differences between the positive and negative phases in pdo are not substantial compared to those in enso and nao 4 1 2 wavelet analyses cwt wtc and mwc the bivariate wtc spectra for all watersheds fig 4 appendices a 1 and b 1 showed significant coherence at various scales greater than 12 months i e the annual periodicity table 3 this was not evident in their respective precipitation and streamflow cwt spectra the cwt spectra showed that both precipitation and streamflow in all watersheds were strongly characterized by the annual periodicity fig 5 appendices a 2 and b 2 typical for canada s hydro meteorological data adamowski and prokoph 2014 nalley et al 2016 the annual periodicity could however be related to events such as annual spring snowmelt for streamflow significant regions around 6 months were also consistently observed this indicated that there were lower frequencies between the teleconnections and precipitation and streamflow that were simultaneously oscillating but could not be seen in their cwt alone the dominancy of the annual periodicity may have also concealed the significance of other low frequency periodicities in the original cwt for the mwc analysis it considered two factors i e enso pdo enso nao and nao pdo or three factors i e enso nao pdo simultaneously the awc and posp values produced from the wtc and mwc analyses allowed for the identification of the most influential teleconnection s for each watershed as well as the combination of teleconnections that best explain the variability in precipitation and streamflow 4 1 2 1 alberta watershed for streamflow at waterton periodicities of significant wtc coherence for nao and particularly for pdo which are known to occur at longer time scales were well reflected nao s coherence up to scales of 48 months was apparent with nao being the only index to have a significant correlation with streamflow for the entire data category r 0 10 p 0 05 table 2 pdo had significant wtc coherence between 96 and 192 months and greater than 192 months 16 years fig 4a table 3 when comparing the awc and posp for all scales among the wtcs pdo flow had the highest values awc 0 37 posp 10 82 table 4 moreover for the two factor cases of the mwc in streamflow significant periodicities at scales of 12 months and greater were increasingly extensive when pdo was involved i e enso pdo flow and nao pdo flow fig 6 a in particular significant coherence at scales between 128 and 256 months was especially prominent potentially reflecting the low frequency periodicities of pdo for the three factor case in streamflow i e enso nao pdo flow significant coherence at scales greater than 32 months particularly around 125 256 months reflected the coherence with pdo this was evident in the wtc of pdo flow fig 4a suggesting the low frequency influence of pdo it was thus evident that for streamflow in this watershed individually pdo appeared to have the strongest influence for the combined influence the mwc showed that the awc and posp values for all the two factor cases were higher than any of the individual cases the three factor case showed even higher awc 0 79 and posp 74 43 values compared to any of the two factor cases table 4 this implied that in addition to pdo enso and nao were necessary predictors in the multivariate analysis in order to best explain the variability of streamflow in this watershed despite their influence being individually less than that of pdo in terms of precipitation crowsnest and lethbridge stations showed quite different bivariate wtc spectra concerning enso and nao for example significant coherence with enso between 48 and roughly 72 months was seen only at crowsnest and not at lethbridge fig 4b and c table 3 similarly significant coherence with nao at scales greater than 96 months was also seen for crowsnest only these incongruities between the two precipitation datasets may have resulted due to the differences in their data periods crowsnest data were for 1963 1993 while lethbridge data were for 1902 2004 although precipitation at lethbridge station covered almost all of the 20th century and should have captured longer periodicities such as those that characterize nao significant coherence at higher scales was not obvious in its enso precipitation and nao precipitation wtc spectra this may suggest that the influence of enso and nao at higher scales in this watershed was only apparent between the mid 1960s to the late 1990s this could not have been concluded through the use of spearman s correlation results alone table 2 both the awc and posp values of enso precipitation and nao precipitation over all scales were also higher during 1963 1993 compared to those during 1902 2004 table 4 past studies such as coulibaly and burn 2004 2005 also observed strong relationships between canada s streamflow and teleconnections including enso and nao since the 1950s this timing appeared to be related to peak activities of enso evident since the 1960s and phase shifts of nao extreme negative in the 1960s and high positive since 1970 anctil and coulibaly 2004 coulibaly and burn 2004 2005 furthermore it has been mentioned that while relationships between a climate index and precipitation or streamflow may be able to be explained for certain times for example due to factors such as changes in the magnitude of the strength of climate indices the coherencies can also be short lived and sometimes there are no explainable or apparent reasons for this chaotic behaviour e g ramage 1983 seager and hoerling 2014 for precipitation at crowsnest the enso nao precipitation and enso pdo precipitation had similar values of awc 0 66 and 0 65 and posp 47 14 and 47 29 which were higher when compared to those for the nao pdo precipitation awc 0 63 and posp 42 72 table 4 significant coherence at scales around 32 64 months was most likely related to enso and for scales greater than 96 months the coherence may be due to the pdo furthermore among the individual wtc cases the awc and posp for enso precipitation and pdo precipitation were higher compared to those for nao p table 4 and precipitation at crowsnest had the highest correlation with pdo r 0 16 p 0 05 followed by enso r 0 11 p 0 05 table 2 these observations suggested that for precipitation at crowsnest the influence of enso and pdo individually was stronger than nao the mwc results showed that enso pdo precipitation for crowsnest was not sufficient in achieving the highest awc and posp values the addition of nao although independently nao did not show strong influence was needed creating the three factor case in order to achieve the highest awc and posp values table 4 similarly for precipitation at lethbridge the strong influence of the pdo was again apparent the values of awc and posp for the wtc individual cases showed that pdo precipitation was higher awc 0 41 posp 12 76 compared to enso and nao awc 0 32 and 0 34 respectively posp 3 86 and 7 44 respectively table 4 it was not surprising that the highest awc and posp for the mwc two factor cases was seen when the pdo was involved i e enso pdo precipitation and nao pdo precipitation furthermore some of the significant coherence at the inter annual scales e g around 96 and 192 384 months identified in the mwc spectra of the two and three factor cases also appeared in the wtc spectrum of pdo precipitation fig 4c like the precipitation at crowsnest the awc and posp of the two factor cases were higher than any of the individual cases but the three factor combination of enso nao pdo precipitation was again the one that showed the highest awc and posp values table 4 for the ab watershed results of the wtc and mwc analyses collectively showed that the inter annual influence of pdo was the most prominent the roles of enso and nao were also evident as shown in some of the bivariate wtc spectra and in the significant r values when combined with pdo the mwc analyses showed that the combination of enso nao pdo creating the three factor cases was needed to obtain the highest value of awc and posp for all precipitation and streamflow data individual and two factor cases were not sufficient significant coherence was particularly apparent at high scales which could be related to the recurring periodicities of pdo it is evident that in addition to the bivariate wtc analysis the multivariate mwc analysis substantiated the significant influence of pdo this watershed is located on the southwestern side of alberta that belongs to the rocky mountain climatic region the primary sources of moisture transport in this region from the pacific ocean are related to the periodicities of enso gan et al 2007 but more strongly to pdo mwale et al 2009 past studies encompassing alberta also detected that pdo consistently appeared in the optimum predictor set for surface water supplies st jacques et al 2010 sauchyn et al 2015 for example there were strong negative relationships between the pdo and streamflow in south and central alberta st jacques et al 2010 periods of prolonged low flow depicted in the tree ring reconstruction records in the athabasca river which encompassed parts of alberta during 1111 2010 were partly associated with low frequency variability of pdo sauchyn et al 2015 4 1 2 2 ontario watershed for both precipitation and streamflow the prominent inter annual and inter decadal influence of enso in this watershed was generally more evident than nao or pdo particularly around scales of 96 and 192 254 months 16 21 years appendix a 1 table 3 these more prominent roles were also reflected in the results of the wilcoxon rank sum test significant differences between positive and negative phases and between positive and neutral phases were seen particularly for enso and nao table 1 and in the wtc and mwc analyses results for the wtc individual cases the highest awc values 0 36 and 0 39 for precipitation and streamflow before 1980 respectively and posp values 10 57 and 14 30 for precipitation and streamflow before 1980 respectively were seen for enso except for precipitation during 1980 2013 where the values were highest for nao awc 0 38 posp 13 92 table 4 for the two factor cases shown in the mwc analysis of streamflow at the missinaibi station enso nao flow and enso pdo flow showed the highest values of awc 0 63 for both combinations and posp 43 95 and 43 79 respectively table 4 and the spectrum of the three factor case appendix a 2 reflected a combination of the spectra of these two factor cases appendix a 2 it was not surprising that enso was a common factor given its evident influence in this watershed although these two factor cases had significantly higher awc and posp values compared to those of the wtc individual cases the three factor combination again produced the highest awc 0 79 and posp 74 19 values table 4 this means that adding nao into the predictor variables was needed to achieve the highest amount of significant coherence this increase can be attributed mainly to scales between 32 and 128 months that came from the two factor combination of enso nao looking at the spearman s correlation results significant r values for streamflow at missinaibi river were only observed for nao overall r 0 06 positive nao r 0 24 and enso negative enso r 0 16 neutral enso r 0 10 table 2 justifying the addition of nao for precipitation during 1980 2013 it was interesting to observe that at scales greater than 24 months it was more coherent with nao but not with enso appendix a 1 significant coherence in nao precipitation started to appear in the mid 1930s and became more noticeable after the 1970s appendix a 1 more intense nao activities in the latter part of the 20th century in the context of canadian rivers has been documented in past studies for example coulibaly 2006 found that post 1940 precipitation in canada was affected by even moderate activities of nao coulibaly and burn 2004 also suggested that the streamflow change point in canada s rivers occurring in 1970 was likely to be associated with strong nao activities particularly with the enhancement of power within the 3 6 year scales for precipitation in this watershed significant spearman s correlations were only evident for nao r 0 13 for p after 1980 and pdo r 0 07 and r 0 10 for precipitation before and after 1980 respectively table 2 but not for enso despite the evident influence of enso on precipitation the insignificant r value of enso precipitation indicated that a non significant overall correlation value did not automatically imply a non significant relationship because positive and negative relationships that existed within the two variables themselves may have cancelled each other out in addition to the wtc results the mwc spectra and analysis also showed that for the two factor cases the awc and posp were highest when enso was involved enso pdo precipitation for precipitation before 1980 and enso nao precipitation for precipitation after 1980 table 4 emphasizing again the prominent influence of enso the mwc spectrum of the combination of enso pdo precipitation had the highest values of awc 0 62 and posp 40 12 among the two factor cases for precipitation before 1980 appendix a 3 this suggests that significant periodicities greater than 48 months were mostly due to enso an inference deduced from the bivariate wtc spectrum of enso precipitation appendix a 1 in the mwc spectrum of the three factor case appendix a 3 more high power periodicities at scales greater than 16 months were apparent compared to any of the single factor and two factor cases the values of awc 0 77 and posp 70 77 of the three factor case were also the highest table 4 this significant increase in awc and posp suggests that before 1980 or during the first three quarters of the 20th century enso nao and pdo are all needed to best explain the variability of precipitation at kapuskasing for precipitation after 1980 among the two factor combinations the highest values for awc 0 64 and posp 43 21 were observed for enso nao precipitation table 4 the higher amounts of significant coherence were mainly contributed by scales around 128 months which could be attributed to the significant inter annual wtc coherence of the nao precipitation appendix a 1 it appeared that the influence of nao was more evident during the latter part of the 20th century 1 the significant regions increased noticeably in the nao precipitation after 1980 compared to the nao precipitation before 1980 appendix a 1 2 the highest significant correlation value r 0 13 for precipitation after 1980 was for nao table 2 and 3 among the wtc individual cases the nao precipitation had the highest awc 0 38 and posp 13 92 table 4 although the influence of enso and nao was stronger than pdo for precipitation after 1980 significant increases in the awc 0 79 and posp 76 01 values in the three factor case for precipitation after 1980 were observed table 4 this suggested that the addition of pdo to the enso nao was needed to best explain the variability of precipitation during the later period of the 20th century for precipitation after 1980 significant correlation values were not only seen for nao r 0 13 but also for pdo r 0 10 table 2 and significant inter annual coherence in the bivariate wtc of pdo precipitation appendix a 1 justified the inclusion of pdo as a predictor for precipitation after 1980 4 1 2 3 newfoundland watershed for this watershed individually the inter annual influence of nao was more prominent compared to enso or pdo particularly on streamflow the bivariate wtc spectrum of nao flow showed the greatest coverage of significant coherence compared to enso and pdo s spectra appendix b 1 for the wtc individual cases nao had the highest awc and posp values for both precipitation awc 0 34 posp 5 77 and streamflow awc 0 40 posp 11 26 table 4 the results of the spearman s rank correlations also show that the only significant correlation for this watershed was for nao flow r 0 10 and positive nao had a significantly lower amount of streamflow compared to the negative nao table 2 the out of phase correlations of nao flow are particularly noticeable between scales 24 and 96 months during the early 1960s to mid 1980s appendix b 1 this implies a potential inter annual influence of nao during those years appendix b 2 the values of awc and posp for nao obtained from the wtc analysis were higher for streamflow than for precipitation furthermore the highest spearman s correlation coefficient absolute value for precipitation was observed for nao precipitation r 0 05 but it was not significant table 2 these observations suggest that the influence of nao was more strongly apparent in streamflow than precipitation in this watershed the inter annual influence of enso appeared to be relatively scattered and not extensive appendix b 1 table 3 while streamflow and positive enso had a significant negative correlation r 0 16 indicating low flow during the el niño period the differences in the amount of precipitation and streamflow between the positive and negative enso phases were not significant table 1 the mwc analyses for streamflow showed that the highest values of awc 0 62 and posp 40 70 among the two factor cases were seen for enso nao flow while for precipitation it was for enso pdo precipitation awc 0 59 posp 34 5 table 4 the enso pdo precipitation appendix b 1 had significant coherence around 128 months likely reflecting the significant coherence with pdo which was seen in its bivariate wtc spectrum appendix b 1 the influence of pdo was noticeable on precipitation at gander the increase in significant coherence in the two factor case of enso pdo precipitation was also likely to be contributed by scales greater than 256 months appendix b 3 which appeared to have come from enso and pdo for both precipitation and streamflow their three factor cases showed significant increases in awc 0 77 and 0 80 for precipitation and streamflow respectively and posp 69 28 and 74 11 for precipitation and streamflow respectively compared to any of their two factor and individual cases table 4 the increase in coherence for streamflow s three factor case were mainly attributed to scales at 12 months towards the later period of the data between 16 and 64 months which may have mainly come from the coherence with nao as displayed in the bivariate wtc spectrum appendix b 1 and at around 126 months to reach the highest value of awc and posp all enso nao and pdo were needed as predictors for both precipitation and streamflow 5 conclusions this study explored three main issues in three watersheds located in three different regions of canada ab on and nf 1 the influence of the different phases of enso nao and pdo on the variability of precipitation and streamflow 2 significant coherence between each of enso nao and pdo individually with either precipitation and streamflow and 3 significant coherence among two or three teleconnections simultaneously with either precipitation and streamflow generally it was seen that the positive phase of enso and nao reflected drier conditions causing lower amounts of precipitation and streamflow whereas the negative phase of enso and nao reflected wetter conditions causing higher amounts of precipitation and streamflow these observations were more evident in the ab and on watersheds and less so for the nf watershed for pdo it was not clear how the positive and negative phases affected the variability of precipitation and streamflow in all watersheds individually and collectively enso nao and pdo influenced precipitation and streamflow differently in different watersheds using wtc and mwc this study was able to determine the most influential teleconnection among enso nao and pdo for each watershed individually pdo was the most dominant teleconnection influencing the ab watershed enso for the on watershed and the nao for the nf watershed the results of the coherence analysis showed that the strength of the linkages between a teleconnection and precipitation and streamflow varied at differing time scales due to these multiscale relationships the mwc analysis revealed that only considering one teleconnection was insufficient when explaining the variability in precipitation and streamflow although for each watershed a dominant teleconnection was determined its awc and posp values were not however the highest therefore a dominant teleconnection alone cannot fully explain the variability of precipitation and streamflow the mwc wavelet analysis also showed that significant awc and posp values were consistently higher in the two factor cases compared to those of the individual factors however the highest awc and posp values were always significantly higher in the three factor cases in all watersheds for all precipitation and streamflow this implied that enso nao and pdo were necessary to best understand the variability of precipitation and streamflow related to the teleconnections unlike most previous studies that chose to analyze the various teleconnections individually the findings of the present study emphasized that one needs to take into consideration the collective influence of these important teleconnections the multiscale decomposition and multivariate analysis in precipitation and streamflow and their connection to enso nao and pdo not only individually but also collectively provided information on the dominant periodicities of variability and significant coherence the temporal evolution of the dominant periodicities and significant coherence during the study period was also revealed through multivariate analysis this study identified important or significant teleconnections affecting precipitation and streamflow variability since the variability in precipitation and streamflow can be affected by the interlinkages of multiple teleconnections the methods applied here illustrated how to choose the most influential teleconnection s to explain the variability this study demonstrated the advantage of using mwc to significantly complement the bivariate wtc and correlation analyses this study contributes to the literature by exploring and proposing the use of wt based methods to conduct multiscale and multivariate analyses for analyzing the individual and combined influence of enso nao and pdo on precipitation and streamflow variability previously this has not been explored the findings obtained in this study also provide further insight into the finer temporal structures of precipitation and streamflow in the watersheds analyzed these insights are important to the understanding of hydrology climate interactions and the approach used in this study can also be applied in other geographical regions watershed managers and planners can incorporate the techniques employed in this study to obtain useful information that can be used as part of strategies and efforts for sustainable water resources management particularly those related to variability in water quantity caused by the dynamics of

6436,a number of past studies have investigated the influence of various teleconnections such as el niño southern oscillation enso the north atlantic oscillation nao and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo on precipitation and streamflow these studies however have not focused on analyzing the combined influence of the different phases of these teleconnections and the simultaneous influence of these teleconnections at differing time frequency scales the present study addresses this issue by exploring the use of wavelet based methods in combination with non parametric approaches to analyze individual and combined influences involving enso nao and pdo on monthly precipitation and streamflow data from watersheds in alberta ontario and newfoundland in canada this study is the first time that multiscale and multivariate analyses of enso nao and pdo along with their different phases are used to explain the variability of streamflow and precipitation in a watershed generally the positive and negative phases particularly of enso and nao were respectively associated with lower and higher precipitation streamflow while the neutral phase showed similar behavior to that of the negative phase the results of the bivariate and multivariate wavelet coherences revealed that there were consistent increases in the average wavelet coherence awc and the percentage of significant coherence posp for all watersheds from using only one factor to two and three teleconnection factors the ranges of awc for one two and three factors were 0 31 0 40 0 56 0 66 and 0 77 0 81 respectively the ranges of posp for one two and three factors were 3 54 14 3 28 38 47 29 and 69 28 76 71 respectively this implies that three factor combinations enso nao pdo were needed to explain the variability of precipitation and streamflow in all watersheds keywords multiscale and multivariate analysis wavelet transform wavelet coherence streamflow and precipitation variability teleconnections canada 1 introduction a changing climate can manifest itself through changes in teleconnections teleconnections are naturally occurring phenomena driven by fluctuations in sea surface temperature sst and sea level pressure slp gaucherel 2010 keener et al 2010 kahya 2011 that have oscillatory patterns and recurring periodicities ranging from inter annual to inter decadal scales their multiscale influence can be seen in global and regional scales and is reflected in the variability of many hydrological components such as precipitation and streamflow regonda et al 2005 tremblay et al 2011 schulte et al 2016 lee and julien 2016 steirou et al 2017 the present study examines precipitation and streamflow variability in three canadian watersheds in relation to the el niño southern oscillation enso the north atlantic oscillation nao and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo which are among the main teleconnections affecting canada s climate coulibaly and burn 2004 bonsal et al 2006 whitfield et al 2010 st jacques et al 2014 newton et al 2014 asnaashari et al 2015 islam and gan 2016 more specifically the study focuses on assessing and understanding the influence of the different phases of the teleconnections as well as the combined influence of multiple teleconnections on precipitation and streamflow fluctuations in teleconnections are considered part of the long term natural variation in climate these fluctuations are associated with high and low index values resulting from differences in values recorded between centres measuring anomalies in slp or sst these fluctuations reflect the different states of teleconnections normally categorized as the positive negative and neutral phases for example positive negative nao phases result from high low differences in values produced between the high pressure system near the azores and low pressure system near iceland hurrell 1995 hurrell et al 2003 coleman and budikova 2013 filippi et al 2014 positive negative enso phases which are called el niño la niña refer mainly to the high low sst anomalies in the east central equatorial pacific ocean rasmusson and carpenter 1982 wang et al 2008 ouyang et al 2014 singh et al 2016 past studies have revealed that the responses of precipitation and streamflow to these different teleconnection phases tend to be asymmetrical and generally do not portray linear behaviour hoerling et al 1997 gobena and gan 2006 gobena et al 2013 cannon 2015 for example gobena and gan 2006 concluded that most basins in southwest canada had wet and dry streamflow conditions following the onset of la niña and el niño periods respectively this was particularly apparent for spring and summer seasons with consistencies higher than 75 similarly in a more confined basin scale gobena et al 2013 found that significant below average streamflow in the canadian columbia river basin occurring as a response to the positive phases of enso and pdo existed for a longer period as compared to the response of streamflow to the negative phases thus different influences associated with the different phases of these teleconnections have important implications on the availability of water resources aside from the effects of these different phases variability in precipitation and streamflow can be simultaneously influenced by more than one teleconnection verdon et al 2004 bonsal et al 2006 gobena and gan 2006 2009 in fact during certain periods teleconnection activities are interconnected huang et al 1998 serreze et al 2000 a number of recent studies have focused on understanding the implications resulting from the coupled or combined influence of multiple teleconnections on hydrological variables e g silva et al 2011 johnson et al 2013 ouyang et al 2014 wang et al 2014 sagarika et al 2015 singh et al 2015 for example enhanced precipitation and streamflow can be intensified when enso and pdo are in phase verdon et al 2004 wang et al 2014 observed that el niño caused more severe droughts during the warm or positive phase of pdo over areas in northern north america northern south america sub saharan africa the mediterranean basin northeastern asia and eastern siberia contrarily it caused wetter conditions in areas such as southwestern north america uruguay the middle east and southern china when enso and pdo were in phase the influence on dry wet global changes appeared to be magnified and extended poleward where changes are typically affected by enso alone and when they were out of phase the influence weakened or even disappeared wang et al 2014 similarly gobena and gan 2006 found that the strength of enso f relationships in parts of western canada was modulated or influenced by inter decadal variations in the pdo phases to analyze the influence of these teleconnections non linear behaviour and multiscale relationships must be considered as common oscillatory behaviour between teleconnections and hydrological variables occurs at various timescales and their relationships tend to have a non linear nature e g wu et al 2006 hsieh et al 2006 fleming et al 2007 gobena and gan 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014a cannon 2015 sagarika et al 2015 consequently the use of standard composite or correlation analysis alone is not ideal because such methods do not distinguish variations at differing timescales nor do they accommodate non monotonic and non linear relationships wu et al 2006 fleming and dahlke 2014a many recent studies particularly after the work carried out by torrence and compo 1998 demonstrated that spectral analysis methods based on the use of the wavelet transform wt were promising tools to analyze multiscale relationships in hydroclimatic variables e g grinsted et al 2004 andreo et al 2006 fu et al 2012 fierro and leslie 2013 nalley et al 2016 niu and chen 2016 schulte et al 2017 li et al 2018 the wavelet basis function is scaled as it is shifted along the analyzed time series decomposing these time series into a two dimensional time frequency format composed of a series of scaled and shifted versions of the mother wavelet drago and boxall 2002 loboda et al 2006 the wt is preferred over conventional spectral analysis methods such as the fourier analysis because the wavelets are localized in time and frequency domains the wt is therefore better able to identify important features or events such as discontinuities sharp jumps and shifts and modes of dominant variability in a signal at the exact temporal locations labat 2005 rehman and siddiqi 2009 yuan et al 2010 using wt significant periodicities in a signal and how they fluctuate over time can therefore be revealed and possibly linked to physical mechanisms such as teleconnection activities nalley et al 2016 pathak et al 2017 schulte et al 2016 to quantify the relationships between two hydroclimatic variables at differing timescales bivariate wavelet coherency wtc which is based on the continuous wavelet transform cwt has been used e g andreo et al 2006 keener et al 2010 perez valdivia et al 2012 nalley et al 2016 as teleconnections typically display strong activities at certain periodic scales e g enso at 2 7 years pdo at 15 25 and 50 70 years similar oscillatory behaviour between a teleconnection and hydrological variables such as precipitation and streamflow can be identified at these timescales using wtc as the name implies the applications of wtc are limited to two variables moreover while past studies have provided significant information on many aspects of the interactions between various teleconnections and hydrologic variables most have focused solely on bivariate relationships since processes affecting precipitation and streamflow variability may simultaneously involve multiple scale dependant climatic factors the wtc method cannot be used when the purpose is to investigate localized relationships involving more than two variables hu and si 2016 hu and si 2016 compared the performance of methods used to analyze multivariate relationships in geoscience data namely multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd multiple spectral coherence msc and their newly proposed method based on cwt multiple wavelet coherence mwc hu and si 2016 showed that mwc outperformed the other methods due to the method s ability to localize multiscale relationships using multiple predictor variables particularly for non stationary data both memd and msc underestimated the variance or coherence when multiple predictor variables were simultaneously involved for a response variable hu and si 2016 the mwc is important and useful in the present study since it has the ability to assess the influence of more than one teleconnection simultaneously at various timescales in a canadian context no studies to date have specifically analyzed the influence of the different phases of enso nao and pdo together with their combined influence at differing time frequency scales in light of this the main goal of this research was to use wt based methods to analyze the individual and combined or simultaneous influences of enso nao and pdo on monthly precipitation and streamflow variability the methodology used involves the combination of cwt wtc mwc and non parametric statistical tests to address the following specific objectives 1 to assess the individual influence of enso nao and pdo based on a the multiscale relationships between each teleconnection and either precipitation or streamflow and b the amounts of precipitation and streamflow associated with the different phases of each teleconnection 2 to assess the combined influence of the teleconnections using mwc by simultaneously considering two factors i e enso nao enso pdo and nao pdo and three factors i e enso nao pdo to demonstrate the application of the methods in addressing the objectives of the present study data from three canadian watersheds in three distinct climatic regions were used the watersheds are located in alberta ab ontario on and newfoundland nf this study is the first to provide an assessment of multiscale and multivariate analyses based on wt involving enso nao and pdo and how these teleconnections can be used to explain the variability of precipitation and streamflow 2 study sites and data 2 1 precipitation and streamflow data monthly total precipitation and monthly average streamflow data from three watersheds in ab on and nf canada were used in this study total precipitation data were recorded by meteorological stations and were obtained from the adjusted precipitation second generation dataset the details of the adjustment procedures are found in mekis and vincent 2011 streamflow data were obtained from gauging stations that belonged to the reference hydrometric basin network rhbn a network containing stations that best represent areas of natural and stable hydrological conditions monk et al 2011 and which had at least 20 years of high quality data zhang et al 2001 since the present study only focuses on the influence of natural climate phenomena through teleconnections it does not consider human activities therefore rhbn sites representing pristine conditions were suitable for the purpose of this study for the ab watershed waterton served as the gauging station while lethbridge and crowsnest served as the meteorological stations for the on watershed missinaibi and kapuskasing were the gauging and meteorological stations respectively for the nf watershed gander and gander s international airport were the gauging and meteorological stations respectively fig 1 shows the locations of these watersheds and their respective meteorological and gauging stations the watersheds were selected based on the availability of gauging and meteorological stations within the watersheds and the length of the available precipitation and streamflow data since one of the objectives of this study was to assess the simultaneous influences of multiple teleconnections on precipitation and streamflow the locations of the meteorological and gauging stations were chosen so that they were within the same watershed or at least in relatively close proximity to each other ideally multiple meteorological stations for each of the gauging stations would be used as physiographic conditions may differ even within a watershed especially in large sized watersheds burn 1997 smakhtin 2001 burn 2008 however there was only a limited number of meteorological stations with appropriate data lengths within the watersheds used this excluded the possibility of using multiple meteorological stations for each watershed only the ab watershed had two meteorological stations additionally the watersheds used were relatively small with the missinaibi river in the on watershed being the largest with a drainage area of 8574 km2 it can therefore be assumed that no significant differences in physiographic conditions exist furthermore since the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the uses of wt based multivariate and multiscale approaches using a limited number of representative meteorological stations was considered sufficient as it was necessary to provide details on the findings obtained from applying the proposed approaches for each watershed streamflow data ranged from 64 to 93 years precipitation data ranged from 31 to 103 years 31 years of precipitation data from the crowsnest station in the ab watershed is short for capturing the low frequency periodicities of pdo e g 50 years the other set of precipitation data had a length of 103 years which is sufficient to capture the main periodicities of enso nao and pdo that range from intra annual to inter decadal scales similarly for the on watershed the length of the first precipitation dataset of kapuskasing station was 34 years but the second set was 60 years for the nf watershed the lengths of all datasets were greater than 64 years missing values were only found in precipitation data at the kapuskasing station on where several monthly records from 1979 were missing since continuous data with a constant sampling interval is necessary for the wt computation kapuskasing s data were divided into two periods 1919 1978 and 1980 2013 and 1979 was excluded 2 2 enso nao and pdo data the length of teleconnection data used varied according to the length of precipitation and streamflow data for each watershed 2 2 1 enso enso describes the movement of water in the equatorial pacific ocean associated with variations in the sst and coupled with fluctuations in atmospheric pressure patterns in the tropical indian and pacific oceans related to the pacific trade winds it has well known recurring periodicities of 2 7 years the measure of enso intensity used in this study was based on the averaged sst anomaly over niño region 3 4 5 n 5 120 w 170 w the 3 month averaged sst anomaly data were calculated for 12 overlapping seasons per year

normalized slp difference between high pressure centres in gibraltar and low pressure centres in southwest iceland hurrell and van loon 1997 jones et al 1997 the nao index is calculated based on the

2 3 pdo the pdo is a large scale climate pattern of sst fluctuations between cool sst anomalies in the east central north pacific and warm sst anomalies around the central west coast of north america the periodicity of pdo is understood to recur at inter decadal around 15 25 years to multi decadal scales around 50 70 years mantua et al 1997 compared to enso and nao the pdo has longer cycles that can last around 20 30 years mantua et al 1997 minobe 1997 the pdo is measured as the monthly mean sst anomaly based on the 1901 2000 period for the north pacific north of 20 n the pdo data were obtained from the earth system research laboratory physical sciences division of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration http www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices 3 methodology and theoretical background this study performed multiscale analyses of the individual and combined influences of enso nao and pdo on precipitation and streamflow for the individual influence the analysis was conducted for one teleconnection at a time on the entire dataset and on the datasets extracted according to the different phases of the teleconnections for the combined influence the analysis was conducted using two factors simultaneously i e enso nao enso pdo and nao pdo or all three factors simultaneously i e enso nao pdo correlation analyses non parametric tests to compare two samples and wt based methods were used and carried out in matlab according to procedures outlined below sections 3 1 3 4 the analytical framework of the procedures is given in fig 2 3 1 applying the continuous wavelet transform the cwt was performed on the precipitation streamflow enso nao and pdo data to determine their dominant mode s of variability applying cwt decomposes the time series into all possible and continuous scales and produces a two dimensional wavelet spectrum that reveals the temporal evolution and variability of each periodicity torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2007 the morlet wavelet a commonly used wavelet in hydrological studies was used in this study for its ability to adequately describe the shape of hydrological type data labat 2005 2006 furthermore it has a better frequency resolution than other wavelets mi et al 2005 massei et al 2011 mi et al 2005 found that the morlet wavelet was better at detecting and localizing different events in ecological data compared to other wavelets such as the mexican hat paul and daubechies wavelets the complex part of the morlet s wavelet coefficients produces the amplitude and phase of the analyzed time series to assess the coherence between two signals the morlet wavelet can be expressed as torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 1 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where i 1 the value of ω0 which is the frequency localization is commonly chosen to be 6 for the morlet wavelet because it gives a good balance between time and frequency localizations torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 the cwt on a time series can then be written as grinsted et al 2004 2 w t x s δ t s t 0 t 1 x t ψ 0 t t δ t s where xt is the analyzed time series that is recorded in a discrete time sequence t with a uniform interval of δt and s represents the scaling factor of the mother wavelet the mother wavelet depends on a time variable η s t which normalizes the cwt to have unit energy this normalization allows all scales to be directly comparable to each other finally the wavelet coefficients wψ of the cwt on a time series with the scaled and translated wavelet ψ and a translation factor for the centre of the window function θ is written as the asterisk is the complex conjugate function torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 3 w ψ s θ 1 s x t ψ t θ s δ t liu et al 2007 showed that an underestimation of energy in the high frequency or lower scale components occurs because the conventional cwt calculation does not include the inverse of the scale to correct this bias the calculation of the wavelet power should include the inverse of the scale which is done by dividing the conventional power by the corresponding scale liu et al 2007 this present study adopted this bias correction procedure 4 e n s x n s 2 s 3 2 determining the phases of enso nao and pdo 3 2 1 enso s phases el niño positive la niña negative and neutral there is no universal method used for categorizing the el niño positive enso and la niña negative enso events in this study following the procedures used in fu et al 2007 and ouyang et al 2014 the el niño and la niña events were defined when the 5 month running means of the recorded sst anomalies consecutively for at least 6 months exceeded 0 4 c and fell below 0 4 c respectively the running mean values between 0 4 and 0 4 were categorized as the neutral phase 3 2 2 nao s phases positive negative and neutral positive and negative nao phases were taken when the recorded values were above and below one standard deviation from the overall mean respectively wettstein and mearns 2002 o malley 2006 afzal et al 2013 values in between were categorized into the neutral phase 3 2 3 pdo s phases positive and negative since the cycle of pdo is mainly inter decadal 11 year running means were used to reflect its variability a procedure similar to the one used in wang et al 2014 the running mean values above and below zero indicated positive and negative pdo phases respectively wang et al 2006 2014 3 2 4 extracting the precipitation and streamflow data according to the phases of teleconnections once the threshold or range values for the phases of enso nao and pdo were determined each monthly record of these teleconnections was then assigned either a positive negative or neutral phase then each precipitation and streamflow record corresponding to the teleconnection was assigned the same phase accordingly data that belonged to the same phase were then grouped together in an ascending order of time producing positive negative and neutral datasets 3 3 determining the individual influence of enso nao and pdo 1 spearman s rank correlation coefficients r values were calculated for each enso nao and pdo with precipitation and with streamflow the r values were calculated for the entire dataset prior to the determination of phases and for the datasets of the different phases i e positive negative and neutral datasets 2 the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test was then applied to determine whether the differences in the amount of precipitation and streamflow were significant between any two phases positive negative positive neutral and negative neutral 3 the amount of precipitation and streamflow during the positive negative and neutral phases was individually compared to the respective variable s long term average these measurements were presented as percent changes steps 1 3 were used as a measure of how the different phases of enso nao and pdo affected the amount of precipitation and streamflow 4 bivariate wtcs were applied on the entire dataset to assess the multiscale relationships of a teleconnection with precipitation or streamflow the spectra produced revealed and delineated significant coherence between enso nao pdo and precipitation or streamflow only the non parametric approaches wilcoxon rank sum test and the spearman s rank correlation and the percent change measures were used when assessing the influence of the positive negative and neutral phases of the teleconnections on the precipitation and streamflow data extracted to the different phases accordingly the bivariate wtc and mwc approaches were not used in the assessment of the different phases due to two factors short data length and unequal time intervals short data length might affect the interpretations of the wavelet analysis when computing the cwt on a time series with a finite length the issue of border distortion effect is introduced which occurs when the convolution process cannot occur outside the ends of signals where there is no information available su et al 2011 the zero padding procedure can be used to extend the time series bringing the data length up to the next dyadic power of two level strang and nguyen 1997 the convolution operation then involves artificial values which results in the cone of influence coi an area near the edges in the power spectrum where the wavelet power might be weaker than actually indicated torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 kallache et al 2005 as understood from section 3 2 determining the phases of enso nao and pdo the extracted streamflow and precipitation data following the positive negative and neutral phases of the teleconnections may only contain short time series at a time before the phase changes this was particularly noticeable for enso and nao phases where each phase may only exist for a few years or less thus the computation of the cwt and the bivariate wtc and mwc which are based on the cwt on short time series might result in extensive coi regions which would not allow for meaningful interpretation or proper feature extractions at least from a practical point of view furthermore uniform time intervals are required for the cwt computation see eqs 2 and 3 again the extracted streamflow and precipitation data according to the positive negative and neutral phases section 3 2 did not always have uniform time intervals because a phase was interrupted by the existence of the other phase s as such the computation of the cwt would not work on the extracted precipitation and streamflow data for the same reason the wtc and mwc could not be computed on the extracted data 3 3 1 spearman s rank correlation the time series for a teleconnection and either precipitation or streamflow were represented by xt t 1 n and yt t 1 n respectively the records in xt and yt were then ranked and the ranks were represented by rx1 rx2 rxn and ry1 ry2 ryn respectively the spearman s rank correlation coefficient r was calculated using sneyers 1990 5 r 1 6 d 2 n 3 n where n is the number of pairs d is the difference between ranks of a teleconnection and either p or f for a specific recording time t 3 3 2 wilcoxon rank sum test the wilcoxon rank sum test is a non parametric test used to determine whether two sets of samples have the same distribution each run of the test was applied to two datasets the extracted precipitation or streamflow data during positive negative positive neutral and negative neutral phases of each teleconnection since the samples were larger than 10 the normal approximation z statistic was used to compute the p value for two samples of either precipitation or streamflow yt1 t1 1 n1 and yt2 t2 1 n2 where n1 n2 the calculated z value was mann and whitney 1947

significant difference between the two phases analyzed 7 u r yn n n 1 2 r yn is the sum of ranks in the sample eq 7 was applied to n1 and n2 and the smaller of u1 or u2 was chosen as u the σ a d j was adjusted when there were ties in ranks as follows mann and whitney 1947 hollander and wolfe 1999 8 σ a d j 2 t i e d r a n k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 where n3 n1 n2 tj represents the number of points having rank j and k is the number of untied ranks 3 3 3 bivariate wavelet coherence bivariate wtc measures the intensity of covariance between two time series one teleconnection and either precipitation or streamflow in time frequency domains wtc is based on the smoothed auto and cross wavelet power spectra between the two variables where wavelet coefficients are calculated for the different time and scales for each variable involved torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 bivariate wtc between a teleconnection xt and either precipitation or streamflow yt is torrence and webster 1999 grinsted et al 2004 9 r t 2 s s s 1 w t xy s 2 s s 1 w t x s 2 s s 1 w t y s 2 w t x and w t y are the cwt of xt and yt respectively w t xy is the cross wavelet spectrum and s is the smoothing operator which is 10 s w s scale s time w t s sscale and stime are the smoothing along the wavelet scale and time respectively the smoothing operator for the morlet wavelet is torrence and webster 1999 11 s time w s

rectangle function and 0 6 represents the scale decorrelation length factor for the morlet wavelet which was empirically determined by torrence and compo 1998 the phase of the bivariate wtc is calculated as follows hu and si 2016 12 θ tan 1 i w yt x t s t r e w yt x t s t i and re are the imaginary and real components of w t y x s t respectively 3 4 determining the combined influences of enso nao and pdo multiple wavelet coherences were used to determine the periodicities of significant coherence when two and three teleconnections were simultaneously involved the two factor cases included enso nao enso pdo and nao pdo while the three factor case included all teleconnections enso nao pdo 3 4 1 multiple wavelet coherence like the wtc the mwc is also based on auto and cross wavelet power spectra among the analyzed variables the response variable yt was either precipitation or streamflow and there were either two or three predictor variables xt xenso xnao xpdo the mwc ρ m 2 s t at scale s and time t is expressed as hu and si 2016 13 ρ m 2 s t w t y x s t w t y x s t w t x x s t w t y y s t w t y x s t is the matrix of the smoothed cross wavelet power between the response and predictor variables w t x x s t is the matrix of the smoothed auto and cross wavelet power among the multiple predictor variables and w t y y s t is the matrix of the smoothed wavelet power of the response variable the w t y x s t represents the complex conjugate of w t y x s t the 95 significance level and the confidence intervals of all wt cwt wtc and mwc were calculated using a monte carlo repetition 1000 repetitions based on the first order autocorrelation coefficient for more detail on calculating the 95 significance level and the confidence intervals using a monte carlo method readers can refer to studies such as torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 hu and si 2016 in the present study for each wtc or mwc computation the average power of wavelet coherence awc and the percentage of the numbers of power that were significant at the 95 significance level posp over all scales were calculated the awc and posp were used as measurements to examine the relative dominance of individual teleconnections or combinations of teleconnections on precipitation and streamflow variability in each watershed the awc was calculated by averaging the wavelet coherence produced over all scales according to the coherence values produced in the wtc computation and in the mwc computation the posp was obtained by calculating the ratio of the number of significant values of power over the total number of values of the power produced in the wtc computation and in the mwc computation significant power occurs when the ratio of the power over the significance level is greater than 1 higher overall awc and posp values indicated more dominance hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 this implies that the teleconnection s involved in the wtc and mwc computations were needed to explain the variation in the respective precipitation or streamflow dataset analyzed although an additional explanatory variable i e the teleconnections may increase the coherence with precipitation or streamflow the increase in posp by at least 5 should be observed before concluding the additional explanatory variable has a practical significance hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 4 results and discussions 4 1 individual and combined influences of enso nao and pdo the individual influence was assessed using non parametric analysis involving the wilcoxon rank sum test the spearman s rank correlation percent change measures and the wtc while the combined influence was assessed using the mwc method due to space limitations only the wavelet spectra cwt wtc and mwc for precipitation and streamflow from the ab watershed are presented in the results section to illustrate the methods used and how the results were used to achieve the goals of this study the corresponding wavelet spectra for the on and nf watersheds are given in the appendix section 4 1 1 non parametric analyses to assess the influence of the phases of teleconnections the effects of the positive and negative phases were generally opposite to each other fig 3 the effect of the neutral phase was almost always in agreement with that of the negative phase fig 3 and there were no significant differences in the amount between the negative and neutral phases except for nao p at lethbridge ab z 2 87 p 0 05 table 1 the positive phase especially of enso and nao was mainly associated with negative precipitation and streamflow percent changes while negative phases were mostly associated with positive percent changes fig 3 these observations were supported by the correlation values table 2 where significant negative and positive r values were shown mainly for the positive phase and negative phase respectively fig 3 and table 2 therefore indicate that positive enso and positive nao were more likely associated with or caused drier conditions whereas negative enso and negative nao were associated with wetter conditions similar results have previously been observed in other studies for canada e g shabbar et al 1997 mengistu et al 2013 where higher enso values were associated with a warmer and drier climate leading to lower precipitation and streamflow the responses of the positive and negative phases however were not mirror images nor were they linear fig 3 table 2 the causes of nonlinearity during particularly strong el niño episodes have been attributed to physical mechanisms stemming from the initiation of deep convection in the tropical pacific as a result of the sst threshold hoerling et al 1997 2001 this causes an asymmetry in the magnitude of tropical convection and a phase shift leading to non linear and non mirror images in response to the opposite phases of enso hoerling et al 1997 2001 the response of precipitation and streamflow to enso in the northern hemisphere has been identified in several studies to be quadratic polynomial e g wu et al 2005 fleming and dahlke 2014a b significant differences in the amount of precipitation and streamflow among the different phases particularly between the positive and negative and between the positive and neutral were evident fig 3 table 2 however this was more noticeable for enso and nao less so for pdo in the ab and on watersheds where positive enso and positive nao were clearly associated with negative percent changes fig 3a and b table 1 for the nf watershed the differences in the amounts of precipitation and streamflow and in the percent change especially between the positive and negative phases were not as striking as they were for the other two watersheds fig 3c table 1 for pdo it appeared inconclusive as to whether positive or negative phases were strongly associated with lower or higher amounts of precipitation and streamflow respectively significant negative correlations were only found for pdo and they were seen for precipitation at kapuskasing on during 1980 2013 for positive pdo r 0 13 p 0 05 and precipitation at crowsnest ab during 1963 1993 for negative pdo r 0 24 p 0 05 table 2 it was also noted that compared to enso and nao the percent changes in pdo s positive and negative phases were generally low all percent changes absolute values in pdo were 5 except for f at waterton ab 6 2 and precipitation at lethbridge ab 5 1 both during the positive pdo again this may indicate that the differences between the positive and negative phases in pdo are not substantial compared to those in enso and nao 4 1 2 wavelet analyses cwt wtc and mwc the bivariate wtc spectra for all watersheds fig 4 appendices a 1 and b 1 showed significant coherence at various scales greater than 12 months i e the annual periodicity table 3 this was not evident in their respective precipitation and streamflow cwt spectra the cwt spectra showed that both precipitation and streamflow in all watersheds were strongly characterized by the annual periodicity fig 5 appendices a 2 and b 2 typical for canada s hydro meteorological data adamowski and prokoph 2014 nalley et al 2016 the annual periodicity could however be related to events such as annual spring snowmelt for streamflow significant regions around 6 months were also consistently observed this indicated that there were lower frequencies between the teleconnections and precipitation and streamflow that were simultaneously oscillating but could not be seen in their cwt alone the dominancy of the annual periodicity may have also concealed the significance of other low frequency periodicities in the original cwt for the mwc analysis it considered two factors i e enso pdo enso nao and nao pdo or three factors i e enso nao pdo simultaneously the awc and posp values produced from the wtc and mwc analyses allowed for the identification of the most influential teleconnection s for each watershed as well as the combination of teleconnections that best explain the variability in precipitation and streamflow 4 1 2 1 alberta watershed for streamflow at waterton periodicities of significant wtc coherence for nao and particularly for pdo which are known to occur at longer time scales were well reflected nao s coherence up to scales of 48 months was apparent with nao being the only index to have a significant correlation with streamflow for the entire data category r 0 10 p 0 05 table 2 pdo had significant wtc coherence between 96 and 192 months and greater than 192 months 16 years fig 4a table 3 when comparing the awc and posp for all scales among the wtcs pdo flow had the highest values awc 0 37 posp 10 82 table 4 moreover for the two factor cases of the mwc in streamflow significant periodicities at scales of 12 months and greater were increasingly extensive when pdo was involved i e enso pdo flow and nao pdo flow fig 6 a in particular significant coherence at scales between 128 and 256 months was especially prominent potentially reflecting the low frequency periodicities of pdo for the three factor case in streamflow i e enso nao pdo flow significant coherence at scales greater than 32 months particularly around 125 256 months reflected the coherence with pdo this was evident in the wtc of pdo flow fig 4a suggesting the low frequency influence of pdo it was thus evident that for streamflow in this watershed individually pdo appeared to have the strongest influence for the combined influence the mwc showed that the awc and posp values for all the two factor cases were higher than any of the individual cases the three factor case showed even higher awc 0 79 and posp 74 43 values compared to any of the two factor cases table 4 this implied that in addition to pdo enso and nao were necessary predictors in the multivariate analysis in order to best explain the variability of streamflow in this watershed despite their influence being individually less than that of pdo in terms of precipitation crowsnest and lethbridge stations showed quite different bivariate wtc spectra concerning enso and nao for example significant coherence with enso between 48 and roughly 72 months was seen only at crowsnest and not at lethbridge fig 4b and c table 3 similarly significant coherence with nao at scales greater than 96 months was also seen for crowsnest only these incongruities between the two precipitation datasets may have resulted due to the differences in their data periods crowsnest data were for 1963 1993 while lethbridge data were for 1902 2004 although precipitation at lethbridge station covered almost all of the 20th century and should have captured longer periodicities such as those that characterize nao significant coherence at higher scales was not obvious in its enso precipitation and nao precipitation wtc spectra this may suggest that the influence of enso and nao at higher scales in this watershed was only apparent between the mid 1960s to the late 1990s this could not have been concluded through the use of spearman s correlation results alone table 2 both the awc and posp values of enso precipitation and nao precipitation over all scales were also higher during 1963 1993 compared to those during 1902 2004 table 4 past studies such as coulibaly and burn 2004 2005 also observed strong relationships between canada s streamflow and teleconnections including enso and nao since the 1950s this timing appeared to be related to peak activities of enso evident since the 1960s and phase shifts of nao extreme negative in the 1960s and high positive since 1970 anctil and coulibaly 2004 coulibaly and burn 2004 2005 furthermore it has been mentioned that while relationships between a climate index and precipitation or streamflow may be able to be explained for certain times for example due to factors such as changes in the magnitude of the strength of climate indices the coherencies can also be short lived and sometimes there are no explainable or apparent reasons for this chaotic behaviour e g ramage 1983 seager and hoerling 2014 for precipitation at crowsnest the enso nao precipitation and enso pdo precipitation had similar values of awc 0 66 and 0 65 and posp 47 14 and 47 29 which were higher when compared to those for the nao pdo precipitation awc 0 63 and posp 42 72 table 4 significant coherence at scales around 32 64 months was most likely related to enso and for scales greater than 96 months the coherence may be due to the pdo furthermore among the individual wtc cases the awc and posp for enso precipitation and pdo precipitation were higher compared to those for nao p table 4 and precipitation at crowsnest had the highest correlation with pdo r 0 16 p 0 05 followed by enso r 0 11 p 0 05 table 2 these observations suggested that for precipitation at crowsnest the influence of enso and pdo individually was stronger than nao the mwc results showed that enso pdo precipitation for crowsnest was not sufficient in achieving the highest awc and posp values the addition of nao although independently nao did not show strong influence was needed creating the three factor case in order to achieve the highest awc and posp values table 4 similarly for precipitation at lethbridge the strong influence of the pdo was again apparent the values of awc and posp for the wtc individual cases showed that pdo precipitation was higher awc 0 41 posp 12 76 compared to enso and nao awc 0 32 and 0 34 respectively posp 3 86 and 7 44 respectively table 4 it was not surprising that the highest awc and posp for the mwc two factor cases was seen when the pdo was involved i e enso pdo precipitation and nao pdo precipitation furthermore some of the significant coherence at the inter annual scales e g around 96 and 192 384 months identified in the mwc spectra of the two and three factor cases also appeared in the wtc spectrum of pdo precipitation fig 4c like the precipitation at crowsnest the awc and posp of the two factor cases were higher than any of the individual cases but the three factor combination of enso nao pdo precipitation was again the one that showed the highest awc and posp values table 4 for the ab watershed results of the wtc and mwc analyses collectively showed that the inter annual influence of pdo was the most prominent the roles of enso and nao were also evident as shown in some of the bivariate wtc spectra and in the significant r values when combined with pdo the mwc analyses showed that the combination of enso nao pdo creating the three factor cases was needed to obtain the highest value of awc and posp for all precipitation and streamflow data individual and two factor cases were not sufficient significant coherence was particularly apparent at high scales which could be related to the recurring periodicities of pdo it is evident that in addition to the bivariate wtc analysis the multivariate mwc analysis substantiated the significant influence of pdo this watershed is located on the southwestern side of alberta that belongs to the rocky mountain climatic region the primary sources of moisture transport in this region from the pacific ocean are related to the periodicities of enso gan et al 2007 but more strongly to pdo mwale et al 2009 past studies encompassing alberta also detected that pdo consistently appeared in the optimum predictor set for surface water supplies st jacques et al 2010 sauchyn et al 2015 for example there were strong negative relationships between the pdo and streamflow in south and central alberta st jacques et al 2010 periods of prolonged low flow depicted in the tree ring reconstruction records in the athabasca river which encompassed parts of alberta during 1111 2010 were partly associated with low frequency variability of pdo sauchyn et al 2015 4 1 2 2 ontario watershed for both precipitation and streamflow the prominent inter annual and inter decadal influence of enso in this watershed was generally more evident than nao or pdo particularly around scales of 96 and 192 254 months 16 21 years appendix a 1 table 3 these more prominent roles were also reflected in the results of the wilcoxon rank sum test significant differences between positive and negative phases and between positive and neutral phases were seen particularly for enso and nao table 1 and in the wtc and mwc analyses results for the wtc individual cases the highest awc values 0 36 and 0 39 for precipitation and streamflow before 1980 respectively and posp values 10 57 and 14 30 for precipitation and streamflow before 1980 respectively were seen for enso except for precipitation during 1980 2013 where the values were highest for nao awc 0 38 posp 13 92 table 4 for the two factor cases shown in the mwc analysis of streamflow at the missinaibi station enso nao flow and enso pdo flow showed the highest values of awc 0 63 for both combinations and posp 43 95 and 43 79 respectively table 4 and the spectrum of the three factor case appendix a 2 reflected a combination of the spectra of these two factor cases appendix a 2 it was not surprising that enso was a common factor given its evident influence in this watershed although these two factor cases had significantly higher awc and posp values compared to those of the wtc individual cases the three factor combination again produced the highest awc 0 79 and posp 74 19 values table 4 this means that adding nao into the predictor variables was needed to achieve the highest amount of significant coherence this increase can be attributed mainly to scales between 32 and 128 months that came from the two factor combination of enso nao looking at the spearman s correlation results significant r values for streamflow at missinaibi river were only observed for nao overall r 0 06 positive nao r 0 24 and enso negative enso r 0 16 neutral enso r 0 10 table 2 justifying the addition of nao for precipitation during 1980 2013 it was interesting to observe that at scales greater than 24 months it was more coherent with nao but not with enso appendix a 1 significant coherence in nao precipitation started to appear in the mid 1930s and became more noticeable after the 1970s appendix a 1 more intense nao activities in the latter part of the 20th century in the context of canadian rivers has been documented in past studies for example coulibaly 2006 found that post 1940 precipitation in canada was affected by even moderate activities of nao coulibaly and burn 2004 also suggested that the streamflow change point in canada s rivers occurring in 1970 was likely to be associated with strong nao activities particularly with the enhancement of power within the 3 6 year scales for precipitation in this watershed significant spearman s correlations were only evident for nao r 0 13 for p after 1980 and pdo r 0 07 and r 0 10 for precipitation before and after 1980 respectively table 2 but not for enso despite the evident influence of enso on precipitation the insignificant r value of enso precipitation indicated that a non significant overall correlation value did not automatically imply a non significant relationship because positive and negative relationships that existed within the two variables themselves may have cancelled each other out in addition to the wtc results the mwc spectra and analysis also showed that for the two factor cases the awc and posp were highest when enso was involved enso pdo precipitation for precipitation before 1980 and enso nao precipitation for precipitation after 1980 table 4 emphasizing again the prominent influence of enso the mwc spectrum of the combination of enso pdo precipitation had the highest values of awc 0 62 and posp 40 12 among the two factor cases for precipitation before 1980 appendix a 3 this suggests that significant periodicities greater than 48 months were mostly due to enso an inference deduced from the bivariate wtc spectrum of enso precipitation appendix a 1 in the mwc spectrum of the three factor case appendix a 3 more high power periodicities at scales greater than 16 months were apparent compared to any of the single factor and two factor cases the values of awc 0 77 and posp 70 77 of the three factor case were also the highest table 4 this significant increase in awc and posp suggests that before 1980 or during the first three quarters of the 20th century enso nao and pdo are all needed to best explain the variability of precipitation at kapuskasing for precipitation after 1980 among the two factor combinations the highest values for awc 0 64 and posp 43 21 were observed for enso nao precipitation table 4 the higher amounts of significant coherence were mainly contributed by scales around 128 months which could be attributed to the significant inter annual wtc coherence of the nao precipitation appendix a 1 it appeared that the influence of nao was more evident during the latter part of the 20th century 1 the significant regions increased noticeably in the nao precipitation after 1980 compared to the nao precipitation before 1980 appendix a 1 2 the highest significant correlation value r 0 13 for precipitation after 1980 was for nao table 2 and 3 among the wtc individual cases the nao precipitation had the highest awc 0 38 and posp 13 92 table 4 although the influence of enso and nao was stronger than pdo for precipitation after 1980 significant increases in the awc 0 79 and posp 76 01 values in the three factor case for precipitation after 1980 were observed table 4 this suggested that the addition of pdo to the enso nao was needed to best explain the variability of precipitation during the later period of the 20th century for precipitation after 1980 significant correlation values were not only seen for nao r 0 13 but also for pdo r 0 10 table 2 and significant inter annual coherence in the bivariate wtc of pdo precipitation appendix a 1 justified the inclusion of pdo as a predictor for precipitation after 1980 4 1 2 3 newfoundland watershed for this watershed individually the inter annual influence of nao was more prominent compared to enso or pdo particularly on streamflow the bivariate wtc spectrum of nao flow showed the greatest coverage of significant coherence compared to enso and pdo s spectra appendix b 1 for the wtc individual cases nao had the highest awc and posp values for both precipitation awc 0 34 posp 5 77 and streamflow awc 0 40 posp 11 26 table 4 the results of the spearman s rank correlations also show that the only significant correlation for this watershed was for nao flow r 0 10 and positive nao had a significantly lower amount of streamflow compared to the negative nao table 2 the out of phase correlations of nao flow are particularly noticeable between scales 24 and 96 months during the early 1960s to mid 1980s appendix b 1 this implies a potential inter annual influence of nao during those years appendix b 2 the values of awc and posp for nao obtained from the wtc analysis were higher for streamflow than for precipitation furthermore the highest spearman s correlation coefficient absolute value for precipitation was observed for nao precipitation r 0 05 but it was not significant table 2 these observations suggest that the influence of nao was more strongly apparent in streamflow than precipitation in this watershed the inter annual influence of enso appeared to be relatively scattered and not extensive appendix b 1 table 3 while streamflow and positive enso had a significant negative correlation r 0 16 indicating low flow during the el niño period the differences in the amount of precipitation and streamflow between the positive and negative enso phases were not significant table 1 the mwc analyses for streamflow showed that the highest values of awc 0 62 and posp 40 70 among the two factor cases were seen for enso nao flow while for precipitation it was for enso pdo precipitation awc 0 59 posp 34 5 table 4 the enso pdo precipitation appendix b 1 had significant coherence around 128 months likely reflecting the significant coherence with pdo which was seen in its bivariate wtc spectrum appendix b 1 the influence of pdo was noticeable on precipitation at gander the increase in significant coherence in the two factor case of enso pdo precipitation was also likely to be contributed by scales greater than 256 months appendix b 3 which appeared to have come from enso and pdo for both precipitation and streamflow their three factor cases showed significant increases in awc 0 77 and 0 80 for precipitation and streamflow respectively and posp 69 28 and 74 11 for precipitation and streamflow respectively compared to any of their two factor and individual cases table 4 the increase in coherence for streamflow s three factor case were mainly attributed to scales at 12 months towards the later period of the data between 16 and 64 months which may have mainly come from the coherence with nao as displayed in the bivariate wtc spectrum appendix b 1 and at around 126 months to reach the highest value of awc and posp all enso nao and pdo were needed as predictors for both precipitation and streamflow 5 conclusions this study explored three main issues in three watersheds located in three different regions of canada ab on and nf 1 the influence of the different phases of enso nao and pdo on the variability of precipitation and streamflow 2 significant coherence between each of enso nao and pdo individually with either precipitation and streamflow and 3 significant coherence among two or three teleconnections simultaneously with either precipitation and streamflow generally it was seen that the positive phase of enso and nao reflected drier conditions causing lower amounts of precipitation and streamflow whereas the negative phase of enso and nao reflected wetter conditions causing higher amounts of precipitation and streamflow these observations were more evident in the ab and on watersheds and less so for the nf watershed for pdo it was not clear how the positive and negative phases affected the variability of precipitation and streamflow in all watersheds individually and collectively enso nao and pdo influenced precipitation and streamflow differently in different watersheds using wtc and mwc this study was able to determine the most influential teleconnection among enso nao and pdo for each watershed individually pdo was the most dominant teleconnection influencing the ab watershed enso for the on watershed and the nao for the nf watershed the results of the coherence analysis showed that the strength of the linkages between a teleconnection and precipitation and streamflow varied at differing time scales due to these multiscale relationships the mwc analysis revealed that only considering one teleconnection was insufficient when explaining the variability in precipitation and streamflow although for each watershed a dominant teleconnection was determined its awc and posp values were not however the highest therefore a dominant teleconnection alone cannot fully explain the variability of precipitation and streamflow the mwc wavelet analysis also showed that significant awc and posp values were consistently higher in the two factor cases compared to those of the individual factors however the highest awc and posp values were always significantly higher in the three factor cases in all watersheds for all precipitation and streamflow this implied that enso nao and pdo were necessary to best understand the variability of precipitation and streamflow related to the teleconnections unlike most previous studies that chose to analyze the various teleconnections individually the findings of the present study emphasized that one needs to take into consideration the collective influence of these important teleconnections the multiscale decomposition and multivariate analysis in precipitation and streamflow and their connection to enso nao and pdo not only individually but also collectively provided information on the dominant periodicities of variability and significant coherence the temporal evolution of the dominant periodicities and significant coherence during the study period was also revealed through multivariate analysis this study identified important or significant teleconnections affecting precipitation and streamflow variability since the variability in precipitation and streamflow can be affected by the interlinkages of multiple teleconnections the methods applied here illustrated how to choose the most influential teleconnection s to explain the variability this study demonstrated the advantage of using mwc to significantly complement the bivariate wtc and correlation analyses this study contributes to the literature by exploring and proposing the use of wt based methods to conduct multiscale and multivariate analyses for analyzing the individual and combined influence of enso nao and pdo on precipitation and streamflow variability previously this has not been explored the findings obtained in this study also provide further insight into the finer temporal structures of precipitation and streamflow in the watersheds analyzed these insights are important to the understanding of hydrology climate interactions and the approach used in this study can also be applied in other geographical regions watershed managers and planners can incorporate the techniques employed in this study to obtain useful information that can be used as part of strategies and efforts for sustainable water resources management particularly those related to variability in water quantity caused by the dynamics of

6437,to better understand the effects of climate change on streamflow the hydrologic response to both temperature and precipitation needs to be examined at the mesoscale new york state provides a hydrologically diverse mesoscale region where sub regional clusters of watersheds may respond differently to changes in temperature and in seasonal precipitation rates connections between streamflow and climate were examined for 97 gaging stations across the state and surrounding areas for a historical period of 56 years of daily average streamflow gages were grouped into clusters if their mean annual discharge rates were strongly correlated to one another within each cluster sharp temporal changes in discharge or change points were identified these change points clustered both spatially and by flow regime with low medium and high flows increasing around 1970 for much of the state consistent with other studies in the region a step increase in catskill low flows in 2003 coincides with increases in summer precipitation and is consistent with a positive correlation between summer precipitation and annual low flows our results support previous studies that have shown that streamflow at this mesoscale is strongly tied to precipitation and the strength of that connection is modulated by land cover geographic position and seasonal moisture conditions across the state the winter spring center of volume date has moved earlier along with increasing january streamflow rates the result of warmer winter temperatures and an increased proportion of precipitation as rain the transition to a post 1970s pluvial period also coincided with more frequent peak over threshold flows statewide and this wetter period has continued to the present day keywords change point analysis streamflow trends mesoscale hydrology climate change 1 introduction the relationship between streamflow and climate has been the focus of numerous investigations in recent years driven by concerns about the effects of long term climate change on a variety of societal impacts such as those related to flood drought and water availability to serve human needs ahn and palmer 2015 archfield et al 2016 demaria et al 2016 mccabe and wolock 2014 sagarika et al 2014 these studies have applied trend analysis to examine past and ongoing changes in streamflow and forecasts based on modeled climate projections to examine likely future streamflow investigations have been carried out at spatial scales that range from a single watershed up to continental and global scales cockburn and garver 2015 milly et al 2008 sagarika et al 2014 results have shown a wide range of streamflow responses that are shaped by complex interactions among long term climate change multi year and multi decadal climate variation and seemingly random climate events that are difficult to explain deterministically archfield et al 2016 sagarika et al 2014 investigators have highlighted the need for mesoscale 100 100 000 km2 schultz 1994 assessments of hydrologic change that are beneficial to decision making and planning at the municipal state wide and regional scales de moel et al 2015 for example broad pronouncements about the effects of climate change on precipitation amount have limited benefit at local scales without a detailed understanding of the relationship between precipitation and streamflow which is highly variable across geographic regions due to factors such as snowpack storage antecedent soil moisture basin topography land cover and flow regulation resulting from dam releases irrigation and municipal allocation ivancic and shaw 2015 rice et al 2015 changes in the magnitude frequency and timing of streamflow result from a confluence of drivers including climate variability changing land use and water use and evaporation controlled soil moisture berghuijs et al 2016 jencso and mcglynn 2011 vogel et al 2011 decadal scale oscillations in patterns of atmospheric and sea surface temperature and pressure have been associated with abrupt shifts in streamflow whereas the influence of anthropogenic climate change may be observed as more gradual monotonic trends that continue into the future sagarika et al 2014 this study focuses on trends and shifts in streamflow across new york state over the past half century new york is a compelling spatial scale for investigation because of a broad set of factors that affect streamflow including marine and great lakes climate influence varied topography and geology and strong gradients in precipitation and snowfall thompson 1966 the timing and nature of shifts in streamflow are examined here across the complete flow regime and compared with step increases in precipitation rates in the context of changing temperatures to pursue a goal of improving our understanding of the connectivity between streamflow and climate variation at this mesoscale similarly we consider changes in the frequency of high flows and the volumetric timing of winter spring flows the northeastern united states ne has been included in a range of recent studies to better understand historical changes in climate and streamflow variability across the contiguous us e g ahn and palmer 2015 hayhoe et al 2010 ivancic and shaw 2015 mccabe and wolock 2014 parr et al 2015 rice et al 2015 among these and other studies the attribution of hydrologic change has received particular attention because the ne has undergone increasing trends in temperature and precipitation over the past century the ne region has warmed by 0 4 0 7 c per decade during the winter between 1965 and 2005 burakowski et al 2008 hayhoe et al 2007 kunkel et al 2013 accompanied by earlier spring snowmelt and lower snow to precipitation ratios over the past half century dudley et al 2017 dyer and mote 2006 hodgkins and dudley 2006 huntington et al 2004 regionally precipitation has been higher post 1970 marking a positive shift in precipitation coincident with the end of a drought during the 1960s that was the most severe on record burakowski et al 2008 frei et al 2015 leathers et al 2000 coincident with the end of the 1960s drought marked increases in streamflow magnitude and shifts in timing of streamflow have been observed throughout new england and the mid atlantic including parts of new york state shifts in the magnitude of annual median and minimum flows mccabe and wolock 2002 mean daily flows ivancic and shaw 2017 seasonal daily flows sagarika et al 2014 and flood magnitude and frequency armstrong et al 2012 have been linked to wetter conditions post 1970 across the ne magnitude of intense top 1 precipitation events has increased over the last half century by 55 easterling et al 2017 guilbert et al 2015 with more stations across the ne exhibiting increased precipitation trends from 1961 to 2000 in contrast to 1926 to 1960 griffiths bradley 2007 upward trends in annual peak discharge have been observed in parts of new england from 1951 to 2006 collins 2009 and the mid atlantic regions armstrong et al 2014 however flood frequency magnitude and duration have shown more fragmented patterns in the ne archfield et al 2016 these fragmented spatial patterns of flooding in the presence of more frequent and larger heavy precipitation events reflect the complex relationships between landscape properties climate regime antecedent moisture conditions snowpack and flood generation ivancic and shaw 2015 berghuijs et al 2016 viglione et al 2016 the spatially variable conditions that influence the temporal behavior of streamflow underline the importance of exploring historical trends and patterns at detailed spatial scales most recent analyses of historical hydrologic change have considered undisturbed reference watersheds from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii falcone et al 2010 dataset which consists of multiple basin characteristics for more than 9000 gages maintained by the us geological survey usgs across the us a subset of more than 1500 reference watersheds in this data set are considered to have minimal human disturbances as defined by minimal amounts of upstream control structures extractions pumping or diversions and with at least 20 years of continuous data lins 2012 whitfield et al 2012 historical analyses of streamflow behavior have largely focused on these reference watersheds e g archfield et al 2016 collins 2009 demaria et al 2016 mccabe and wolock 2014 sagarika et al 2014 where observed temporal variability in streamflow characteristics can be more confidently linked to long term trends or abrupt shifts in climate to expand spatial coverage beyond the limitations of reference watersheds some investigators have cautiously included non reference watersheds that exhibit varying degrees of regulation based on the assumption that natural signals can be identified in streams with limited human disturbance barrett and salis 2017 rice et al 2015 ivancic and shaw 2017 included both regulated and reference gages in a cluster analysis of change point timing of mean annual flow across the us from 1940 to 2014 they attributed spatially clustered change points to climatic influences while non clustered isolated spatial occurrences of change points were assumed to be attributable to human impact in this study we assess changes across multiple flow magnitude frequency and timing metrics for gages in new york state and adjacent areas over the past half century using a combination of trend and change point analysis our study includes both reference and non reference watersheds based on an assumption that consistent spatially clustered patterns observed at multiple watersheds are likely due to climatic controls ivancic and shaw 2017 isolated spatial occurrence of change points are assumed to be attributable to human factors such as dams and impoundments we then compare the timing of spatially clustered change points to long term changes and shifts in temperature and precipitation in the context of geographic position the timing of change points provides insight into the connections between streamflow and atmospheric processes these change points may be linked to the nonstationary behavior of hydrologic systems accompanied by stream channel adjustments in the case of high flows slater et al 2015 land cover change milly et al 2008 and the interaction of long term climate warming with oceanic atmospheric oscillations vogel et al 2011 nonstationarity of hydrologic systems can also be linked to human impact in the form of permanently changing the landscape and altering soil permeability evapotranspiration rates and vegetative cover dey and mishra 2017 groundwater pumping diversion changes in land cover and changes to reservoir storage also contribute to watershed scale hydrologic changes although the extent of human influence in the ne region is not as pronounced as in more arid regions of the us wang and hejazi 2011 this study provides an account of change across a diverse range of flow variables with high spatial coverage across elevations climate divisions and basin drainage areas fig 1 table 1 our statewide approach informs a regional understanding of the connections between streamflow and climate and provides a historical framework from which future predictions in streamflow can be refined based on long term climate change 1 1 study area in the ne atmospheric moisture is transferred from the atlantic ocean the gulf of mexico and the great lakes with snowmelt an increasingly important hydrologic driver as elevation and latitude increase notaro et al 2006 new york state nys is at the intersection of the new england mid atlantic ohio and great lakes hydrologic regions and varies in elevation by more than 1600 m fig 1b the underlying bedrock of the state is largely paleozoic sedimentary rock with a crystalline metamorphic dome to the north that comprises the adirondack mountains denny 1974 and areas near new york city that consists of highly metamorphosed rock at the northern edge of the us east coast piedmont region long island is underlain by cretaceous sedimentary bedrock and poorly sorted glacial till for most of the state glacial deposits and erosional features dominate the landscape in the form of till mantled bedrock uplands and alluvial fluvial and lacustrine sediment filled valleys the appalachian plateau to the south includes the catskill mountains that reach elevations of 1200 m the highlands of the north and south are divided by a lowland region that spans from the great lakes through the mohawk river valley toward the hudson valley to the east the humid continental climate of new york state spans 10 us climatological divisions controlled by large scale atmospheric circulation topography and large lake systems the temperature regimes in the region are highly seasonal while precipitation remains relatively constant throughout the year www ncdc

2015 hydrologic regimes in upstate new york defined here as north of metropolitan new york city are characterized by summer and fall low flows and large snowmelt driven spring runoff pulses shaw et al 2011 in areas of new york state just east and south of the great lakes large lake effect precipitation events are commonly observed in the fall and winter from warm lake waters with high intensity snow events occurring in december and january briley et al 2017 several studies of hydrologic change have focused on the catskill region because of its role as the principal source of new york city s water supply burns et al 2007 cockburn and garver 2015 gianfagna et al 2015 matonse and frei 2013 pradhanang et al 2013 seager et al 2012 the catskills like the adirondacks are largely mountainous and forested while much of the finger lakes region and western nys contain high amounts of both forest and cropland fig 1a southeastern portions of the state including new york city and long island are largely urban and sub urban where increasing portions of impervious cover and groundwater pumping over the past 50 years has likely impacted both high and low flows busciolano 2005 burns et al 2005 2 data and methods 2 1 data the data sets used in this analysis include daily average discharge at 97 gaging stations maintained by the u s geological survey usgs throughout new york state and surrounding areas us geological survey 2016 which includes 14 reference watersheds of minimal disturbance and 83 gages throughout the state that exhibit some degree of human influence table 1 records were selected with more than eight continuous years of data for every ten years between water years 1961 2016 and incomplete records were infilled using the monthly mean and streamflow record extension facilitator sref granato 2008 table 2 the sref methodology uses the line of organic correlation loc as part of the maintenance of variance move record extension technique hirsch 1982 to predict flows for missing daily records from highly correlated neighboring stations by minimizing errors in both the horizontal and vertical directions the move 3 vogel and stedinger 1985 was used for this analysis within the sref platform complete records that were used in the move 3 calculations are referred to here as index gages and were determined by the strength of correlation to the station with missing values gazoorian 2015 after employing the sref move 3 gap filling technique 87 of the gages used in this study contain 56 years of continuous record starting in 1961 while the remaining 13 of gages have continuous records with start dates between 1963 and 1975 the drainage areas associated with each gage in this study varied over about three orders of magnitude from approximately 10 km2 9000 km2 table 1 and are distributed throughout the state across land cover types climate regions and elevations fig 1 we used monthly precipitation and temperature data from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism dataset http www prism oregonstate edu for a record length of 1961 to 2016 this gridded dataset is based on interpolative calculations of meteorological station data with consideration of topography slope orographic and coastal effects daly et al 1994 monthly gridded prism data were resampled from 4 km to 800 m grids for finer boundary resolution and spatially averaged over the watershed area for each associated stream gage in our study time series of monthly values were aggregated by seasonal monthly average for water years 1961 2016 for trend and change point detection defined as winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son although prism datasets can have temporal inconsistencies due to station and instrument changes hamlet et al 2005 when averaged over entire basin areas trends detected in the prism data set have been shown to be nearly identical to those identified in the us historical climatology network ushcn data that had been corrected for these inhomogeneities small et al 2006 annual time series of seasonal average temperatures were inspected by loess locally estimated scatterplot smoothing which fits many regression models to local subsets of time series data in order to describe the variation in the data cleveland 1979 and was carried out using the r package stats r core team 2018 2 2 spatial clustering spatial correlation across stream gages reduces the effective sample size number of independent gages when investigating trends and change points over many sites and should not be ignored when performing hypothesis tests across a region douglas et al 2000 to address this the daily streamflow records were aggregated to mean annual flow and standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the series standard deviation as in mccabe and wolock 2014 similarly to mccabe and wolock 2014 we used hierarchical clustering of these standardized flow values to discern regional hydrologic cohesion to do this we applied the hclust r function package stats r core team 2018 using pearson correlation coefficients as a measure of similarity between gages at the start each gage was assigned to its own cluster then joined iteratively with its most similar watershed until the total number of clusters reflects a desired level of heterogeneity for this study six total clusters were chosen in order to represent the diverse topography and climate regions of nys these clusters contain groups of stream gages with similar annual mean time series spatial clustering provides a framework for examining regional variability in streamflow and can inform our understanding of how streamflow responds to basin drainage boundaries land cover and flow regulation although all gages in the ne are correlated to each other to a certain degree r 0 5 mccabe and wolock 2014 this type of spatial grouping can help explain shifts in streamflow that are caused by regional climatic processes by explaining hydrologic phenomena in terms of clusters instead of individual gages we can address some of the similarities between gages that arise from spatial correlation douglas et al 2000 2 3 flow duration curves a flow duration curve illustrates the relationship between ranked annual daily flow magnitudes and the probability of their exceedance ep annual flow duration curves fdcs were calculated for each water year across all study gages according to methods outlined by vogel and fennessey 1994 and annual time series were computed for the ep 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 probabilities of flow exceedance where the highest annual flows exhibit the lowest ep for each water year by including this wide range of flow exceedance probabilities eps the response of stream systems to changes in meteorological variables can be explored with respect to processes that govern high medium and low flow regimes flow extremes ep 0 01 0 05 0 95 0 99 were not included in this study which focuses on flow properties that comprise more central portions of the flow duration curve in new york state low flows associated with higher eps are usually observed during the late summer and early fall and include substantial amounts of groundwater supplying base flow to watersheds high flows with lower likelihood of exceedance may be generated by a combination of snowmelt heavy precipitation and high antecedent soil moisture conditions and usually occur in the spring for upstate new york while the fall season and late summer high flows are impacted by tropical cyclones and extratropical flooding smith et al 2011 by examining the entire flow regime from ep 0 1 to ep 0 9 and how it changes over time we can better predict the sensitivity of certain annual flows high medium low to changes in climate as it relates to seasonality and physical setting 2 4 peaks over threshold flood and high flow frequency were examined over the 56 year period using a peaks over threshold pot technique where a pot sample consists of the occurrence of average daily discharge value above a chosen threshold lang et al 1999 this technique of evaluating peak flows increases the sample size to more than one event per year as is the case with the annual peak flow time series threshold selection for this method can be carried out in a variety of ways such as the lowest annual peak flow for the multiannual series or an average of three to four peaks per year langbein 1949 robson and reed 1999 irvine and waylen 1986 suggested a return period of 1 2 2 years as a threshold and it has also been suggested to set the threshold according to physical overflowing water level of a specific stream bankfull e g karim et al 2017 we based our threshold detection on statistical properties of the daily average discharge series for each station similar to the method of threshold selection presented by madsen et al 1997 eq 1 1 q t μ q k σ q where the threshold qt is calculated based on the mean of the series μ q summed with its standard deviation σ q multiplied by a frequency factor k of 1 5 which is lower than the value of k 3 used by madsen et al 1997 a choice of k 1 5 leads to a lower threshold and includes more data than a choice of k 3 necessitating rigorous testing for independence of each peak the peaks occurring above qt for each water year were tested for independence to ensure that more than one peak was not counted for a single flood or high flow event independence criteria have varied in the literature for example cunnane 1979 suggested that the local minimum discharge value between any two peaks should be smaller than two thirds of the first peak and that peaks should be separated by a time determined by onset timing of each peak in the hydrograph criteria suggested by the water resources council uswrc 1982 identify independent peaks as separated by five days added to the logarithm of the basin area in square miles and the minimum daily average discharge between peaks must be less than 75 of the smaller of the two peaks if a pair of peaks do not meet these criteria then the second of the two is rejected from the data set we combined these two approaches using both of the following independence criteria and rejecting the lesser of two peaks determined to be non independent 2 δ 5 log a a n d x min 2 3 m i n a b where δ is the separation distance days between peaks a is the contributing basin area mi2 xmin is the magnitude of the lowest flow between two successive peaks a and b annual occurrences of independent pot were examined for trends and change points over the period of record at least one pot was identified in each water year for 67 gages whereas 31 gages had at least one water year with no peaks according to the threshold criteria 2 5 winter spring center of volume wscov the timing of annual spring streamflow was evaluated using the winter spring center of volume wscov approach which has been widely used in the literature to evaluate the effects of climate change in snowmelt dominated regions e g burns et al 2007 dudley et al 2017 hodgkins et al 2003 the wscov is the julian day where half the winter spring flow has passed the stream gage evaluated only during the months january through may although this day is largely controlled by spring snowmelt in the ne it is also sensitive to rain on snow events spatial distribution of snowmelt runoff and the ratio of groundwater to snowmelt whitfield 2013 the annual wscov date was averaged by cluster and graphically compared using loess smoothing to examine temporal shifts in accumulated streamflow volume during the winter spring season monthly average flows for january through may across all gages were tested for monotonic trends and changepoints 2 6 hypothesis testing and correlation analysis gradual monotonic trends can sometimes be falsely identified in the presence of abrupt shifts in the mean of a series mccabe and wolock 2002 and change points can appear in statistical tests due to the presence of linear trends busuioc and von storch 1996 in this study we tested for both gradual trends and single change points at each station using the non parametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 and pettitt test pettitt 1979 which have been featured in numerous previous studies of hydrologic change e g demaria et al 2016 sagarika et al 2014 these statistical tests were performed for each fdc exceedance probability annual time series as well as the pot and wscov over the period of record using the r package trend pohlert 2018 both the mann kendall and pettitt tests are rank based and are commonly used in hydrology because they more suitable for the typical non normal distributions of hydrometeorological variables e g anderson and gough 2017 hirsch 1982 villarini et al 2011 the slope of identified trends was calculated using a sen slope estimation method helsel and hirsch 2002 which computes the median of all possible pair wise slopes in the data and has been widely used to evaluate trend magnitudes in hydrology e g gan 1998 hodgkins and dudley 2006 to examine autocorrelation of the hydrologic time series the durbin watson test was carried out using the r package lmtest durbin and watson 1971 zeileis and hothorn 2002 statistically significant α 0 1 lag 1 positive serial correlation was present at 56 of the annual flow time series throughout low medium and high flows durbin watson p value supplementary table s5 annual monthly average streamflows for january also exhibited significant α 0 1 positive serial correlation for 55 of the gages where february through march were autocorrelated at fewer than 10 of the gages because the presence of serial correlation can increase the number of false positives when performing nonparametric trend tests under the assumption of serial independence bayazit and önöz 2007 von storch 1999 time series data for flow exceedance probabilities of 0 1 0 9 that exhibited lag 1 autocorrelation as well as mean january flows were detrended and prewhitened according to trend free prewhitening tfpw methods described in yue et al 2002 before mann kendall trend tests were performed using the r package zyp barbour and parker 2014 long term persistence ltp in hydrologic time series can artificially enhance the null hypothesis rejection rate when considering statistical trends hodgkins and dudley 2011 observed trends in a relatively short record may actually be manifestations of mutli scale fluctuations in climate drivers such as sea surface temperatures radiative forcing and greenhouse gases or other long range cycles that affect streamflow such as long term changes in soil properties or storage sagarika et al 2014 although the record length used in this study is short to reliably determine the extent of any ltp it should be noted that multiscale processes may be leading to the misidentification of some trends vogel et al 1998 to explore the relationship between streamflow metrics and meteorological variables a non parametric correlation analysis was carried out using the kendall s tau method based on concordant and discordant ranked pairs kendall 1975 seasonal monthly temperature and precipitation were compared with annual streamflow exceedance probabilities 0 1 to 0 9 as well as to the wscov to prepare the data from all watersheds for the correlation analysis annual series for each streamflow exceedance probability were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of all flow values for the study period these values were then aggregated by cluster for a standardized cluster average time series seasonal monthly temperature precipitation and wscov were also averaged by spatial cluster these cluster averaged values were used in the correlation analysis and are presented at a significance level of α 0 1 3 results 3 1 spatial clustering stream gages in this study were grouped into six clusters based on temporal clustering analysis groupings show gages with annual flows that are closely correlated with one another table 3 fig 2 the resulting clusters were spatially coherent although generally not confined to major basin drainage divides or to topographic position the central adirondack cluster spatially overlaps with the catskill cluster by approximately 1600 km2 while it shares roughly 350 km2 of watershed area with the finger lakes watersheds most of the erie allegheny gages were clustered together along the appalachian highlands and also included two gages off the coast of lake erie the housatonic gages were generally confined to areas east of the hudson river in western new england those watersheds clustered in the adirondack central new york region spanned across the mid atlantic and great lakes drainage basin as well as across high adirondack highlands and low mohawk valley topographic positions this was also the case for the finger lakes cluster most watersheds included in the catskill cluster were in forested areas although some of the more southern catskill gages were found in more urbanized areas closer to new york city along with the long island cluster the catskill cluster also contained 11 of the 17 reference watersheds included in this study comprising more than half the gages in that cluster 3 2 precipitation and temperature trends in precipitation rates were generally associated with increasing change points detected by the pettitt test at marginal significance levels of p 0 1 and were largely accompanied by significant trends which were more pronounced in the summer for all clusters except long island and erie allegheny supplemental table s1 all changes in precipitation throughout the study period were increasing and the year of increase depends on the regional cluster and the season of the year fig 3 no significant α 0 1 change points were detected for spring precipitation although a large proportion of non significant change points occurred in the spring between 1972 and 1974 and again between 1988 and 1990 fig 3 grey bars both winter and summer precipitation increased between 2002 and 2004 in the central adirondack cluster while only summer precipitation increased in the catskills this step increase in catskill summer precipitation occurred in 9 of 21 watersheds and was the most pronounced of all precipitation change points detected in this study winter precipitation increased between 1990 and 2010 in adirondack catskill and housatonic clusters while some fall increases were detected in the housatonic temperatures have increased on average across new york state by 0 14 c per decade exhibiting similar patterns throughout each spatial cluster sen slope supplemental table s2 a change point toward warmer temperatures was detected in the mid 1980s for temperatures in the winter while summer temperatures shifted upward later that decade this was followed by an increasing changepoint in fall temperatures in the mid to late 1990s although temperatures are generally getting warmer throughout the state the loess regression reveals a shift from increasing to slightly decreasing slopes during the mid 1990s in the winter fig 4 this break in slope can be explained by two cold periods in the winter 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 that have been linked to instabilities in the atmospheric jet stream over canada anderson gough 2017 the loss of arctic sea ice has been associated with a weakened polar arctic vortex which causes colder air to reach portions of eurasia and north america causing anomalously cold winter temperatures zhang et al 2016 3 3 flow duration curves across the gages and corresponding high exceedance probability ep 0 2 medium 0 2 ep 0 8 and low flows ep 0 8 approximately half of the sites exhibited significant α 0 1 monotonic trends after trend free prewhitening table s5 these trends were evident in gages representing each spatial cluster in the study

flow per year in the long island cluster the results from the pettitt test revealed statistically significant step changes that varied across low medium and high flow regimes at a significance level of α 0 1 for all gages in the study supplemental table s5 negative step changes that were statistically significant α 0 1 were found at less than 4 of all flow duration time series where all remaining statistically significant step increases were positive shifts toward higher flow rates pettitt change point test results were presented in fig 6 for series that did not exhibit serial correlation 44

exceedance occurred over the period of record for at least 30 of gages in each respective cluster fig 6 darker grey pixels step changes detected at fewer than 30 of gages were assumed to be isolated occurrences and either affected by regulation or other non climatic controls within water years 1971 and 1972 positive increases in flow magnitude were apparent throughout the housatonic finger lakes catskill and central adirondack regions and most significant changepoints were concentrated in medium flows 0 2 ep 0 8 with the exception of low flows increasing in the finger lakes and some high flow increases in the catskill and central adirondack clusters from the mid 1990s to mid 2000s the catskill region had significant increases in streamflow particularly in mid and low flows all 11 reference gages and 75 of all gages in the catskill cluster exhibited positive shifts in low flows in 2003 the mid to late 1990s also brought increasing changepoints to some medium flows in the catskill cluster 40 of all catskill gages a limitation of the pettitt change point test is that only the single highest magnitude change is detected while there may be other more subtle step changes in the record to explore the possibility of multiple step changes all records were re evaluated after 1972 as well as before 1995 for the catskill gages for the post 1972 period most clusters exhibited non significant decreases in flow magnitude between 1980 and 1982 while high and medium flows for the central adirondack gages increased abruptly along with the catskills between 2003 and 2004 supplemental table s6 3 4 peaks over threshold pettitt change point analysis reveals a point in time where a shift occurs toward more frequent peaks in all clusters over the study period fig 7 shifts primarily occurred between 1968 and 1973 with some shifts toward higher frequencies in 1995 across the catskills and central adirondacks the upward shifts in the early 1970s toward more frequent pot occurrences coincide with shifts observed in flow magnitude across all spatial clusters except long island supplemental table s3 but a similar coincidence is not observed for the early 2000s in the catskills because pot frequency is associated with high flow regimes because pot events are likely tied to event based precipitation and not monthly average precipitation rates no linkages were observed between precipitation and step increases in pot frequency most changepoints in pot frequency were accompanied by statistically significant α 0 1 gradual trends mann kendall results supplementary table s3 of those trends in pot that were significant the average sen s slope estimator showed an increase in 0 4 peaks per decade 3 5 winter spring center of volume and monthly average streamflow at almost all sites the julian day representing the winter spring center of volume wscov has shifted earlier by one to two days per decade supplemental table s3 sen s slope estimate loess regression lines show similar patterns in more than 75 of gages where a steady decrease toward earlier wscov dates pauses during the 1980s before continuing toward earlier dates after 1990 fig 8 although nine gages exhibited a negative step change in wscov either in the early 1970s or early 2000s supplemental table s3 most statistically significant changes in wscov were found using the mann kendall trend test results one quarter of the streamgages in this study showed decreasing wscov trends at a significance level of α 0 1 the average sen s slope estimate is 2 4 days per decade for gages with significant decreasing trends in the wscov across all regional clusters in the state january flow significantly increased α 0 1 by an average of 10 per decade percentage of the mean flow of record sen s slope supplemental table s4 while few gages exhibited statistically significant α 0 1 increases or decreases in flow rate in the remaining months of february may of those gages exhibiting mann kendall trends at an α 0 1 significance level the average increase in january streamflow was 12 per decade more than 45 of all gages included in this study showed significant increases in average january flow after trend free prewhitening compared to less than 5 of all gages showing increases for the rest of the winter spring season 3 6 correlation analysis seasonal temperatures did not significantly correlate with low medium or high annual flow series with the exception of the erie allegheny cluster where spring temperatures correlated negatively to high flows and winter temperatures correlated negatively with low flows fig 9 spring precipitation showed a weak positive correlation to low medium and high flows at the housatonic and long island clusters and to medium and high flows only for the catskill finger lakes and erie allegheny regions winter precipitation showed similar weak correlations to streamflow where summer precipitation showed moderate to strong correlations in all clusters fall precipitation showed no significant correlation with streamflow with the exception of low flows in the erie allegheny region winter monthly precipitation correlated negatively with the wscov for the housatonic catskill finger lakes and erie allegheny clusters fig 10 a negative correlation means that increases in winter rain could drive the center of volume earlier in the year or more dry winters associated with later centers of volume because more precipitation may be falling later in the spring accompanied by higher streamflow spring precipitation showed a significant positive relationship with the wscov for all clusters except the housatonic where correlations were positive but not significant spring temperatures correlated negatively with the wscov for all clusters except long island which only shows a positive relationship between spring precipitation and wscov the negative correlation could be tied to circumstances of increasing spring temperatures causing snowmelt earlier in the season 4 discussion step increases that occurred in 2003 and 2004 for low flows in the catskill cluster are concurrent with a significant α 0 1 step increase in monthly summer precipitation in the same region this increase is also coincident with the end of a severe drought in the summer and winter of 2002 that occurred in central and southeastern portions of new york state noaa nws 2017 although this drought in the catskills occurred over four years 1998 2002 seager et al 2007 and would not be detected as a shift in the series mean particularly using the pettitt test which not sensitive to outliers xie et al 2014 the catskill changepoints are coincident with step increases in summer precipitation these summer increases are consistent with increases in warm season precipitation magnitude that have been observed in the catskills burns et al 2007 new england hodgkins and dudley 2008 and a higher frequency of extreme warm season rain events in the northeastern united states frei et al 2015 summer precipitation and low flows correlate most strongly across the housatonic central adirondack and catskill clusters where rainfall in june july and august may have raised the water table or lake levels in the associated basins to contribute to increased base flows smakhtin 2001 low flows in new york state are generally associated with the summer and fall seasons when soil moisture conditions are at their lowest due to high rates of evapotranspiration at that time of year suro and gazoorian 2011 increases in low flows for some catskill and adirondack watersheds however have been showed to be disconnected from changes in groundwater levels and have been observed to increase in streams affected by urbanization and regulation suro and gazoorian 2011 during the same time period early 2000s increasing shifts were observed in winter precipitation particularly for the central adirondack cluster if winter precipitation is stored as snowpack this can also raise water tables in the spring and summer contributing to higher groundwater levels that influence summer base flows huntington et al 2009 the tendency toward earlier winter spring center of volume dates however indicates that this likely is not the case because more precipitation in the winter is falling as rain higher catskill low flows beginning in the early 2000s are likely not influenced by winter precipitation and are instead driven by increases in summer precipitation in the catskills which is consistent with results of a correlation analysis by hodgkins and dudley 2011 and coincident step changes in summer precipitation and annual low flows as well as their strong positive correlation in general more winter precipitation falling as either rain or snow can lead to stronger high flow responses because this is the time of year when soil moisture is highest either from infiltration of stored snowmelt or from winter rain events and reduced evapotranspiration matonse and frei 2013 step changes in high flow were not detected for 2003 2004 to coincide with these step changes in winter precipitation likely because the pettitt test only identifies a single step change and the central adirondack cluster underwent an increasing shift in high flows between 1970 and 1971 when the records were considered post 1972 gages in the central adirondack cluster exhibited increasing step changes between water years 2003 and 2004 which is coincident with step increases in winter precipitation in that part of the state supplemental table s6 this is consistent with a positive correlation between winter precipitation and most flow regimes in the central adirondack cluster with the exception of the lowest flows included in this analysis exceedance probability 0 9 the increases in flow magnitude and pot frequency circa 1970 reflect numerous reported shifts from relatively dry conditions to the post 1970s pluvial period for the northeast and mid atlantic regions e g ahn and palmer 2015 sagarika et al 2014 according to tree ring data and historical precipitation records this pluvial period is unprecedented and reflects a regional regime change toward persistently wetter conditions pederson et al 2013 gages in the central adirondack catskill and finger lakes clusters exhibited a step increase in high and medium flows during this time although almost no step increases were observed for precipitation between 1968 and 1972 that were significant at α 0 1 this lack of significant step changes in the precipitation data set around 1970 suggest that other measures should be explored to attribute these flow changes for this time period such as changes in precipitation variability strong event frequency and antecedent soil moisture changes in clusters that may have contributed to step increases in streamflow the january increases in streamflow across the state are influencing the wscov concentrating more volumetric streamflow toward the earlier part of the winter spring season over time increasing winter temperatures across the state in combination with increasing winter precipitation are likely the drivers for the positive trend in january average streamflow and earlier center of volume trends although the wscov is likely also influenced by changes in early spring march temperature the relative lack of significant changes in streamflow for the spring however suggest that the dominant factor influencing the earlier center of volume dates is concentrated in the winter the wscov date is becoming earlier for all clusters except long island which has a coastal climate and is not heavily influenced by snowmelt runoff earlier wscov across the remaining five clusters across the study area are likely due to an increase in rain on snow events driven by increases in winter precipitation and winter thaws that increase annual high flows and release snowpack storage this is consistent with superimposed winter cold spells cohen et al 2018 and trends toward winter warming hayhoe et al 2006 observed in the ne in recent decades and may be the result of arctic temperature destabilization the transition from drier to wetter conditions after the 1960s drought is consistent with a multi century tendency toward conditions of higher precipitation pederson et al 2013 has also been associated with a shift from a very negative phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao toward more positive and neutral phases bradbury et al 2002 seager et al 2012 frontal systems tend to pass through new york state more frequently during positive nao phases notaro et al 2006 and allow for more coastal storms to deliver moisture to the mid atlantic positive phases of nao have been linked to warmer temperatures in the ne notaro et al 2006 although a positive nao phase was linked to colder air temperatures in eastern canada along with a negative phase of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo hurrell 1996 new york state like many locations in the ne has undergone some land use change including dam construction agricultural land conversion to secondary forest growth and an increase in urban impervious surfaces suro gazoorian 2011 dams and reservoir impoundments lower the magnitude of high flows while moderate increases in forested land cover have had negligible effects on runoff response in new york state shaw et al 2014 and urbanization tends to increase peak flows and lower base flows finkenbein et al 2000 the catskill region contains the highest concentration of dam impoundments in the state http www dec ny gov maps nysdams kmz which may partially explain the muted high flow response during the step change in the early 2000s although more than half of the gages included in the catskill cluster are either under reference conditions have lower degrees of regulation or lie upstream from any flow interruptions the isolated occurrence fewer than 30 of gages in each cluster of statistically significant step changes throughout the region may be linked to some of these human induced watershed transformations which do not tend to occur across multiple watersheds these transformations can also occur gradually and may be linked to observed trends in flow frequency throughout the ne winter temperatures and precipitation amounts are projected to increase over the next century according to climate models that correspond to both low and high representative concentration pathways hayhoe et al 2007 if true this will result in reduced snowpack coverage particularly in late spring accompanied by earlier peak streamflow demaria et al 2016 negative correlations between seasonal average temperatures and streamflow for the erie allegheny cluster suggest that future winter warming in this region may be accompanied by decreased annual low flows this negative correlation also suggests that warming spring temperatures would be associated with dampened high flows where more intense evapotranspiration rates reduce soil moisture and surface storage more warm temperature extremes and fewer cold temperature extremes are projected throughout the ne as well as more frequent and intense precipitation under all emissions scenarios ning et al 2015 a higher occurrence of anomalously warm winters in the northeast would support the tendency toward earlier winter spring center of volume dates with earlier snowmelt conditions and rain on snow events this may be of particular importance to the western portion of the state erie allegheny and finger lakes where significant negative correlations exist between wscov and both precipitation and temperature by the end of the 21st century summer precipitation amounts are projected to decrease across the region fan et al 2014 although climate model outputs for precipitation are less certain than for temperature are not statistically significant and contrast with observed increases in low flows particularly for the catskills in the early 2000s changes in summer precipitation could be accompanied by changes in low medium and high streamflows throughout most of the state with the most pronounced streamflow response occurring at low flows 70 90 flow exceedance which is the most strongly correlated to summer rainfall across all clusters with the exception of long island projected increases in summer temperatures over the next century hayhoe et al 2008 would likely be associated with higher rates of evapotranspiration and may weaken the correlation between annual low flows and summer precipitation 5 conclusion results from this study suggest that changes in streamflow have a strong connection to changes in precipitation and to geographic location the timing of change points can provide insight into hydrologic processes that are connected to low medium and high flow regimes as well as to flood and high flow frequency across new york state seasonal precipitation and temperature have an effect on flow generation for both lower and upper flow regimes clustered time series of streamflow reveal patterns of spatial correlation that do not necessarily correspond to consistent combinations of basin characteristics including topography landscape position land use and drainage divides a diversity of temporal patterns is observed at this mesoscale despite broadly consistent changes in climate over this 56 year period climatic controls on streamflow are observed by the coincidence of increasing shifts in seasonal precipitation and annual low medium and high flow shifts that occur regionally across the state the most notable relationship is that of annual low flows and summer precipitation particularly for the catskill region which exhibited step increases in both metrics in the early 2000s the shift toward higher summer precipitation in the catskills has likely increased annual low flows which usually occur in the fall or late summer the beginning of an extended anomalously wet period after 1970 resulted in marked increases in housatonic catskill adirondack and finger lakes flows the transition from the 1960s to the 1970s also marked a change toward more frequent high flows according to the pot analysis changes in streamflow across new york state were largely abrupt positive shifts accompanied by monotonic trends more evaporative transport is expected for the northeastern us over the next century particularly in the winter hayhoe et al 2008 our historical analysis of change point timing suggests that winter precipitation is connected to both high and low flow regimes and that the observed increases will likely continue in a warming climate the wscov will likely continue to advance toward earlier in the year as winter rainfall amounts and temperatures continue to increase magnifying winter streamflow and rain on snow events additionally warm winter days will likely be associated with less precipitation to falling the form of snow which will affect the timing of medium and high flow patterns across most of the state acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation united states ear 1316429 and an

6437,to better understand the effects of climate change on streamflow the hydrologic response to both temperature and precipitation needs to be examined at the mesoscale new york state provides a hydrologically diverse mesoscale region where sub regional clusters of watersheds may respond differently to changes in temperature and in seasonal precipitation rates connections between streamflow and climate were examined for 97 gaging stations across the state and surrounding areas for a historical period of 56 years of daily average streamflow gages were grouped into clusters if their mean annual discharge rates were strongly correlated to one another within each cluster sharp temporal changes in discharge or change points were identified these change points clustered both spatially and by flow regime with low medium and high flows increasing around 1970 for much of the state consistent with other studies in the region a step increase in catskill low flows in 2003 coincides with increases in summer precipitation and is consistent with a positive correlation between summer precipitation and annual low flows our results support previous studies that have shown that streamflow at this mesoscale is strongly tied to precipitation and the strength of that connection is modulated by land cover geographic position and seasonal moisture conditions across the state the winter spring center of volume date has moved earlier along with increasing january streamflow rates the result of warmer winter temperatures and an increased proportion of precipitation as rain the transition to a post 1970s pluvial period also coincided with more frequent peak over threshold flows statewide and this wetter period has continued to the present day keywords change point analysis streamflow trends mesoscale hydrology climate change 1 introduction the relationship between streamflow and climate has been the focus of numerous investigations in recent years driven by concerns about the effects of long term climate change on a variety of societal impacts such as those related to flood drought and water availability to serve human needs ahn and palmer 2015 archfield et al 2016 demaria et al 2016 mccabe and wolock 2014 sagarika et al 2014 these studies have applied trend analysis to examine past and ongoing changes in streamflow and forecasts based on modeled climate projections to examine likely future streamflow investigations have been carried out at spatial scales that range from a single watershed up to continental and global scales cockburn and garver 2015 milly et al 2008 sagarika et al 2014 results have shown a wide range of streamflow responses that are shaped by complex interactions among long term climate change multi year and multi decadal climate variation and seemingly random climate events that are difficult to explain deterministically archfield et al 2016 sagarika et al 2014 investigators have highlighted the need for mesoscale 100 100 000 km2 schultz 1994 assessments of hydrologic change that are beneficial to decision making and planning at the municipal state wide and regional scales de moel et al 2015 for example broad pronouncements about the effects of climate change on precipitation amount have limited benefit at local scales without a detailed understanding of the relationship between precipitation and streamflow which is highly variable across geographic regions due to factors such as snowpack storage antecedent soil moisture basin topography land cover and flow regulation resulting from dam releases irrigation and municipal allocation ivancic and shaw 2015 rice et al 2015 changes in the magnitude frequency and timing of streamflow result from a confluence of drivers including climate variability changing land use and water use and evaporation controlled soil moisture berghuijs et al 2016 jencso and mcglynn 2011 vogel et al 2011 decadal scale oscillations in patterns of atmospheric and sea surface temperature and pressure have been associated with abrupt shifts in streamflow whereas the influence of anthropogenic climate change may be observed as more gradual monotonic trends that continue into the future sagarika et al 2014 this study focuses on trends and shifts in streamflow across new york state over the past half century new york is a compelling spatial scale for investigation because of a broad set of factors that affect streamflow including marine and great lakes climate influence varied topography and geology and strong gradients in precipitation and snowfall thompson 1966 the timing and nature of shifts in streamflow are examined here across the complete flow regime and compared with step increases in precipitation rates in the context of changing temperatures to pursue a goal of improving our understanding of the connectivity between streamflow and climate variation at this mesoscale similarly we consider changes in the frequency of high flows and the volumetric timing of winter spring flows the northeastern united states ne has been included in a range of recent studies to better understand historical changes in climate and streamflow variability across the contiguous us e g ahn and palmer 2015 hayhoe et al 2010 ivancic and shaw 2015 mccabe and wolock 2014 parr et al 2015 rice et al 2015 among these and other studies the attribution of hydrologic change has received particular attention because the ne has undergone increasing trends in temperature and precipitation over the past century the ne region has warmed by 0 4 0 7 c per decade during the winter between 1965 and 2005 burakowski et al 2008 hayhoe et al 2007 kunkel et al 2013 accompanied by earlier spring snowmelt and lower snow to precipitation ratios over the past half century dudley et al 2017 dyer and mote 2006 hodgkins and dudley 2006 huntington et al 2004 regionally precipitation has been higher post 1970 marking a positive shift in precipitation coincident with the end of a drought during the 1960s that was the most severe on record burakowski et al 2008 frei et al 2015 leathers et al 2000 coincident with the end of the 1960s drought marked increases in streamflow magnitude and shifts in timing of streamflow have been observed throughout new england and the mid atlantic including parts of new york state shifts in the magnitude of annual median and minimum flows mccabe and wolock 2002 mean daily flows ivancic and shaw 2017 seasonal daily flows sagarika et al 2014 and flood magnitude and frequency armstrong et al 2012 have been linked to wetter conditions post 1970 across the ne magnitude of intense top 1 precipitation events has increased over the last half century by 55 easterling et al 2017 guilbert et al 2015 with more stations across the ne exhibiting increased precipitation trends from 1961 to 2000 in contrast to 1926 to 1960 griffiths bradley 2007 upward trends in annual peak discharge have been observed in parts of new england from 1951 to 2006 collins 2009 and the mid atlantic regions armstrong et al 2014 however flood frequency magnitude and duration have shown more fragmented patterns in the ne archfield et al 2016 these fragmented spatial patterns of flooding in the presence of more frequent and larger heavy precipitation events reflect the complex relationships between landscape properties climate regime antecedent moisture conditions snowpack and flood generation ivancic and shaw 2015 berghuijs et al 2016 viglione et al 2016 the spatially variable conditions that influence the temporal behavior of streamflow underline the importance of exploring historical trends and patterns at detailed spatial scales most recent analyses of historical hydrologic change have considered undisturbed reference watersheds from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii falcone et al 2010 dataset which consists of multiple basin characteristics for more than 9000 gages maintained by the us geological survey usgs across the us a subset of more than 1500 reference watersheds in this data set are considered to have minimal human disturbances as defined by minimal amounts of upstream control structures extractions pumping or diversions and with at least 20 years of continuous data lins 2012 whitfield et al 2012 historical analyses of streamflow behavior have largely focused on these reference watersheds e g archfield et al 2016 collins 2009 demaria et al 2016 mccabe and wolock 2014 sagarika et al 2014 where observed temporal variability in streamflow characteristics can be more confidently linked to long term trends or abrupt shifts in climate to expand spatial coverage beyond the limitations of reference watersheds some investigators have cautiously included non reference watersheds that exhibit varying degrees of regulation based on the assumption that natural signals can be identified in streams with limited human disturbance barrett and salis 2017 rice et al 2015 ivancic and shaw 2017 included both regulated and reference gages in a cluster analysis of change point timing of mean annual flow across the us from 1940 to 2014 they attributed spatially clustered change points to climatic influences while non clustered isolated spatial occurrences of change points were assumed to be attributable to human impact in this study we assess changes across multiple flow magnitude frequency and timing metrics for gages in new york state and adjacent areas over the past half century using a combination of trend and change point analysis our study includes both reference and non reference watersheds based on an assumption that consistent spatially clustered patterns observed at multiple watersheds are likely due to climatic controls ivancic and shaw 2017 isolated spatial occurrence of change points are assumed to be attributable to human factors such as dams and impoundments we then compare the timing of spatially clustered change points to long term changes and shifts in temperature and precipitation in the context of geographic position the timing of change points provides insight into the connections between streamflow and atmospheric processes these change points may be linked to the nonstationary behavior of hydrologic systems accompanied by stream channel adjustments in the case of high flows slater et al 2015 land cover change milly et al 2008 and the interaction of long term climate warming with oceanic atmospheric oscillations vogel et al 2011 nonstationarity of hydrologic systems can also be linked to human impact in the form of permanently changing the landscape and altering soil permeability evapotranspiration rates and vegetative cover dey and mishra 2017 groundwater pumping diversion changes in land cover and changes to reservoir storage also contribute to watershed scale hydrologic changes although the extent of human influence in the ne region is not as pronounced as in more arid regions of the us wang and hejazi 2011 this study provides an account of change across a diverse range of flow variables with high spatial coverage across elevations climate divisions and basin drainage areas fig 1 table 1 our statewide approach informs a regional understanding of the connections between streamflow and climate and provides a historical framework from which future predictions in streamflow can be refined

with missing values gazoorian 2015 after employing the sref move 3 gap filling technique 87 of the gages used in this study contain 56 years of continuous record starting in 1961 while the remaining 13 of gages have continuous records with start dates between 1963 and 1975 the drainage areas associated with each gage in this study varied over about three orders of magnitude from approximately 10 km2 9000 km2 table 1 and are distributed throughout the state across land cover types climate regions and elevations fig 1 we used monthly precipitation and temperature data from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism dataset http www prism oregonstate edu for a record length of 1961 to 2016 this gridded dataset is based on interpolative calculations of meteorological station data with consideration of topography slope orographic and coastal effects daly et al 1994 monthly gridded prism data were resampled from 4 km to 800 m grids for finer boundary resolution and spatially averaged over the watershed area for each associated stream gage in our study time series of monthly values were aggregated by seasonal monthly average for water years 1961 2016 for trend and change point detection defined as winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son although prism datasets can have temporal inconsistencies due to station and instrument changes hamlet et al 2005 when averaged over entire basin areas trends detected in the prism data set have been shown to be nearly identical to those identified in the us historical climatology network ushcn data that had been corrected for these inhomogeneities small et al 2006 annual time series of seasonal average temperatures were inspected by loess locally estimated scatterplot smoothing which fits many regression models to local subsets of time series data in order to describe the variation in the data cleveland 1979 and was carried out using the r package stats r core team 2018 2 2 spatial clustering spatial correlation across stream gages reduces the effective sample size number of independent gages when investigating trends and change points over many sites and should not be ignored when performing hypothesis tests across a region douglas et al 2000 to address this the daily streamflow records were aggregated to mean annual flow and standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the series standard deviation as in mccabe and wolock 2014 similarly to mccabe and wolock 2014 we used hierarchical clustering of these standardized flow values to discern regional hydrologic cohesion to do this we applied the hclust r function package stats r core team 2018 using pearson correlation coefficients as a measure of similarity between gages at the start each gage was assigned to its own cluster then joined iteratively with its most similar watershed until the total number of clusters reflects a desired level of heterogeneity for this study six total clusters were chosen in order to represent the diverse topography and climate regions of nys these clusters contain groups of stream gages with similar annual mean time series spatial clustering provides a framework for examining regional variability in streamflow and can inform our understanding of how streamflow responds to basin drainage boundaries land cover and flow regulation although all gages in the ne are correlated to each other to a certain degree r 0 5 mccabe and wolock 2014 this type of spatial grouping can help explain shifts in streamflow that are caused by regional climatic processes by explaining hydrologic phenomena in terms of clusters instead of individual gages we can address some of the similarities between gages that arise from spatial correlation douglas et al 2000 2 3 flow duration curves a flow duration curve illustrates the relationship between ranked annual daily flow magnitudes and the probability of their exceedance ep annual flow duration curves fdcs were calculated for each water year across all study gages according to methods outlined by vogel and fennessey 1994 and annual time series were computed for the ep 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 probabilities of flow exceedance where the highest annual flows exhibit the lowest ep for each water year by including this wide range of flow exceedance probabilities eps the response of stream systems to changes in meteorological variables can be explored with respect to processes that govern high medium and low flow regimes flow extremes ep 0 01 0 05 0 95 0 99 were not included in this study which focuses on flow properties that comprise more central portions of the flow duration curve in new york state low flows associated with higher eps are usually observed during the late summer and early fall and include substantial amounts of groundwater supplying base flow to watersheds high flows with lower likelihood of exceedance may be generated by a combination of snowmelt heavy precipitation and high antecedent soil moisture conditions and usually occur in the spring for upstate new york while the fall season and late summer high flows are impacted by tropical cyclones and extratropical flooding smith et al 2011 by examining the entire flow regime from ep 0 1 to ep 0 9 and how it changes over time we can better predict the sensitivity of certain annual flows high medium low to changes in climate as it relates to seasonality and physical setting 2 4 peaks over threshold flood and high flow frequency were examined over the 56 year period using a peaks over threshold pot technique where a pot sample consists of the occurrence of average daily discharge value above a chosen threshold lang et al 1999 this technique of evaluating peak flows increases the sample size to more than one event per year as is the case with the annual peak flow time series threshold selection for this method can be carried out in a variety of ways such as the lowest annual peak flow for the multiannual series or an average of three to four peaks per year langbein 1949 robson and reed 1999 irvine and waylen 1986 suggested a return period of 1 2 2 years as a threshold and it has also been suggested to set the threshold according to physical overflowing water level of a specific stream bankfull e g karim et al 2017 we based our threshold detection on statistical properties of the daily average discharge series for each station similar to the method of threshold selection presented by madsen et al 1997 eq 1 1 q t μ q k σ q where the threshold qt is calculated based on the mean of the series μ q summed with its standard deviation σ q multiplied by a frequency factor k of 1 5 which is lower than the value of k 3 used by madsen et al 1997 a choice of k 1 5 leads to a lower threshold and includes more data than a choice of k 3 necessitating rigorous testing for independence of each peak the peaks occurring above qt for each water year were tested for independence to ensure that more than one peak was not counted for a single flood or high flow event independence criteria have varied in the literature for example cunnane 1979 suggested that the local minimum discharge value between any two peaks should be smaller than two thirds of the first peak and that peaks should be separated by a time determined by onset timing of each peak in the hydrograph criteria suggested by the water resources council uswrc 1982 identify independent peaks as separated by five days added to the logarithm of the basin area in square miles and the minimum daily average discharge between peaks must be less than 75 of the smaller of the two peaks if a pair of peaks do not meet these criteria then the second of the two is rejected from the data set we combined these two approaches using both of the following independence criteria and rejecting the lesser of two peaks determined to be non independent 2 δ 5 log a a n d x min 2 3 m i n a b where δ is the separation distance days between peaks a is the contributing basin area mi2 xmin is the magnitude of the lowest flow between two successive peaks a and b annual occurrences of independent pot were examined for trends and change points over the period of record at least one pot was identified in each water year for 67 gages whereas 31 gages had at least one water year with no peaks according to the threshold criteria 2 5 winter spring center of volume wscov the timing of annual spring streamflow was evaluated using the winter spring center of volume wscov approach which has been widely used in the literature to evaluate the effects of climate change in snowmelt dominated regions e g burns et al 2007 dudley et al 2017 hodgkins et al 2003 the wscov is the julian day where half the winter spring flow has passed the stream gage evaluated only during the months january through may although this day is largely controlled by spring snowmelt in the ne it is also sensitive to rain on snow events spatial distribution of snowmelt runoff and the ratio of groundwater to snowmelt whitfield 2013 the annual wscov date was averaged by cluster and graphically compared using loess smoothing to examine temporal shifts in accumulated streamflow volume during the winter spring season monthly average flows for january through may across all gages were tested for monotonic trends and changepoints 2 6 hypothesis testing and correlation analysis gradual monotonic trends can sometimes be falsely identified in the presence of abrupt shifts in the mean of a series mccabe and wolock 2002 and change points can appear in statistical tests due to the presence of linear trends busuioc and von storch 1996 in this study we tested for both gradual trends and single change points at each station using the non parametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 and pettitt test pettitt 1979 which have been featured in numerous previous studies of hydrologic change e g demaria et al 2016 sagarika et al 2014 these statistical tests were performed for each fdc exceedance probability annual time series as well as the pot and wscov over the period of record using the r package trend pohlert 2018 both the mann kendall and pettitt tests are rank based and are commonly used in hydrology because they more suitable for the typical non normal distributions of hydrometeorological variables e g anderson and gough 2017 hirsch 1982 villarini et al 2011 the slope of identified trends was calculated using a sen slope estimation method helsel and hirsch 2002 which computes the median of all possible pair wise slopes in the data and has been widely used to evaluate trend magnitudes in hydrology e g gan 1998 hodgkins and dudley 2006 to examine autocorrelation of the hydrologic time series the durbin watson test was carried out using the r package lmtest durbin and watson 1971 zeileis and hothorn 2002 statistically significant α 0 1 lag 1 positive serial correlation was present at 56 of the annual flow time series throughout low medium and high flows durbin watson p value supplementary table s5 annual monthly average streamflows for january also exhibited significant α 0 1 positive serial correlation for 55 of the gages where february through march were autocorrelated at fewer than 10 of the gages because the presence of serial correlation can increase the number of false positives when performing nonparametric trend tests under the assumption of serial independence bayazit and önöz 2007 von storch 1999 time series data for flow exceedance probabilities of 0 1 0 9 that exhibited lag 1 autocorrelation as well as mean january flows were detrended and prewhitened according to trend free prewhitening tfpw methods described in yue et al 2002 before mann kendall trend tests were performed using the r package zyp barbour and parker 2014 long term persistence ltp in hydrologic time series can artificially enhance the null hypothesis rejection rate when considering statistical trends hodgkins and dudley 2011 observed trends in a relatively short record may actually be manifestations of mutli scale fluctuations in climate drivers such as sea surface temperatures radiative forcing and greenhouse gases or other long range cycles that affect streamflow such as long term changes in soil properties or storage sagarika et al 2014 although the record length used in this study is short to reliably determine the extent of any ltp it should be noted that multiscale processes may be leading to the misidentification of some trends vogel et al 1998 to explore the relationship between streamflow metrics and meteorological variables a non parametric correlation analysis was carried out using the kendall s tau method based on concordant and discordant ranked pairs kendall 1975 seasonal monthly temperature and precipitation were compared with annual streamflow exceedance probabilities 0 1 to 0 9 as well as to the wscov to prepare the data from all watersheds for the correlation analysis annual series for each streamflow exceedance probability were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of all flow values for the study period these values were then aggregated by cluster for a standardized cluster average time series seasonal monthly temperature precipitation and wscov were also averaged by spatial cluster these cluster averaged values were used in the correlation analysis and are presented at a significance level of α 0 1 3 results 3 1 spatial clustering stream gages in this study were grouped into six clusters based on temporal clustering analysis groupings show gages with annual flows that are closely correlated with one another table 3 fig 2 the resulting clusters were spatially coherent although generally not confined to major basin drainage divides or to topographic position the central adirondack cluster spatially overlaps with the catskill cluster by approximately 1600 km2 while it shares roughly 350 km2 of watershed area with the finger lakes watersheds most of the erie allegheny gages were clustered together along the appalachian highlands and also included two gages off the coast of lake erie the housatonic gages were generally confined to areas east of the hudson river in western new england those watersheds clustered in the adirondack central new york region spanned across the mid atlantic and great lakes drainage basin as well as across high adirondack highlands and low mohawk valley topographic positions this was also the case for the finger lakes cluster most watersheds included in the catskill cluster were in forested areas although some of the more southern catskill gages were found in more urbanized areas closer to new york city along with the long island cluster the catskill cluster also contained 11 of the 17 reference watersheds included in this study comprising more than half the gages in that cluster 3 2 precipitation and temperature trends in precipitation rates were generally associated with increasing change points detected by the pettitt test at marginal significance levels of p 0 1 and were largely accompanied by significant trends which were more pronounced in the summer for all clusters except long island and erie allegheny supplemental table s1 all changes in precipitation throughout the study period were increasing and the year of increase depends on the regional cluster and the season of the year fig 3 no significant α 0 1 change points were detected for spring precipitation although a large proportion of non significant change points occurred in the spring between 1972 and 1974 and again between 1988 and 1990 fig 3 grey bars both winter and summer precipitation increased between 2002 and 2004 in the central adirondack cluster while only summer precipitation increased in the catskills this step increase in catskill summer precipitation occurred in 9 of 21 watersheds and was the most pronounced of all precipitation change points detected in this study winter precipitation increased between 1990 and 2010 in adirondack catskill and housatonic clusters while some fall increases were detected in the housatonic temperatures have increased on average across new york state by 0 14 c per decade exhibiting similar patterns throughout each spatial cluster sen slope supplemental table s2 a change point toward warmer temperatures was detected in the mid 1980s for temperatures in the winter while summer temperatures shifted upward later that decade this was followed by an increasing changepoint in fall temperatures in the mid to late 1990s although temperatures are generally getting warmer throughout the state the loess regression reveals a shift from increasing to slightly decreasing slopes during the mid 1990s in the winter fig 4 this break in slope can be explained by two cold periods in the winter 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 that have been linked to instabilities in the atmospheric jet stream over canada anderson gough 2017 the loss of arctic sea ice has been associated with a weakened polar arctic vortex which causes colder air to reach portions of eurasia and north america causing anomalously cold winter temperatures zhang et al 2016 3 3 flow duration curves across the gages and corresponding high exceedance probability ep 0 2 medium 0 2 ep 0 8 and low flows ep 0 8 approximately half of the sites exhibited significant α 0 1 monotonic trends after trend free prewhitening table s5 these trends were evident in gages representing each spatial cluster in the study and the sen slope estimator for those exhibiting significant monotonic trends are shown in fig 5 rates of change as measured by sen s slope throughout most flow exceedance probabilities 0 1 to 0 9 exhibited increases of 0 8 to 1 of the mean 1961 2016 streamflow per water year with some higher slopes of 1 to 3 per water year in the catskill cluster and slopes ranging from 1 6 to 0 5 of the mean flow per year in the long island cluster the results from the pettitt test revealed statistically significant step changes that varied across low medium and high flow regimes at a significance level of α 0 1 for all gages in the study supplemental table s5 negative step changes that were statistically significant α 0 1 were found at less than 4 of all flow duration time series where all remaining statistically significant step increases were positive shifts toward higher flow rates pettitt change point test results were presented in fig 6 for series that did not exhibit serial correlation 44 of records and for those series that exhibited significant mann kendall trends after the trend free prewhitening procedure 20 of records coincident increasing change points for given probabilities of exceedance occurred over the period of record for at least 30 of gages in each respective cluster fig 6 darker grey pixels step changes detected at fewer than 30 of gages were assumed to be isolated occurrences and either affected by regulation or other non climatic controls within water years 1971 and 1972 positive increases in flow magnitude were apparent throughout the housatonic finger lakes catskill and central adirondack regions and most significant changepoints were concentrated in medium flows 0 2 ep 0 8 with the exception of low flows increasing in the finger lakes and some high flow increases in the catskill and central adirondack clusters from the mid 1990s to mid 2000s the catskill region had significant increases in streamflow particularly in mid and low flows all 11 reference gages and 75 of all gages in the catskill cluster exhibited positive shifts in low flows in 2003 the mid to late 1990s also brought increasing changepoints to some medium flows in the catskill cluster 40 of all catskill gages a limitation of the pettitt change point test is that only the single highest magnitude change is detected while there may be other more subtle step changes in the record to explore the possibility of multiple step changes all records were re evaluated after 1972 as well as before 1995 for the catskill gages for the post 1972 period most clusters exhibited non significant decreases in flow magnitude between 1980 and 1982 while high and medium flows for the central adirondack gages increased abruptly along with the catskills between 2003 and 2004 supplemental table s6 3 4 peaks over threshold pettitt change point analysis reveals a point in time where a shift occurs toward more frequent peaks in all clusters over the study period fig 7 shifts primarily occurred between 1968 and 1973 with some shifts toward higher frequencies in 1995 across the catskills and central adirondacks the upward shifts in the early 1970s toward more frequent pot occurrences coincide with shifts observed in flow magnitude across all spatial clusters except long island supplemental table s3 but a similar coincidence is not observed for the early 2000s in the catskills because pot frequency is associated with high flow regimes because pot events are likely tied to event based precipitation and not monthly average precipitation rates no linkages were observed between precipitation and step increases in pot frequency most changepoints in pot frequency were accompanied by statistically significant α 0 1 gradual trends mann kendall results supplementary table s3 of those trends in pot that were significant the average sen s slope estimator showed an increase in 0 4 peaks per decade 3 5 winter spring center of volume and monthly average streamflow at almost all sites the julian day representing the winter spring center of volume wscov has shifted earlier by one to two days per decade supplemental table s3 sen s slope estimate loess regression lines show similar patterns in more than 75 of gages where a steady decrease toward earlier wscov dates pauses during the 1980s before continuing toward earlier dates after 1990 fig 8 although nine gages exhibited a negative step change in wscov either in the early 1970s or early 2000s supplemental table s3 most statistically significant changes in wscov were found using the mann kendall trend test results one quarter of the streamgages in this study showed decreasing wscov trends at a significance level of α 0 1 the average sen s slope estimate is 2 4 days per decade for gages with significant decreasing trends in the wscov across all regional clusters in the state january flow significantly increased α 0 1 by an average of 10 per decade percentage of the mean flow of record sen s slope supplemental table s4 while few gages exhibited statistically significant α 0 1 increases or decreases in flow rate in the remaining months of february may of those gages exhibiting mann kendall trends at an α 0 1 significance level the average increase in january streamflow was 12 per decade more than 45 of all gages included in this study showed significant increases in average january flow after trend free prewhitening compared to less than 5 of all gages showing increases for the rest of the winter spring season 3 6 correlation analysis seasonal temperatures did not significantly correlate with low medium or high annual flow series with the exception of the erie allegheny cluster where spring temperatures correlated negatively to high flows and winter temperatures correlated negatively with low flows fig 9 spring precipitation showed a weak positive correlation to low medium and high flows at the housatonic and long island clusters and to medium and high flows only for the catskill finger lakes and erie allegheny regions winter precipitation showed similar weak correlations to streamflow where summer precipitation showed moderate to strong correlations in all clusters fall precipitation showed no significant correlation with streamflow with the exception of low flows in the erie allegheny region winter monthly precipitation correlated negatively with the wscov for the housatonic catskill finger lakes and erie allegheny clusters fig 10 a negative correlation means that increases in winter rain could drive the center of volume earlier in the year or more dry winters associated with later centers of volume because more precipitation may be falling later in the spring accompanied by higher streamflow spring precipitation showed a significant positive relationship with the wscov for all clusters except the housatonic where correlations were positive but not significant spring temperatures correlated negatively with the wscov for all clusters except long island which only shows a positive relationship between spring precipitation and wscov the negative correlation could be tied to circumstances of increasing spring temperatures causing snowmelt earlier in the season 4 discussion step increases that occurred in 2003 and 2004 for low flows in the catskill cluster are concurrent with a significant α 0 1 step increase in monthly summer precipitation in the same region this increase is also coincident with the end of a severe drought in the summer and winter of 2002 that occurred in central and southeastern portions of new york state noaa nws 2017 although this drought in the catskills occurred over four years 1998 2002 seager et al 2007 and would not be detected as a shift in the series mean particularly using the pettitt test which not sensitive to outliers xie et al 2014 the catskill changepoints are coincident with step increases in summer precipitation these summer increases are consistent with increases in warm season precipitation magnitude that have been observed in the catskills burns et al 2007 new england hodgkins and dudley 2008 and a higher frequency of extreme warm season rain events in the northeastern united states frei et al 2015 summer precipitation and low flows correlate most strongly across the housatonic central adirondack and catskill clusters where rainfall in june july and august may have raised the water table or lake levels in the associated basins to contribute to increased base flows smakhtin 2001 low flows in new york state are generally associated with the summer and fall seasons when soil moisture conditions are at their lowest due to high rates of evapotranspiration at that time of year suro and gazoorian 2011 increases in low flows for some catskill and adirondack watersheds however have been showed to be disconnected from changes in groundwater levels and have been observed to increase in streams affected by urbanization and regulation suro and gazoorian 2011 during the same time period early 2000s increasing shifts were observed in winter precipitation particularly for the central adirondack cluster if winter precipitation is stored as snowpack this can also raise water tables in the spring and summer contributing to higher groundwater levels that influence summer base flows huntington et al 2009 the tendency toward earlier winter spring center of volume dates however indicates that this likely is not the case because more precipitation in the winter is falling as rain higher catskill low flows beginning in the early 2000s are likely not influenced by winter precipitation and are instead driven by increases in summer precipitation in the catskills which is consistent with results of a correlation analysis by hodgkins and dudley 2011 and coincident step changes in summer precipitation and annual low flows as well as their strong positive correlation in general more winter precipitation falling as either rain or snow can lead to stronger high flow responses because this is the time of year when soil moisture is highest either from infiltration of stored snowmelt or from winter rain events and reduced evapotranspiration matonse and frei 2013 step changes in high flow were not detected for 2003 2004 to coincide with these step changes in winter precipitation likely because the pettitt test only identifies a single step change and the central adirondack cluster underwent an increasing shift in high flows between 1970 and 1971 when the records were considered post 1972 gages in the central adirondack cluster exhibited increasing step changes between water years 2003 and 2004 which is coincident with step increases in winter precipitation in that part of the state supplemental table s6 this is consistent with a positive correlation between winter precipitation and most flow regimes in the central adirondack cluster with the exception of the lowest flows included in this analysis exceedance probability 0 9 the increases in flow magnitude and pot frequency circa 1970 reflect numerous reported shifts from relatively dry conditions to the post 1970s pluvial period for the northeast and mid atlantic regions e g ahn and palmer 2015 sagarika et al 2014 according to tree ring data and historical precipitation records this pluvial period is unprecedented and reflects a regional regime change toward persistently wetter conditions pederson et al 2013 gages in the central adirondack catskill and finger lakes clusters exhibited a step increase in high and medium flows during this time although almost no step increases were observed for precipitation between 1968 and 1972 that were significant at α 0 1 this lack of significant step changes in the precipitation data set around 1970 suggest that other measures should be explored to attribute these flow changes for this time period such as changes in precipitation variability strong event frequency and antecedent soil moisture changes in clusters that may have contributed to step increases in streamflow the january increases in streamflow across the state are influencing the wscov concentrating more volumetric streamflow toward the earlier part of the winter spring season over time increasing winter temperatures across the state in combination with increasing winter precipitation are likely the drivers for the positive trend in january average streamflow and earlier center of volume trends although the wscov is likely also influenced by changes in early spring march temperature the relative lack of significant changes in streamflow for the spring however suggest that the dominant factor influencing the earlier center of volume dates is concentrated in the winter the wscov date is becoming earlier for all clusters except long island which has a coastal climate and is not heavily influenced by snowmelt runoff earlier wscov across the remaining five clusters across the study area are likely due to an increase in rain on snow events driven by increases in winter precipitation and winter thaws that increase annual high flows and release snowpack storage this is consistent with superimposed winter cold spells cohen et al 2018 and trends toward winter warming hayhoe et al 2006 observed in the ne in recent decades and may be the result of arctic temperature destabilization the transition from drier to wetter conditions after the 1960s drought is consistent with a multi century tendency toward conditions of higher precipitation pederson et al 2013 has also been associated with a shift from a very negative phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao toward more positive and neutral phases bradbury et al 2002 seager et al 2012 frontal systems tend to pass through new york state more frequently during positive nao phases notaro et al 2006 and allow for more coastal storms to deliver moisture to the mid atlantic positive phases of nao have been linked to warmer temperatures in the ne notaro et al 2006 although a positive nao phase was linked to colder air temperatures in eastern canada along with a negative phase of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo hurrell 1996 new york state like many locations in the ne has undergone some land use change including dam construction agricultural land conversion to secondary forest growth and an increase in urban impervious surfaces suro gazoorian 2011 dams and reservoir impoundments lower the magnitude of high flows while moderate increases in forested land cover have had negligible effects on runoff response in new york state shaw et al 2014 and urbanization tends to increase peak flows and lower base flows finkenbein et al 2000 the catskill region contains the highest concentration of dam impoundments in the state http www dec ny gov maps nysdams kmz which may partially explain the muted high flow response during the step change in the early 2000s although more than half of the gages included in the catskill cluster are either under reference conditions have lower degrees of regulation or lie upstream from any flow interruptions the isolated occurrence fewer than 30 of gages in each cluster of statistically significant step changes throughout the region may be linked to some of these human induced watershed transformations which do not tend to occur across multiple watersheds these transformations can also occur gradually and may be linked to observed trends in flow frequency throughout the ne winter temperatures and precipitation amounts are projected to increase over the next century according to climate models that correspond to both low and high representative concentration pathways hayhoe et al 2007 if true this will result in reduced snowpack coverage particularly in late spring accompanied by earlier peak streamflow demaria et al 2016 negative correlations between seasonal average temperatures and streamflow for the erie allegheny cluster suggest that future winter warming in this region may be accompanied by decreased annual low flows this negative correlation also suggests that warming spring temperatures would be associated with dampened high flows where more intense evapotranspiration rates reduce soil moisture and surface storage more warm temperature extremes and fewer cold temperature extremes are projected throughout the ne as well as more frequent and intense precipitation under all emissions scenarios ning et al 2015 a higher occurrence of anomalously warm winters in the northeast would support the tendency toward earlier winter spring center of volume dates with earlier snowmelt conditions and rain on snow events this may be of particular importance to the western portion of the state erie allegheny and finger lakes where significant negative correlations exist between wscov and both precipitation and temperature by the end of the 21st century summer precipitation amounts are projected to decrease across the region fan et al 2014 although climate model outputs for precipitation are less certain than for temperature are not statistically significant and contrast with observed increases in low flows particularly for the catskills in the early 2000s changes in summer precipitation could be accompanied by changes in low medium and high streamflows throughout most of the state with the most pronounced streamflow response occurring at low flows 70 90 flow exceedance which is the most strongly correlated to summer rainfall across all clusters with the exception of long island projected increases in summer temperatures over the next century hayhoe et al 2008 would likely be associated with higher rates of evapotranspiration and may weaken the correlation between annual low flows and summer precipitation 5 conclusion results from this study suggest that changes in streamflow have a strong connection to changes in precipitation and to geographic location the timing of change points can provide insight into hydrologic processes that are connected to low medium and high flow regimes as well as to flood and high flow frequency across new york state seasonal precipitation and temperature have an effect on flow generation for both lower and upper flow regimes clustered time series of streamflow reveal patterns of spatial correlation that do not necessarily correspond to consistent combinations of basin characteristics including topography landscape position land use and drainage divides a diversity of temporal patterns is observed at this mesoscale despite broadly consistent changes in climate over this 56 year period climatic controls on streamflow are observed by the coincidence of increasing shifts in seasonal precipitation and annual low medium and high flow shifts that occur regionally across the state the most notable relationship is that of annual low flows and summer precipitation particularly for the catskill region which exhibited step increases in both metrics in the early 2000s the shift toward higher summer precipitation in the catskills has likely increased annual low flows which usually occur in the fall or late summer the beginning of an extended anomalously wet period after 1970 resulted in marked increases in housatonic catskill adirondack and finger lakes flows the transition from the 1960s to the 1970s also marked a change toward more frequent high flows according to the pot analysis changes in streamflow across new york state were largely abrupt positive shifts accompanied by monotonic trends more evaporative transport is expected for the northeastern us over the next century particularly in the winter hayhoe et al 2008 our historical analysis of change point timing suggests that winter precipitation is connected to both high and low flow regimes and that the observed increases will likely continue in a warming climate the wscov will likely continue to advance toward earlier in the year as winter rainfall amounts and temperatures continue to increase magnifying winter streamflow and rain on snow events additionally warm winter days will likely be associated with less precipitation to falling the form of snow which will affect the timing of medium and high flow patterns across most of the state acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation united states ear 1316429 and an

exhaustively assessed the methods which are highly sustainable with minimum waste generation and cost effective are also evaluated keywords fluorosis global fluoride belts geology and geochemistry of fluoride belts isotopic effects in situ fluoride removal techniques 1 introduction fluorosis is a prevalent disease caused due to higher intake of fluoride in human body agencies like the institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme world health organization who etc measure the worldwide disease burden and issues alert on endemic problems different metrics are used in disease burden quantification like the disability adjusted life year daly healthy life expectancy hale which summaries and assesses the population health including mortality and morbidity murray and lopez 1996 fewtrell et al 2006 have made one of the early attempts to examine the adequacy of existing data to determine the worldwide burden of illness resulting from elevated fluoride in drinking water supplies the population effected by fluorosis has substantially increased in the last five decades it is estimated that higher than two hundred sixty million people around the globe are affected by fluorosis amini et al 2008 after five decades of research on different types of fluorosis at present fluoride has been identified as a fait accompli fluoride can enter the human body through different agents like water air food dietary sources however water has been considered as the major source several human welfare organizations monitor the fluoride level in drinking water of different countries to avoid the health hazard caused by higher intake of fluoride the allowablelevel of fluoride in drinking water was set 1 5 mg l according to who 1984 this limit set by who is not sensu stricto different countries have set their own limit of fluoride in take through drinking water for example in india the bureau of indian standards bis sets a limit of 1 mg l bis report 2009 while the council of medical research of india special report icmr 1975 defines 1 5 mg l as the safety limit recently in 2015 department of health and human services united states recommends a maximum of 0 7 mg l modifying and replacing the earlier recommended level of 0 7 mg l to 1 2 mg l issued in 1962 the new suggested level intends to lower the rate of dental fluorosis on the basis of research work report u s department of health and human services hss 2015 however fluoride is known to be an important oligo element favorable for dental and skeletal growth boulétreau et al 2006 mcdonaghet al 2000 messaitfa 2008 when taken within the permissible limit intake of fluoride in high amount through drinking of water higher than the safe limit is the primary cause of fluorosis gopalakrishnan et al 1991 chowdhury and shepherd 1990 gopalakrishnan and mebrahtom 2006 infante 1975 gopalakrishnan and viswanathan 2012 karro et al 2006 zhu et al 2006 this is the reason fluoride is also called as two edged sword hence the balanced concentration of fluoride intake through drinking water is essential for survival fluoride is there in different other natural medium apart from water like air food soil etc the fact that the drinking water is a major concern is due to its requirement for metabolic system of living beings fluoride present in water completely dissociates into fluoride ions from the existing compounds and occurs either naturally or in the form of added salts jackson et al 2002 harrison 2005 the systematic absorption of fluoride into our body diffused from the intestinal tract through water to bloodstream is 100 cerklewski 1997 ekstrand et al 1978 whitford 1994 rao 1984 whitford 1996 doull et al 2006 maguire et al 2005 hence high fluoride level in water is the elementary source of fluorosis geogenic sources of high fluoride are discussed by several authors from different countries edmunds and smedley 2013 friedel and finn 2008 kanisawa 1979 liu and zhu 1991 messaitfa 2008 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 several geological processes are found to be responsible for increasing fluoride concentration in groundwater among the geological processes between the rock and water interaction geothermal spring volcanic processes tectonic processes weathering etc vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 baba and tayfur 2011 are the major pathways for fluoride contamination association of ions like chloride and phosphate shows a positive correlation with the fluoride concentration in water while the calcium ion shows negative correlation chae et al 2007 yoshimura et al 2004 isotopic data like isotopes of c o and h are also used to understand the origin of water and the loss of water from the system through evaporation they are further used to understand the interconnection between different aquifers and climatic control on fluoride concentration berger et al 2016 gastmans et al 2017 the fluoride level in groundwater can also be enhanced by anthropogenic causes phosphate fertilizers rodenticide fumigants herbicides and insecticides containing fluoride as an impurity datta et al 1996 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 fluoride contamination can also occur through burning of coal fly ash and emission of fluoride particulate from steel aluminum glass and tile industries vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the current review paper intends to investigate the information on available geological data suitable for estimating fluoride level in drinking water the review paper will attempt to correlate the distribution of rock types globally to indicate fluoride exposed zones and the population threatened by fluoride exposures precise geological data of this nature are however not available at the global level this paper is also the first paper of its kind to present detail description of the fluoride belts fig 1 is a pie diagram showing the number of persons affected in millions by fluorosis in different countries china and india are severely affected due to large population density there are many other countries too where fluorosis is a major threat fig 1 like kenya tanzania thailand uganda etc due to low population density in these countries the number of affected population is low but the percentage is much higher it has been a proven fact that the occurrence of high fluoride concentration is related to the geology and geography of the area as shown in figs 2 and 7 frencken 1992 marques et al 2006 he et al 2013 rosi 2003 naseem et al 2010 fordyce et al 2007 shah and danishwar 2003 tirumalesh et al 2007 colombo et al 2010 garcía et al 2012 globally there are few recognized zones that connect fluoride affected areas known as the fluoride belts the fluoride belts on globe stretches from syria through jordan fig 2 egypt libya algeria sudan and kenya and another that another stretch from turkey through iraq iran afghanistan india northern thailand and china as shown in figs 2 and 3 table 1 there are similar belts in the america and japan also as indicated in figs 2 and 3 the reported cases of fluorosis have been high in these areas and the groundwater fluoride level is also found to be elevated dahi 2009 have published in his report demarking five distinct linear stretches of fluoride belts as listed in table 1 and shown in fig 3 the belts are formed by joining the places that have high fluorosis and are geographically located within interconnected landmasses except a few of them 2 the five fluoride belts of the world recent studies break the previous belief on fluorosis as it was thought to be restricted within tropical countries dissanayake and chandrajith 2009 high fluoride concentrations in drinking water are frequently encountered in extensive geological and geographical belts these belts are associated with a tectonic zones b granites and gneissic rocks c marine sediments in highland areas and d volcanic rocks these belts identified as belt 1 2 3 4 and 5 occur globally along linear stretches connecting different countries fig 3 the five fluoride belts have been described in the following section and possible similarities between each belt are also drawn 2 1 belt 1 this belt is linear stretch that runs towards south from turkey to tanzania this belt includes turkey starting point syria jordan egypt sudan somali ethiopia kenya tanzania mozambique and south africa fig 3 the belt takes sharp turns from syria towards south west then from sudan towards south east connecting ethiopia and finally turns from somali towards south west following the edges of the africa continent detail descriptions are provided in the supporting information file section s2 1 in belt 1 the population suffers from fluorosis due to different geological causes that contaminates the groundwater while there are a few anthropological causes too the rock types and the water rock interaction are major factor for elevated fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the countries in belt 1 most of the countries in this belt have a dry and arid climate and high relief occurrences of extremely higher level of fluoride groundwater in the vicinity of the rift valley are observed in this belt the rift valley runs through the countries ethiopia kenya tanzania mozambique and south africa the high fluoride occurrences are concentrated along this region along the vicinity of hot spring higher fluoride is observed in the natural available water resources in syria the fractures and the topography controls the groundwater hydrogeology and possibly the water chemistry anthropological cause is also reported in turkey due to burning of coal the natural factors that are responsible for elevated fluoride level in this country are the rock types and the tectonics from fig 4 a and b we can see that the zones of high fluoride occurrences are geographically related with the rift fault volcanic and tectonics later in the tectonic section section 4 2 the correlation of the global fluoride belts and their association with the global tectonic belts has been discussed the belt has a desert tropical and desert temperate type climate the major soil type is aridisol 2 2 belt 2 this belt is linear stretch that runs from egypt to mauritania this belt includes egypt starting point common with belt 1 followed by libya algeria morocco western sahara mauritania the stretches runs east west and takes a sharp turn from morocco towards south connecting western sahara mauritania following the western edges of the continent of africa fig 3 shows the location of the different countries in this belt with respect to the global map the countries are highlighted in blue detail descriptions of each country in this belt are provided in the supporting information file section s2 2 granites and precambian basement gneisses are one of the major geological causes for elevated fluoride levels in groundwater in algeria and libya the fluoride concentration in groundwater is controlled by granites and precambian basement while in mauritania the presence of metarhyolites can cause significant variation in fluoride concentration of associated groundwater morocco and western sahara are one of highest exporter of phosphate around the world and the possible causes of fluorosis in this area is due to the presence of phosphate mines and phosphate fertilizer industries which are always associated near phosphate mines several authors have established the relationship between phosphate mining and the occurrences of fluorosis in the adjoining area haikel et al 1986 maadid et al 2017 tanouayi et al 2016 a positive correlation exists between the phosphorus and fluoride concentration in ground water this belt moves parallel to the west african mobile belt and their geographic relation with the tectonic zones can be clearly observed fig 4 the belt has desert temperate climate and the soil type is aridisol 2 3 belt 3 this belt is linear stretch that runs from turkey to china this belt includes turkey starting point common with belt 1 followed by iraq iran afghanistan pakistan india north thailand parts of china the belt runs towards east from turkey and takes a sharp turn after india towards north following the eastern edges of the continent of asia fig 3 marks the geographical location of the different countries in this belt with respect to the global map the countries are highlighted in green detail descriptions of each country in this belt are provided in the supporting information file section s2 3 the weathering and dissolution of gypsum volcanic rocks calc alkaline rocks are responsible for elevated fluoride level in groundwater of iraq and iran in iran high fluoride concentration is also observed along the adjoining areas of metamorphic rocks the alkaline granites and the pegmatite veins in afghanistan influence the higher fluoride concentration apart from the similar geological factors in pakistan and afghanistan the dry and arid climate further enhances the causes of fluorosis the semi arid climate of pakistan enhances the weathering of fluoride minerals and the alkaline water of the country promotes the rate of dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals due to the large geographical extent and geomorphological variation in india several factors are responsible for elevated fluoride level in groundwater one of the largest contributors of f in groundwater is granites and its associated aquifers fracture controlled hydrogeology phosphatic fertilizers in china and northern thailand the fluoride groundwater are associated around the hot spring in china the regional geology granitic aquifers are also local factors which can hike the fluoride concentration in groundwater this belt has a desert temperate climate but the soil type varies from aridisols to entisols discussed in section 4 2 4 belt 4 this belt is linear stretch that runs from sierra nevada to andes mountains this belt includes sierra nevada starting point followed by usa rocky mountain mexico part of north america central america colombia peru bolivia and ends in andes mountains the belt runs south west from sierra nevada and takes a sharp turn after bolivia towards south west connecting andes mountains this belt connects a large number of volcanoes active and dormant and hence can be called as a volcanic fluoride belt the countries are highlighted in violet colors observed in fig 3 detail descriptions of each country in this belt are provided in the supporting information file section s2 4 in belt 4 the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater are mostly caused by the action of active volcanoes the volcanic ash and acid rain in south america colombia the presence of hot spring volcanic craters and groundwater temperature is the most dominating factors for high fluoride concentration while in sierra nevada and bolivia the granitic aquifer is also an important factor the volcanic ash of the andes has high fluoride concentration and the leaching of the volcanic ash results in water with very high fluoride content particularly in sierra nevada and andes the acidic soil and ph of the water play a greater role in fluoride dissolution from the associated rocks this belt has a desert tropical climate and andisols as their major soil types 2 5 belt 5 this belt is linear stretch that runs from japan to volcanic islands of indonesia this belt includes japan starting point followed by philippines and indonesia the belt runs south west from japan connecting philippines and indonesia this belt also connects active and dormant volcanoes and hence can be classified in the group of volcanic fluoride belt fig 3 shows the location of the different countries in this belt from a global view the countries are highlighted in yellow color in belt 5 the entire zone is dominated by active volcanism and tectonic activity the volcanic rocks volcanic ash and active subduction in japan and indonesia are the prime causes of fluoride concentration in the groundwater of these areas in philippines apart from the active volcanic activity the hot spring also have significant contribution in contaminating groundwater with high fluoride the fluoride concentration in lakes of indonesia is very high 1266 ppm this belt has a temperate humid climate and is dominated by andisols detail descriptions of each country in this belt are provided in the supporting information file section s2 5 3 geochemistry of fluoride fluoride being a natural element is present in almost all types of water in different concentration the range of fluoride concentration sometimes reaches as high as 2800 mg l gaciri and davies 1993 the factors influencing the concentration of f in groundwater are climate factor altitude or relief factor evaporation precipitation along with geology and geomorphology of the area liu and zhu 1991 the most important method by which fluoride concentrates into the groundwater is by leaching of rocks containing fluoride rich minerals that are leached out from the source rock and contaminated the groundwater by dissolution wenzel and blum 1992 thus the dominating factor leading to fluoride contamination is the lithology and geology of the aquifer that hold groundwater in the subsurface the other important factors include the dissolved ions ph and the temperature of the water fluoride concentration in natural water is variable depending on the physico chemical factors of the water being in contact with different rock types as listed in table 2 the table displays the concentration of fluoride for different rock types and provides an insight about the potentiality of individual rock types to contribute fluoride into groundwater among the different rock types the alkalic rocks 1000 ppm mafic alkalic rocks rapakavi granites 2680 ppm phenolites 930 ppm granites and granodiorites 810 ppm shales 800 ppm and oceanic sediments 730 ppm contains very high concentration of f the presence of limestone or dolomite increases the concentration of carbonate c o 3 2 ion in water the higher carbonate c o 3 2 ion plays the role of a catalyst and enhances the dissolution of f from the associated rock within the aquifer fluoride concentrations in ground water are sometimes highly variable fordyce et al 2007 within similar lithology or climatic condition depending on the extent of weathering and availability of leachable f in rocks etc the fluoride belts around the world shows a great amount of resemblance in terms of rock type table 2 and soil composition discussed detailed in sections 4 1 and 4 4 3 1 isotope geochemistry of high fluoride groundwater isotopic techniques have been deployed in groundwater studies from past four decades isotopes in alliances with different incompatible and compatible elements are used to evaluate the process of recharge and discharge flow path interconnections within aquifers and the different sources as well as the mechanism of pollution due to their radioactivity isotopes are unique tools to determine the groundwater residence time age while in arid and semi arid climatic conditions isotopic technique is the only technique available to study aquifer dynamics stable isotopes in conjunction with fluoride are determined and investigated to understand the source of fluoride contamination and the processes controlling it several isotopic data are collected for these purposes the most popular isotopes used for understanding the groundwater sources and effects of different processes in groundwater are 18o 2h 3h 34s 12c 14c 15n etc datta et al 1996 studied the 18oisotopic composition of the groundwater in india and reported that the 18o data are like physical tracer that helps us to understand the water movement and also mixing of water from different sources they also observed that groundwater with low fluoride content 1 ppm are associated with high 18o isotopic enrichment they further suggested that 18o in integration with fluoride provide us concrete evidence on the mechanism of leaching of fluoride from soil and lateral mixing of groundwater farooqi et al 2007 studied the sulphur isotopes of the groundwater around the kasur districts punjab pakistan using the δ34s value they delineated the depth of the aquifer they reported that the δ34s value ranges 5 5 5 7 for the samples from the middle and deep aquifers li et al 2006 have demonstrated that the δ34s values of so4 values are crucial to delineate the sources of groundwater he observed that δ34s values of so4 2 in rainwater and groundwater samples are overlapping revealing so4 2 in the samples are originated mainly from pollutants in the air that gets released in the atmosphere inside the basin cortecci et al 2002 demonstrated that the δ34s of so4 2 ranges between approximately 15 and 4 for so4 2 formed by oxidation of pyrite disseminated in the local rocks and between 15 and 23 for so4 2 formed by the dissolution of evaporites whereas the δ34s of anthropogenic so4 2 from industrial effluents and fertilizers are 1 to 8 this information harnessed from the sulfur isotopes are used in understanding the geochemistry of fluoride particularly the fluctuation of fluoride with depth and the source of fluoride kim and jeong 2005 studied the oxygen isotopes of the groundwater from korean peninsula and correlated fluoride concentration they reported that low fluoride groundwater groups 0 0 5 ppm f showed δd and δ18o values of 54 1 4 6 and 7 74 0 62 respectively which suggested that the water sources were from recently precipitation the isotopedata of the fluoride group with high f concentration 1 5 ppm f are lighter in comparison to the groundwater with low fluorideand with δ18o values of 9 53 0 70 and δd values of 67 4 6 1 they further suggested that in a condition of very low nitrate levels δ18o values are also low and fluoride values are high the groundwater is significantly older than the corresponding low fluoride values tirumalesh et al 2007 studied the hydrochemistry of the groundwater in karnataka ilkal area india with a purpose of understanding the mechanism and sources of fluoride pathway into groundwater they reported that stable isotopic values δ18o of 3 4 to 0 18 and δ2h of 30 to 3 8 is observed in the bore well samples while the samples from the dug well have stable isotopic values δ18o of 0 45 to 0 15 and δ2h of 5 5 to 1 4 the surface waters lake and river have δ18o in the range 5 2 to 2 6 and δ2h in the range 39 2 to 5 8 they established a correlation between high tritium 4 7 tu δ18o and fluoride in fluoride contaminated groundwater and on the basis of the information they suggested the contribution from different sources like the surface waters contaminated by anthropogenic activities and interaction of alkaline water with clays sediments derived from mica and biotite present in the streambed awad 2014 reported from the analysis of 13c isotopes in the groundwater that stable carbon isotopes from the dissolved co2 in the water can provide significant information on the origin and the area of pollution of water the 13c isotope values can also be used to estimate the inputs of carbon with biogenic origin and quantifying its percentage in the mineralization of groundwater bhandary et al 2015 studied the two main aquifers from state of kuwait kuwait namely the kuwait group aquifer and dammam formation aquifer from the values of 13c and 14c in the aquifer groundwater they suggested the anticipated velocities and the ageof the groundwater the groundwater of the kuwait group aquifer and dammam formation aquifer was reported to be 11 30 m a and 12 21 m a respectively while the groundwater age was estimated to be 0 8 103 22 5 103b p and 26 103 to 36 103 a b p respectively analyzing the carbon isotopes and fluoride from the same samples will provide significant insight on the origin and the contribution of fluoride from different sources along with the residence time of the water application of n and sr isotopes are also widely used to monitor groundwater characteristic aravena and robertson 1998 reported the application of nitrogen isotopes and suggested that values of 15n decreases with depth jackson et al 2002 suggested that sr isotopes inventories are a unique tool for examining the weathering fluxes precisely and determining the proportions of silicate vs carbonate weathering in the himalaya by analyzing the water stream and bedrock of tributary watersheds that flows through the himalaya 4 natural factors effecting the fluoride concentration from the analysis of different fluoride belts and studying the causes of elevated fluoride level in groundwater it can be said that the concentration of groundwater fluoride is governed by the following natural factors 4 1 rock types there are total 33 countries which forms the global fluoride belts among them in 28 countries the level of fluoride in groundwater is related to the rock types and the geology four countries are indirectly related to geological causes of their fluoride concentration table 3 among the geological causes the dominated rock type is igneous 12 28 countries where the sedimentary are second most rock type 10 28 countries the geology and their associated rock type of each area of fluoride belt have been discussed earlier in this paper in this section we will describe the countries that are affected by fluorosis but are not included in the global fluoride belt the rogaland igneous complex in the s w norway and its surrounding metamorphic rocks were studied by roelandts et al 1987 they reported that the fluoride concentration ranges from 25 ppm to 3500 ppm they also found positive correlation between the f and p2o5 concentration for igneous rocks on the basis of this correlation they suggested the apatite has considerable buffering on the concentration of f in associated metamorphic unit they observed amphibole and biotite beside apatite are the other key mineral with high fluoride roelandts et al 1987 table 3 provides an overview of the dominant rock types in each place of the fluoride belts in the previous section the different rock types in context to each fluoride belt are discussed however there are other countries like canada brazil australia norway and saudi arabia that are also affected by fluorosis petrides and cartwright 2006 mirlean and roisenberg 2007 desbarats 2009 banks et al 1998 alabdulaaly 1997 while in australia the fluoride levels in groundwater is not very high and anthropological cause is suspected in brazil the phosphate fertilizer factory have raised the level of f in groundwater to 4 79 ppm leading phosphate producing countries in the world include china morocco western sahara usa egypt india jordan syria mexico part of north america south africa algeria etc they are all a part of the global fluoride belt there is a relationship between the world phosphate producing countries and the occurrences of higher fluorosis fig 5 is a pie diagram that shows the world rock phosphate concentrate production usgs 2012 phosphate from the rock concentrate is produced in different parts of the world however three countries namely china morocco and usa contribute 67 of the production of which the largest producer is china with 37 of world production although morocco which also includes parts of western sahara is one of the biggest producer fig 10 of the world but their reserve is estimated to be 50 000 million tons in morocco and western sahara the areas prone to fluorosis are mostly located near the phosphate mines dharmagunawardhane et al 2016 have analyzed the f concentration of different minerals from srilanka and it can be observed from the data that apatite major mineral in phosphaterocks contains high f fig 6 showing the fluoride content of different minerals from srilanka in canada f concentration in groundwater in not uniform and highly variable in space distribution occasionally the f concentration in groundwater can rise to as high as 15 1 ppm in norway the geology is strongly responsible for high f in groundwater with levels of f reaching up to as high as 8 26 ppm banks et al 1998 in saudi arabia there are limited data available and reliable sources are rare alabdulaaly 1997 have reported a highest level of 1 8 ppm 4 2 tectonics of the area the tectonics of the area has significant influences in enhancing the fluoride concentration in water the high fluoride rich groundwater zones are mostly associated with some kind of tectonic zones fig 7 is a map indicating the geographical relation between the fluoride belts and the global tectonic zones belt 3 4 and 5 are associated with the subduction zones while belt 1 and 2 are parallel with the adjoining convergent boundary and the transform fault respectively running parallel to the northern and eastern edge of the continent africa the spatial relation of the fluoride belts with the tectonic zone suggests that two parameters are not mutually exclusive belt 4 and 5 follows the volcanic belts of the globe and shows a strong correlation between the volcanic belts and occurrences of high fluoride zone these may be for the reason that the volcanic soils are rich in fluoride containing minerals and the high altitude of the volcanic mountains promotes high weathering the east african rift zone is particularly important and interesting in the context of tectonic relation with high fluoride bearing zones fluoride is a constituents in different rock types but the maximum concentration of fluoride in water sources and highest reported cases of fluorosis are usually from the areas that consist of intra continental hotspots aborted rifts and andean type magmatic belts though volcanic rocks are the one having highest fluoride concentration the precambrian and young marine sediments also possess high concentration of fluoride figs 8 and 9 show the east african rift ear system and associated plate moments with the location of the countries within the system the ear system is a continental rift figs 8 and 9 characterize by numerous faults and grabens this rift system extends from the jordan valley till the united republic of tanzania through sudan ethiopia uganda and kenya the volcanic rocks of the ear are known to host one of the highest fluoride zones like lake nakuru in kenya 2800 mg l 1 momella soda lake in tanzanian fig 9 has a fluoride concentration of 690 mg l 1 ethiopia is a part of the rift system fig 9 and has predominance of widespread volcanic basalt flows in the upland and lowland regions that have created from complex tectonic events baker et al 1972 the areas like alem tena and koka villages near wonji farm as well as sodere resort had boreholes yielding fluoride concentration between 6 0 mg l 1 and 22 6 mg l 1 kloos and haimanot 1999 according to the reports of kloos and haimanot 1999 the euthopian rift valley contains fluoride levels higher than 5 0 mg l in different location the highest concentration is observed in hot springs 100 of all sources while the lowest concentration is observed in springs and rivers below 1 5 mg l 1 on an average 50 of the lakes 78 of all sources shallow wells 54 of all sources and boreholes 35 of all sources have also fluoride level above 5 0 mg l the volcanic areas of the nairobi rift valley and central provinces have shown upto maximum groundwater fluoride concentration of 30 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 nair et al 1984 the ear valley had a lot of volcanic activity over the past consisting some of the tallest and extinct volcanoes the ear zone consists of active as well as dormant volcanoes among them mount meru mount kenya mount kilimanjaro menengai crater mount longonot mount nyiragongo mount karisimbi and mount elgon as well as the crater highlands in tanzania saemundsson 2008 mount meru is a younger extrusive volcano with its latest eruption in 1877 nanyaro et al 1984 among the active volcano are dallafilla ol doinyo lengai and erta ale ol doinyo lengai volcano of this region is the only known natrocarbonatite volcano that erupted in 1960 the pyroclastic ejected from these volcanoes contains high amounts of na and f and low concentrations of calcium ca and magnesium mg the faulting in the rift zone may expose deeper lithologies to the surface this may also uplift fluoride rich zones near the surface there may be some unexplored reasons too for now we can state that the tectonic zone bears a positive correlation with the occurrences of the global fluoride belts 4 3 physical and chemical properties of water the geochemistry of fluoride has been investigated by different workers ayoob and gupta 2006 it is also seen that the adsorption is strongly ph dependent at ph 3 4 the fluoride adsorption is highest and then decreases above ph 6 5 w h o 2002 as we know natural water is usually in the range of ph 7 it is not easy to dissolve a great amount of fluoride absorbed from soil to understand the sources of fluoride contamination that leads to fluorosis we will now take a look on the geochemistry of fluorides there are a number of mechanisms by which fluorides get into groundwater the rain water moving over the surface of the land gets enrich in co2 from soil air and through biochemical reactions of organic matter the dissolved co2 in turn increases the h ions in groundwater the calcareous mineral like calcite caco3 also gets dissolved in the water handa 1975 saxena and shakeel 2003 subba and john 2003 the reactions are 2 c o 2 h 2 o h 2 c o 3 3 h 2 c o 3 h h c o 3 4 hc o 3 h c o 3 2 5 cac o 3 h 2 f c a f 2 h c o 3 6 ca f 2 c a 2 2 f banerjee 2015 reported the facts that long groundwater residence time is necessary for fluoride contamination in groundwater and the process of hydrolysis is one of the most efficient processes for rapid releasing of fluoride in groundwater 4 3 1 hydrochemistry of fluoride and other ions of groundwater the concentration fluoride in water is affected by different parameters of like ph water temperature water rock interaction etc kitalika et al 2018 a direct correlation between concentration of fluoride ions and other ions like chloride sodium bicarbonate boron and with tds total dissolved solid ph e c is firmly established while a negative correlation is observed between f and ca2 is also well established understanding the correlation of fluoride with other properties of groundwater provide an insight to the mechanism and source of fluoride dissolution wang et al 2013 discussed the relation of different ions with fluoride level in groundwater of northern china where positive correlations were observed with respect to fluoride and other ions like chloride and bicarbonate warren et al 2005 have reported the correlation of different ions with fluoride and establish positive correlation between fluoride and other ions from the groundwater of northern argentina karro and uppin 2013 discussed the hydrochemistry of fluoride and boron in carbonate aquifer system in central and western estonia their results show that borondoes have a positive correlation with f in the groundwater in carbonate aquifer system they also concluded that probable reasons for the correlation between f and boron in groundwater are weathering and concurrent dissolution of fluorides and boron from carbonate rocks in estonia however boron is least studied elements in water analysis in context to fluoride in usa the dakota aquifer covers northward from kansas approximately to the arctic circle in canada from fig 10 a c we can see the geographical extent of the aquifer and the positive correlation between fluoride vs bicarbonate and fluoride vs ph fig 11 shows the correlation between fluoride vs total dissolved solid tds and fluoride vs electrical conductivity ec there is only one ion ca2 reported so far which showed a negative correlation with respect to fluoride karro and uppin 2013 fig 12 a and b show the positive correlation between fluoride vs boron and negative correlation between fluoride vs calcium respectively and fig 13 a and b shows a positive correlation between fluoride vs hco3 and fluoride vs na after a detail investigation handa 1975 came out with some possible relation with high fluoride in groundwater and the other dissolved ions he reported those high fluoride groundwater are generally coupled with littleca2 content with a negative correlation between the two ions while the calcium content is low the bicarbonate ions is high in the same water these groundwater are usually fluoride under saturated handa 1975 singaraja et al 2018 discussed the effects of bicarbonate and positive correlation of hco3 with fluoride and ph with co2 on the other hand the concentration of fluoride in groundwater is greatly affected by the rock water interaction which is effected by the ph and dissolved ions like calcium bicarbonate an alkaline environment with high bicarbonate concentration is more favorable for the dissolution of fluoride in the groundwater fig 10c this suggests that ph of the water effective in determining condition for fluoridization saxena and shakeel 2003 so the weathering of minerals is one of the responsible factors which provided the needed ions to increase the favorability of water for fluoride dissolution here in the current work it is observed that most of the fluoride belts have three optimum conditions that are responsible to hike the level of fluoridenamely volcanic ash volcanic rock types and thermal springs are high narsimha and sudarshan 2018 discussed the importance of estimating fluoride level in water emphasizing on the water chemistry parameter which would be useful in determining the safe zones for drinking water and assessment of the groundwater quality for making sustainable planning of water resources in future 4 4 types of soil in the area fig 14 a f shows the spatial distribution of diverse soils types globally while table 4 describe the properties of these types of soil from fig 14 a f we can observe that belt 1 belt2 belt 3 are dominated by aridisols while belt 4 belt 5 are dominated by andisols soils so here we describe these two soils in brief the dominant processes characteristics and soil properties of all the other soil types are shown in the map fig 14 are provided briefly in table 4 two varieties of soil are dominant in the fluoride belts namely the aridisols and andisols these soils are described briefly here 4 4 1 aridisols aridisols gets its name from the latin word aridus means dry and solum means soil are dry soils found in arid regions globally 12 7 of the ice free landmass is comprised by this soil aridisols are generally light in color and content low in organic matter these soils are characterized by little water content however the soil moisture is sufficiently high to support plant growth for short time the surface horizon ranges between vegetated areas and interspersed bare the vegetation consists of desert shrubs short bushes and grasses in the subsurface horizons accumulation of lime and salt are common due to lack of substantial leaching agents the soil soluble materials break down and are not being removed from the soil profile they accumulate in the lower layer of the soil the materials accumulated include gypsum gypsic calcium carbonate calcic soluble salts salic or exchangeable sodium natric in some cases the carbonates may bind with the soil particles and forms coarse fragments simonson 1991 aridisols is extensively found extensively in the deserts around the globe while some aridisols may possess argillic b horizon clay accumulation which are found in wetter climate due to imbalance between evapotranspiration and precipitation the soil is enriched in accumulated and concentrated salts a few aridisols are found in geologic evaporites aridisols are classified into six sub suborders among which four suborders are based on two parameters of the soluble fraction namely composition and accumulation the weathering of clay translocation occurs in a small scale in these areas the fourth and the sixth suborders reflect the processes the six classified suborders are eswaran and reich 2005 soil survey staff 1999 i cryids aridisols in cold areas ii salids these soils are formed by accumulation of salts that are more soluble than gypsum this soil includes the typical soils of playas or desert depressions or closed basins iii durids formed bysilica accumulations and they are not frequent and are associated with soils that are made from volcanic materials they are known to occur in the western usa only iv gypsids formed by gypsum accumulation they are extensively found in the near east especially in belt 1 syria iraq saudi arabia and iran they approximately cover 1 1 million km2 v argids they are results of accumulation of clay by translocation they are currently reported from usa only vi calcids accumulation product of carbonates they have calcic petrocalcic or a hypercalcic horizon there are extensively found in the major deserts of the world and covers an area of 10 2 million km2 vii cambids they occupy approximately 13 3 million km2 and are formed by transformation of material these soils are dominant suborder of aridisols low organic matter promotes fluoride desorption and mobility d alessandro et al 2012 the availability of carbonate and sodium enhance the rate of dissolution of f from rocks the calcids type aridisols are prone to high fluoride concentration as it consist of calcic petrocalcic or a hypercalcic horizon the durids type aridisols are weathered product of volcanic materials and hence are another potential source soil types having high fluoride concentration 4 4 2 andisols andisols are defined by the presence of volcanic glass in the soil these soils are least weathered and the soils forms after breaking of cinders pyroclastic material and volcanic ash close to the proximity of downwind of a volcanic activity they are younger in age forming in deposits from geologically recent events the character of the andisols depends on the climate and elevation of the mountain the belt 4 5 lies in the domain of volcanic beltand consist of several active and passive volcanoes alexander et al 1993 analyzed 27 soil samples that have an elevation ranging from 270 to 2030 m above sea level from a volcanic plateau west southwest of lassen peak northern california and usa they reported the variation of clay clay minerals from lower to higher altitude that were kaolinite smectite halloysite hydrated halloysite and allophane d alessandro et al 2012 has reported that the higher altitude soils have a lower adsorption capacity which may also affect the mobility of fluoride these evidences suggest that different types of soil will have different reaction with water at different elevation but the capacity to adsorb fluoride decreases with high altitude so the soil can release f into the aquifer at mountain regions if other factors do not cause a resistance 4 4 3 geochemistry of soils geochemically f is a typical lithophile element element that forms silicates or oxides and is concentrated in the minerals of the earth s crust under terrestrial land conditions with atmophile affinity fig 14 a f is a map showing the global distribution of different soil types in soil fluorine exists in the form of fluoride ion f this f is retained in soil mineral surface by a ligand exchange reactions or is sometimes incorporated into the minerals of soils the f in soil can also exist as complexes with al or h stuczynski et al 2007 baker and bowers 1988 under acidic condition the solubility of fluoride is high due to the availability of readily soluble fluoride salts such as naf kf and nh4f and the formation of cationic complexes like alf 2 and alf2 wenzel and blum 1992 thus f contents increased with depth due to increase in soil ph omueti and jones 1980 in soil the average fluoride concentration ranges from 200 to 300 ppm atsdr 2003 soils with 1000 ppm f and contaminated soils with 3500 ppm have been reported by ranjith et al 2017 fluoride is not leached out from the soil easily due to their strong association with soil component w h o 2002 mostly in soils fluorides are in complexes with aluminium or iron brewer et al 1966b reported that the fine texture of the soil is also responsible for the retention of f mostly in clay rich soil brewer 1966b when fluoride binds to clay it displaces hydroxide oh from the surface of the clay bower and hatcher 1967 huang and jackson 1965 meeussen et al 1996 hence the soil with enriched clay content contributes more to the distribution of f in soil profiles piotrowska and wiacek 1975 in calcareous soil the dispersion of the f is restricted due to the presence of caf2 and formation of complexes of f with fe al and si the sodic soils have high exchangeable na that increases the solubility of f the sandy soils have the least f content while high concentration of f is found in heavy clay soils and soils derived from mafic rocks kabata pendias and pendias 2001 it is seen that only 5 10 of the available fluoride is soluble in water nommik 1953 kabata pendias and pendias 2001 studied the trace elements present in soil trace element and published the trace elements concentration including fluoride in different type of soils they reported that sewages sludges contains 2 740 ppm of f phosphate fertilizer contains 8500 3800 ppm of f while limestone bearing soil contains 300 ppm of f kabata pendias and pendias 2001 essentially minerals like fluorite caf2 fluorspar cryolite na3alf6 and fluorapatite ca10 po4 6f2 contains adequate amount of fluoride to contaminate the groundwater above the permissible limit the soils that have high abundance of these minerals usually have much higher fluoride content in a range of about 7 38 g kg smith et al 1977 in the process of weathering f combined with siliceous minerals and remains as residual materials the amount dissolution is also different for different minerals for example cryolite na3alf6 dissolves readily while fluoroapatite and fluorite dissolve slowly while the clays and phosphorites sorbed the mobile f larsen and widdowson 1971 perrott et al 1976 chhabra et al 1980 brewer et al 1966b reported that the fine soil texture is also responsible for the retention of f mostly in clay rich soil brewer 1966b when fluoride binds to clay it displaces hydroxide oh from the clay surface bower and hatcher 1967 huang and jackson 1965 meeussen et al 1996 however bower and hatcher 1967 reported thatf adsorption in clay mineral are a surface phenomenon and not an exchange of oh from lattice of clay minerals the soil chemistry soil geochemistry and climate have high influences for the fluoride release from soils two major fluoride belts belt 4 5 are located along the volcanic zones the chemical data of the volcanic rocks shows that they have very high content of f kokuba 1956 analyzed28 samples of plutonic rocks and reported the f content of the rocks the volcanic rocks contain 160 2900 ppm of f and the volacanic ashes contain 120 2400 ppm of f hence it is not astonishing to find high concentration of f in ground and surface water near the zones of volcanic belts d alessandro et al 2012 conducted experiments to understand the fluorine adsorption from the topsoil upto a depth of 5 cm from the top collected on the flanks of the volcano of mt etna in italy they collected 28 samples from different position of the volcano they reported that soil sorption of f increases from the summit craters of the volcano they also reported that the sorption capacity of the soil is positively correlated with soil ph clay content and weathering index the human settlement located close to the vicinity of the volcanic zones are highly prone to receive fluoride rich water due to the leaching out of high amount of f through rain water from these zone 4 5 altitude and weathering 4 5 1 altitude manji et al 1986 was among the first workers to report the positive correlation of fluorosis and altitude manji et al 1986 surveyed children from kenya aged between 11 and 15 years from three zones of low fluoride concentration 0 5 ppm in drinking water with an altitude of 0 m 1500 m and 2 400 m above sea level and from two zones of higher fluoride concentration 0 5 ppm 1 0 ppm in drinking water for dental fluorosis the results of this survey establish a relationship between altitude and fluorosis they reported in the low f zones 36 4 of the children at sea level suffered from dental fluorosis as compared to 78 0 living at a height of 1500 m and 100 0 living at a height of 2400 m in the higher f 0 5 ppm 1 0 ppm in drinking water zones 71 2 has been effected with dental fluorosis at sea levels as compared to 93 8 at 1500 m p 0 001 they further reported that the intraoral pattern of fluorosis dental was similar within these population group but the severity of dental fluorosis for individual tooth type increased notably with a positive changes in the altitude in both the zones low and higher fluoride zones manji et al 1986 rwenyonyi et al 1998 experimented to evaluate the relationship between altitude height and fluorosis dental among the children of western uganda in two fluoride f districts at random they sampled 481 children aged between 10 and 14 years to examine for fluorosis they classified the groups further into two types one group was those who were exposed to drinking water containing 0 5 ppm of f and other group with 2 5 ppm of f group one had samples living at altitudes of 900 m 2200 m and group two had samples living at altitudes of 1750 m 2800 m they reported that from group 1 around 25 of the children n 81 located at 900 m above msl had dental fluorosis in comparison to 45 of the children n 82 at 2200 m while the other group that was exposed to high fluoride water 2 5 ppm had 67 of the children n 67 living at 1750 m effected with dental fluorosis as compared to 84 of the children n 64 at 2800 m above sea level rwenyonyi et al 1998 akosu et al 2009 studied the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in the high and low altitude parts of the central senatorial district of plateau state nigeria they selected 12 15 years children as samples and randomly 1000 children were analysed from which 554 50 4 from the high altitude part of the district and 546 49 6 from the low altitude part they reported that fluorosis prevalence was 12 9 in the district but significantly higher 22 2 in the high altitude areas compared to the low altitude ones 3 5 pontigo loyola et al 2008 studied 1024 children aged from 12 to 15 years to determine the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in mexican adolescents they were located in tula de allende hidalgo mexico north america area where the altitude ranges from 2000 m or 6560 ft they fluorine content in the water of this area range from 1 38 ppm to 3 07 ppm the reported fluorosis prevalence in el llano 3 07 ppm of f san marcos 1 38 ppm of f and tula centro 1 42 ppm of f was 94 7 89 8 and 81 9 percent respectively fig 15 shows the high relief area in a global map and it shows that the fluoride belts follow the high relief area the fig 15and the reports discussed provide us a concrete evidences that the severity of dental fluorosis increases and is positively related with altitude and the accountability of the altitude factor must be taken into consideration 4 5 2 weathering the degradation of the soil is directly related to the impact of the weathering the fluoride belts are marked in the map fig 16 they are not to scale but provide an insight about the relationship between the type of degradation of soil and location of fluoride belts it can be seen from the map fig 16 that most of the fluoride belts countries falls in the zone of very degraded soils the soils in the countries forming the fluoride belts are usually highly weathered and degraded however genetical relationship between highly weathered zones and fluorosis has also been established by some worker shekhar et al 2017 dharmagunawardhane et al 2016 dehbandi et al 2017 dharmagunawardhane et al 2016 conducted mass balance study of the mineralogical sources for fluoride in rocks weathered charnockitic gneiss bedrock and regolith from sri lanka they collected bed rock and regolith samples from the polonnaruwa area for this study where prevalence of dental flurosis exist the groundwater fluoride level in the area was upto 5 25 mg l 1 they reported that the loss of fluoride from individual fluoride bearing minerals and hence from the whole rock mass was a result of weathering they further concluded that different mineral release different amount of shekhar et al 2017 investigated the area of daltonganj bishrampur chainpur and pandu blocks of palamu district of jharkhand state in india covering an area of 1397 sq km the investigation was undertaken to study the possible relation between fluorosis and different other geomorphological parameters including weathering they reported that geomorphologically highest fluoride contamination was recorded in plateau weathered moderate 91 67 followed by plateau weathered shallow 71 43 flood plain 41 76 inselberg 27 27 and pediment 25 dehbandi et al 2017 studied the geochemistry of fluorine in the soils of localities that are effected by endemic fluorosis in central iran they reported a very strong positive correlation of total fluoride with weathering indices and soil s fine sized fractions they concluded that the chemical weathering and alteration of parent rocks soils are one of the main controlling factors of fluoride behavior in soils 4 6 climate as already mentioned fluorosis has been described as an endemic disease of tropical climates but concrete evidences are lacking however few authors have quoted that processes like evaporation and or evaporation transpiration lead to the condensation of soluble components in arid and semiarid regions resulting in fluoride enriched groundwater guo et al 2007 jacks et al 2005 mukherjee and singh 2018 suggested that arid and semiarid regions of india are more prone to high fluoride concentration and the mineralogical composition and climatic conditions are the primary controlling factors for groundwater fluoride contamination rasool et al 2017 have also suggested that the semiarid regions such as argentina china bangladesh and mexico part of north america and pakistan are more susceptible to fluoride enrichment in groundwater although in mexico rhyolites and thermal groundwater flow are greater contributors of high fluoride in groundwater however climatic condition controls the process of fluoride contamination higher dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals are facilitated by semiarid climate with low rainfall 225 400 mm per year and high rate of evaporation 2000 mm per year galagan and vermillion 1957 studied the varying concentrations of fluorosis that exist at a constant concentration of fluoride in drinking water in different temperature zones they formulated methodologies and suggested the process of calculating optimum range of fluoride intake at different temperature they also proposed the optimal fluoride range to be between 0 7 and 1 2 ppm at a temperature range of 50 f and 90 f however the optimum level of fluoride in drinking water is now thought to vary for different countries with different environmental condition hence the optimum fluoride level for different countries is set differently in srilanka the recommended level is 0 6 0 8 ppm warnakulasuriya et al 1992 while in chile it is 0 5 0 6 ppm villa et al 1998 in sudan the upper permissible limit was proposed to be modified by ramadan and hilmi 2014 to 0 32 0 35 ppm based on the climatic factors and other related factors ramadan and hilmi 2014 hence considering the above evidences the factors of climatic influences on fluorosis cannot be ruled out however it is not a dominating factor from fig 17 we can see that belt 1 2 3 and 5 are dominated by desert tropical to desert temperate type climate while belt 4 has temperate humid climate the dominance of these two types of climate suggests that desert type climate favors dissolution of fluoride in groundwater enhancing the fluoride level in groundwater when seen from a global prospective 4 7 mechanism of fluoride mobility the hydrogeochemical cycle of fluorine is a complex process as shown in fig 18 the cycle shows exchange of fluoride to the atmosphere hydrosphere geosphere and biosphere the biosphere is severely affected by excessive intake of fluoride plants aquatic as well as land animals are affected by higher intake of fluoride the mechanism of fluoride contamination is divided here into three types fluoride in water air and biosphere 4 7 1 mechanism 1 fluoride into water the fluoride is transferred from rock to soil by the process of weathering and from rock to water by dissolution of minerals fluoride can be incorporated into water from the atmosphere through rainfall and it has been calculated that the rainfall have 20 75 ppm of fluoride in wales usa in norway the rainwater fluoride concentration was 13 25 ppm and most of it was from anthropogenic sources mainly from industrial aerosols edmunds and smedley 2013 the fluoride from atmosphere to water is likely a potential sources however due to analytical difficulties this mechanism is not well established globally 4 7 2 mechanism 2 the fluoride into the atmosphere fluoride can be incorporated into the atmosphere through evapo transpiration of the water from water bodies and plants fluoride is also transferred into the atmosphere during volcanic emission volcanic activities and hydro geothermal vents also release f into the environment which contaminates the soil and hf containing gases that contaminates the air with f industrial release of fluorine into atmosphere is also possible 4 7 3 mechanism 3 the fluoride into the biosphere fluorine can be incorporated into the biosphere from water or atmosphere as well as from the soil by uptake of plants plants cells get affected by higher intake of fluoride and lead to cell death the consumption of high fluoride water causes several health hazards and has been discussed in the introduction section 1 1 4 8 hydrogeology of high fluoride aquifers fluoride enrichment in aquifers depends on the physical characteristic of the host aquifer such a rock types water residence time ph of the water and soil as well as ongoing chemical reaction between rock water singh et al 2018 described the aquifer geology of high fluoride groundwater from india according to his reports high f zones occurs in alluvium in the ganga plain having minerals like biotite 0 32 5 02 f and muscovite 2 06 f from the global statistic it can be observed that above 90 of the aquifers possessing high fluoride water are associated with granitic and gneissic rocks edmunds and smedley 2013 studied the groundwater geology of high fluoride from a global prospect and reported that high fluoride groundwater are typically of nahco3 type and have low ca concentrations 20 mg l1 or so and with ph value in the range of neutral to alkaline around 7 9 they also found that basement aquifers like granitic aquifers inactive volcanic zones water from geothermal sources and groundwater in contact with sediment particularly in arid areas are prone to show fluoride problems most part of belt 1 is dominated by granitic and basement gneisses while the hydrogeology is controlled by fracture occurring due to rifting while belts 2 have a climatic factor and phosphate mining belt 3 is governed by arid climate and granitic aquifers while belt 4 and 5 are zones of inactive and active volcanoes fig 19 shows the naivasha catchment within the central kenya rift ckr portion of the east african rift system this area has been extensively studied by olaka et al 2016 and the relation of basement rocks and fault control on fluoride concentration in the groundwater is clearly depicted such relations are also established by other workers from korea and india 5 mitigation measures clean water is a basic right of every human being water with high amount of fluoride is scientifically proved as a toxic to human body in order to mitigate the hazards caused from drinking highly concentrated fluorinated water a number of processes has been developed these processes can be broadly classified in two major groups namely in situ treatment methods and ex situ treatment methods the in situ method is only discussed here in brief 5 1 in situ treatment methods in situ defluoridation involves fluoride removal from groundwater within the aquifer instead of pumping water for treatment from the ground in situ remediation of fluoride is seen as a potential solution for drinking water supply to a large group of populations this method is cost effective provides a long term solution waste generations are minimum and requires little maintenance teutsch et al 1996 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 tredoux et al 2004 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2002 fluoride rich groundwater can be diluted using suitable managed aquifer recharge mar methods for domestic supply the challenge of this method is to find an alternative source which will have low level of fluoride concentration in the reservoir the high fluoride concentrated water is diluted by mixing it with low fluoride concentrated water and then supplied for public use this technique is suitable for developing nation where fluoride concentration is decreased with minimum cost an example of successful implementation of this method is check dams of anantapur district india where fluoride concentration in groundwater was widely reduced bhagavan and raghu 2005 rain water harvesting is another popular method used in mar techniques suitable for household or small community level developing countries like kenya uganda and tanzania have large rooftop rainwater harvesting installations built in its villages bangladesh has also launched a massive program to build rooftop rainwater harvesting structures to provide pollution free water for villagers vishwanathan 2004 and jagadeshan et al 2015 has conducted experiments on dug well recharge system by diluting high fluoride concentrated groundwater with rain water inside a dug well the results were quiet promising where they were able to demonstrate successfully the concentration of fluoride decreased from 3 1 ppm to 1 4 ppm by raising the water level from 9 1 m to 14 5 m in a well sometimes addition of certain compound enhances the capacity of natural materials to remove fluoride gogoi et al 2015 studied the change in potential of limestone to remove fluoride using phosphoric acid pa the method is known pa enhanced limestone defluoridation paeld technique they found the fluoride removal capacity of limestone get enhances greatly with addition of pa the presence of pa in limestone hikes the fluoride removal potential from 0 39 mg g to 1 10 mg g gogoi and dutta 2016 studied the effect of hydrothermally modified limestone and its fluoride removal potential the limestone was modified hydrothermally using h3po4 for fluoride adsorption they reported that the limestone possessed fluoride removal potential of 6 45 mg g the hydrothermally modified limestone possesses higher capacity of fluoride removal fig 20 fig 20 shows the enhance ability of limestone after suitable modification hydrothermally with h3po4 shown in blue lines on the time vs fluoride removal graph the line on the graph in red color shows the efficiency of fluoride removal of unmodified limestone natural waste products like fly ash generated from the domestic cooking can also be a potential remover of fluoride ranjeeta 2015 have studied the potential of fly ash generated from the burning of fuels in chula used for cooking purposed in india the fly ash was cleaned by distilled water and then they have been tested for their potentiality to remove fluoride the results reported by ranjeeta 2015 shows that the fly ash possesses a potential to remove 30 50 of the fluoride in water fig 21 is a bar diagram modified after ranjeeta 2015 plots the number of samples in the x axis and concentration of fluoride in the y axis different color codes are used to show the concentration of fluoride before and after defluoridation the f removal capacity of the fly ash is clearly deciphered graphically however these remedies sometimes come with negative consequences like untreated fly ash can change other parameters of drinking water which could be harmful for consumption jayarathne et al 2015 investigated the potential of natural apatite from eppawala srilanka with an objective to develop low cost and eco friendly adsorbent material they studied the ability of natural apatite under laboratory condition to adsorb fluoride from aqueous solutions the limitation of this method was the ph condition of water the best results were found at ph 6 0 depending of the actual concentration of fluoride the chemical composition of water the adsorption capacity was reported to be in a range of fluoride concentrations from 5 0 to 25 0 mg l this technique was suggested by them to be useful in designing an inexpensive easy to use and environmentally friendly method for removal of fluoride in water supplies at village level chidambaram et al 2003 studied the capacity of local materials using column methods the materials used to prepare the column were red soil serpentine fly ash charcoaland brick powder the time was 30 min they reported that red soil has the high fluoride removal capacity among the other materials due to presence of very fine clays iron aluminum oxide and organic matter the fact that red soil contain both the oxides of iron and aluminum that can readily adsorb fluoride red soils are one of the best removers of fluoride chidambaram et al 2003 there are several natural minerals and products that have the potential to remove fluoride in different capacities magnesite natrolite apophyllite stilbite clinoptilolite bentonite gibbsite goethite kaolinite halloysite vermiculite zeolite s serpentine alkaline soil acidic clay kaolinitic clay fuller s earth china clay aiken soil diatomaceous earth and ando soil are some of them that possesses fluoride removal capacities bower and hatcher 1967 maruthamuthu and sivasamy 1994 bjorvatn and bårdsen 1997 singano et al 1997 so it can be said from the following evidences that natural materials do have capacities to remove fluoride and they are easily available and cost effective using natural material and processes to remove fluoride must be done with precaution using such materials can change the other essential parameters of the water that supports life any natural process for fluoride removal must be properly investigated in laboratory before it is available for public uses 5 2 ex situ treatment methods exsitu treatment method works on the principle of removal of fluoride before the water is consumed for drinking purposes with chemical physical biological or a combination of these techniques there are several techniques that have been developed over decades for this purpose and each method has its own merits and demerits however in this paper we are limiting our discussion to in situ method only there are several papers and review papers that have been published that describes the methodology working principle advantages and disadvantages of different ex situ removal technique scott et al 1937 sollo et al 1978 hendrickson and vik 1984 korir et al 2009 dahi 1996 hu et al 2005 bolto and gregory 2007 bratby 1980 dahi et al 1996 mameri et al 1998 mameri et al 2001 shankar et al 2013 mohapatra et al 2009 gupta et al 2007 yadav et al 2006 kumar et al 2009 6 results the information documented and presented in this paper brings in light several facts about occurrences of high concentration fluoride in groundwater globally in this paper different natural factors are taken into consideration to analyze the most dominating and the least dominating factors for prevalence of fluorosis in an area on the basis of the data presented the following results were obtained 6 1 the fluoride belts around the world are interconnected fig 3 within the landmass globally individual fluoride belts belt 1 belt 5 are interlinked however all the belts are not interlinked with each other belt 4 fig 3 violet color and belt 5 fig 3 yellow color are not connected with the other fluoride belts each belt is associated with a certain type of soil rock types and climate relief and tectonics belt 4 5 are dominated by active to dormant volcano and large part of this belt is covered by volcanic soil belt 1 fig 3 red color and 2 fig 3 blue color are the countries located within the africa and have an arid climate as well as they are located along the mobile belts fig 4 most of the countries of the belt 1 are in geographical proximity with the east african rift system it is also noteworthy that the belts 1 2 are following the boundary of the continent belt 3 fig 3 green color is one of the longest inland belt and crosses through a number of countries with different climatic condition and lithounits however most of the countries like iraq iran pakistan and afghanistan are arid and mountainous these countries follow the tectonic zone interspersed between the eurasian plate and arabian plate fig 7 in thailand india and china the fluoride belts are associated with specific rock types granites and alkaline and soils andisols so it can be stated that the occurrences of fluorides in different countries along a belt are not random but there is a definite relationship with the tectonics and lithotypes of the area 6 2 from table 2 it is observed that similar rock types can have varying proportion of fluoride concentration for example rhyolites 480 ppm of f and alkali rhyolite 2180 ppm of f have variable amount of fluoride alkali rocks and rapakavi granites also show high contrast in fluoride concentration 6 3 fig 14 shows the soil types and its global distribution table 4 describe the properties of the soil types it is observed that most of the regions affected with high fluoride concentration are dominated by volcanic arid or mountain soil types the ph of the soil can range from very acidic about 2 to and alkaline soils sodic that may have ph values above 10 merry 2009 from fig 14 it can be observed that the fluoride belts namely belts 1 belt 2 and belt 3 are dominated by arid soils and belt 4 and belt 5 are dominated by mountain soil the texture of the soil also affects the fluoride retention capacity of the soil 6 4 the composition of the groundwater is different in different places due to the climate and aquifer geology from section 2 1 2 of this paper and from figs 10 13 it is observed that fluoride have a positive correlation with different parameters of water like tds ec chloride sodium etc similarly in mauritania positive correlation is observed between f vs cl plot section 2 2 5 in iraq high sulphates salinity and bicarbonates effects the fluoride concentration in groundwater 6 5 the altitude factor was first measured and shown by manji et al 1986 it was reported by manji et al 1986 that with similar fluoride concentration the rate of fluorosis increased with the altitude at sea level 34 were affected with fluorosis while 1500 m 70 were affected and at 2400 m 100 rwenyonyi et al 1998 also reported that there is sharp increase in occurrences of fluorosis with increase in altitude 6 6 the countries under belt 1 and 2 have typically desert type climate dry and arid climate are found egypt sudan somali mozambique mauritania iran afghanistan pakistan and china kenya has tropical to desert type condition 6 7 as discussed in section 4 1 and from fig 5 we observe that the fluorides enrich countries are also one of the largest exporters of phosphate the countries like morocco western sahara and china have close association of high fluoride along the vicinity of phosphate mines also the phosphate fertilizer contains 8500 3800 ppm of f which can affect the water bodies in the vicinity of this zone 6 8 naturally occurring rocks minerals and soils have potential to remove fluoride from drinking water commonly available materials like magnasite serpentine red soil andosoil etc possesses high potential in fluoride removal from water sometime a little modification can enhance the adsorption capacity of fluoride in natural material to a large extend phosphoric acid when added with limestone enhances its adsorption capacity to 2 times 6 9 isotopes of 18o 2h 3h 34s 12c 14c 15nare key evidences and provides important information about the sources of the fluoride in section 3 1 the details of different isotopes and their application to delineate the sources of fluoride have been discussed from the assessment of the isotopic study it is clear that the enriched 18o data are related to low fluoride content and the δ34s value are related to aquifer depth the δ18o values are used to assess the age of the water too the δ34s values in combination with so4 2 had been observed to provide potential information about water mixing and origin of water the δ34s values can also differentiate between the anthropogenic sources and natural sources of fluoride contamination high tritium 4 7 tu values can delineate the rock water interaction and the dissolution of minerals 7 discussions 7 1 the occurrences of the highest fluoride concentration are found along the east african rift countries belt 4 contains the location of some of the active hot spot of the globe and is one of the leading examples of active volcanism in the world iraq and iran is also located close to the vicinity of the collision of the eurasian plate and the arabian plate the close association of the occurrences of the fluoride belts with tectonic indicate a positive correlation between high fluoride occurrences and tectonic belt these belts also have common arid climate and similar aridsols soils these similarities in climate soil and geographic location signify that a combination of a number of natural factors is responsible for the enrichment of fluoride in these belts the location of belt 2 and belt 3close to the subduction zone fig 3 and fig 7 also indicates the correlation between the tectonic belts and occurrences of fluoride belt in thailand india and china the rock types and the soil becomes the governing factors the tectonics factor that is responsible to expose the fluoride rich zones to the surface and the tectonic areas are mostly associated with volcanic zones fig 7 hence the areas near to the active or inactive tectonic zones contain hot springs and volcanic soils both of which enhances the f ions into groundwater through different processes as observed from fig 7 that the fluoride belts mostly runs parallel to the volcanic zones and the global tectonic belts the associations of high fluoride zone with the tectonic zone are geologically disturbed and have large faults which bring the deeper part of the soil or rocks in contact with the groundwater 7 2 the most dominating factors in accumulation of higher concentration of fluoride in groundwater are the rock types and lithology of the area the rocks with higher amount of fluoride after weathering will generate the soil which is rich in fluoride bearing minerals table 2 we can see from table 2 that similar rock types like rhyolites 480 ppm of f and alkali rhyolite 2180 ppm of f may have variable amount of fluoride this brings us to the conclusion that mere identifying the rock types is not sufficient to understand the concentration of fluoride in the rocks trace element and major element analysis of the rock is also important to understand its potential for fluoride contribution there is also a probability that within a low fluoride zone a local pocket may exist with high fluoride concentration that may affect the groundwater fluoride concentration substantially 7 3 soil composition is also an important natural factor for higher fluoride concentration in groundwater minerals like fluorite caf2 fluorspar cryolite na3alf6 and fluorapatite ca10 po4 6f2 contains adequate amount of fluorine when the weathered product of these minerals makes the soil they retain their potential of contributing higher f ions soil with varying composition of these minerals may contain fluoride within the range of 7 38 g kg smith et al 1977 due to its ability to control fluoride concentration the clay minerals in the soil will be a potential contributor of fluoride in groundwater the fine grained soils usuallyhave higher fluoride retaining capacity than sandy types edmunds and smedley 2013 due to difference in alkalinity compositionally similar soil contribute more f incorporation in the groundwater than their corresponding soil with similar composition but less alkalinity the groundwaters in the semi arid region with low rainfall have an alkaline ph these factors may have influenced the concentration of fluoride concentration of these fluoride belts soil composition its texture and ph are important characteristic of the soil that controls the efficiency of the soil to hold fluoride 7 4 the physicochemical property of the groundwater is another important governing factor as water with different ph will leach different amount of fluoride the presence of different ions will act as a positive or negative catalyst in dissolution of fluoride from the groundwater for example high carbonate ions co3 2 forbid the dissolution of f from the water while high sulphate so4 2 in the water favors the dissolution of f from the soil or rocks 7 5 the next governing factor is the weathering while altitude that increases the occurrences of fluorosis in particular population high weathering brings up the minerals from the deeper part of the soil which may be more fluoride rich as we have discussed earlier that in mountain soils the soil alkalinity increases with depth and hence the chances of availability of fluoride bearing minerals is also more however it is also noted that with increasing altitude the similar fluoride concentration in groundwater becomes more hazardous manji et al 1986 akosu et al 2009 pontigo loyola et al 2008 this altitude fact is observed and documented but the reasons for this effect is not well studied however it is clear from the evidences and result of the different worker that with increase in altitude the perils of fluoride increases 7 6 climate to some extent affects the groundwater fluoride and the occurrences of fluorosis higher dissolution of fluoride bearing mineral are facilitate by semiarid climate with low annual precipitation 225 400 mm per year and rapid rate of evaporation 2000 mm per year the effect of climatic factors is much less in comparison to the other governing factors so we propose the following order of the natural factors in descending order for their impacts on concentration of fluoride in groundwater rock types tectonics of the area physical and chemical properties of water types of soil in the area weathering altitude climate 7 7 the high phosphate occurrences are generally associated with high fluoride zones the higher concentration fluoride in the phosphate fertilizer may also effect the fluoride concentration in the nearest water bodies mostly phosphate mining areas are associated with nearest fertilizer factory 7 8 the natural materials like minerals soils and sometimes natural products like coconut egg shell do have potential to adsorb fluoride from drinking water a modified natural material has much higher capacity of fluoride removal hence they are a better alternative than chemical fluoride removers 7 9 the data from different types of isotopes are highly reliable and provides key information about the depth age dissolution and sources of water the isotope information in conjunction to the fluoride data can precisely provide information about the possible sources of fluoride contamination residence time of the groundwater as well as depth of the water the depth information can be used to understand the variation in fluoride concentration with depth dissolution of fluoride form different minerals in the aquifer can also be distinctly studied using δ18o values 8 conclusion i the global fluoride belts bear a positive correlation with the global tectonic belts ii the domination factors in descending order are as follows rock types tectonics of the area physicochemical properties of water types of soil in the area weathering altitude climate iii concentration of chloride and sulphate ions in water can also buffer the concentration of fluoride in groundwater iv the 18o 2h 3h 34s 12c 14c 15n isotopes provide us key information and their assessment are important to understand the characteristic of aquifer mechanism of fluoride concentration and the sources of fluoride enrichment isotopic information in combination with fluoride data provides an accurate and precise understanding of the mechanism of fluoride concentration v the phosphate mining areas are mostly associated with high fluoride content in the ground and surface water vi naturally available materials can have high potential to remove fluoride from drinking water and can be used substantially with a little

6438,fluorosis is an endemic disease that is now a global challenge in this review paper we have classified and described the global fluoride belts gfb geologically and geographically connecting different countries a proper map of the global fluoride belts showing the inland connections between each belt is presented several natural factors like the rock type soil tectonics hydrogeology and climate of a terrain which are majorly responsible for engrafting higher fluoride in drinking water are described a detailed uniform description of each belts with respect to geology geochemistry are discussed the minor factors like altitude phosphate mining etc on fluorosis are also discussed including countries like canada norway etc which are potentially affected by fluorosis the correlation of different ions like cl ca2 etc ph electrical conductivity tds etc are compared and reviewed in detailed with respect to different gfb the genesis and sources of fluoride contamination are also supported by different isotopic evidences in this article the in situ methods involving natural minerals and materials which can adsorb fluoride effectively and are being used globally are exhaustively assessed the methods which are highly sustainable with minimum waste generation and cost effective are also evaluated keywords fluorosis global fluoride belts geology and geochemistry of fluoride belts isotopic effects in situ fluoride removal techniques 1 introduction fluorosis is a prevalent disease caused due to higher intake of fluoride in human body agencies like the institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme world health organization who etc measure the worldwide disease burden and issues alert on endemic problems different metrics are used in disease burden quantification like the disability adjusted life year daly healthy life expectancy hale which summaries and assesses the population health including mortality and morbidity murray and lopez 1996 fewtrell et al 2006 have made one of the early attempts to examine the adequacy of existing data to determine the worldwide burden of illness resulting from elevated fluoride in drinking water supplies the population effected by fluorosis has substantially increased in the last five decades it is estimated that higher than two hundred sixty million people around the globe are affected by fluorosis amini et al 2008 after five decades of research on different types of fluorosis at present fluoride has been identified as a fait accompli fluoride can enter the human body through different agents like water air food dietary sources however water has been considered as the major source several human welfare organizations monitor the fluoride level in drinking water of different countries to avoid the health hazard caused by higher intake of fluoride the allowablelevel of fluoride in drinking water was set 1 5 mg l according to who 1984 this limit set by who is not sensu stricto different countries have set their own limit of fluoride in take through drinking water for example in india the bureau of indian standards bis sets a limit of 1 mg l bis report 2009 while the council of medical research of india special report icmr 1975 defines 1 5 mg l as the safety limit recently in 2015 department of health and human services united states recommends a maximum of 0 7 mg l modifying and replacing the earlier recommended level of 0 7 mg l to 1 2 mg l issued in 1962 the new suggested level intends to lower the rate of dental fluorosis on the basis of research work report u s department of health and human services hss 2015 however fluoride is known to be an important oligo element favorable for dental and skeletal growth boulétreau et al 2006 mcdonaghet al 2000 messaitfa 2008 when taken within the permissible limit intake of fluoride in high amount through drinking of water higher than the safe limit is the primary cause of fluorosis gopalakrishnan et al 1991 chowdhury and shepherd 1990 gopalakrishnan and mebrahtom 2006 infante 1975 gopalakrishnan and viswanathan 2012 karro et al 2006 zhu et al 2006 this is the reason fluoride is also called as two edged sword hence the balanced concentration of fluoride intake through drinking water is essential for survival fluoride is there in different other natural medium apart from water like air food soil etc the fact that the drinking water is a major concern is due to its requirement for metabolic system of living beings fluoride present in water completely dissociates into fluoride ions from the existing compounds and occurs either naturally or in the form of added salts jackson et al 2002 harrison 2005 the systematic absorption of fluoride into our body diffused from the intestinal tract through water to bloodstream is 100 cerklewski 1997 ekstrand et al 1978 whitford 1994 rao 1984 whitford 1996 doull et al 2006 maguire et al 2005 hence high fluoride level in water is the elementary source of fluorosis geogenic sources of high fluoride are discussed by several authors from different countries edmunds and smedley 2013 friedel and finn 2008 kanisawa 1979 liu and zhu 1991 messaitfa 2008 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 several geological processes are found to be responsible for increasing fluoride concentration in groundwater among the geological processes between the rock and water interaction geothermal spring volcanic processes tectonic processes weathering etc vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 baba and tayfur 2011 are the major pathways for fluoride contamination association of ions like chloride and phosphate shows a positive correlation with the fluoride concentration in water while the calcium ion shows negative correlation chae et al 2007 yoshimura et al 2004 isotopic data like isotopes of c o and h are also used to understand the origin of water and the loss of water from the system through evaporation they are further used to understand the interconnection between different aquifers and climatic control on fluoride concentration berger et al 2016 gastmans et al 2017 the fluoride level in groundwater can also be enhanced by anthropogenic causes phosphate fertilizers rodenticide fumigants herbicides and insecticides containing fluoride as an impurity datta et al 1996 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 fluoride contamination can also occur through burning of coal fly ash and emission of fluoride particulate from steel aluminum glass and tile industries vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the current review paper intends to investigate the information on available geological data suitable for estimating fluoride level in drinking water the review paper will attempt to correlate the distribution of rock types globally to indicate fluoride exposed zones and the population threatened by fluoride exposures precise geological data of this nature are however not available at the global level this paper is also the first paper of its kind to present detail description of the fluoride belts fig 1 is a pie diagram showing the number of persons affected in millions by fluorosis in different countries china and india are severely affected due to large population density there are many other countries too where fluorosis is a major threat fig 1 like kenya tanzania thailand uganda etc due to low population density in these countries the number of affected population is low but the percentage is much higher it has been a proven fact that the occurrence of high fluoride concentration is related to the geology and geography of the area as shown in figs 2 and 7 frencken 1992 marques et al 2006 he et al 2013 rosi 2003 naseem et al 2010 fordyce et al 2007 shah and danishwar 2003 tirumalesh et al 2007 colombo et al 2010 garcía et al 2012 globally there are few recognized zones that connect fluoride affected areas known as the fluoride belts the fluoride belts on globe stretches from syria through jordan fig 2 egypt libya algeria sudan and kenya and another that another stretch from turkey through iraq iran afghanistan india northern thailand and china as shown in figs 2 and 3 table 1 there are similar belts in the america and japan also as indicated in figs 2 and 3 the reported cases of fluorosis have been high in these areas and the groundwater fluoride level is also found to be elevated dahi 2009 have published in his report demarking five distinct linear stretches of fluoride belts as listed in table 1 and shown in fig 3 the belts are formed by joining the places that have high fluorosis and are geographically located within interconnected landmasses except a few of them 2 the five fluoride belts of the world recent studies break the previous belief on fluorosis as it was thought to be restricted within tropical countries dissanayake and chandrajith 2009 high fluoride concentrations in drinking water are frequently encountered in extensive geological and geographical belts these belts are associated with a tectonic zones b granites and gneissic rocks c marine sediments in highland areas and d volcanic rocks these belts identified as belt 1 2 3 4 and 5 occur globally along linear stretches connecting different countries fig 3 the five fluoride belts have been described in the following section and possible similarities between each belt are also drawn 2 1 belt 1 this belt is linear stretch that runs towards south from turkey to tanzania this belt includes turkey starting point syria jordan egypt sudan somali ethiopia kenya tanzania mozambique and south africa fig 3 the belt takes sharp turns from syria towards south west then from sudan towards south east connecting ethiopia and finally turns from somali towards south west following the edges of the africa continent detail descriptions are provided in the supporting information file section s2 1 in belt 1 the population suffers from fluorosis due to different geological causes that contaminates the groundwater while there are a few anthropological causes too the rock types and the water rock interaction are major factor for elevated fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the countries in belt 1 most of the countries in this belt have a dry and arid climate and high relief occurrences of extremely higher level of fluoride groundwater in the vicinity of the rift valley are observed in this belt the rift valley runs through the countries ethiopia kenya tanzania mozambique and south africa the high fluoride occurrences are concentrated along this region along the vicinity of hot spring higher fluoride is observed in the natural available water resources in syria the fractures and the topography controls the groundwater hydrogeology and possibly the water chemistry anthropological cause is also reported in turkey due to burning of coal the natural factors that are responsible for elevated fluoride level in this country are the rock types and the tectonics from fig 4 a and b we can see that the zones of high fluoride occurrences are geographically related with the rift fault volcanic and tectonics later in the tectonic section section 4 2 the correlation of the global fluoride belts and their association with the global tectonic belts has been discussed the belt has a desert tropical and desert temperate type climate the major soil type is aridisol 2 2 belt 2 this belt is linear stretch that runs from egypt to mauritania this belt includes egypt starting point common with belt 1 followed by libya algeria morocco western sahara mauritania the stretches runs east west and takes a sharp turn from morocco towards south connecting western sahara mauritania following the western edges of the continent of africa fig 3 shows the location of the different countries in this belt with respect to the global map the countries are highlighted in blue detail descriptions of each country in this belt are provided in the supporting information file section s2 2 granites and precambian basement gneisses are one of the major geological causes for elevated fluoride levels in groundwater in algeria and libya the fluoride concentration in groundwater is controlled by granites and precambian basement while in mauritania the presence of metarhyolites can cause significant variation in fluoride concentration of associated groundwater morocco and western sahara are one of highest exporter of phosphate around the world and the possible causes of fluorosis in this area is due to the presence of phosphate mines and phosphate fertilizer industries which are always associated near phosphate mines several authors have established the relationship between phosphate mining and the occurrences of fluorosis in the adjoining area haikel et al 1986 maadid et al 2017 tanouayi et al 2016 a positive correlation exists between the phosphorus and fluoride concentration in ground water this belt moves parallel to the west african mobile belt and their geographic relation with the tectonic zones can be clearly observed fig 4 the belt has desert temperate climate and the soil type is aridisol 2 3 belt 3 this belt is linear stretch that runs from turkey to china this belt includes turkey starting point common with belt 1 followed by iraq iran afghanistan pakistan india north thailand parts of china the belt runs towards east from turkey and takes a sharp turn after india towards north following the eastern edges of the continent of asia fig 3 marks the geographical location of the different countries in this belt with respect to the global map the countries are highlighted in green detail descriptions of each country in this belt are provided in the supporting information file section s2 3 the weathering and dissolution of gypsum volcanic rocks calc alkaline rocks are responsible for elevated fluoride level in groundwater of iraq and iran in iran high fluoride concentration is also observed along the adjoining areas of metamorphic rocks the alkaline granites and the pegmatite veins in afghanistan influence the higher fluoride concentration apart from the similar geological factors in pakistan and afghanistan the dry and arid climate further enhances the causes of fluorosis the semi arid climate of pakistan enhances the weathering of fluoride minerals and the alkaline water of the country promotes the rate of dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals due to the large geographical extent and geomorphological variation in india several factors are responsible for elevated fluoride level in groundwater one of the largest contributors of f in groundwater is granites and its associated aquifers fracture controlled hydrogeology phosphatic fertilizers in china and northern thailand the fluoride groundwater are associated around the hot spring in china the regional geology granitic aquifers are also local factors which can hike the fluoride concentration in groundwater this belt has a desert temperate climate but the soil type varies from aridisols to entisols discussed in section 4 2 4 belt 4 this belt is linear stretch that runs from sierra nevada to andes mountains this belt includes sierra nevada starting point followed by usa rocky mountain mexico part of north america central america colombia peru bolivia and ends in andes mountains the belt runs south west from sierra nevada and takes a sharp turn after bolivia towards south west connecting andes mountains this belt connects a large number of volcanoes active and dormant and hence can be called as a volcanic fluoride belt the countries are highlighted in violet colors observed in fig 3 detail descriptions of each country in this belt are provided in the supporting information file section s2 4 in belt 4 the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater are mostly caused by the action of active volcanoes the volcanic ash and acid rain in south america colombia the presence of hot spring volcanic craters and groundwater temperature is the most dominating factors for high fluoride concentration while in sierra nevada and bolivia the granitic aquifer is also an important factor the volcanic ash of the andes has high fluoride concentration and the leaching of the volcanic ash results in water with very high fluoride content particularly in sierra nevada and andes the acidic soil and ph of the water play a greater role in fluoride dissolution from the associated rocks this belt has a desert tropical climate and andisols as their major soil types 2 5 belt 5 this belt is linear stretch that runs from japan to volcanic islands of indonesia this belt includes japan starting point followed by philippines and indonesia the belt runs south west from japan connecting philippines and indonesia this belt also connects active and dormant volcanoes and hence can be classified in the group of volcanic fluoride belt fig 3 shows the location of the different countries in this belt from a global view the countries are highlighted in yellow color in belt 5 the entire zone is dominated by active volcanism and tectonic activity the volcanic rocks volcanic ash and active subduction in japan and indonesia are the prime causes of fluoride concentration in the groundwater of these areas in philippines apart from the active volcanic activity the hot spring also have significant contribution in contaminating groundwater with high fluoride the fluoride concentration in lakes of indonesia is very high 1266 ppm this belt has a temperate humid climate and is dominated by andisols detail descriptions of each country in this belt are provided in the supporting information file section s2 5 3 geochemistry of fluoride fluoride being a natural element is present in almost all types of water in different concentration the range of fluoride concentration sometimes reaches as high as 2800 mg l gaciri and davies 1993 the factors influencing the concentration of f in groundwater are climate factor altitude or relief factor evaporation precipitation along with geology and geomorphology of the area liu and zhu 1991 the most important method by which fluoride concentrates into the groundwater is by leaching of rocks containing fluoride rich minerals that are leached out from the source rock and contaminated the groundwater by dissolution wenzel and blum 1992 thus the dominating factor leading to fluoride contamination is the lithology and geology of the aquifer that hold groundwater in the subsurface the other important factors include the dissolved ions ph and the temperature of the water fluoride concentration in natural water is variable depending on the physico chemical factors of the water being in contact with different rock types as listed in table 2 the table displays the concentration of fluoride for different rock types and provides an insight about the potentiality of individual rock types to contribute fluoride into groundwater among the different rock types the alkalic rocks 1000 ppm mafic alkalic rocks rapakavi granites 2680 ppm phenolites 930 ppm granites and granodiorites 810 ppm shales 800 ppm and oceanic sediments 730 ppm contains very high concentration of f the presence of limestone or dolomite increases the concentration of carbonate c o 3 2 ion in water the higher carbonate c o 3 2 ion plays the role of a catalyst and enhances the dissolution of f from the associated rock within the aquifer fluoride concentrations in ground water are sometimes highly variable fordyce et al 2007 within similar lithology or climatic condition depending on the extent of weathering and availability of leachable f in rocks etc the fluoride belts around the world shows a great amount of resemblance in terms of rock type table 2 and soil composition discussed detailed in sections 4 1 and 4 4 3 1 isotope geochemistry of high fluoride groundwater isotopic techniques have been deployed in groundwater studies from past four decades isotopes in alliances with different incompatible and compatible elements are used to evaluate the process of recharge and discharge flow path interconnections within aquifers and the different sources as well as the mechanism of pollution due to their radioactivity isotopes are unique tools to determine the groundwater residence time age while in arid and semi arid climatic conditions isotopic technique is the only technique available to study aquifer dynamics stable isotopes in conjunction with fluoride are determined and investigated to understand the source of fluoride contamination and the processes controlling it several isotopic data are collected for these purposes the most popular isotopes used for understanding the groundwater sources and effects of different processes in groundwater are 18o 2h 3h 34s 12c 14c 15n etc datta et al 1996 studied the 18oisotopic composition of the groundwater in india and reported that the 18o data are like physical tracer that helps us to understand the water movement and also mixing of water from different sources they also observed that groundwater with low fluoride content 1 ppm are associated with high 18o isotopic enrichment they further suggested that 18o in integration with fluoride provide us concrete evidence on the mechanism of leaching of fluoride from soil and lateral mixing of groundwater farooqi et al 2007 studied the sulphur isotopes of the groundwater around the kasur districts punjab pakistan using the δ34s value they delineated the depth of the aquifer they reported that the δ34s value ranges 5 5 5 7 for the samples from the middle and deep aquifers li et al 2006 have demonstrated that the δ34s values of so4 values are crucial to delineate the sources of groundwater he observed that δ34s values of so4 2 in rainwater and groundwater samples are overlapping revealing so4 2 in the samples are originated mainly from pollutants in the air that gets released in the atmosphere inside the basin cortecci et al 2002 demonstrated that the δ34s of so4 2 ranges between approximately 15 and 4 for so4 2 formed by oxidation of pyrite disseminated in the local rocks and between 15 and 23 for so4 2 formed by the dissolution of evaporites whereas the δ34s of anthropogenic so4 2 from industrial effluents and fertilizers are 1 to 8 this information harnessed from the sulfur isotopes are used in understanding the geochemistry of fluoride particularly the fluctuation of fluoride with depth and the source of fluoride kim and jeong 2005 studied the oxygen isotopes of the groundwater from korean peninsula and correlated fluoride concentration they reported that low fluoride groundwater groups 0 0 5 ppm f showed δd and δ18o values of 54 1 4 6 and 7 74 0 62 respectively which suggested that the water sources were from recently precipitation the isotopedata of the fluoride group with high f concentration 1 5 ppm f are lighter in comparison to the groundwater with low fluorideand with δ18o values of 9 53 0 70 and δd values of 67 4 6 1 they further suggested that in a condition of very low nitrate levels δ18o values are also low and fluoride values are high the groundwater is significantly older than the corresponding low fluoride values tirumalesh et al 2007 studied the hydrochemistry of the groundwater in karnataka ilkal area india with a purpose of understanding the mechanism and sources of fluoride pathway into groundwater they reported that stable isotopic values δ18o of 3 4 to 0 18 and δ2h of 30 to 3 8 is observed in the bore well samples while the samples from the dug well have stable isotopic values δ18o of 0 45 to 0 15 and δ2h of 5 5 to 1 4 the surface waters lake and river have δ18o in the range 5 2 to 2 6 and δ2h in the range 39 2 to 5 8 they established a correlation between high tritium 4 7 tu δ18o and fluoride in fluoride contaminated groundwater and on the basis of the information they suggested the contribution from different sources like the surface waters contaminated by anthropogenic activities and interaction of alkaline water with clays sediments derived from mica and biotite present in the streambed awad 2014 reported from the analysis of 13c isotopes in the groundwater that stable carbon isotopes from the dissolved co2 in the water can provide significant information on the origin and the area of pollution of water the 13c isotope values can also be used to estimate the inputs of carbon with biogenic origin and quantifying its percentage in the mineralization of groundwater bhandary et al 2015 studied the two main aquifers from state of kuwait kuwait namely the kuwait group aquifer and dammam formation aquifer from the values of 13c and 14c in the aquifer groundwater they suggested the anticipated velocities and the ageof the groundwater the groundwater of the kuwait group aquifer and dammam formation aquifer was reported to be 11 30 m a and 12 21 m a respectively while the groundwater age was estimated to be 0 8 103 22 5 103b p and 26 103 to 36 103 a b p respectively analyzing the carbon isotopes and fluoride from the same samples will provide significant insight on the origin and the contribution of fluoride from different sources along with the residence time of the water application of n and sr isotopes are also widely used to monitor groundwater characteristic aravena and robertson 1998 reported the application of nitrogen isotopes and suggested that values of 15n decreases with depth jackson et al 2002 suggested that sr isotopes inventories are a unique tool for examining the weathering fluxes precisely and determining the proportions of silicate vs carbonate weathering in the himalaya by analyzing the water stream and bedrock of tributary watersheds that flows through the himalaya 4 natural factors effecting the fluoride concentration from the analysis of different fluoride belts and studying the causes of elevated fluoride level in groundwater it can be said that the concentration of groundwater fluoride is governed by the following natural factors 4 1 rock types there are total 33 countries which forms the global fluoride belts among them in 28 countries the level of fluoride in groundwater is related to the rock types and the geology four countries are indirectly related to geological causes of their fluoride concentration table 3 among the geological causes the dominated rock type is igneous 12 28 countries where the sedimentary are second most rock type 10 28 countries the geology and their associated rock type of each area of fluoride belt have been discussed earlier in this paper in this section we will describe the countries that are affected by fluorosis but are not included in the global fluoride belt the rogaland igneous complex in the s w norway and its surrounding metamorphic rocks were studied by roelandts et al 1987 they reported that the fluoride concentration ranges from 25 ppm to 3500 ppm they also found positive correlation between the f and p2o5 concentration for igneous rocks on the basis of this correlation they suggested the apatite has considerable buffering on the concentration of f in associated metamorphic unit they observed amphibole and biotite beside apatite are the other key mineral with high fluoride roelandts et al 1987 table 3 provides an overview of the dominant rock types in each place of the fluoride belts in the previous section the different rock types in context to each fluoride belt are discussed however there are other countries like canada brazil australia norway and saudi arabia that are also affected by fluorosis petrides and cartwright 2006 mirlean and roisenberg 2007 desbarats 2009 banks et al 1998 alabdulaaly 1997 while in australia the fluoride levels in groundwater is not very high and anthropological cause is suspected in brazil the phosphate fertilizer factory have raised the level of f in groundwater to 4 79 ppm leading phosphate producing countries in the world include china morocco western sahara usa egypt india jordan syria mexico part of north america south africa algeria etc they are all a part of the global fluoride belt there is a relationship between the world phosphate producing countries and the occurrences of higher fluorosis fig 5 is a pie diagram that shows the world rock phosphate concentrate production usgs 2012 phosphate from the rock concentrate is produced in different parts of the world however three countries namely china morocco and usa contribute 67 of the production of which the largest producer is china with 37 of world production although morocco which also includes parts of western sahara is one of the biggest producer fig 10 of the world but their reserve is estimated to be 50 000 million tons in morocco and western sahara the areas prone to fluorosis are mostly located near the phosphate mines dharmagunawardhane et al 2016 have analyzed the f concentration of different minerals from srilanka and it can be observed from the data that apatite major mineral in phosphaterocks contains high f fig 6 showing the fluoride content of different minerals from srilanka in canada f concentration in groundwater in not uniform and highly variable in space distribution occasionally the f concentration in groundwater can rise to as high as 15 1 ppm in norway the geology is strongly responsible for high f in groundwater with levels of f reaching up to as high as 8 26 ppm banks et al 1998 in saudi arabia there are limited data available and reliable sources are rare alabdulaaly 1997 have reported a highest level of 1 8 ppm 4 2 tectonics of the area the tectonics of the area has significant influences in enhancing the fluoride concentration in water the high fluoride rich groundwater zones are mostly associated with some kind of tectonic zones fig 7 is a map indicating the geographical relation between the fluoride belts and the global tectonic zones belt 3 4 and 5 are associated with the subduction zones while belt 1 and 2 are parallel with the adjoining convergent boundary and the transform fault respectively running parallel to the northern and eastern edge of the continent africa the spatial relation of the fluoride belts with the tectonic zone suggests that two parameters are not mutually exclusive belt 4 and 5 follows the volcanic belts of the globe and shows a strong correlation between the volcanic belts and occurrences of high fluoride zone these may be for the reason that the volcanic soils are rich in fluoride containing minerals and the high altitude of the volcanic mountains promotes high weathering the east african rift zone is particularly important and interesting in the context of tectonic relation with high fluoride bearing zones fluoride is a constituents in different rock types but the maximum concentration of fluoride in water sources and highest reported cases of fluorosis are usually from the areas that consist of intra continental hotspots aborted rifts and andean type magmatic belts though volcanic rocks are the one having highest fluoride concentration the precambrian and young marine sediments also possess high concentration of fluoride figs 8 and 9 show the east african rift ear system and associated plate moments with the location of the countries within the system the ear system is a continental rift figs 8 and 9 characterize by numerous faults and grabens this rift system extends from the jordan valley till the united republic of tanzania through sudan ethiopia uganda and kenya the volcanic rocks of the ear are known to host one of the highest fluoride zones like lake nakuru in kenya 2800 mg l 1 momella soda lake in tanzanian fig 9 has a fluoride concentration of 690 mg l 1 ethiopia is a part of the rift system fig 9 and has predominance of widespread volcanic basalt flows in the upland and lowland regions that have created from complex tectonic events baker et al 1972 the areas like alem tena and koka villages near wonji farm as well as sodere resort had boreholes yielding fluoride concentration between 6 0 mg l 1 and 22 6 mg l 1 kloos and haimanot 1999 according to the reports of kloos and haimanot 1999 the euthopian rift valley contains fluoride levels higher than 5 0 mg l in different location the highest concentration is observed in hot springs 100 of all sources while the lowest concentration is observed in springs and rivers below 1 5 mg l 1 on an average 50 of the lakes 78 of all sources shallow wells 54 of all sources and boreholes 35 of all sources have also fluoride level above 5 0 mg l the volcanic areas of the nairobi rift valley and central provinces have shown upto maximum groundwater fluoride concentration of 30 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 nair et al 1984 the ear valley had a lot of volcanic activity over the past consisting some of the tallest and extinct volcanoes the ear zone consists of active as well as dormant volcanoes among them mount meru mount kenya mount kilimanjaro menengai crater mount longonot mount nyiragongo mount karisimbi and mount elgon as well as the crater highlands in tanzania saemundsson 2008 mount meru is a younger extrusive volcano with its latest eruption in 1877 nanyaro et al 1984 among the active volcano are dallafilla ol doinyo lengai and erta ale ol doinyo lengai volcano of this region is the only known natrocarbonatite volcano that erupted in 1960 the pyroclastic ejected from these volcanoes contains high amounts of na and f and low concentrations of calcium ca and magnesium mg the faulting in the rift zone may expose deeper lithologies to the surface this may also uplift fluoride rich zones near the surface there may be some unexplored reasons too for now we can state that the tectonic zone bears a positive correlation with the occurrences of the global fluoride belts 4 3 physical and chemical properties of water the geochemistry of fluoride has been investigated by different workers ayoob and gupta 2006 it is also seen that the adsorption is strongly ph dependent at ph 3 4 the fluoride adsorption is highest and then decreases above ph 6 5 w h o 2002 as we know natural water is usually in the range of ph 7 it is not easy to dissolve a great amount of fluoride absorbed from soil to understand the sources of fluoride contamination that leads to fluorosis we will now take a look on the geochemistry of fluorides there are a number of mechanisms by which fluorides get into groundwater the rain water moving over the surface of the land gets enrich in co2 from soil air and through biochemical reactions of organic matter the dissolved co2 in turn increases the h ions in groundwater the calcareous mineral like calcite caco3 also gets dissolved in the water handa 1975 saxena and shakeel 2003 subba and john 2003 the reactions are 2 c o 2 h 2 o h 2 c o 3 3 h 2 c o 3 h h c o 3 4 hc o 3 h c o 3 2 5 cac o 3 h 2 f c a f 2 h c o 3 6 ca f 2 c a 2 2 f banerjee 2015 reported the facts that long groundwater residence time is necessary for fluoride contamination in groundwater and the process of hydrolysis is one of the most efficient processes for rapid releasing of fluoride in groundwater 4 3 1 hydrochemistry of fluoride and other ions of groundwater the concentration fluoride in water is affected by different parameters of like ph water temperature water rock interaction etc kitalika et al 2018 a direct correlation between concentration of fluoride ions and other ions like chloride sodium bicarbonate boron and with tds total dissolved solid ph e c is firmly established while a negative correlation is observed between f and ca2 is also well established understanding the correlation of fluoride with other properties of groundwater provide an insight to the mechanism and source of fluoride dissolution wang et al 2013 discussed the relation of different ions with fluoride level in groundwater of northern china where positive correlations were observed with respect to fluoride and other ions like chloride and bicarbonate warren et al 2005 have reported the correlation of different ions with fluoride and establish positive correlation between fluoride and other ions from the groundwater of northern argentina karro and uppin 2013 discussed the hydrochemistry of fluoride and boron in carbonate aquifer system in central and western estonia their results show that borondoes have a positive correlation with f in the groundwater in carbonate aquifer system they also concluded that probable reasons for the correlation between f and boron in groundwater are weathering and concurrent dissolution of fluorides and boron from carbonate rocks in estonia however boron is least studied elements in water analysis in context to fluoride in usa the dakota aquifer covers northward from kansas approximately to the arctic circle in canada from fig 10 a c we can see the geographical extent of the aquifer and the positive correlation between fluoride vs bicarbonate and fluoride vs ph fig 11 shows the correlation between fluoride vs total dissolved solid tds and fluoride vs electrical conductivity ec there is only one ion ca2 reported so far which showed a negative correlation with respect to fluoride karro and uppin 2013 fig 12 a and b show the positive correlation between fluoride vs boron and negative correlation between fluoride vs calcium respectively and fig 13 a and b shows a positive correlation between fluoride vs hco3 and fluoride vs na after a detail investigation handa 1975 came out with some possible relation with high fluoride in groundwater and the other dissolved ions he reported those high fluoride groundwater are generally coupled with littleca2 content with a negative correlation between the two ions while the calcium content is low the bicarbonate ions is high in the same water these groundwater are usually fluoride under saturated handa 1975 singaraja et al 2018 discussed the effects of bicarbonate and positive correlation of hco3 with fluoride and ph with co2 on the other hand the concentration of fluoride in groundwater is greatly affected by the rock water interaction which is effected by the ph and dissolved ions like calcium bicarbonate an alkaline environment with high bicarbonate concentration is more favorable for the dissolution of fluoride in the groundwater fig 10c this suggests that ph of the water effective in determining condition for fluoridization saxena and shakeel 2003 so the weathering of minerals is one of the responsible factors which provided the needed ions to increase the favorability of water for fluoride dissolution here in the current work it is observed that most of the fluoride belts have three optimum conditions that are responsible to hike the level of fluoridenamely volcanic ash volcanic rock types and thermal springs are high narsimha and sudarshan 2018 discussed the importance of estimating fluoride level in water emphasizing on the water chemistry parameter which would be useful in determining the safe zones for drinking water and assessment of the groundwater quality for making sustainable planning of water resources in future 4 4 types of soil in the area fig 14 a f shows the spatial distribution of diverse soils types globally while table 4 describe the properties of these types of soil from fig 14 a f we can observe that belt 1 belt2 belt 3 are dominated by aridisols while belt 4 belt 5 are dominated by andisols soils so here we describe these two soils in brief the dominant processes characteristics and soil properties of all the other soil types are shown in the map fig 14 are provided briefly in table 4 two varieties of soil are dominant in the fluoride belts namely the aridisols and andisols these soils are described briefly here 4 4 1 aridisols aridisols gets its name from the latin word aridus means dry and solum means soil are dry soils found in arid regions globally 12 7 of the ice free landmass is comprised by this soil aridisols are generally light in color and content low in organic matter these soils are characterized by little water content however the soil moisture is sufficiently high to support plant growth for short time the surface horizon ranges between vegetated areas and interspersed bare the vegetation consists of desert shrubs short bushes and grasses in the subsurface horizons accumulation of lime and salt are common due to lack of substantial leaching agents the soil soluble materials break down and are not being removed from the soil profile they accumulate in the lower layer of the soil the materials accumulated include gypsum gypsic calcium carbonate calcic soluble salts salic or exchangeable sodium natric in some cases the carbonates may bind with the soil particles and forms coarse fragments simonson 1991 aridisols is extensively found extensively in the deserts around the globe while some aridisols may possess argillic b horizon clay accumulation which are found in wetter climate due to imbalance between evapotranspiration and precipitation the soil is enriched in accumulated and concentrated salts a few aridisols are found in geologic evaporites aridisols are classified into six sub suborders among which four suborders are based on two parameters of the soluble fraction namely composition and accumulation the weathering of clay translocation occurs in a small scale in these areas the fourth and the sixth suborders reflect the processes the six classified suborders are eswaran and reich 2005 soil survey staff 1999 i cryids aridisols in cold areas ii salids these soils are formed by accumulation of salts that are more soluble than gypsum this soil includes the typical soils of playas or desert depressions or closed basins iii durids formed bysilica accumulations and they are not frequent and are associated with soils that are made from volcanic materials they are known to occur in the western usa only iv gypsids formed by gypsum accumulation they are extensively found in the near east especially in belt 1 syria iraq saudi arabia and iran they approximately cover 1 1 million km2 v argids they are results of accumulation of clay by translocation they are currently reported from usa only vi calcids accumulation product of carbonates they have calcic petrocalcic or a hypercalcic horizon there are extensively found in the major deserts of the world and covers an area of 10 2 million km2 vii cambids they occupy approximately 13 3 million km2 and are formed by transformation of material these soils are dominant suborder of aridisols low organic matter promotes fluoride desorption and mobility d alessandro et al 2012 the availability of carbonate and sodium enhance the rate of dissolution of f from rocks the calcids type aridisols are prone to high fluoride concentration as it consist of calcic petrocalcic or a hypercalcic horizon the durids type aridisols are weathered product of volcanic materials and hence are another potential source soil types having high fluoride concentration 4 4 2 andisols andisols are defined by the presence of volcanic glass in the soil these soils are least weathered and the soils forms after breaking of cinders pyroclastic material and volcanic ash close to the proximity of downwind of a volcanic activity they are younger in age forming in deposits from geologically recent events the character of the andisols depends on the climate and elevation of the mountain the belt 4 5 lies in the domain of volcanic beltand consist of several active and passive volcanoes alexander et al 1993 analyzed 27 soil samples that have an elevation ranging from 270 to 2030 m above sea level from a volcanic plateau west southwest of lassen peak northern california and usa they reported the variation of clay clay minerals from lower to higher altitude that were kaolinite smectite halloysite hydrated halloysite and allophane d alessandro et al 2012 has reported that the higher altitude soils have a lower adsorption capacity which may also affect the mobility of fluoride these evidences suggest that different types of soil will have different reaction with water at different elevation but the capacity to adsorb fluoride decreases with high altitude so the soil can release f into the aquifer at mountain regions if other factors do not cause a resistance 4 4 3 geochemistry of soils geochemically f is a typical lithophile element element that forms silicates or oxides and is concentrated in the minerals of the earth s crust under terrestrial land conditions with atmophile affinity fig 14 a f is a map showing the global distribution of different soil types in soil fluorine exists in the form of fluoride ion f this f is retained in soil mineral surface by a ligand exchange reactions or is sometimes incorporated into the minerals of soils the f in soil can also exist as complexes with al or h stuczynski et al 2007 baker and bowers 1988 under acidic condition the solubility of fluoride is high due to the availability of readily soluble fluoride salts such as naf kf and nh4f and the formation of cationic complexes like alf 2 and alf2 wenzel and blum 1992 thus f contents increased with depth due to increase in soil ph omueti and jones 1980 in soil the average fluoride concentration ranges from 200 to 300 ppm atsdr 2003 soils with 1000 ppm f and contaminated soils with 3500 ppm have been reported by ranjith et al 2017 fluoride is not leached out from the soil easily due to their strong association with soil component w h o 2002 mostly in soils fluorides are in complexes with aluminium or iron brewer et al 1966b reported that the fine texture of the soil is also responsible for the retention of f mostly in clay rich soil brewer 1966b when fluoride binds to clay it displaces hydroxide oh from the surface of the clay bower and hatcher 1967 huang and jackson 1965 meeussen et al 1996 hence the soil with enriched clay content contributes more to the distribution of f in soil profiles piotrowska and wiacek 1975 in calcareous soil the dispersion of the f is restricted due to the presence of caf2 and formation of complexes of f with fe al and si the sodic soils have high exchangeable na that increases the solubility of f the sandy soils have the least f content while high concentration of f is found in heavy clay soils and soils derived from mafic rocks kabata pendias and pendias 2001 it is seen that only 5 10 of the available fluoride is soluble in water nommik 1953 kabata pendias and pendias 2001 studied the trace elements present in soil trace element and published the trace elements concentration including fluoride in different type of soils they reported that sewages sludges contains 2 740 ppm of f phosphate fertilizer contains 8500 3800 ppm of f while limestone bearing soil contains 300 ppm of f kabata pendias and pendias 2001 essentially minerals like fluorite caf2 fluorspar cryolite na3alf6 and fluorapatite ca10 po4 6f2 contains adequate amount of fluoride to contaminate the groundwater above the permissible limit the soils that have high abundance of these minerals usually have much higher fluoride content in a range of about 7 38 g kg smith et al 1977 in the process of weathering f combined with siliceous minerals and remains as residual materials the amount dissolution is also different for different minerals for example cryolite na3alf6 dissolves readily while fluoroapatite and fluorite dissolve slowly while the clays and phosphorites sorbed the mobile f larsen and widdowson 1971 perrott et al 1976 chhabra et al 1980 brewer et al 1966b reported that the fine soil texture is also responsible for the retention of f mostly in clay rich soil brewer 1966b when fluoride binds to clay it displaces hydroxide oh from the clay surface bower and hatcher 1967 huang and jackson 1965 meeussen et al 1996 however bower and hatcher 1967 reported thatf adsorption in clay mineral are a surface phenomenon and not an exchange of oh from lattice of clay minerals the soil chemistry soil geochemistry and climate have high influences for the fluoride release from soils two major fluoride belts belt 4 5 are located along the volcanic zones the chemical data of the volcanic rocks shows that they have very high content of f kokuba 1956 analyzed28 samples of plutonic rocks and reported the f content of the rocks the volcanic rocks contain 160 2900 ppm of f and the volacanic ashes contain 120 2400 ppm of f hence it is not astonishing to find high concentration of f in ground and surface water near the zones of volcanic belts d alessandro et al 2012 conducted experiments to understand the fluorine adsorption from the topsoil upto a depth of 5 cm from the top collected on the flanks of the volcano of mt etna in italy they collected 28 samples from different position of the volcano they reported that soil sorption of f increases from the summit craters of the volcano they also reported that the sorption capacity of the soil is positively correlated with soil ph clay content and weathering index the human settlement located close to the vicinity of the volcanic zones are highly prone to receive fluoride rich water due to the leaching out of high amount of f through rain water from these zone 4 5 altitude and weathering 4 5 1 altitude manji et al 1986 was among the first workers to report the positive correlation of fluorosis and altitude manji et al 1986 surveyed children from kenya aged between 11 and 15 years from three zones of low fluoride concentration 0 5 ppm in drinking water with an altitude of 0 m 1500 m and 2 400 m above sea level and from two zones of higher fluoride concentration 0 5 ppm 1 0 ppm in drinking water for dental fluorosis the results of this survey establish a relationship between altitude and fluorosis they reported in the low f zones 36 4 of the children at sea level suffered from dental fluorosis as compared to 78 0 living at a height of 1500 m and 100 0 living at a height of 2400 m in the higher f 0 5 ppm 1 0 ppm in drinking water zones 71 2 has been effected with dental fluorosis at sea levels as compared to 93 8 at 1500 m p 0 001 they further reported that the intraoral pattern of fluorosis dental was similar within these population group but the severity of dental fluorosis for individual tooth type increased notably with a positive changes in the altitude in both the zones low and higher fluoride zones manji et al 1986 rwenyonyi et al 1998 experimented to evaluate the relationship between altitude height and fluorosis dental among the children of western uganda in two fluoride f districts at random they sampled 481 children aged between 10 and 14 years to examine for fluorosis they classified the groups further into two types one group was those who were exposed to drinking water containing 0 5 ppm of f and other group with 2 5 ppm of f group one had samples living at altitudes of 900 m 2200 m and group two had samples living at altitudes of 1750 m 2800 m they reported that from group 1 around 25 of the children n 81 located at 900 m above msl had dental fluorosis in comparison to 45 of the children n 82 at 2200 m while the other group that was exposed to high fluoride water 2 5 ppm had 67 of the children n 67 living at 1750 m effected with dental fluorosis as compared to 84 of the children n 64 at 2800 m above sea level rwenyonyi et al 1998 akosu et al 2009 studied the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in the high and low altitude parts of the central senatorial district of plateau state nigeria they selected 12 15 years children as samples and randomly 1000 children were analysed from which 554 50 4 from the high altitude part of the district and 546 49 6 from the low altitude part they reported that fluorosis prevalence was 12 9 in the district but significantly higher 22 2 in the high altitude areas compared to the low altitude ones 3 5 pontigo loyola et al 2008 studied 1024 children aged from 12 to 15 years to determine the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in mexican adolescents they were located in tula de allende hidalgo mexico north america area where the altitude ranges from 2000 m or 6560 ft they fluorine content in the water of this area range from 1 38 ppm to 3 07 ppm the reported fluorosis prevalence in el llano 3 07 ppm of f san marcos 1 38 ppm of f and tula centro 1 42 ppm of f was 94 7 89 8 and 81 9 percent respectively fig 15 shows the high relief area in a global map and it shows that the fluoride belts follow the high relief area the fig 15and the reports discussed provide us a concrete evidences that the severity of dental fluorosis increases and is positively related with altitude and the accountability of the altitude factor must be taken into consideration 4 5 2 weathering the degradation of the soil is directly related to the impact of the weathering the fluoride belts are marked in the map fig 16 they are not to scale but provide an insight about the relationship between the type of degradation of soil and location of fluoride belts it can be seen from the map fig 16 that most of the fluoride belts countries falls in the zone of very degraded soils the soils in the countries forming the fluoride belts are usually highly weathered and degraded however genetical relationship between highly weathered zones and fluorosis has also been established by some worker shekhar et al 2017 dharmagunawardhane et al 2016 dehbandi et al 2017 dharmagunawardhane et al 2016 conducted mass balance study of the mineralogical sources for fluoride in rocks weathered charnockitic gneiss bedrock and regolith from sri lanka they collected bed rock and regolith samples from the polonnaruwa area for this study where prevalence of dental flurosis exist the groundwater fluoride level in the area was upto 5 25 mg l 1 they reported that the loss of fluoride from individual fluoride bearing minerals and hence from the whole rock mass was a result of weathering they further concluded that different mineral release different amount of shekhar et al 2017 investigated the area of daltonganj bishrampur chainpur and pandu blocks of palamu district of jharkhand state in india covering an area of 1397 sq km the investigation was undertaken to study the possible relation between fluorosis and different other geomorphological parameters including weathering they reported that geomorphologically highest fluoride contamination was recorded in plateau weathered moderate 91 67 followed by plateau weathered shallow 71 43 flood plain 41 76 inselberg 27 27 and pediment 25 dehbandi et al 2017 studied the geochemistry of fluorine in the soils of localities that are effected by endemic fluorosis in central iran they reported a very strong positive correlation of total fluoride with weathering indices and soil s fine sized fractions they concluded that the chemical weathering and alteration of parent rocks soils are one of the main controlling factors of fluoride behavior in soils 4 6 climate as already mentioned fluorosis has been described as an endemic disease of tropical climates but concrete evidences are lacking however few authors have quoted that processes like evaporation and or evaporation transpiration lead to the condensation of soluble components in arid and semiarid regions resulting in fluoride enriched groundwater guo et al 2007 jacks et al 2005 mukherjee and singh 2018 suggested that arid and semiarid regions of india are more prone to high fluoride concentration and the mineralogical composition and climatic conditions are the primary controlling factors for groundwater fluoride contamination rasool et al 2017 have also suggested that the semiarid regions such as argentina china bangladesh and mexico part of north america and pakistan are more susceptible to fluoride enrichment in groundwater although in mexico rhyolites and thermal groundwater flow are greater contributors of high fluoride in groundwater however climatic condition controls the process of fluoride contamination higher dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals are facilitated by semiarid climate with low rainfall 225 400 mm per year and high rate of evaporation 2000 mm per year galagan and vermillion 1957 studied the varying concentrations of fluorosis that exist at a constant concentration of fluoride in drinking water in different temperature zones they formulated methodologies and suggested the process of calculating optimum range of fluoride intake at different temperature they also proposed the optimal fluoride range to be between 0 7 and 1 2 ppm at a temperature range of 50 f and 90 f however the optimum level of fluoride in drinking water is now thought to vary for different countries with different environmental condition hence the optimum fluoride level for different countries is set differently in srilanka the recommended level is 0 6 0 8 ppm warnakulasuriya et al 1992 while in chile it is 0 5 0 6 ppm villa et al 1998 in sudan the upper permissible limit was proposed to be modified by ramadan and hilmi 2014 to 0 32 0 35 ppm based on the climatic factors and other related factors ramadan and hilmi 2014 hence considering the above evidences the factors of climatic influences on fluorosis cannot be ruled out however it is not a dominating factor from fig 17 we can see that belt 1 2 3 and 5 are dominated by desert tropical to desert temperate type climate while belt 4 has temperate humid climate the dominance of these two types of climate suggests that desert type climate favors dissolution of fluoride in groundwater enhancing the fluoride level in groundwater when seen from a global prospective 4 7 mechanism of fluoride mobility the hydrogeochemical cycle of fluorine is a complex process as shown in fig 18 the cycle shows exchange of fluoride to the atmosphere hydrosphere geosphere and biosphere the biosphere is severely affected by excessive intake of fluoride plants aquatic as well as land animals are affected by higher intake of fluoride the mechanism of fluoride contamination is divided here into three types fluoride in water air and biosphere 4 7 1 mechanism 1 fluoride into water the fluoride is transferred from rock to soil by the process of weathering and from rock to water by dissolution of minerals fluoride can be incorporated into water from the atmosphere through rainfall and it has been calculated that the rainfall have 20 75 ppm of fluoride in wales usa in norway the rainwater fluoride concentration was 13 25 ppm and most of it was from anthropogenic sources mainly from industrial aerosols edmunds and smedley 2013 the fluoride from atmosphere to water is likely a potential sources however due to analytical difficulties this mechanism is not well established globally 4 7 2 mechanism 2 the fluoride into the atmosphere fluoride can be incorporated into the atmosphere through evapo transpiration of the water from water bodies and plants fluoride is also transferred into the atmosphere during volcanic emission volcanic activities and hydro geothermal vents also release f into the environment which contaminates the soil and hf containing gases that contaminates the air with f industrial release of fluorine into atmosphere is also possible 4 7 3 mechanism 3 the fluoride into the biosphere fluorine can be incorporated into the biosphere from water or atmosphere as well as from the soil by uptake of plants plants cells get affected by higher intake of fluoride and lead to cell death the consumption of high fluoride water causes several health hazards and has been discussed in the introduction section 1 1 4 8 hydrogeology of high fluoride aquifers fluoride enrichment in aquifers depends on the physical characteristic of the host aquifer such a rock types water residence time ph of the water and soil as well as ongoing chemical reaction between rock water singh et al 2018 described the aquifer geology of high fluoride groundwater from india according to his reports high f zones occurs in alluvium in the ganga plain having minerals like biotite 0 32 5 02 f and muscovite 2 06 f from the global statistic it can be observed that above 90 of the aquifers possessing high fluoride water are associated with granitic and gneissic rocks edmunds and smedley 2013 studied the groundwater geology of high fluoride from a global prospect and reported that high fluoride groundwater are typically of nahco3 type and have low ca concentrations 20 mg l1 or so and with ph value in the range of neutral to alkaline around 7 9 they also found that basement aquifers like granitic aquifers inactive volcanic zones water from geothermal sources and groundwater in contact with sediment particularly in arid areas are prone to show fluoride problems most part of belt 1 is dominated by granitic and basement gneisses while the hydrogeology is controlled by fracture occurring due to rifting while belts 2 have a climatic factor and phosphate mining belt 3 is governed by arid climate and granitic aquifers while belt 4 and 5 are zones of inactive and active volcanoes fig 19 shows the naivasha catchment within the central kenya rift ckr portion of the east african rift system this area has been extensively studied by olaka et al 2016 and the relation of basement rocks and fault control on fluoride concentration in the groundwater is clearly depicted such relations are also established by other workers from korea and india 5 mitigation measures clean water is a basic right of every human being water with high amount of fluoride is scientifically proved as a toxic to human body in order to mitigate the hazards caused from drinking highly concentrated fluorinated water a number of processes has been developed these processes can be broadly classified in two major groups namely in situ treatment methods and ex situ treatment methods the in situ method is only discussed here in brief 5 1 in situ treatment methods in situ defluoridation involves fluoride removal from groundwater within the aquifer instead of pumping water for treatment from the ground in situ remediation of fluoride is seen as a potential solution for drinking water supply to a large group of populations this method is cost effective provides a long term solution waste generations are minimum and requires little maintenance teutsch et al 1996 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 tredoux et al 2004 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2002 fluoride rich groundwater can be diluted using suitable managed aquifer recharge mar methods for domestic supply the challenge of this method is to find an alternative source which will have low level of fluoride concentration in the reservoir the high fluoride concentrated water is diluted by mixing it with low fluoride concentrated water and then supplied for public use this technique is suitable for developing nation where fluoride concentration is decreased with minimum cost an example of successful implementation of this method is check dams of anantapur district india where fluoride concentration in groundwater was widely reduced bhagavan and raghu 2005 rain water harvesting is another popular method used in mar techniques suitable for household or small community level developing countries like kenya uganda and tanzania have large rooftop rainwater harvesting installations built in its villages bangladesh has also launched a massive program to build rooftop rainwater harvesting structures to provide pollution free water for villagers vishwanathan 2004 and jagadeshan et al 2015 has conducted experiments on dug well recharge system by diluting high fluoride concentrated groundwater with rain water inside a dug well the results were quiet promising where they were able to demonstrate successfully the concentration of fluoride decreased from 3 1 ppm to 1 4 ppm by raising the water level from 9 1 m to 14 5 m in a well sometimes addition of certain compound enhances the capacity of natural materials to remove fluoride gogoi et al 2015 studied the change in potential of limestone to remove fluoride using phosphoric acid pa the method is known pa enhanced limestone defluoridation paeld technique they found the fluoride removal capacity of limestone get enhances greatly with addition of pa the presence of pa in limestone hikes the fluoride removal potential from 0 39 mg g to 1 10 mg g gogoi and dutta 2016 studied the effect of hydrothermally modified limestone and its fluoride removal potential the limestone was modified hydrothermally using h3po4 for fluoride adsorption they reported that the limestone possessed fluoride removal potential of 6 45 mg g the hydrothermally modified limestone possesses higher capacity of fluoride removal fig 20 fig 20 shows the enhance ability of limestone after suitable modification hydrothermally with h3po4 shown in blue lines on the time vs fluoride removal graph the line on the graph in red color shows the efficiency of fluoride removal of unmodified limestone natural waste products like fly ash generated from the domestic cooking can also be a potential remover of fluoride ranjeeta 2015 have studied the potential of fly ash generated from the burning of fuels in chula used for cooking purposed in india the fly ash was cleaned by distilled water and then they have been tested for their potentiality to remove fluoride the results reported by ranjeeta 2015 shows that the fly ash possesses a potential to remove 30 50 of the fluoride in water fig 21 is a bar diagram modified after ranjeeta 2015 plots the number of samples in the x axis and concentration of fluoride in the y axis different color codes are used to show the concentration of fluoride before and after defluoridation the f removal capacity of the fly ash is clearly deciphered graphically however these remedies sometimes come with negative consequences like untreated fly ash can change other parameters of drinking water which could be harmful for consumption jayarathne et al 2015 investigated the potential of natural apatite from eppawala srilanka with an objective to develop low cost and eco friendly adsorbent material they studied the ability of natural apatite under laboratory condition to adsorb fluoride from aqueous solutions the limitation of this method was the ph condition of water the best results were found at ph 6 0 depending of the actual concentration of fluoride the chemical composition of water the adsorption capacity was reported to be in a range of fluoride concentrations from 5 0 to 25 0 mg l this technique was suggested by them to be useful in designing an inexpensive easy to use and environmentally friendly method for removal of fluoride in water supplies at village level chidambaram et al 2003 studied the capacity of local materials using column methods the materials used to prepare the column were red soil serpentine fly ash charcoaland brick powder the time was 30 min they reported that red soil has the high fluoride removal capacity among the other materials due to presence of very fine clays iron aluminum oxide and organic matter the fact that red soil contain both the oxides of iron and aluminum that can readily adsorb fluoride red soils are one of the best removers of fluoride chidambaram et al 2003 there are several natural minerals and products that have the potential to remove fluoride in different capacities magnesite natrolite apophyllite stilbite clinoptilolite bentonite gibbsite goethite kaolinite halloysite vermiculite zeolite s serpentine alkaline soil acidic clay kaolinitic clay fuller s earth china clay aiken soil diatomaceous earth and ando soil are some of them that possesses fluoride removal capacities bower and hatcher 1967 maruthamuthu and sivasamy 1994 bjorvatn and bårdsen 1997 singano et al 1997 so it can be said from the following evidences that natural materials do have capacities to remove fluoride and they are easily available and cost effective using natural material and processes to remove fluoride must be done with precaution using such materials can change the other essential parameters of the water that supports life any natural process for fluoride removal must be properly investigated in laboratory before it is available for public uses 5 2 ex situ treatment methods exsitu treatment method works on the principle of removal of fluoride before the water is consumed for drinking purposes with chemical physical biological or a combination of these techniques there are several techniques that have been developed over decades for this purpose and each method has its own merits and demerits however in this paper we are limiting our discussion to in situ method only there are several papers and review papers that have been published that describes the methodology working principle advantages and disadvantages of different ex situ removal technique scott et al 1937 sollo et al 1978 hendrickson and vik 1984 korir et al 2009 dahi 1996 hu et al 2005 bolto and gregory 2007 bratby 1980 dahi et al 1996 mameri et al 1998 mameri et al 2001 shankar et al 2013 mohapatra et al 2009 gupta et al 2007 yadav et al 2006 kumar et al 2009 6 results the information documented and presented in this paper brings in light several facts about occurrences of high concentration fluoride in groundwater globally in this paper different natural factors are taken into consideration to analyze the most dominating and the least dominating factors for prevalence of fluorosis in an area on the basis of the data presented the following results were obtained 6 1 the fluoride belts around the world are interconnected fig 3 within the landmass globally individual fluoride belts belt 1 belt 5 are interlinked however all the belts are not interlinked with each other belt 4 fig 3 violet color and belt 5 fig 3 yellow color are not connected with the other fluoride belts each belt is associated with a certain type of soil rock types and climate relief and tectonics belt 4 5 are dominated by active to dormant volcano and large part of this belt is covered by volcanic soil belt 1 fig 3 red color and 2 fig 3 blue color are the countries located within the africa and have an arid climate as well as they are located along the mobile belts fig 4 most of the countries of the belt 1 are in geographical proximity with the east african rift system it is also noteworthy that the belts 1 2 are following the boundary of the continent belt 3 fig 3 green color is one of the longest inland belt and crosses through a number of countries with different climatic condition and lithounits however most of the countries like iraq iran pakistan and afghanistan are arid and mountainous these countries follow the tectonic zone interspersed between the eurasian plate and arabian plate fig 7 in thailand india and china the fluoride belts are associated with specific rock types granites and alkaline and soils andisols so it can be stated that the occurrences of fluorides in different countries along a belt are not random but there is a definite relationship with the tectonics and lithotypes of the area 6 2 from table 2 it is observed that similar rock types can have varying proportion of fluoride concentration for example rhyolites 480 ppm of f and alkali rhyolite 2180 ppm of f have variable amount of fluoride alkali rocks and rapakavi granites also show high contrast in fluoride concentration 6 3 fig 14 shows the soil types and its global distribution table 4 describe the properties of the soil types it is observed that most of the regions affected with high fluoride concentration are dominated by volcanic arid or mountain soil types the ph of the soil can range from very acidic about 2 to and alkaline soils sodic that may have ph values above 10 merry 2009 from fig 14 it can be observed that the fluoride belts namely belts 1 belt 2 and belt 3 are dominated by arid soils and belt 4 and belt 5 are dominated by mountain soil the texture of the soil also affects the fluoride retention capacity of the soil 6 4 the composition of the groundwater is different in different places due to the climate and aquifer geology from section 2 1 2 of this paper and from figs 10 13 it is observed that fluoride have a positive correlation with different parameters of water like tds ec chloride sodium etc similarly in mauritania positive correlation is observed between f vs cl plot section 2 2 5 in iraq high sulphates salinity and bicarbonates effects the fluoride concentration in groundwater 6 5 the altitude factor was first measured and shown by manji et al 1986 it was reported by manji et al 1986 that with similar fluoride concentration the rate of fluorosis increased with the altitude at sea level 34 were affected with fluorosis while 1500 m 70 were affected and at 2400 m 100 rwenyonyi et al 1998 also reported that there is sharp increase in occurrences of fluorosis with increase in altitude 6 6 the countries under belt 1 and 2 have typically desert type climate dry and arid climate are found egypt sudan somali mozambique mauritania iran afghanistan pakistan and china kenya has tropical to desert type condition 6 7 as discussed in section 4 1 and from fig 5 we observe that the fluorides enrich countries are also one of the largest exporters of phosphate the countries like morocco western sahara and china have close association of high fluoride along the vicinity of phosphate mines also the phosphate fertilizer contains 8500 3800 ppm of f which can affect the water bodies in the vicinity of this zone 6 8 naturally occurring rocks minerals and soils have potential to remove fluoride from drinking water commonly available materials like magnasite serpentine red soil andosoil etc possesses high potential in fluoride removal from water sometime a little modification can enhance the adsorption capacity of fluoride in natural material to a large extend phosphoric acid when added with limestone enhances its adsorption capacity to 2 times 6 9 isotopes of 18o 2h 3h 34s 12c 14c 15nare key evidences and provides important information about the sources of the fluoride in section 3 1 the details of different isotopes and their application to delineate the sources of fluoride have been discussed from the assessment of the isotopic study it is clear that the enriched 18o data are related to low fluoride content and the δ34s value are related to aquifer depth the δ18o values are used to assess the age of the water too the δ34s values in combination with so4 2 had been observed to provide potential information about water mixing and origin of water the δ34s values can also differentiate between the anthropogenic sources and natural sources of fluoride contamination high tritium 4 7 tu values can delineate the rock water interaction and the dissolution of minerals 7 discussions 7 1 the occurrences of the highest fluoride concentration are found along the east african rift countries belt 4 contains the location of some of the active hot spot of the globe and is one of the leading examples of active volcanism in the world iraq and iran is also located close to the vicinity of the collision of the eurasian plate and the arabian plate the close association of the occurrences of the fluoride belts with tectonic indicate a positive correlation between high fluoride occurrences and tectonic belt these belts also have common arid climate and similar aridsols soils these similarities in climate soil and geographic location signify that a combination of a number of natural factors is responsible for the enrichment of fluoride in these belts the location of belt 2 and belt 3close to the subduction zone fig 3 and fig 7 also indicates the correlation between the tectonic belts and occurrences of fluoride belt in thailand india and china the rock types and the soil becomes the governing factors the tectonics factor that is responsible to expose the fluoride rich zones to the surface and the tectonic areas are mostly associated with volcanic zones fig 7 hence the areas near to the active or inactive tectonic zones contain hot springs and volcanic soils both of which enhances the f ions into groundwater through different processes as observed from fig 7 that the fluoride belts mostly runs parallel to the volcanic zones and the global tectonic belts the associations of high fluoride zone with the tectonic zone are geologically disturbed and have large faults which bring the deeper part of the soil or rocks in contact with the groundwater 7 2 the most dominating factors in accumulation of higher concentration of fluoride in groundwater are the rock types and lithology of the area the rocks with higher amount of fluoride after weathering will generate the soil which is rich in fluoride bearing minerals table 2 we can see from table 2 that similar rock types like rhyolites 480 ppm of f and alkali rhyolite 2180 ppm of f may have variable amount of fluoride this brings us to the conclusion that mere identifying the rock types is not sufficient to understand the concentration of fluoride in the rocks trace element and major element analysis of the rock is also important to understand its potential for fluoride contribution there is also a probability that within a low fluoride zone a local pocket may exist with high fluoride concentration that may affect the groundwater fluoride concentration substantially 7 3 soil composition is also an important natural factor for higher fluoride concentration in groundwater minerals like fluorite caf2 fluorspar cryolite na3alf6 and fluorapatite ca10 po4 6f2 contains adequate amount of fluorine when the weathered product of these minerals makes the soil they retain their potential of contributing higher f ions soil with varying composition of these minerals may contain fluoride within the range of 7 38 g kg smith et al 1977 due to its ability to control fluoride concentration the clay minerals in the soil will be a potential contributor of fluoride in groundwater the fine grained soils usuallyhave higher fluoride retaining capacity than sandy types edmunds and smedley 2013 due to difference in alkalinity compositionally similar soil contribute more f incorporation in the groundwater than their corresponding soil with similar composition but less alkalinity the groundwaters in the semi arid region with low rainfall have an alkaline ph these factors may have influenced the concentration of fluoride concentration of these fluoride belts soil composition its texture and ph are important characteristic of the soil that controls the efficiency of the soil to hold fluoride 7 4 the physicochemical property of the groundwater is another important governing factor as water with different ph will leach different amount of fluoride the presence of different ions will act as a positive or negative catalyst in dissolution of fluoride from the groundwater for example high carbonate ions co3 2 forbid the dissolution of f from the water while high sulphate so4 2 in the water favors the dissolution of f from the soil or rocks 7 5 the next governing factor is the weathering while altitude that increases the occurrences of fluorosis in particular population high weathering brings up the minerals from the deeper part of the soil which may be more fluoride rich as we have discussed earlier that in mountain soils the soil alkalinity increases with depth and hence the chances of availability of fluoride bearing minerals is also more however it is also noted that with increasing altitude the similar fluoride concentration in groundwater becomes more hazardous manji et al 1986 akosu et al 2009 pontigo loyola et al 2008 this altitude fact is observed and documented but the reasons for this effect is not well studied however it is clear from the evidences and result of the different worker that with increase in altitude the perils of fluoride increases 7 6 climate to some extent affects the groundwater fluoride and the occurrences of fluorosis higher dissolution of fluoride bearing mineral are facilitate by semiarid climate with low annual precipitation 225 400 mm per year and rapid rate of evaporation 2000 mm per year the effect of climatic factors is much less in comparison to the other governing factors so we propose the following order of the natural factors in descending order for their impacts on concentration of fluoride in groundwater rock types tectonics of the area physical and chemical properties of water types of soil in the area weathering altitude climate 7 7 the high phosphate occurrences are generally associated with high fluoride zones the higher concentration fluoride in the phosphate fertilizer may also effect the fluoride concentration in the nearest water bodies mostly phosphate mining areas are associated with nearest fertilizer factory 7 8 the natural materials like minerals soils and sometimes natural products like coconut egg shell do have potential to adsorb fluoride from drinking water a modified natural material has much higher capacity of fluoride removal hence they are a better alternative than chemical fluoride removers 7 9 the data from different types of isotopes are highly reliable and provides key information about the depth age dissolution and sources of water the isotope information in conjunction to the fluoride data can precisely provide information about the possible sources of fluoride contamination residence time of the groundwater as well as depth of the water the depth information can be used to understand the variation in fluoride concentration with depth dissolution of fluoride form different minerals in the aquifer can also be distinctly studied using δ18o values 8 conclusion i the global fluoride belts bear a positive correlation with the global tectonic belts ii the domination factors in descending order are as follows rock types tectonics of the area physicochemical properties of water types of soil in the area weathering altitude climate iii concentration of chloride and sulphate ions in water can also buffer the concentration of fluoride in groundwater iv the 18o 2h 3h 34s 12c 14c 15n isotopes provide us key information and their assessment are important to understand the characteristic of aquifer mechanism of fluoride concentration and the sources of fluoride enrichment isotopic information in combination with fluoride data provides an accurate and precise understanding of the mechanism of fluoride concentration v the phosphate mining areas are mostly associated with high fluoride content in the ground and surface water vi naturally available materials can have high potential to remove fluoride from drinking water and can be used substantially with a little modification they are cost effective and easily available declaration of interest none acknowledgements authors thank serb dst new delhi india for financial support grant no sr ft cs 125 2010 authors

6439,reservoir inflow estimation is important in flood control operation reservoir inflow includes three components namely upstream tributary and lateral inflow however the lateral inflow which has a significant contribution to reservoir inflow during flood seasons is difficult to estimate in regions where precipitation or meteorological data are lacking a reverse model based on the adjoint equation method aem was proposed to improve the estimated accuracy of reservoir inflow without using rainfall data the model inverted the lateral inflow on the basis of observed hydraulic characteristic data such as water levels and discharges the aem which is considered an optimization method determines the optimal lateral inflow by minimizing misfits between the observed and simulated data the capability of the aem was verified by two synthetic examples with varied boundary conditions after running the forward model to solve one dimensional saint venant equations the resulting water level hydrographs were used as known observations for the inversion the practical applicability was tested by reproducing a historical flood event of the three gorges reservoir by using water level data and outflow hydrograph results demonstrated that the aem could successfully invert lateral and reservoir inflows by using observed data and has practical applicability in complicated reservoirs keywords reservoir inflow estimation lateral inflow reverse flow routing model adjoint equation method 1 d saint venant equations 1 introduction floods have caused tremendous loss of life and incalculable economic damage worldwide in recent years in this regard accurate reservoir inflow estimation is a key issue in flood forecasting and control reservoir inflow usually includes main upstream and tributary inflows deng et al 2015 liu et al 2015 during floods the contribution of lateral inflow which is generated by rainfall to the reservoir inflow is significant tayfur et al 2007 two category models namely data driven and physically based models have been widely used over the past decades to forecast reservoir inflows deng et al 2015 data driven models avoid analyzing the physical progress by building a black box to forecast reservoir inflow artificial neural networks are used to predict reservoir inflow jain et al 1999 coulibaly et al 2000 cheng et al 2015 a radial basis function model is also adopted to forecast reservoir inflow during typhoons lin et al 2009 lin and wu 2011 physical models such as simple water balance method are often used to estimate reservoir inflow deng et al 2015 as shown as follows 1 i t o t v t 1 v t δ t l t where it is the reservoir inflow during time period t vt and vt 1 are the reservoir storage volumes at the initial and final time periods δ t respectively ot is the reservoir release during time period t and l t is the water loss from the reservoir including evaporation and seepage the reservoir storage volume v t is estimated by the relationship between storage and observed water level z t that is v t f z t the reservoir inflow is the total water flow into the reservoir and it can also be obtained directly through fig 1 2 i q up q tri q l where q up and q tri represent the observed discharges of the upstream main channel and tributaries from monitoring stations respectively and q l is the discharge of lateral inflow including small tributaries which have no gauge station and total discharge of hill slope lateral inflow along the main channel the discharge from the main channel and large tributaries can be easily measured but the lateral inflow is hardly quantified lateral inflow estimation has become the key issue in reservoir inflow estimation flood warning systems such as the delft fews system that integrates hydraulic and hydrological models have been developed to forecast reservoir inflow werner and reggiani 2005 werner et al 2013 wu et al 2014 and the lateral inflow generated by hydrological models has been used as a boundary condition or lateral input added to a hydraulic model which is based on saint venant equations nam et al 2014 in general the lateral inflow cannot be estimated accurately because of the lack of precipitation or meteorological data without rainfall data category models known as reverse flow routing process models are proposed to estimate unknown discharge hydrograph on the basis of hydraulic characteristics such as stage hydrograph das 2009 tarpanelli et al 2012 zucco et al 2015 spada et al 2017 the reverse flow routing model estimates the unknown discharge hydrograph by routing the forward model one dimensional saint venant equations many times until producing hydraulic characteristics as close to observed data as possible zucco et al 2015 topography data the distribution of roughness coefficient and initial and boundary conditions are required to solve the hydraulic model and an implicit four point difference scheme is usually used the hydraulic model needs to be verified and calibrated to ensure its capability to describe the hydraulic routing process d oria and tanda 2012 the unknown upstream inflow of channel is reversed with the downstream discharge series and initial conditions throughout the channel dooge and bruen 2005 d oria and tanda 2012 applied a bayesian geostatistical approach to reverse flow routing in open channels and properly reproduced the upstream inflow hydrographs with random errors of downstream discharge up to 10 spada et al 2017 developed a reverse flow routing model that solves the saint venant equations in diffusion form and the discharge hydrograph estimated using only the stage hydrograph of the two ends of a channel reach with lateral inflow is significant most of the reverse flow routing models presented above reversed the upstream inflow hydrograph by the observed data and the lateral inflow was considered negligible or known however zucco et al 2015 and spada et al 2017 considered the significant lateral inflow when building their reverse flow routing models in most conditions the upstream and tributary inflows are easily measured and the significant lateral inflow estimation has become the key issue in reservoir inflow estimation thus obtaining the lateral inflow without rainfall data should be studied in this study a reverse model based on the adjoint equation method aem was proposed and applied to the three gorges reservoir tgr in china to estimate the reservoir inflow with significant lateral inflow the aem is an effective inverse methodology which has been widely used in meteorology and oceanography ghil and malanotterizzoli 1991 the application of the aem in meteorology has been proven to be effective courtier et al 1993 tziperman and thacker 1989 applied the aem to estimate the unknown parameters of an oceanic general circulation in recent years the aem has been used in the research area of hydrodynamics ding 2005 and yoshida 2014 used the aem to inverse manning s roughness coefficient in channel networks and vegetated flooded rivers respectively an optimal flow control technique based on the aem was also proposed to estimate the lateral outflow rate to make the downstream stage be under the maximum allowable water level ding and wang 2006 2 forward model 2 1 governing equation the forward model is

number 3 aem the aem was first proposed by penenko and obraztsov 1967 the basic idea of the aem is to minimize the objective function which is defined as the sum of squares of differences between

the optimal lateral inflow value is searched by 35 q lat k 1 n q lat kn l q lat kn α where α is the search step size and the gradient of the objective function with respect to the lateral flow is the search direction in this work the aem procedure is as follows see fig 4 1 the lateral inflow of an initial value is given 2 the forward model is run the simulated values are obtained and the objective function j is calculated 3 the adjoint equation is driven backward in time and the gradient of objective function is calculated with respect to the lateral inflow 4 if the objective function is smaller than the required precision ε then the process is stopped otherwise the variables are adjusted on the basis of the gradient and iteration steps 2 4 are repeated until the required precision is met 4 synthetic examples the inverse methodology was verified by conducting two synthetic examples because the lateral inflow value is difficult to measure an actual lateral inflow hydrograph was assumed and the forward model was applied to obtain observations which were used in the inverse procedure if the inversed lateral inflow hydrograph is close to the actual inflow hydrograph then the inverse methodology could estimate the lateral inflow successfully in the two synthetic examples the unknown lateral inflow and reservoir inflow were inversed by the aem with known channel geometry boundary and initial conditions and observations the observations including the water level values of gauging stations cuntan qingxichang wanxian fengjie and badong and actual outflow values the discharge from the dam were calculated by the forward model with actual lateral inflow hydrograph and initial and boundary condition the two synthetic examples had the same channel geometry the main channel of tgr see fig 5 but different boundary conditions the first synthetic example considered that no tributary import to the main channel existed whereas the second example considered that one tributary flowed into the main channel the initial condition of each example was obtained from a long time simulation with the first boundary values until a steady state condition was reached in all the synthetic cases the total simulation time was 168 h the time step discretization of the results was set to 2 h 85 values the number of forward model runs to obtain the optimal value was approximately 30 and the computational time was approximately 4 h on a standard personal computer inter core i5 with cpu speed of 3 30 ghz and 4 gb of ram running windows 7 three criteria root mean square error rmse coefficient of correlation cc and coefficient of efficiency ce were adopted to evaluate the performance of the inverse methodology 4 1 synthetic example with no tributary in this example a synthetic discharge hydrograph and a uniform water level 142 227 m were specified as the upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the main channel respectively the upstream inflow hydrograph was assumed as a flood with a base flow of 16800 m3 s and peak discharge of 25000 m3 s fig 6 b the actual lateral input was a synthetic discharge series and a train of three sinusoidal waves with a period of 48 h was generated though q l 2000 cos 2 π t 48 2000 the synthetic lateral inflow hydrograph was unrealistic but useful in demonstrating the capability of the aem in inversing high frequency waves bruen and dooge 2007 as shown in fig 6 the actual lateral inflow hydrograph perfectly matches with the estimated one reservoir inflow is the sum of lateral and upstream inflows and if needed the tributary inflow and it can be obtained directly through eq 2 accordingly the estimated reservoir inflow is close to the actual reservoir inflow a comparison between actual outflow and the estimated outflow shows that the inversed results are similar to the observed data this case demonstrates that the inverse methodology can inverse the lateral inflow waves into a single channel and estimate the reservoir inflow successfully the rmse cc and ce of the lateral inflow reservoir inflow and outflow are shown in table 1 4 2 synthetic example with one tributary in the second synthetic example the upstream and downstream boundaries were the same with the first synthetic example and a tributary was added to the main channel fig 5 the tributary inflow hydrograph was assumed as a flood with a base flow of 2500 m3 s and peak discharge of 5000 m3 s fig 8 a the lateral inflow hydrograph was assumed as a flood wave with 45 h to peak peak discharge of 11000 m3 s and a base flow of 3000 m3 s fig 8a in this case the contribution of lateral inflow to reservoir inflow was significant and the maximum lateral inflow contribution rate was 30 during the inversion the observed water level values were first assumed free of errors these observed water level values corrupted with random errors obeying gaussian distribution with maximum deviations of 0 05 m to make the synthetic example close to real applications fig 7 the observed outflow values do not corrupt with random errors because the outflow is a determined value calculated using the gate hole outflow formula in practical applications in fig 8 the actual lateral inflow reservoir inflow and outflow hydrographs are displayed with the estimated ones the difference between the actual hydrographs and the error free estimated ones is small and the cc and ce values of lateral inflow reservoir inflow and outflow are close to 1 0 table 2 in case of introducing errors in the observations the inversion results remain to have high accuracy minimal oscillations occur in the estimated lateral inflow values but the estimated reservoir inflow and outflow hydrograph remain smooth the result of the second synthetic test shows that the aem has high accuracy in inversing the significant lateral inflow when a tributary concentrate exists in the main channel even the observations were corrupted with random errors the synthetic examples demonstrate that the aem can accurately inverse the lateral inflow reservoir inflow and outflow under different boundary conditions although the observations were corrupted with random errors the aem could reproduce the lateral inflow with high precision 5 case study 5 1 study area the tgr 29 16 31 25 n 106 20 111 50 e located in yichang hubei province china is the largest hydraulic project in the world wu et al 2016 this project is a typical river channel type reservoir which retains the original shape of the river section its main channel length is 660 km the reservoir has a surface area of approximately 1080 km2 and a reservoir storage capacity of 393 108 m3 under a normal pool level of 175 m the tgr plays an important role in flood control power generation navigation and agricultural irrigation for the yangtze river basin in the flood season generally from july to september the most important issue of the tgr is flood control because the tgr downstream is a plain area which is the most populous area that suffers disastrous flood threats in china the inflow of the tgr consists of three components namely the main upstream inflow the inflow from the tributaries and the lateral inflow generated by rainfalls from the tgr intervening basin li et al 2010 which has a catchment area of 55 907 km2 fig 9 the tgr intervening basin is located in a monsoon climate zone its annual precipitation ranges from 1000 mm to 1600 mm and the average precipitation is approximately 1200 mm zhang et al 2005 the terrain and geomorphology of this region are complex and the lateral inflow rapidly concentrates to the main channel and exerts an impact on the reservoir inflow of the tgr wang et al 2011 studied the effects of lateral inflow on the flood peak of the tgr by analyzing 880 flood events during 1956 2000 this finding shows that the contributions of lateral inflow to the reservoir inflow of the tgr are significant the contribution ratio of lateral inflow to reservoir inflow peak can reach up to 50 with an average of 20 the average lateral inflow discharge is 3524 m3 s and the maximum lateral discharge can reach 25000 m3 s fig 10 shows the distribution of gauge stations seven gauge stations along the mainstream zhutuo cuntan qinxichang wanxian fengjie badong and fenghuangshan and nine tributaries jialing wu xiaojiang tangxi modaoxi daning yandu qinggang and xiangxi rivers were considered in the study 5 2 morphological data the river geometry is represented by 377 cross sections and the distance between two adjacent cross sections varies from 2 km to 4 km the channel terrain of the tgr is very complex and irregular the tgr main channel vertical profile is shown in fig 11 and the typical cross section of the main channel is shown in fig 12 5 3 manning s roughness coefficient calibration in the forward model manning s roughness coefficient is the only parameter that needs to be calibrated manning s roughness coefficient is an empirical parameter that is related to several factors including channel shape surface friction and vegetation manning s roughness coefficient changes considerably along the tgr main channel because of the channel terrain irregularity the distribution of manning s roughness coefficient along the main channel was based on a previous study wang et al 2011 and three cases were used to calibrate manning s roughness coefficient the calibration results are shown in table 3 three periods namely 5th 12th of march 2007 3rd 10th of february 2008 and 2nd 9th of april 2009 were selected to calibrate the distribution of manning s roughness coefficient in the tgr because the influence of lateral inflow can be ignored during the nonflood season the recorded discharge hydrograph of zhutuo gauge station and the recorded water level data of fenghuangshan dam gauge station were considered the upstream and downstream boundaries respectively and the discharge of each tributary was considered the lateral boundary the results after a long time steady state simulation of the first boundary values were selected as the initial conditions the simulated results and the observed data of 2009 are shown in fig 10 fig 13 shows that the simulated water level agrees with the observed ones the rmse cc ce and mean absolute error mae of the water level are shown in table 4 the data demonstrate that manning s roughness distribution of the forward model is reliable 5 4 field data application the practical applicability of the inverse methodology was tested by reproducing a historical flood event during the 27th of july to 8th of august 2007 which shows that the contribution of the lateral inflow is significant the recorded discharge hydrograph of zhutuo gauge station and recorded water level data of fenghuangshan dam gauge station were considered the upstream and downstream boundaries respectively according to the gateway control of the tgr during the flood season the downstream water level is under 145 m which is the flood limit water level liu et al 2015 the discharge of each tributary was considered the lateral boundary the initial conditions were obtained from a long time steady state simulation with the first boundary values the observed water level values at the sites of cuntan qingxichang wanxian fengjie and badong and the outflow were used to inverse the unknown lateral inflow through a large repetitive calculation the observed outflow is related to the reservoir water level and operating rules of the tgr and it can be obtained through the following hydropower generation formula 36 n k q out h where n is the output power kw k is the comprehensive efficiency coefficient m2 s q out is the outflow value m3 s h is the water head m and h is the reservoir water level of the dam the observations of each gauging station and the inverse methodology results are shown in fig 14 and the optimal lateral inflow hydrograph and estimated reservoir inflow are shown in fig 15 a comparison of the observed data simulated data and inversed data is reported in fig 14 the simulated data are the results at each gauging station obtained from the forward model which neglects the lateral inflow the inversed data are the ones obtained considering the lateral inflow which are inversed by the aem in the beginning and end of the flood event 0 50 h and 200 300 h a good match between the forward model simulation results and the observed data was observed this result demonstrates that when the lateral inflow influence is negligible the forward model has great precision a gap between the forward model simulation results and observed data in 50 200 h was observed and the observed water level of gauge stations is higher than the forward model simulation results this finding shows the lateral inflow has an impact on the reservoir inflow during floods fig 14 shows that compared with the forward model simulated results the stage hydrographs reproduced by the reverse methodology are closer to the observed hydrographs the inversed lateral inflow hydrograph is an oscillating curve in which the maximum amplitude reaches 2500 m3 s fig 15 the inversed lateral inflow hydrograph is a flood wave with 60 h to peak with peak discharge of 11000 m3 s the peak discharge of the inversed reservoir inflow hydrograph is 56000 m3 s with 70 h to peak table 5 shows the performance of the inverse methodology at each gauge station the findings show that the inverse methodology improves the forecast performance fig 14a and f show that during some periods which are 100 175 h to cuntan site and 75 125 h to badong site the forward model simulated results are closer to the observed hydrograph than the estimated hydrograph this situation may be caused by two reasons one is the uniform lateral inflow assumption which hardly represents the spatial and temporal distributions of the lateral inflow the other is that measurement errors exist in the observed data in this case the number of forward model runs to obtain the optimal value was approximately 45 and the computational time was approximately 15 h on a standard personal computer inter core i5 with cpu speed of 3 30 ghz and 4 gb of ram running windows 7 6 conclusion lateral inflow is difficult to acquire due to the lack of precipitation or meteorological data the objective of this work is to invert the significant lateral inflow from the observed water level and discharge data the aem was used to find the optimal lateral inflow by minimizing the misfits between observed and simulated data two synthetic examples with different boundary conditions and known data were used to test the capabilities of the inverse methodology the results of the synthetic examples highlight the accuracy of the inverse methodology in reproducing the lateral inflow hydrograph a field case was used to evaluate the practical application performance of the inverse methodology the tgr was selected as the study area because it is a typical river channel type reservoir where the influence of the lateral inflow is significant during the flood season the results show that with the observed data only the inverse methodology can reproduce the historically significant lateral inflow in case of complicated reservoirs with irregular cross sections and different manning s roughness coefficients the aem can be used to invert the historical lateral inflow process estimate the reservoir inflow and correct and predict the lateral inflow in real time on the basis of real time dynamic monitoring data the inverse approach can invert the lateral inflow of current events and use this value to predict the reservoir inflow at the next event the results will provide reservoir managers with real time accurate and effective information on water status thus giving safeguards for safe operation of reservoirs and flood control declaration of interests none acknowledgements this work was supported by

6439,reservoir inflow estimation is important in flood control operation reservoir inflow includes three components namely upstream tributary and lateral inflow however the lateral inflow which has a significant contribution to reservoir inflow during flood seasons is difficult to estimate in regions where precipitation or meteorological data are lacking a reverse model based on the adjoint equation method aem was proposed to improve the estimated accuracy of reservoir inflow without using rainfall data the model inverted the lateral inflow on the basis of observed hydraulic characteristic data such as water levels and discharges the aem which is considered an optimization method determines the optimal lateral inflow by minimizing misfits between the observed and simulated data the capability of the aem was verified by two synthetic examples with varied boundary conditions after running the forward model to solve one dimensional saint venant equations the resulting water level hydrographs were used as known observations for the inversion the practical applicability was tested by reproducing a historical flood event of the three gorges reservoir by using water level data and outflow hydrograph results demonstrated that the aem could successfully invert lateral and reservoir inflows by using observed data and has practical applicability in complicated reservoirs keywords reservoir inflow estimation lateral inflow reverse flow routing model adjoint equation method 1 d saint venant equations 1 introduction floods have caused tremendous loss of life and incalculable economic damage worldwide in recent years in this regard accurate reservoir inflow estimation is a key issue in flood forecasting and control reservoir inflow usually includes main upstream and tributary inflows deng et al 2015 liu et al 2015 during floods the contribution of lateral inflow which is generated by rainfall to the reservoir inflow is significant tayfur et al 2007 two category models namely data driven and physically based models have been widely used over the past decades to forecast reservoir inflows deng et al 2015 data driven models avoid analyzing the physical progress by building a black box to forecast reservoir inflow artificial neural networks are used to predict reservoir inflow jain et al 1999 coulibaly et al 2000 cheng et al 2015 a radial basis function model is also adopted to forecast reservoir inflow during typhoons lin et al 2009 lin and wu 2011 physical models such as simple water balance method are often used to estimate reservoir inflow deng et al 2015 as shown as follows 1 i t o t v t 1 v t δ t l t where it is the reservoir inflow during time period t vt and vt 1 are the reservoir storage volumes at the initial and final time periods δ t respectively ot is the reservoir release during time period t and l t is the water loss from the reservoir including evaporation and seepage the reservoir storage volume v t is estimated by the relationship between storage and observed water level z t that is v t f z t the reservoir inflow is the total water flow into the reservoir and it can also be obtained directly through fig 1 2 i q up q tri q l where q up and q tri represent the observed discharges of the upstream main channel and tributaries from monitoring stations respectively and q l is the discharge of lateral inflow including small tributaries which have no gauge station and total discharge of hill slope lateral inflow along the main channel the discharge from the main channel and large tributaries can be easily measured but the lateral inflow is hardly quantified lateral inflow estimation has become the key issue in reservoir inflow estimation flood warning systems such as the delft fews system that integrates hydraulic and hydrological models have been developed to forecast reservoir inflow werner and reggiani 2005 werner et al 2013 wu et al 2014 and the lateral inflow generated by hydrological models has been used as a boundary condition or lateral input added to a hydraulic model which is based on saint venant equations nam et al 2014 in general the lateral inflow cannot be estimated accurately because of the lack of precipitation or meteorological data without rainfall data category models known as reverse flow routing process models are proposed to estimate unknown discharge hydrograph on the basis of hydraulic characteristics such as stage hydrograph das 2009 tarpanelli et al 2012 zucco et al 2015 spada et al 2017 the reverse flow routing model estimates the unknown discharge hydrograph by routing the forward model one dimensional saint venant equations many times until producing hydraulic characteristics as close to observed data as possible zucco et al 2015 topography data the distribution of roughness coefficient and initial and boundary conditions are required to solve the hydraulic model and an implicit four point difference scheme is usually used the hydraulic model needs to be verified and calibrated to ensure its capability to describe the hydraulic routing process d oria and tanda 2012 the unknown upstream inflow of channel is reversed with the downstream discharge series and initial conditions throughout the channel dooge and bruen 2005 d oria and tanda 2012 applied a bayesian geostatistical approach to reverse flow routing in open channels and properly reproduced the upstream inflow hydrographs with random errors of downstream discharge up to 10 spada et al 2017 developed a reverse flow routing model that solves the saint venant equations in diffusion form and the discharge hydrograph estimated using only the stage hydrograph of the two ends of a channel reach with lateral inflow is significant most of the reverse flow routing models presented above reversed the upstream inflow hydrograph by the observed data and the lateral inflow was considered negligible or known however zucco et al 2015 and spada et al 2017 considered the significant lateral inflow when building their reverse flow routing models in most conditions the upstream and tributary inflows are easily measured and the significant lateral inflow estimation has become the key issue in reservoir inflow estimation thus obtaining the lateral inflow without rainfall data should be studied in this study a reverse model based on the adjoint equation method aem was proposed and applied to the three gorges reservoir tgr in china to estimate the reservoir inflow with significant lateral inflow the aem is an effective inverse methodology which has been widely used in meteorology and oceanography ghil and malanotterizzoli 1991 the application of the aem in meteorology has been proven to be effective courtier et al 1993 tziperman and thacker 1989 applied the aem to estimate the unknown parameters of an oceanic general circulation in recent years the aem has been used in the research area of hydrodynamics ding 2005 and yoshida 2014 used the aem to inverse manning s roughness coefficient in channel networks and vegetated flooded rivers respectively an optimal flow control technique based on the aem was also proposed to estimate the lateral outflow rate to make the downstream stage be under the maximum allowable water level ding and wang 2006 2 forward model 2 1 governing equation the forward model is

number 3 aem the aem was first proposed by penenko and obraztsov 1967 the basic idea of the aem is to minimize the objective function which is defined as the sum of squares of differences between

the optimal lateral inflow value is searched by 35 q lat k 1 n q lat kn l q lat kn α where α is the search step size and the gradient of the objective function with respect to the lateral flow is the search direction in this work the aem procedure is as follows see fig 4 1 the lateral inflow of an initial value is given 2 the forward model is run the simulated values are obtained and the objective function j is calculated 3 the adjoint equation is driven backward in time and the gradient of objective function is calculated with respect to the lateral inflow 4 if the objective function is smaller than the required precision ε then the process is stopped otherwise the variables are adjusted on the basis of the gradient and iteration steps 2 4 are repeated until the required precision is met 4 synthetic examples the inverse methodology was verified by conducting two synthetic examples because the lateral inflow value is difficult to measure an actual lateral inflow hydrograph was assumed and the forward model was applied to obtain observations which were used in the inverse procedure if the inversed lateral inflow hydrograph is close to the actual inflow hydrograph then the inverse methodology could estimate the lateral inflow successfully in the two synthetic examples the unknown lateral inflow and reservoir inflow were inversed by the aem with known channel geometry boundary and initial conditions and observations the observations including the water level values of gauging stations cuntan qingxichang wanxian fengjie and badong and actual outflow values the discharge from the dam were calculated by the forward model with actual lateral inflow hydrograph and initial and boundary condition the two synthetic examples had the same channel geometry the main channel of tgr see fig 5 but different boundary conditions the first synthetic example considered that no tributary import to the main channel existed whereas the second example considered that one tributary flowed into the main channel the initial condition of each example was obtained from a long time simulation with the first boundary values until a steady state condition was reached in all the synthetic cases the total simulation time was 168 h the time step discretization of the results was set to 2 h 85 values the number of forward model runs to obtain the optimal value was approximately 30 and the computational time was approximately 4 h on a standard personal computer inter core i5 with cpu speed of 3 30 ghz and 4 gb of ram running windows 7 three criteria root mean square error rmse coefficient of correlation cc and coefficient of efficiency ce were adopted to evaluate the performance of the inverse methodology 4 1 synthetic example with no tributary in this example a synthetic discharge hydrograph and a uniform water level 142 227 m were specified as the upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the main channel respectively the upstream inflow hydrograph was assumed as a flood with a base flow of 16800 m3 s and peak discharge of 25000 m3 s fig 6 b the actual lateral input was a synthetic discharge series and a train of three sinusoidal waves with a period of 48 h was generated though q l 2000 cos 2 π t 48 2000 the synthetic lateral inflow hydrograph was unrealistic but useful in demonstrating the capability of the aem in inversing high frequency waves bruen and dooge 2007 as shown in fig 6 the actual lateral inflow hydrograph perfectly matches with the estimated one reservoir inflow is the sum of lateral and upstream inflows and if needed the tributary inflow and it can be obtained directly through eq 2 accordingly the estimated reservoir inflow is close to the actual reservoir inflow a comparison between actual outflow and the estimated outflow shows that the inversed results are similar to the observed data this case demonstrates that the inverse methodology can inverse the lateral inflow waves into a single channel and estimate the reservoir inflow successfully the rmse cc and ce of the lateral inflow reservoir inflow and outflow are shown in table 1 4 2 synthetic example with one tributary in the second synthetic example the upstream and downstream boundaries were the same with the first synthetic example and a tributary was added to the main channel fig 5 the tributary inflow hydrograph was assumed as a flood with a base flow of 2500 m3 s and peak discharge of 5000 m3 s fig 8 a the lateral inflow hydrograph was assumed as a flood wave with 45 h to peak peak discharge of 11000 m3 s and a base flow of 3000 m3 s fig 8a in this case the contribution of lateral inflow to reservoir inflow was significant and the maximum lateral inflow contribution rate was 30 during the inversion the observed water level values were first assumed free of errors these observed water level values corrupted with random errors obeying gaussian distribution with maximum deviations of 0 05 m to make the synthetic example close to real applications fig 7 the observed outflow values do not corrupt with random errors because the outflow is a determined value calculated using the gate hole outflow formula in practical applications in fig 8 the actual lateral inflow reservoir inflow and outflow hydrographs are displayed with the estimated ones the difference between the actual hydrographs and the error free estimated ones is small and the cc and ce values of lateral inflow reservoir inflow and outflow are close to 1 0 table 2 in case of introducing errors in the observations the inversion results remain to have high accuracy minimal oscillations occur in the estimated lateral inflow values but the estimated reservoir inflow and outflow hydrograph remain smooth the result of the second synthetic test shows that the aem has high accuracy in inversing the significant lateral inflow when a tributary concentrate exists in the main channel even the observations were corrupted with random errors the synthetic examples demonstrate that the aem can accurately inverse the lateral inflow reservoir inflow and outflow under different boundary conditions although the observations were corrupted with random errors the aem could reproduce the lateral inflow with high precision 5 case study 5 1 study area the tgr 29 16 31 25 n 106 20 111 50 e located in yichang hubei province china is the largest hydraulic project in the world wu et al 2016 this project is a typical river channel type reservoir which retains the original shape of the river section its main channel length is 660 km the reservoir has a surface area of approximately 1080 km2 and a reservoir storage capacity of 393 108 m3 under a normal pool level of 175 m the tgr plays an important role in flood control power generation navigation and agricultural irrigation for the yangtze river basin in the flood season generally from july to september the most important issue of the tgr is flood control because the tgr downstream is a plain area which is the most populous area that suffers disastrous flood threats in china the inflow of the tgr consists of three components namely the main upstream inflow the inflow from the tributaries and the lateral inflow generated by rainfalls from the tgr intervening basin li et al 2010 which has a catchment area of 55 907 km2 fig 9 the tgr intervening basin is located in a monsoon climate zone its annual precipitation ranges from 1000 mm to 1600 mm and the average precipitation is approximately 1200 mm zhang et al 2005 the terrain and geomorphology of this region are complex and the lateral inflow rapidly concentrates to the main channel and exerts an impact on the reservoir inflow of the tgr wang et al 2011 studied the effects of lateral inflow on the flood peak of the tgr by analyzing 880 flood events during 1956 2000 this finding shows that the contributions of lateral inflow to the reservoir inflow of the tgr are significant the contribution ratio of lateral inflow to reservoir inflow peak can reach up to 50 with an average of 20 the average lateral inflow discharge is 3524 m3 s and the maximum lateral discharge can reach 25000 m3 s fig 10 shows the distribution of gauge stations seven gauge stations along the mainstream zhutuo cuntan qinxichang wanxian fengjie badong and fenghuangshan and nine tributaries jialing wu xiaojiang tangxi modaoxi daning yandu qinggang and xiangxi rivers were considered in the study 5 2 morphological data the river geometry is represented by 377 cross sections and the distance between two adjacent cross sections varies from 2 km to 4 km the channel terrain of the tgr is very complex and irregular the tgr main channel vertical profile is shown in fig 11 and the typical cross section of the main channel is shown in fig 12 5 3 manning s roughness coefficient calibration in the forward model manning s roughness coefficient is the only parameter that needs to be calibrated manning s roughness coefficient is an empirical parameter that is related to several factors including channel shape surface friction and vegetation manning s roughness coefficient changes considerably along the tgr main channel because of the channel terrain irregularity the distribution of manning s roughness coefficient along the main channel was based on a previous study wang et al 2011 and three cases were used to calibrate manning s roughness coefficient the calibration results are shown in table 3 three periods namely 5th 12th of march 2007 3rd 10th of february 2008 and 2nd 9th of april 2009 were selected to calibrate the distribution of manning s roughness coefficient in the tgr because the influence of lateral inflow can be ignored during the nonflood season the recorded discharge hydrograph of zhutuo gauge station and the recorded water level data of fenghuangshan dam gauge station were considered the upstream and downstream boundaries respectively and the discharge of each tributary was considered the lateral boundary the results after a long time steady state simulation of the first boundary values were selected as the initial conditions the simulated results and the observed data of 2009 are shown in fig 10 fig 13 shows that the simulated water level agrees with the observed ones the rmse cc ce and mean absolute error mae of the water level are shown in table 4 the data demonstrate that manning s roughness distribution of the forward model is reliable 5 4 field data application the practical applicability of the inverse methodology was tested by reproducing a historical flood event during the 27th of july to 8th of august 2007 which shows that the contribution of the lateral inflow is significant the recorded discharge hydrograph of zhutuo gauge station and recorded water level data of fenghuangshan dam gauge station were considered the upstream and downstream boundaries respectively according to the gateway control of the tgr during the flood season the downstream water level is under 145 m which is the flood limit water level liu et al 2015 the discharge of each tributary was considered the lateral boundary the initial conditions were obtained from a long time steady state simulation with the first boundary values the observed water level values at the sites of cuntan qingxichang wanxian fengjie and badong and the outflow were used to inverse the unknown lateral inflow through a large repetitive calculation the observed outflow is related to the reservoir water level and operating rules of the tgr and it can be obtained through the following hydropower generation formula 36 n k q out h where n is the output power kw k is the comprehensive efficiency coefficient m2 s q out is the outflow value m3 s h is the water head m and h is the reservoir water level of the dam the observations of each gauging station and the inverse methodology results are shown in fig 14 and the optimal lateral inflow hydrograph and estimated reservoir inflow are shown in fig 15 a comparison of the observed data simulated data and inversed data is reported in fig 14 the simulated data are the results at each gauging station obtained from the forward model which neglects the lateral inflow the inversed data are the ones obtained considering the lateral inflow which are inversed by the aem in the beginning and end of the flood event 0 50 h and 200 300 h a good match between the forward model simulation results and the observed data was observed this result demonstrates that when the lateral inflow influence is negligible the forward model has great precision a gap between the forward model simulation results and observed data in 50 200 h was observed and the observed water level of gauge stations is higher than the forward model simulation results this finding shows the lateral inflow has an impact on the reservoir inflow during floods fig 14 shows that compared with the forward model simulated results the stage hydrographs reproduced by the reverse methodology are closer to the observed hydrographs the inversed lateral inflow hydrograph is an oscillating curve in which the maximum amplitude reaches 2500 m3 s fig 15 the inversed lateral inflow hydrograph is a flood wave with 60 h to peak with peak discharge of 11000 m3 s the peak discharge of the inversed reservoir inflow hydrograph is 56000 m3 s with 70 h to peak table 5 shows the performance of the inverse methodology at each gauge station the findings show that the inverse methodology improves the forecast performance fig 14a and f show that during some periods which are 100 175 h to cuntan site and 75 125 h to badong site the forward model simulated results are closer to the observed hydrograph than the estimated hydrograph this situation may be caused by two reasons one is the uniform lateral inflow assumption which hardly represents the spatial and temporal distributions of the lateral inflow the other is that measurement errors exist in the observed data in this case the number of forward model runs to obtain the optimal value was approximately 45 and the computational time was approximately 15 h on a standard personal computer inter core i5 with cpu speed of 3 30 ghz and 4 gb of ram running windows 7 6 conclusion lateral inflow is difficult to acquire due to the lack of precipitation or meteorological data the objective of this work is to invert the significant lateral inflow from the observed water level and discharge data the aem was used to find the optimal lateral inflow by minimizing the misfits between observed and simulated data two synthetic examples with different boundary conditions and known data were used to test the capabilities of the inverse methodology the results of the synthetic examples highlight the accuracy of the inverse methodology in reproducing the lateral inflow hydrograph a field case was used to evaluate the practical application performance of the inverse methodology the tgr was selected as the study area because it is a typical river channel type reservoir where the influence of the lateral inflow is significant during the flood season the results show that with the observed data only the inverse methodology can reproduce the historically significant lateral inflow in case of complicated reservoirs with irregular cross sections and different manning s roughness coefficients the aem can be used to invert the historical lateral inflow process estimate the reservoir inflow and correct and predict the lateral inflow in real time on the basis of real time dynamic monitoring data the inverse approach can invert the lateral inflow of current events and use this value to predict the reservoir inflow at the next event the results will provide reservoir managers with real time accurate and effective information on water status thus giving safeguards for safe operation of reservoirs and flood control declaration of interests none acknowledgements this work was supported by
