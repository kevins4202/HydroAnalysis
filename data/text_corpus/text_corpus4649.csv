23245,increasing autonomy efficiency and safety for remotely operated vehicles rovs is crucial for future subsea operations and requires accurate models for optimal control operations and design this involves precise modeling of the cable in conjunction with the rov response this paper presents a novel three dimensional cable model for remotely operated vehicles using euler bernoulli beam theory the presented model is implemented in matlab and takes into account the most important effects related to the response of underwater cables and rovs following beam theory bending stiffness is also included making the model applicable for low tension scenarios the presented model is modified to allow for compression of the cable the resulting non linear equations are discretized spatially by the galerkin finite element method and solved temporally by the newmark β time integration scheme the model is verified experimentally in ocean tank experiments on a real rov system a numerical example is presented and the results are compared to previous published results lastly a sensitivity analysis for the hydrodynamic parameters is presented keywords rov cable dynamics finite element dynamic modeling simulation 1 introduction today most subsea operations are performed by unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs these vehicles are typically divided into two groups autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and remotely operated vehicles rovs rovs are mostly used for inspection maintenance and repair imr due to their high payload and maneuvering capabilities whilst auvs are most often used for monitoring and mapping of the seabed due to their high speed and autonomous capabilities auvs tend to have onboard power supplies while rovs are connected to a remote unit through a cable tether rov systems usually consist of a supporting ship a cable and a rov equipped with the tools relevant for the specific mission the tether connecting the rov to the ship controller is a power and signal cable the tether imposes additional forces on the rov cable drag inertia and stiffness forces are transferred to the rov and can in some cases dominate the overall response of the rov eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 for deep and ultra deep waters a tether management system tms is applied to reduce these loads but the cable will still have a large impact on the rov response quan et al 2015 today these forces are mostly counteracted by human operators and the skills of the operator is therefore crucial for the mission success rate in the future as operations become more autonomous these forces must be counteracted by the control systems rather than a human operator accurate models of these forces is therefore crucial in the move towards autonomy estimation of the response of the rov is in addition important to ensure safe efficient and accurate underwater operations estimation of the response to counteract the environmental loads can greatly increase efficiency and safety of an operation in addition predicting the response of a rov system can be extremely beneficial during mission planning controller design or rov simulations estimating the response of the rov cable system can be performed by continuous or discrete models continuous models have the advantage of being able to accurately estimate natural frequencies transfer functions and harmonics of tethered systems very efficiently and have been utilized extensively in the investigation of towed underwater cables hover et al 1994 bliek 1984 driscoll et al 2000b there are however some critical disadvantages for continuous models when it comes to modeling cable responses for rov systems most prominently rov cables often experience low or no tension and continuous models are not valid for slack cables triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1991 linearization of the nonlinear drag forces is also required in the continuous models given that the linearized force term deviates substantially from the quadratic force given a random drag force naess and yim 1996 applicability of the models is limited modeling variations in hydrodynamic forces and cable properties over the length of the cable is a drawback as it can be difficult if not impossible to model this correctly using continuous models driscoll et al 2000a the aforementioned drawbacks are avoided using discrete models discrete models have the disadvantages of being computationally demanding and introducing numerical errors but recent years advances in computational power have made discrete models very fast and accurate discrete models have been investigated and tested extensively in previous work but most models focus on towed vehicles or tms where relative high tensions are assumed driscoll et al 2000a suggested a 1 dimensional lumped mass discrete model of a deep sea rov system tms the model was able to estimate the tension and vertical motion of the tms in addition the model was able to predict the snap loads and capture the corresponding nonlinear characteristics but was limited to 1 degree of freedom and bending forces were not included buckham et al buckham and nahon 1999 buckham et al 2000 buckham et al 2003b presented a three dimensional lumped mass model that took into account bending effects following the approach presented by burgess 1992 this model was verified experimentally by comparing the dynamic response of the cable and showed the importance of including bending stiffness for low tension tethers the model was however not verified in a real scenario where the ends of the cable can translate in all three degrees of freedom buckham et al 2003a and lambert et al 2003 furthermore proposed a lumped mass model for towed underwater vehicles where bending forces were neglected as they were assumed to be insignificant for a towed cable the model was verified using results from real sea trials and showed good agreement for most variables velocity tension and thrust buckham et al 2004 furthermore proposed a new model that took into account bending effects using cubic spline curves the model has an advantage when it comes to computational efficiency due to the low number of variables used when calculating the response the model was however not verified against other experiments or sea trials fang et al 2007 proposed a complete rov model including cable effects the model was verified experimentally and the rov response showed good correspondence between simulated and experimental results the presented model assumed in extensible cables limited to positive tension forces limitations regarding the operational domain and dimensions of the rov system is therefore of concern fang et al 2013 furthermore presented a finite element cable model using the cubic spline curve as proposed by buckham et al 2004 the cubic spline model was able to correctly simulate the steady state deflections when compared to experimental results obtained in zhu et al 2002 quan et al 2015 proposed a geometrically exact formulation for three dimensional static and dynamic analyses of deep water rov systems this model has the major advantage of including geometric nonlinearities due to large displacements which is often neglected in cable modeling the model was validated against measurements taken from a real deep water rov system although only 1 degree of freedom was considered heave the model was able to accurately calculate the response of the tms when compared to the experimental results as the model was not tested on a rov system without a tms it is difficult to determine the accuracy for low tension cables eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 proposed a finite element model using euler bernoulli beam theory for deep water rov systems the model was applied to a real rov system showing the importance of including cable effects and the relative importance of incoming current velocities when modeling rov systems the benefit of this model is the inclusion of bending stiffness the novelty of the modeling and the ability to run many types of rov scenarios such as small large cable tensions rov systems with or without tms and complex rov maneuvers eidsvik and schjølberg 2017 later applied the model to a tms and compared the model against results obtained from sea trials the model showed very good results with regards to the horizontal response of the tms the above mentioned work typically has limitations when it comes to the range of applicability the most prominent concern are the models that require the presence of positive tension in the cable for many rov operations this may not be the case as shown by buckham et al 2000 models that neglect bending forces can for low tension scenarios neglect important dynamic effects of the cable due to the large relative importance of the bending forces in low tension scenarios bending forces may have the same order of magnitude as the axial forces the cubic spline methods shows great potential but experimental validation on real systems are still needed to verify functionality this paper extends the work presented in eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 to mathematically model and simulate the dynamic response of rov systems the euler bernoulli beam theory grants good results for cases when the cable has limited curvature and should retain stability also when the tension is small the novelty of implementing beam theory is an important benefit of the presented model an algorithm for handling the buckling scenario negative tension is also introduced to extend the applicability of the model the model is hence able to simulate the dynamic response of a rov system for a wide range of rov systems maneuvers and environmental conditions the model is verified against experimental data and hydrodynamic parameter sensitivity is tested the scientific contributions of this paper can hence be divided into four main contributions development and implementation of a novel finite element rov and cable model for simulating the dynamic response of the rov system for a wide range of operations development of an experimental test procedure for rov cable systems verification of the presented model by experimental data a sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic parameters of the rov cables the article is organized as follows in sec 2 the mathematical modeling of the complete rov cable system is presented followed by a presentation of the experimental procedure in sec 3 the results from the experimental tests and numerical simulations are presented in sec 4 followed by a brief discussion on the obtained results in sec 5 lastly concluding remarks and suggestions for further work are presented in sec 6 2 modeling this section presents the mathematical formulation for the rov cable system presented in this paper the kinematic and dynamic modeling is presented along with the structure of the numerical solver used in this work 2 1 kinematics a number of reference frames are introduced in this section as illustrated in fig 1 an inertial reference frame is defined as being fixed relative to the earth and the origin is set at the surface the z axis is pointing vertically down and the x and y axes are coinciding with north and east respectively the cable system is assumed to operate in a local reference frame with approximate constant latitude and longitude this is usually referred to as flat earth navigation and newton s law still applies fossen 2011 moreover a set of local reference frames are fixed relative to the orientation of each finite element of the cable hence n cable element reference frames are created combined with the two local frames of the rov and surface ship this adds up to a total of n 2 local reference frames the orientation of the i t h local frame is defined by a ϕ θ ψ euler angle set following sname notation sname 1950 where ϕ θ ψ are the rotations around x y and z axes respectively the use of euler angles introduces singularities in the angular transformation matrix for the cable singular points are avoided since the torsional degree of freedom is neglected hence there are only two angular rotations in the local reference frames the rov will most likely not experience pitch angles of 90 d e g due to the relative large hydrostatic restoring in roll and pitch unless for extreme cases for underwater flight vehicles which have very limited hydrostatic restoring 90 d e g rotations around the horizontal axes can easily occur and must be accounted for the singularity in the angular transformation can in these cases be avoided by introducing a new euler angle representation with different singularities and the singular points can be avoided by switching between them the orthogonal transformation from the i t h local frame to the inertial frame becomes 1 r i g b c ψ c θ s ψ c ϕ c ψ s θ s ϕ s ψ s ϕ c ψ c ϕ s θ s i n ψ c θ c ψ c ϕ s ϕ s θ s ψ c ψ s ϕ s θ s ψ c ϕ s θ c θ s ϕ c θ c ϕ 2 2 equations of motion to create a numerical model for a cable which includes bending axial and inertial forces a set of dynamic equations of motion are developed euler bernoulli beam theory has been extensively utilized in structural problems and has proven to give good results in cases where the beam cross sections do not deform significantly it is assumed that deep sea umbilical cables usually have a significant length to width ratio with a limited curvature due to the large vertical distance the euler bernoulli beam equations therefore represents the dynamics of the cable with satisfactory accuracy as shown in eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 the governing equations in the local frame can be written 2 e a 2 u x 2 m 2 u t 2 f x x 3 2 x 2 e i z 2 v x 2 m c a a ρ 2 v t 2 f y x 4 2 x 2 e i y 2 w x 2 m c a a ρ 2 w t 2 f z x where f n x is the external force in n direction as a function of the longitudinal position x e is the young s module of the cable u v w are the deflections in the x y and z direction respectively a is the cross section area i is the 2nd moment of inertia c a is the added mass coefficient of a circular cylinder morison et al 1950 ρ is the density of water and m is the mass of the cable per unit length the longitudinal added mass hydrodynamic mass has been omitted from eq 2 as it is orders of magnitude smaller than the transverse added mass for length to width ratios applicable to a deep sea rov cable length to width ratios typically above 10 4 for large length to width ratios the flexural moments of the cable become very limited and the inclusion of the these moments can be argued as they will have a negligible effect on the overall response however for the case of small or zero tension forces the flexural moments can become of importance as observed in buckham et al buckham and nahon 1999 buckham et al 2000 buckham et al 2003b the bending stiffness is important for low tension cases not because the curvatures are exceptionally large but rather due to a lack of other forces hover 1997 low or zero tension may be restricted to a finite area or may span the entire length of the cable the equations of motion for perfectly flexible cables become singular when the tension vanishes chen et al 2014 this singular behavior is avoided by the inclusion of bending stiffness burgess 1993 for small and medium sized rov systems cables having a more or less neutral submerged weight are often used hence low or zero tension scenarios are not unrealistic in these low tension scenarios the cable has very little impact on the rov response however it is still important to model the response of the cable correctly in these scenarios this because the response at a given time instance will affect the response at a later time for cables with small length to width ratios the flexural moments become more important due to limitations in testing facilities smaller length to width ratios might be used in experimental testing and verification of rov cables in these cases bending stiffness should be included as the flexural moments in these cases may become significant it is practical to write eqs 2 4 in the weak form as the weak form creates the basis for the finite element approach 5 e a u x g 0 l 0 l m 2 u t 2 g e a g x u x f x x g d x 0 6 e i z 3 v x 3 g 0 l e i z 2 v x 2 g x 0 l 0 l e i z 2 v x 2 2 g x 2 m c a a ρ 2 v t 2 g f y x g d x 0 7 e i

degrees of freedom the governing equations in the local body fixed reference frame for the rov in 6 dof can be found in fossen 2011 for the sensitivity analysis and experimental verification performed in this work the dynamic equations of motion for the rov are not used as the accuracy of the cable modeling is of interest rather than the accuracy of the rov model the rov response is in these cases treated as a predetermined input 2 3 external forces the external forces on the cable consists of added mass and drag forces combined with hydrostatic buoyancy forces wave induced forces can generally be neglected as the water particle velocity in waves die out with a factor of e k z in deep waters where k is the wave number and z is the vertical position relative to the mean surface the wave induced forces will therefore only affect a small portion of the cable the wave forces will however have a large influence on the response of the surface ship and will therefore be included in the boundary conditions of the cable the external forces f n for a given cable cross section can be written as 8 d d x f n x ρ c a n a v n t 1 2 ρ c d n d v n v n where ρ is the density of sea water c a n is the added mass coefficient in the local n direction v n is the relative fluid velocity in the local n direction d is the diameter of the cable a is the area of the cable cross section and c d n is the drag coefficient in the n direction this equation is known as the morison equation morison et al 1950 the equation consists of two coefficients in each degree of freedom c a and c d which are often estimated analytically experimentally or numerically since the cable has a dominating dimension longitudinal much larger than the two others transverse strip theory is valid the first term in eq 8 inertia term was already included on the left side in the governing equations as can be seen in eqs 3 and 4 the coefficients for circular cylinders are very well studied and accurate estimates are available in literature however both the added mass and drag coefficients vary with the flow conditions and can in many cases not be treated as constants the added mass coefficients are highly affected by the kc number in an oscillatory flow oscillatory flow conditions might occur in the presence of waves or when the cable experiences vortex induced vibration likewise the drag coefficient is affected by kc number upstream flow conditions and inflow velocity the keulegan carpenter kc number is a dimensionless quantity describing the relative importance of the drag forces over the inertia forces and is defined as 9 k c v t l where v is the amplitude of the flow velocity oscillation t is the period of oscillation and l is the diameter of the cylinder faltinsen 1999 some assumptions can be made when defining these coefficients to greatly reduce the problem of estimating the numerical values the following assumptions are therefore applied assumption 2 1 the oscillatory dependence of drag and added mass coefficients can be neglected based on the facts that waves will only affect a small part of the cable and the vortex shedding frequency will be much larger than the natural frequency for relevant cable dimensions assumption 2 2 the transverse velocity component will be dominating since the cable is positioned approximately vertical the interaction between the transverse and longitudinal velocity components can therefore be neglected due to the large relative inflow angle cross flow principle is therefore valid based on assumption 2 1 and 2 2 the added mass forces can be represented by a single constant furthermore the drag forces can be represented by a drag coefficient only dependent on the inflow velocity in both the transverse and the longitudinal directions the drag term in eq 8 can for the translatory degrees of freedom be written as 10 d d x f x x 1 2 ρ c t π d u r u r 11 d d x f y x 1 2 ρ c d d v r v r 12 d d x f z x 1 2 ρ c d d w r w r where c t is the tangential drag coefficient of a flat plate c d is the normal drag coefficient of a circular cylinder u v w is the cable deflection along x y and z axes respectively and u r v r w r is the relative inflow velocity along x y and z axes respectively i e 13 u r v r w r u v w u c v c w c where u v w is the translational velocity of the cable and u c v c w c is the current velocity the hydrostatic buoyancy and gravity forces b z can be can be written in the inertial reference frame as 14 b z m ρ a g l where m is the mass of a unit length of the cable ρ is the density of water a is the cross section area g is the constant of gravity and l is the complete submerged length of the cable for many rov systems the cable is designed close to neutrally buoyant to remove the negative buoyancy force the rigid body motion of the rov is the boundary condition for the cable which means the cable response is calculated based on the rov position likewise the rov response is calculated based on the cable tension hence a cross coupling between the two dynamic systems is created the tension forces in the cable are hence added as external forces acting on the rov 15 f r o v r n r o v t c where r n r o v is the rotation matrix from the last element to the rov and t c is the tension force in the last cable element 2 4 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations for the cable eqs 5 7 a complete set of both boundary and initial conditions must be determined the response of the cable ends are given by the connections to the surface ship and the rov see fig 1 denoted top and bottom ends for a beam element in three dimensional space a total of six boundary conditions must be determined at each end three deflections and three rotations this number is reduced to five by neglecting the torsional rotation rotation around the local x axis the torsional degree of freedom is neglected based on the following assumption assumption 2 3 the top and bottom ends of the cable are assumed to rotate freely independent of the surface ship and rov motions as no external forces acts in the torsional degree of freedom it is therefore reasonable to omit it the remaining 10 boundary conditions are determined as follows the translational positions of the two cable ends are assumed to be equal to the position of the surface ship and the rov the curvature of the cable at the ends are assumed to be zero the curvature at the top and bottom end of the cable is assumed to be zero as rovs are usually installed with a small wire or rotating mechanism connecting the rov and the cable to absorb the tension forces this is done to minimize the cable loads acting on the connection between the cable and the rov the wire is only able to absorb tension forces and provides minimal flexural moment the configuration on the top end can vary based on equipment and operation often a crane or winch is used to hold the rov cable during operations the resistance to bending at the top end can therefore depend on the equipment used but it is reasonable to assume that a simple support zero curvature at the top end should be sufficient as the flexural moment should in any case be negligible the top and bottom boundary conditions are 16 u 0 u s h i p v 0 v s h i p w 0 w s h i p 2 v 0 x 2 0 2 w 0 x 2 0 u l u r o v v l v r o v w l w r o v 2 v l x 2 0 2 w l x 2 0 where u 0 v 0 w 0 are the deflections of the top end u l v l w l are the deflections of the bottom end of the cable u s h i p v s h i p w s h i p is the position of the ship and u r o v v r o v w r o v is the position of the rov 2 5 finite element discretization this section presents the finite element discretization of the governing equations eqs 5 7 that creates the basis for the developed simulation tool which is implemented in matlab firstly the three dimensional beam elements are presented the galerkin approach is then used to equate the weight function in the weak formulation followed by a presentation of the element stiffness and mass matrices respectively the proportional damping is introduced also the external forces on each element are calculated followed lastly by the presentation of the discrete equations based on the preceding modeling this section contains a large number of notations and some general notation rules are used to make the equations more understandable the notation used in this section is as follows superscript i denotes element number i subscript i denotes node number i bold capital letters denote matrix it is assumed the cable is divided into a finite number of equal length elements as indicated in fig 2 each element has 5 degrees of freedom which results in 10 unknown states 6 deflections and 4 rotations the deflections are denoted u v and w for the x y and z directions respectively and the rotations are denoted θ y and θ z for rotations about the y and z axes respectively eqs 5 7 are written elementwise 17 0 l m 2 u t 2 g e a g x u x f x x g d x 0 18 0 l e i z 2 v x 2 2 g x 2 m c a a ρ 2 v t 2 g f y x g d x 0 19 0 l e i y 2 w x 2 2 g x 2 m c a a ρ 2 w t 2 g f z x g d x 0 where l is the element length following the galerkin method a set of suitable shape functions are found hughes 2000 that is the weight function g x is substituted with the approximating functions n i it is necessary to assure compatibility between adjacent elements with respect to deflections and slopes hence the approximating functions must be chosen such that the functions and their derivatives are continuous at the element ends the approximation for the total displacement u x for each element can be written as a superposition of the nodal displacements by combining eq 17 19 20 u x n 1 x u 1 n 2 x u 2 n 3 x v 1 w 1 n 4 x θ y 1 θ z 1 n 5 x v 2 w 2 n 6 x θ y 2 θ z 2 where n are the 6 shape functions following the galerkin fem here n 1 and n 2 are linear as eq 17 contains a first order derivative 21 n 1 1 x l n 2 x l n 3 to n 6 are the shape functions of eqs 18 and 19 which is of third order 22 n 3 1 3 x l 2 2 x l 3 n 4 x 1 x l 2 n 5 3 x l 2 2 x l 3 n 6 x x l 2 x l eqs 18 and 19 have identical shapes but are orthogonal to each other the corresponding shape functions are therefore identical obtaining the discretizised form of eq 6 therefore yields the discretized form of eq 7 as well note that the shape functions n 1 to n 6 satisfies the continuity requirement of the deflections and the slopes at the element ends x 0 and x l eq 20 can be written in a more compact form 23 u x n x r where n is the matrix of shape functions and r is the vector of nodal displacements defined as 24 r u 1 v 1 w 1 θ y 1 θ z 1 u 2 v 2 w 2 θ y 2 θ z 2 the stiffness matrix for the beam elements can be calculated from eq 17 19 using the presented shape functions this derivation can be found in standard finite element literature cook et al 1989 and the derivation will hence not be presented in this work the three equations produces three stiffness matrices as mentioned earlier 6 and 7 produces the same result as they have identical shapes but are orthogonal e q 5 e a l 1 1 1 1 e q 6 e i z l 3 12 6 l 12 6 l 6 l 4 l 2 6 l 2 l 2 12 6 l 2 12 6 l 6 l 2 l 2 6 l

these matrices according to eq 20 the element stiffness matrix can be written as k e e a l 0 0 0 0 e a l 0 0 0 0 0 12 e i z l 3 0 0 6 e i z l 2 0 12 e i z l 3 0 0 6 e i z l 2 0 0 12 e i y l 3 6 e i y

0 4 e i z l where i y and i z are the 2nd moments of inertia with respect to the y and z axes respectively i y and i z are identical for a body with radial symmetry and l is the element length in the matrix representation k m n is the stiffness force in m dof due to a deflection in n dof hence by multiplying the stiffness matrix k e with the deflection vector r the stiffness forces of each element are found the mass matrix for the beam elements is generated using particle lumping rather than using the galerkin approach as was done with the stiffness matrix by lumped mass it is meant that the mass terms in eq 17 19 are split between each element boundary i e at x 0 and x l half the mass is therefore applied to each node of the element by this approach the mass matrix becomes diagonal as no coupling between the different degrees of freedom occur other methods such as consistent or combination mass matrices would not result in a diagonal mass matrix due to the fact that for each time step the mass matrix must be inverted a diagonal matrix is desirable to greatly reduce the computation time it has been proven in literature that lumped mass approximation is consistent with the dynamics of an actual highly flexible cable huang 1994 and a lumped mass approach has accuracy equivalent to that of more complex methods kamman and huston 1999 zhu et al 2008 also showed that the lumped mass parameter model is an effective tool to simulate nonlinear coupled movement of a multi body systems such as rov cages for the lumped mass matrix to be nonsingular rotary inertia must be included and this is done by including the term m e α l 2 the element mass matrix can then be written as vector of diagonal elements m e l m e 2 m e ρ c a a 2 m e ρ c a a 2 m e α l m e α l m e 2 m e ρ c a a 2 m e ρ c a a 2 m e α l m e α l d where m e is the mass pr unit length the added mass is included for transverse translations but neglected for rotational and longitudinal degrees of freedom the added mass coefficient c a for a circular cylinder can be found analytically and is exactly 1 for non oscillating flow the factor α should ideally be negative or zero since the translational end node masses m e 2 greatly overestimates the angular momentum of the element however under the requirement of positive elements in the mass matrix α is determined ad hoc by calculating the associated mass moment of inertia of a slender bar with length l 2 25 i b a r m 2 l 2 2 3 α 1 24 the damping of the cable is mainly governed by the hydrodynamic drag forces this because the drag force is given by the current relative velocity and will therefore act either as a damping force or as a driving force however it is desirable to include some form of structural damping of the cable to ensure numerical stability in this work linear proportional damping is used the main reason for this choice is that the damping model has been utilized extensively in engineering and it s easy to incorporate as it is calculated from the already obtained stiffness and mass matrices the proportional damping for each element can hence be written as hughes 2000 26 c e α 1 k e α 2 m e where c e is the proportional damping matrix for an element α 1 and α 2 are the stiffness and mass proportional damping coefficients respectively usually chosen to be in the range of 0 5 depending on the natural frequencies for marine structures that undergo large rigid body motions the mass proportional damping term is usually neglected as it would give damping to the rigid body motions which is undesirable dnv 2010 as rov cables in many cases undergo large rigid body motions the mass term should be zero α 2 0 the hydrodynamic drag forces on the cable are discretized by writing eq 10 12 as sums of the mean drag force of each element 27 f x i 1 2 ρ c t π d u r i u r i l i f y i 1 2 ρ c d d v r i v r i l i f z i 1 2 ρ c d d w r i w r i l i where u r i v r i and w r i are the current relative element velocity components of element i expressed in the local reference frame l i is the length of element i and f n i is the hydrodynamic force on element i in the local n dof the current relative element velocity components are estimated by taking the average of the two nodal velocities at each element end the element drag force vector is then calculated by lumping the drag force of each element at the ends a disadvantage of this model is the fact that an element simply rotating in resting fluid will experience a zero average velocity of the end nodes and the resulting drag force will become zero the buoyancy force is discretized in the same manner and it is expressed in the inertial reference frame 28 b z i m e i ρ a g l i where b z i is the buoyancy force on element i in the inertial frame and m e i is the mass of element i the element buoyancy force vector is also calculated by lumping the element force between the two element nodes 2 6 global matrix assembly in the previous section all the internal and external element matrices for the cable were calculated by assembling the element matrices the global system of equations can be calculated following the finite element approach by superposing entries from coincident nodes the global matrices can be found that is 29 k i j g e 1 n k i j e m i j g e 1 n m i j e c i j g e 1 n c i j e f d i j g e 1 n f d i j e b i j g e 1 n b i j e the complete matrix system for the global system of equations can then be written 30 r g b m g r g b t r r g b k g r g b t r r g b c g r g b t r r g b f d g b g where m g is the global mass matrix expressed in the local reference frames r is the vector of nodal accelerations k g is the global stiffness matrix expressed in the local reference frames r g b is the global transformation matrix r g b t is the transformed global transformation matrix c g is the global structural damping matrix expressed in the local reference frames f d g is the global hydrodynamic drag force vector expressed in the local reference frames and b g is the global buoyancy force vector expressed in the inertial reference frame 2 7 floating frame of reference formulation the global assembly presented in the previous section grants the deflection for an elastic beam using linear finite elements as the rov i e the bottom end of the cable is able to move the equilibrium position of the cable therefore varies in time therefore a nonlinear model must be used to calculate the stiffness forces given the new equilibrium position this is done by introducing a floating frame of reference ffr formulation using a ffr formulation the displacement vector r can be rewritten as the sum of the elastic displacement and the rigid body displacement of the undeformed cable 31 r r 0 r e l a s t i c where r 0 and r e l a s t i c are the rigid body and elastic displacements of the cable respectively eq 31 can be rewritten in a more convenient form 32 r e l a s t i c r r 0 for the scenarios presented in this work the surface ship is assumed to be stationary during rov operations hence the top end of the cable is assumed fixed the undeformed cable r 0 will therefore only rotate about the top end the elastic deflection r e l a s t i c is used to calculate the tension forces on the rov the elastic tension forces will in turn produce a given response of the rov the response of the rov is used to calculate the rigid body deflection r 0 r 0 is calculated by assuming a straight cable undeformed going from the top end through the connection point of the rov having a length equal the undeformed length of the cable by inserting the expression for r e l a s t i c from eq 32 into the stiffness term in eq 30 the system of equations for the dynamic response of the cable can be found 33 r g b m g r g b t r r g b k g r g b t r r 0 r g b c g r g b t r r g b f d g b g 2 8 initial conditions the initial conditions of the cable depend on the given scenario and must be determined accordingly for simplicity the cable is assumed to be positioned strictly vertical following the finite element approach this translates to positioning all nodal points of the cable vertically the initial conditions for each cable node i hence become in the local reference frame 34 u i 0 v i 0 w i 0 f o r i 1 n 1 2 9 hydrodynamic parameters the hydrodynamic parameters related to the cable are the three coefficients c t c d and c a eqs 5 7 these are the tangential and normal drag coefficients and the added mass coefficient respectively as the cable is assumed to be a circular cylinder operating in a turbulent flow regime the drag coefficients can be determined based on experimental data for circular cylinders and application of the cross flow principle the tangential drag coefficient is estimated using the approximate estimates for a smooth flat plate in turbulent flow conditions schlichting 1979 for the region of relevant reynolds numbers u l ν an approximate value of c t 0 02 is used the normal drag coefficient is more important as the normal drag force will dominate the hydrodynamic loads due to the vertical orientation of the cable the normal drag coefficient c d is given as a function of the normal inflow velocity of each cable element rather than a constant value the reynolds dependent drag coefficients for a circular cylinder are taken from table 10 18 in blevins 2003 as stated in sec 2 5 the normal added mass coefficient c a can be calculated analytically and is exactly 1 tangential added mass is neglected since it is orders of magnitude smaller than the normal coefficient for relevant cable length to width ratios 2 10 compression in real rov operations compression of the cable due to vertical rov motion is a likely scenario the numerical solver should therefore be able to calculate the response when the cable is subjected to compression forces due to the large length to width ratio of the cable the static buckling load compression load is approximately zero the critical buckling load for a slender beam can be written as timoshenko and gere 1989 35 p c r i t π 2 e i l 2 0 where p c r i t is the critical buckling load i e that maximum compression load before the beam will buckle e i is the flexural rigidity and l is the length of the cable hence when the rov produces a load on the cable in the positive vertical direction the cable will buckle the buckling is modeled by introducing a new equilibrium position i e undeformed position vector when calculating the stiffness forces by equilibrium position vector is meant the position vector where the stiffness forces are zero this new equilibrium position is denoted r ˆ 0 and will satisfy four main requirements the element lengths and overall length of the cable is conserved the vertical position of the top and bottom nodes are equal to the vertical position of the surface ship and the rov respectively the cable will buckle in the same direction as already existing deflections the vertical translation of the new r ˆ 0 nodes will be reduced linearly from the bottom end to the top end a generic algorithm for calculating the r ˆ 0 terms for node i can based on these requirements be found note that subscript denotes node number and superscript denotes element number 36a z ˆ i z i δ z r o v i 1 n 36b x ˆ i x i x ˆ i 1 z ˆ i 1 z ˆ i t a n α i c o s β i 36c y ˆ i y i y ˆ i 1 z ˆ i 1 z ˆ i t a n α i s i n β i 36d α i a c o s z ˆ i 1 z ˆ i l i s i g n θ i where x ˆ i y ˆ i z ˆ i is the buckled position r ˆ 0 of node i x i y i z i is the original position r 0 of node i δ z r o v is the vertical position of the rov relative to r 0 n is the number of elements α i is the angle between r 0 and r ˆ 0 of element i β i is the angle between inertial reference frame x axis and the horizontal orientation of element i θ i is the relative angle between r and r 0 of element i and l is the initial element length note that the equations are given in the inertial reference frame hence z is the vertical axis and x y is the horizontal plane in fig 3 a sketch of a buckling scenario displaying the quantities used in eqs 36a and 36d is shown fig 3a shows the scenario for the entire cable while the same scenario is shown for only the last two cable elements in fig 3b 2 11 numerical solver the dynamic problems given in eq 33 are solved in the spatial domain by inverting the mass matrix to solve the equations in the time domain direct time integration using the newmark β method is performed the newmark β method is an implicit method where stability limits depend on the parameters used the newmark β integral equations can be written as huebner et al 2001 37 r t 1 r t 1 λ t r t λ t r t 1 r t 1 r t t r t 1 2 β t 2 r t β t 2 r t 1 where r t is the displacement vector of the previous time step λ and β are free parameters and t is the time increment setting β to 0 25 gives the trapezoidal method of integration which is unconditionally stable λ is set to 0 5 which gives no artificial damping this might become problematic as high frequency noise can be beneficial to remove however introducing artificial damping will damp the solution and is not introduced the following sequence of calculations produces the next state of the coupled system position velocity and acceleration of time step t 1 1 transformation matrix r g b from local reference frames to the inertial reference frame 2 global matrices m g k g c g b g and f d are calculated and transformed to the inertial reference frame 3 eq 30 are solved with respect to the cable acceleration r 4 nodal velocities r and positions r are calculated from eq 37 5 eq 15 is used to calculate the rov tension forces 6 drag thrust inputs and hydrostatic restoring are calculated using rov position and velocity from previous time step 7 the rov acceleration is calculated 8 rov position and velocity is calculated using eq 37 9 surface ship and rov position is used as boundary conditions in the next iteration step where surface ship position is taken as a predetermined input the flowchart of the solver is shown in fig 4 3 experimental validation this section describes the experimental setup employed for the validation of the presented cable model the experiment was performed in laboceano located at universidade federal do rio de janeiro ufrj brazil the tank dimensions are 30 m wide 45 m long and 15 m deep the tank also includes a 5 m wide pit with an additional depth of 10 m 3 1 experimental setup the experimental setup consisted of the following components bluerov 2 remotely operated vehicle with tether produced by bluerobotics neutrally buoyant tether with diameter of 7 6 mm qualisys motion capture system with a total of 6 cameras mounted vertically from 9 to 15 m water depth acoustic underwater positioning system from waterlinked as tension load cell produced by hottinger baldwin messtechnik gmbh the key parameters of the bluerov 2 is shown in table 1 the mass of the rov is approximately 10 kg and it is neutrally buoyant in water the qualisys system requires that minimum two cameras have vision on a marker to determine its position the maximum domain possible to cover with 6 cameras is therefore limited the approximate domain where the qualisys system is able to properly find a marker in space is a vertical cylinder 12 m high and a diameter of 7 m the cable is marked with retro reflective markers about every 1 m as shown in fig 5 the position of the rov is recorded using the waterlinked underwater positioning system utilizing 4 transponders mounted on the rov in addition to the qualisys positioning this is done simply to have redundancy in the rov positioning the tension load cell is positioned on the intersection between the rov and the cable and all forces applied to the rov from the cable will therefore be registered by the load cell the load cell is furthermore synchronized with the qualisys positioning system and both run at 60 hz the 4 transponders and the load cell each require one cable to transfer the signals these additional cables are twisted around the rov tether which change the characteristics of the tether quite significantly most prominently the weight and diameter of the cable but also the flexural rigidity and drag coefficients the axial stiffness is not expected to be affected much by the additional cables this is because the two cable ends are only connected using the rov tether and the tether is able to translate in the axial direction with very limited resistance from the other cables the cable specifications for the experimental setup are shown in table 2 the test setup is shown in fig 5 3 2 test procedure the experiments are performed at constant water depth and the depth of the rov is automatically controlled using a pressure sensor and a pd controller the depth is kept approximately constant to simulate a vertical tether and also to ease the localization of the reflective markers the surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom are controlled using a joystick note that bluerov 2 does not have actuation in roll and pitch the experiments are divided into two different cases of rov motion experiment 1 straight line back and forth experiment 2 straight line sideways for each experiment time series of the load cell force cable position and rov position are recorded at 60 hz the experiments are run for approximately 5 min and the rov is kept at rest for 5 min between each experiment to allow the cable to untwine it should be noted that the position of each qualisys marker is not recorded for all time steps as the position of the markers tend to fall in and out of sight of the qualisys cameras this problem is occurring more frequently near the edges of the domain covered by the cameras the position velocity and acceleration for the markers are therefore interpolated to create continuous inputs to the simulations thus some errors are present in the input signals 4 results this section presents the experimental and simulated numerical results from of the trials conducted at laboceano two experiments were performed and compared with the results from simulations of same motion in sec 4 2 a verification test against already published results is presented before a sensitivity analysis is performed on the most important hydrodynamic parameters of the cable in sec 4 3 4 1 experimental verification 4 1 1 experiment 1 the first experiment was performed simply by driving the rov forwards and backwards on constant depth the path of the rov recorded by the qualisys motion capture system can be seen in fig 6 a and the recorded tension force obtained from the load cell for the same experiment can be seen in fig 6b the recorded cable position is shown for 7 different time instances in fig 6c and d the simulations are performed using the recorded rov position fig 6a as a predetermined input the response of the rov is hence not simulated this is done to remove uncertainties in the rov modeling from the experiment in addition no thruster data was recorded hence simulating the rov response would not have been possible the simulated results for experiment 1 is shown in fig 7 from fig 7a it can clearly be seen that the simulator is able to predict the bottom tension in the cable with fairly good accuracy the root mean square deviation rmsd between the simulated and experimental tension force is 7 21 n the simulated tension is overpredicted during peaks the reason for the overprediction is most likely due to the fact that the interconnection between the rov and the load cell had an initial slack hence the rov was able to move about 2 cm before the load cell was exposed to tension forces this initial slack was not accounted for in the simulations due to the complexity in modeling it the deflections are predicted accurately fig 7c and d for the case where the tension of the cable is significant i e at t 175 s for the case where the tension is low t 30 s the deflection is poorly estimated the nature of a slack cable is chaotic and is therefore difficult to reproduce in the dynamic simulations since the cable in addition had an initial slack the low tension scenario becomes almost impossible to reproduce in the simulation 4 1 2 experiment 2 the second experiment was performed similarly to the first experiment but now the horizontal motion of the rov is mainly in the y direction the rov path recorded by the qualisys motion capture system for this experiment can be seen in fig 8 a and the tension force obtained from the load cell is shown in fig 8b the recorded cable deflection for 7 different time instances is shown in fig 8c and d for x and y direction respectively the simulated results for experiment 2 is shown in fig 9 from fig 9a it can clearly be seen that the simulator is able to predict the bottom tension of the cable with fairly good accuracy the rmsd is 7 26 n which is significant when taking into account the small tension force the simulated tension force is however still in the correct range and taking into account the large uncertainties in the experimental procedure a rmsd of 7 26 n is acceptable the simulated tension is again slightly overpredicted as it was in experiment 1 this is also most likely due to an initial slack in the cable which was not accounted for in the simulations the deflections are also predicted accurately fig 9c and d again it can be noticed that during the low tension case t 53 s the deflection is poorly estimated with a difference of about 0 5 m but for the tension case t 289 s the accuracy is better this coincides good with the observations made in experiment 1 some additional differences between the simulated and experimental deflections can be observed in fig 9c and d especially the deflections in the x direction after 53 s it seems as if the stiffness of the simulated cable is too large compared to the experimental measurement whilst at 113 s the simulated cable looks as if the stiffness is too small this inconsistency most likely comes as a result of the interpolation of the cable measurements the raw data plot from experiment 2 can be seen in fig 10 and it clearly shows that jumps in the position measurements occur this happens when the qualisys automatic identification of markers aim model is unable to separate two markers or is unable to detect one or more markers this tendency is more prominent for the markers closer to the rov 1 and 2 than for the markers higher up on the cable 4 and 5 the reason for this is that the markers closer to the rov experiences larger motions than the markers higher up on the cable which makes them harder for qualisys to follow and identify the uncertainty in the experimental cable deflection is therefore big and should be taken into account when evaluating the results 4 2 comparison with published results a numerical comparison with the results from the static deflection analysis performed in quan et al 2015 is done for the tether management system described in the reference using 3000 and 5000 m cable lengths the simulations yield a root mean square deviation of 4 67 m at 3000 m cable length and 0 79 m at 5000 m cable length which is about 0 16 and 0 016 of the cable length the static horizontal deflection from the proposed model is therefore very similar to the model presented by quan et al 2015 the results from the static deflection simulations are shown in fig 11 4 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic parameters is performed by varying one parameter while keeping all other variables fixed the parameters varied are the transverse added mass and transverse drag coefficients the tests are performed by giving the rov a desired path the response of the rov is taken as a predetermined input since identical rov response for all cases is needed to compare the results the rov response is therefore kept identical to the desired path for all cases in this study the rov system used is the bluerov the elasticity module of the cable is set to 1 gpa and no environmental forces are applied in this study the desired rov path is shown in fig 12 4 3 1 added mass the added mass analysis is performed using the reynolds dependent drag coefficient as discussed in sec 2 3 the results from the sensitivity analysis is shown in fig 13 a it can be seen that the added mass coefficient has no impact on the bottom tension the importance of modeling the added mass coefficient correctly is therefore limited however large oscillations in the tension can be seen for the smallest added mass coefficients this is numerical instability which comes as a result of having less inertia forces on the cable the added mass can therefore remove numerical instabilities if required note that all simulations were performed using the same step sizes to ensure comparability the oscillations could therefore have been removed by decreasing the step size for the smallest added mass coefficients in fig 13b it can be noticed that doubling the added mass coefficient results in only 0 2 peak tension increase which is negligible the prescribed rov path contains very limited accelerations hence it is not surprising that the sensitivity of the added mass coefficient is small for a rov response with larger accelerations the sensitivity of the added mass coefficient would be larger 4 3 2 drag the results from the sensitivity analysis performed on the drag coefficient is shown in fig 14 from fig 14a it can be seen that the drag coefficient has similarly to the added mass very limited effect on the cable forces transferred to the rov in the performed simulation a horizontal peak velocity of 0 64 m s is accomplished during the initial phase 0 40 s which is about 50 of the top speed of the bluerov 2 yet the difference between a drag coefficient of 0 5 and 2 results in a cable peak tension increase of only 8 5 on the rov the difference between the reynolds dependent drag coefficient and the typical drag coefficient of c d 1 is also negligible about 0 2 hence the drag force can easily be represented by a single constant rather than using more complex methods the reason for this is that during the simulations the cable experiences a limited range of reynolds numbers and in this range the reynolds dependent drag coefficient is close to 1 for larger cables or larger range of relative velocities the difference between a reynolds dependent drag coefficient and a constant drag coefficient could be more prominent 5 discussion the overall goal of the experiments were to verify the mathematical cable model implemented in matlab in the following the obtained results are discussed 5 1 experimental validation comparing the experimental results with the numerical simulations some important characteristics were observed the cable tensions measured at the rov end during the experiment were similar in magnitude to the numerical simulations with a root mean square deviation of about 7 n the tension peaks were also similar although the numerical simulations gave higher tension peaks than the experimental results the difference in tension peaks was explained as initial slack in the cable but a number of other possible error sources are present in addition to potential errors in the modeling most of these error sources result from experimental measurement errors due to the small scale of the experiment the measured cable tension is of small magnitude hence the accuracy of the load cell may impact the results significantly the load cell was calibrated and the drift over time was found to be minimal the accuracy of the load cell is however unknown and could therefore affect the results the qualisys motion capture system was not always able to distinguish between the markers hence the rov and cable response had many jumps in the recorded data most of these jumps were removed by smoothing the data and removing outliers but removing all inconsistencies was not possible it is therefore expected to be some differences between the load cell measurements which is a scalar value and the three dimensional cable and rov position recorded by qualisys this error can most likely explain why som tension peaks are underpredicted or not present at all in the experimental results compared to the numerical simulations other possible sources of error are the cable properties the module of elasticity of 0 16 gpa was used based on the experimental results obtained by buckham et al 2000 the cable applied in this experiment could deviate from the cable used in the reference but the module of elasticity should be in the correct range the cable tension measured is directly linked to the module of elasticity the module can therefore be modified to obtain better correspondence between the experimental results and the numerical simulations the cable used in the experiment was in addition not completely circular since it was constructed by one center cable and four surrounding transponder cable the hydrodynamic drag coefficient in the experiment would therefore be different than the assumed cylinder drag coefficient however as observed in sec 4 3 this would not result in any noticeable difference in the cable tension and could therefore be ignored for the cable deflections a better agreement between the simulated and the experimental data were observed when the cable was subjected to tension forces this was not surprising as in the low tension scenario the cable response becomes chaotic and difficult to replicate in a dynamic simulation 5 2 published results when comparing the steady horizontal deflection of a tms rov system with the results obtained in quan et al 2015 using a geometrical exact formulation it was observed that the deflections corresponded very well the root mean square deviation between the presented model and quan et al 2015 was only 4 67 m and 0 79 m for the 3000 m and 5000 m scenarios respectively which showed that the presented model was able to simulate the horizontal steady state tms rov response with good accuracy as a tms rov system is the ideal system to model using beam equations this was expected the large tension in the cable significantly reduces the curvature and the beam equations will therefore perform well as the key assumption in beam theory is satisfied this confirms the findings obtained in eidsvik and schjølberg 2017 where the presented model was used to simulate the dynamic response of a tms 5 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis performed in sec 4 3 yielded interesting results the cable tension acting on the rov did not vary with the added mass of the cable the accelerations of the cable were very limited due to the path of the rov and it can therefore be expected that in cases where the rov has larger accelerations the sensitivity of the added mass coefficient becomes more prominent one interesting observation made in fig 13b is that increasing the added mass actually reduced the tension peaks slightly this observation most likely comes from numerical instabilities in the simulations a higher added mass will increase the inertia of the cable and hence reduce the oscillations of the cable this can also be noticed in fig 13a where c a 0 8 and c a 0 5 shows instabilities due to small amount of inertia resulting from the small added mass coefficient these oscillations could have been removed by reducing the step size or increasing the proportional damping but was not done to keep all variables in the simulations identical for the effect of the drag coefficient the results were more as expected the drag coefficient did for the presented scenario affect the peak tension as well as the overall tension acting on the rov however the effect was also here limited a doubling of the drag coefficient only resulted in a peak tension increase of 7 which is less then expected this shows that for the maneuver performed in the sensitivity analysis the cable stiffness was the most important parameter since the hydrodynamic parameters were of small importance and the cable mass was identical to the added mass using a cable with smaller module of elasticity less than 1 gpa could therefore give a higher relative importance of the hydrodynamic parameters to conclude the discussion it can be said that for the presented rov system and maneuver performed the hydrodynamic parameters have little effect on the rov response a more extensive sensitivity analysis could be performed where different rov systems and maneuvers are investigated this can produce more general results which will be interesting for further research 6 conclusions a novel three dimensional rov cable model is presented the cable is represented using euler bernoulli beam theory which is modified to allow for compression of the cable the spacial discretization is performed using linear finite element theory combined with a floating frame of reference formulation and the resulting discrete equations are solved using the newmark β time integration scheme the model is verified experimentally and the calculated deflections and tension forces show good agreement with the experimental results some differences between the simulated and experimental results are present but taking into account the relative large uncertainties present in the small scale experiment performed a major part of this difference can be attributed to experimental measurement errors the model is able to estimate the tension forces in the cable accurately with an approximate root mean square deviation of 7 n tuning of the parameters such as elasticity modulus hydrodynamic parameters or rigid body parameters could perhaps be performed to achieve better accuracy but this was not done as the experiments were meant to verify the accuracy of the presented model and not modify it verification of the modeling is performed by using published results for the steady state horizontal deflections of a tether management system the presented model is able to estimate the horizontal deflection with good accuracy when compared with the reference having a root mean square deviation rmsd of less than 4 7 m when using a 3000 m long cable and less than 1 m when using a 5000 m long cable a sensitivity analysis is performed on the hydrodynamic parameters and shows that for the presented scenario these parameters have little effect on the cable tension applied to the rov hence using advanced methods for accurately estimating these coefficients based on keulegan carpenter kc and reynolds numbers re would not be beneficial the sensitivity analysis is however only performed on a single rov system performing a single maneuver hence drawing any general conclusions is difficult for the tested case however it can be concluded that the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic parameters of the cable is small the presented model is able to estimate the response and tension forces of the cable used in a rov system with good accuracy it is one of only a few models verified experimentally and the functionality for real rov operations is therefore verified the model can therefore be used in numerical tools such as simulators and operator mission training utilization of the model in rov design is also an important benefit cable forces can dominate the overall response of a rov system including these forces in the design stage can help optimize the rov design with regards to e g maximum working depth required thrust minimum required hydrostatic restoring etc another possible use of the model is state estimation for deep water operations loss of acoustic positioning can frequently occur being able to estimate the response of the rov during this time can be crucial the model therefore presents a useful and versatile tool with applications to many different areas acknowledgment this work has been carried out at the center for

23245,increasing autonomy efficiency and safety for remotely operated vehicles rovs is crucial for future subsea operations and requires accurate models for optimal control operations and design this involves precise modeling of the cable in conjunction with the rov response this paper presents a novel three dimensional cable model for remotely operated vehicles using euler bernoulli beam theory the presented model is implemented in matlab and takes into account the most important effects related to the response of underwater cables and rovs following beam theory bending stiffness is also included making the model applicable for low tension scenarios the presented model is modified to allow for compression of the cable the resulting non linear equations are discretized spatially by the galerkin finite element method and solved temporally by the newmark β time integration scheme the model is verified experimentally in ocean tank experiments on a real rov system a numerical example is presented and the results are compared to previous published results lastly a sensitivity analysis for the hydrodynamic parameters is presented keywords rov cable dynamics finite element dynamic modeling simulation 1 introduction today most subsea operations are performed by unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs these vehicles are typically divided into two groups autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and remotely operated vehicles rovs rovs are mostly used for inspection maintenance and repair imr due to their high payload and maneuvering capabilities whilst auvs are most often used for monitoring and mapping of the seabed due to their high speed and autonomous capabilities auvs tend to have onboard power supplies while rovs are connected to a remote unit through a cable tether rov systems usually consist of a supporting ship a cable and a rov equipped with the tools relevant for the specific mission the tether connecting the rov to the ship controller is a power and signal cable the tether imposes additional forces on the rov cable drag inertia and stiffness forces are transferred to the rov and can in some cases dominate the overall response of the rov eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 for deep and ultra deep waters a tether management system tms is applied to reduce these loads but the cable will still have a large impact on the rov response quan et al 2015 today these forces are mostly counteracted by human operators and the skills of the operator is therefore crucial for the mission success rate in the future as operations become more autonomous these forces must be counteracted by the control systems rather than a human operator accurate models of these forces is therefore crucial in the move towards autonomy estimation of the response of the rov is in addition important to ensure safe efficient and accurate underwater operations estimation of the response to counteract the environmental loads can greatly increase efficiency and safety of an operation in addition predicting the response of a rov system can be extremely beneficial during mission planning controller design or rov simulations estimating the response of the rov cable system can be performed by continuous or discrete models continuous models have the advantage of being able to accurately estimate natural frequencies transfer functions and harmonics of tethered systems very efficiently and have been utilized extensively in the investigation of towed underwater cables hover et al 1994 bliek 1984 driscoll et al 2000b there are however some critical disadvantages for continuous models when it comes to modeling cable responses for rov systems most prominently rov cables often experience low or no tension and continuous models are not valid for slack cables triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1991 linearization of the nonlinear drag forces is also required in the continuous models given that the linearized force term deviates substantially from the quadratic force given a random drag force naess and yim 1996 applicability of the models is limited modeling variations in hydrodynamic forces and cable properties over the length of the cable is a drawback as it can be difficult if not impossible to model this correctly using continuous models driscoll et al 2000a the aforementioned drawbacks are avoided using discrete models discrete models have the disadvantages of being computationally demanding and introducing numerical errors but recent years advances in computational power have made discrete models very fast and accurate discrete models have been investigated and tested extensively in previous work but most models focus on towed vehicles or tms where relative high tensions are assumed driscoll et al 2000a suggested a 1 dimensional lumped mass discrete model of a deep sea rov system tms the model was able to estimate the tension and vertical motion of the tms in addition the model was able to predict the snap loads and capture the corresponding nonlinear characteristics but was limited to 1 degree of freedom and bending forces were not included buckham et al buckham and nahon 1999 buckham et al 2000 buckham et al 2003b presented a three dimensional lumped mass model that took into account bending effects following the approach presented by burgess 1992 this model was verified experimentally by comparing the dynamic response of the cable and showed the importance of including bending stiffness for low tension tethers the model was however not verified in a real scenario where the ends of the cable can translate in all three degrees of freedom buckham et al 2003a and lambert et al 2003 furthermore proposed a lumped mass model for towed underwater vehicles where bending forces were neglected as they were assumed to be insignificant for a towed cable the model was verified using results from real sea trials and showed good agreement for most variables velocity tension and thrust buckham et al 2004 furthermore proposed a new model that took into account bending effects using cubic spline curves the model has an advantage when it comes to computational efficiency due to the low number of variables used when calculating the response the model was however not verified against other experiments or sea trials fang et al 2007 proposed a complete rov model including cable effects the model was verified experimentally and the rov response showed good correspondence between simulated and experimental results the presented model assumed in extensible cables limited to positive tension forces limitations regarding the operational domain and dimensions of the rov system is therefore of concern fang et al 2013 furthermore presented a finite element cable model using the cubic spline curve as proposed by buckham et al 2004 the cubic spline model was able to correctly simulate the steady state deflections when compared to experimental results obtained in zhu et al 2002 quan et al 2015 proposed a geometrically exact formulation for three dimensional static and dynamic analyses of deep water rov systems this model has the major advantage of including geometric nonlinearities due to large displacements which is often neglected in cable modeling the model was validated against measurements taken from a real deep water rov system although only 1 degree of freedom was considered heave the model was able to accurately calculate the response of the tms when compared to the experimental results as the model was not tested on a rov system without a tms it is difficult to determine the accuracy for low tension cables eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 proposed a finite element model using euler bernoulli beam theory for deep water rov systems the model was applied to a real rov system showing the importance of including cable effects and the relative importance of incoming current velocities when modeling rov systems the benefit of this model is the inclusion of bending stiffness the novelty of the modeling and the ability to run many types of rov scenarios such as small large cable tensions rov systems with or without tms and complex rov maneuvers eidsvik and schjølberg 2017 later applied the model to a tms and compared the model against results obtained from sea trials the model showed very good results with regards to the horizontal response of the tms the above mentioned work typically has limitations when it comes to the range of applicability the most prominent concern are the models that require the presence of positive tension in the cable for many rov operations this may not be the case as shown by buckham et al 2000 models that neglect bending forces can for low tension scenarios neglect important dynamic effects of the cable due to the large relative importance of the bending forces in low tension scenarios bending forces may have the same order of magnitude as the axial forces the cubic spline methods shows great potential but experimental validation on real systems are still needed to verify functionality this paper extends the work presented in eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 to mathematically model and simulate the dynamic response of rov systems the euler bernoulli beam theory grants good results for cases when the cable has limited curvature and should retain stability also when the tension is small the novelty of implementing beam theory is an important benefit of the presented model an algorithm for handling the buckling scenario negative tension is also introduced to extend the applicability of the model the model is hence able to simulate the dynamic response of a rov system for a wide range of rov systems maneuvers and environmental conditions the model is verified against experimental data and hydrodynamic parameter sensitivity is tested the scientific contributions of this paper can hence be divided into four main contributions development and implementation of a novel finite element rov and cable model for simulating the dynamic response of the rov system for a wide range of operations development of an experimental test procedure for rov cable systems verification of the presented model by experimental data a sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic parameters of the rov cables the article is organized as follows in sec 2 the mathematical modeling of the complete rov cable system is presented followed by a presentation of the experimental procedure in sec 3 the results from the experimental tests and numerical simulations are presented in sec 4 followed by a brief discussion on the obtained results in sec 5 lastly concluding remarks and suggestions for further work are presented in sec 6 2 modeling this section presents the mathematical formulation for the rov cable system presented in this paper the kinematic and dynamic modeling is presented along with the structure of the numerical solver used in this work 2 1 kinematics a number of reference frames are introduced in this section as illustrated in fig 1 an inertial reference frame is defined as being fixed relative to the earth and the origin is set at the surface the z axis is pointing vertically down and the x and y axes are coinciding with north and east respectively the cable system is assumed to operate in a local reference frame with approximate constant latitude and longitude this is usually referred to as flat earth navigation and newton s law still applies fossen 2011 moreover a set of local reference frames are fixed relative to the orientation of each finite element of the cable hence n cable element reference frames are created combined with the two local frames of the rov and surface ship this adds up to a total of n 2 local reference frames the orientation of the i t h local frame is defined by a ϕ θ ψ euler angle set following sname notation sname 1950 where ϕ θ ψ are the rotations around x y and z axes respectively the use of euler angles introduces singularities in the angular transformation matrix for the cable singular points are avoided since the torsional degree of freedom is neglected hence there are only two angular rotations in the local reference frames the rov will most likely not experience pitch angles of 90 d e g due to the relative large hydrostatic restoring in roll and pitch unless for extreme cases for underwater flight vehicles which have very limited hydrostatic restoring 90 d e g rotations around the horizontal axes can easily occur and must be accounted for the singularity in the angular transformation can in these cases be avoided by introducing a new euler angle representation with different singularities and the singular points can be avoided by switching between them the orthogonal transformation from the i t h local frame to the inertial frame becomes 1 r i g b c ψ c θ s ψ c ϕ c ψ s θ s ϕ s ψ s ϕ c ψ c ϕ s θ s i n ψ c θ c ψ c ϕ s ϕ s θ s ψ c ψ s ϕ s θ s ψ c ϕ s θ c θ s ϕ c θ c ϕ 2 2 equations of motion to create a numerical model for a cable which includes bending axial and inertial forces a set of dynamic equations of motion are developed euler bernoulli beam theory has been extensively utilized in structural problems and has proven to give good results in cases where the beam cross sections do not deform significantly it is assumed that deep sea umbilical cables usually have a significant length to width ratio with a limited curvature due to the large vertical distance the euler bernoulli beam equations therefore represents the dynamics of the cable with satisfactory accuracy as shown in eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 the governing equations in the local frame can be written 2 e a 2 u x 2 m 2 u t 2 f x x 3 2 x 2 e i z 2 v x 2 m c a a ρ 2 v t 2 f y x 4 2 x 2 e i y 2 w x 2 m c a a ρ 2 w t 2 f z x where f n x is the external force in n direction as a function of the longitudinal position x e is the young s module of the cable u v w are the deflections in the x y and z direction respectively a is the cross section area i is the 2nd moment of inertia c a is the added mass coefficient of a circular cylinder morison et al 1950 ρ is the density of water and m is the mass of the cable per unit length the longitudinal added mass hydrodynamic mass has been omitted from eq 2 as it is orders of magnitude smaller than the transverse added mass for length to width ratios applicable to a deep sea rov cable length to width ratios typically above 10 4 for large length to width ratios the flexural moments of the cable become very limited and the inclusion of the these moments can be argued as they will have a negligible effect on the overall response however for the case of small or zero tension forces the flexural moments can become of importance as observed in buckham et al buckham and nahon 1999 buckham et al 2000 buckham et al 2003b the bending stiffness is important for low tension cases not because the curvatures are exceptionally large but rather due to a lack of other forces hover 1997 low or zero tension may be restricted to a finite area or may span the entire length of the cable the equations of motion for perfectly flexible cables become singular when the tension vanishes chen et al 2014 this singular behavior is avoided by the inclusion of bending stiffness burgess 1993 for small and medium sized rov systems cables having a more or less neutral submerged weight are often used hence low or zero tension scenarios are not unrealistic in these low tension scenarios the cable has very little impact on the rov response however it is still important to model the response of the cable correctly in these scenarios this because the response at a given time instance will affect the response at a later time for cables with small length to width ratios the flexural moments become more important due to limitations in testing facilities smaller length to width ratios might be used in experimental testing and verification of rov cables in these cases bending stiffness should be included as the flexural moments in these cases may become significant it is practical to write eqs 2 4 in the weak form as the weak form creates the basis for the finite element approach 5 e a u x g 0 l 0 l m 2 u t 2 g e a g x u x f x x g d x 0 6 e i z 3 v x 3 g 0 l e i z 2 v x 2 g x 0 l 0 l e i z 2 v x 2 2 g x 2 m c a a ρ 2 v t 2 g f y x g d x 0 7 e i

degrees of freedom the governing equations in the local body fixed reference frame for the rov in 6 dof can be found in fossen 2011 for the sensitivity analysis and experimental verification performed in this work the dynamic equations of motion for the rov are not used as the accuracy of the cable modeling is of interest rather than the accuracy of the rov model the rov response is in these cases treated as a predetermined input 2 3 external forces the external forces on the cable consists of added mass and drag forces combined with hydrostatic buoyancy forces wave induced forces can generally be neglected as the water particle velocity in waves die out with a factor of e k z in deep waters where k is the wave number and z is the vertical position relative to the mean surface the wave induced forces will therefore only affect a small portion of the cable the wave forces will however have a large influence on the response of the surface ship and will therefore be included in the boundary conditions of the cable the external forces f n for a given cable cross section can be written as 8 d d x f n x ρ c a n a v n t 1 2 ρ c d n d v n v n where ρ is the density of sea water c a n is the added mass coefficient in the local n direction v n is the relative fluid velocity in the local n direction d is the diameter of the cable a is the area of the cable cross section and c d n is the drag coefficient in the n direction this equation is known as the morison equation morison et al 1950 the equation consists of two coefficients in each degree of freedom c a and c d which are often estimated analytically experimentally or numerically since the cable has a dominating dimension longitudinal much larger than the two others transverse strip theory is valid the first term in eq 8 inertia term was already included on the left side in the governing equations as can be seen in eqs 3 and 4 the coefficients for circular cylinders are very well studied and accurate estimates are available in literature however both the added mass and drag coefficients vary with the flow conditions and can in many cases not be treated as constants the added mass coefficients are highly affected by the kc number in an oscillatory flow oscillatory flow conditions might occur in the presence of waves or when the cable experiences vortex induced vibration likewise the drag coefficient is affected by kc number upstream flow conditions and inflow velocity the keulegan carpenter kc number is a dimensionless quantity describing the relative importance of the drag forces over the inertia forces and is defined as 9 k c v t l where v is the amplitude of the flow velocity oscillation t is the period of oscillation and l is the diameter of the cylinder faltinsen 1999 some assumptions can be made when defining these coefficients to greatly reduce the problem of estimating the numerical values the following assumptions are therefore applied assumption 2 1 the oscillatory dependence of drag and added mass coefficients can be neglected based on the facts that waves will only affect a small part of the cable and the vortex shedding frequency will be much larger than the natural frequency for relevant cable dimensions assumption 2 2 the transverse velocity component will be dominating since the cable is positioned approximately vertical the interaction between the transverse and longitudinal velocity components can therefore be neglected due to the large relative inflow angle cross flow principle is therefore valid based on assumption 2 1 and 2 2 the added mass forces can be represented by a single constant furthermore the drag forces can be represented by a drag coefficient only dependent on the inflow velocity in both the transverse and the longitudinal directions the drag term in eq 8 can for the translatory degrees of freedom be written as 10 d d x f x x 1 2 ρ c t π d u r u r 11 d d x f y x 1 2 ρ c d d v r v r 12 d d x f z x 1 2 ρ c d d w r w r where c t is the tangential drag coefficient of a flat plate c d is the normal drag coefficient of a circular cylinder u v w is the cable deflection along x y and z axes respectively and u r v r w r is the relative inflow velocity along x y and z axes respectively i e 13 u r v r w r u v w u c v c w c where u v w is the translational velocity of the cable and u c v c w c is the current velocity the hydrostatic buoyancy and gravity forces b z can be can be written in the inertial reference frame as 14 b z m ρ a g l where m is the mass of a unit length of the cable ρ is the density of water a is the cross section area g is the constant of gravity and l is the complete submerged length of the cable for many rov systems the cable is designed close to neutrally buoyant to remove the negative buoyancy force the rigid body motion of the rov is the boundary condition for the cable which means the cable response is calculated based on the rov position likewise the rov response is calculated based on the cable tension hence a cross coupling between the two dynamic systems is created the tension forces in the cable are hence added as external forces acting on the rov 15 f r o v r n r o v t c where r n r o v is the rotation matrix from the last element to the rov and t c is the tension force in the last cable element 2 4 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations for the cable eqs 5 7 a complete set of both boundary and initial conditions must be determined the response of the cable ends are given by the connections to the surface ship and the rov see fig 1 denoted top and bottom ends for a beam element in three dimensional space a total of six boundary conditions must be determined at each end three deflections and three rotations this number is reduced to five by neglecting the torsional rotation rotation around the local x axis the torsional degree of freedom is neglected based on the following assumption assumption 2 3 the top and bottom ends of the cable are assumed to rotate freely independent of the surface ship and rov motions as no external forces acts in the torsional degree of freedom it is therefore reasonable to omit it the remaining 10 boundary conditions are determined as follows the translational positions of the two cable ends are assumed to be equal to the position of the surface ship and the rov the curvature of the cable at the ends are assumed to be zero the curvature at the top and bottom end of the cable is assumed to be zero as rovs are usually installed with a small wire or rotating mechanism connecting the rov and the cable to absorb the tension forces this is done to minimize the cable loads acting on the connection between the cable and the rov the wire is only able to absorb tension forces and provides minimal flexural moment the configuration on the top end can vary based on equipment and operation often a crane or winch is used to hold the rov cable during operations the resistance to bending at the top end can therefore depend on the equipment used but it is reasonable to assume that a simple support zero curvature at the top end should be sufficient as the flexural moment should in any case be negligible the top and bottom boundary conditions are 16 u 0 u s h i p v 0 v s h i p w 0 w s h i p 2 v 0 x 2 0 2 w 0 x 2 0 u l u r o v v l v r o v w l w r o v 2 v l x 2 0 2 w l x 2 0 where u 0 v 0 w 0 are the deflections of the top end u l v l w l are the deflections of the bottom end of the cable u s h i p v s h i p w s h i p is the position of the ship and u r o v v r o v w r o v is the position of the rov 2 5 finite element discretization this section presents the finite element discretization of the governing equations eqs 5 7 that creates the basis for the developed simulation tool which is implemented in matlab firstly the three dimensional beam elements are presented the galerkin approach is then used to equate the weight function in the weak formulation followed by a presentation of the element stiffness and mass matrices respectively the proportional damping is introduced also the external forces on each element are calculated followed lastly by the presentation of the discrete equations based on the preceding modeling this section contains a large number of notations and some general notation rules are used to make the equations more understandable the notation used in this section is as follows superscript i denotes element number i subscript i denotes node number i bold capital letters denote matrix it is assumed the cable is divided into a finite number of equal length elements as indicated in fig 2 each element has 5 degrees of freedom which results in 10 unknown states 6 deflections and 4 rotations the deflections are denoted u v and w for the x y and z directions respectively and the rotations are denoted θ y and θ z for rotations about the y and z axes respectively eqs 5 7 are written elementwise 17 0 l m 2 u t 2 g e a g x u x f x x g d x 0 18 0 l e i z 2 v x 2 2 g x 2 m c a a ρ 2 v t 2 g f y x g d x 0 19 0 l e i y 2 w x 2 2 g x 2 m c a a ρ 2 w t 2 g f z x g d x 0 where l is the element length following the galerkin method a set of suitable shape functions are found hughes 2000 that is the weight function g x is substituted with the approximating functions n i it is necessary to assure compatibility between adjacent elements with respect to deflections and slopes hence the approximating functions must be chosen such that the functions and their derivatives are continuous at the element ends the approximation for the total displacement u x for each element can be written as a superposition of the nodal displacements by combining eq 17 19 20 u x n 1 x u 1 n 2 x u 2 n 3 x v 1 w 1 n 4 x θ y 1 θ z 1 n 5 x v 2 w 2 n 6 x θ y 2 θ z 2 where n are the 6 shape functions following the galerkin fem here n 1 and n 2 are linear as eq 17 contains a first order derivative 21 n 1 1 x l n 2 x l n 3 to n 6 are the shape functions of eqs 18 and 19 which is of third order 22 n 3 1 3 x l 2 2 x l 3 n 4 x 1 x l 2 n 5 3 x l 2 2 x l 3 n 6 x x l 2 x l eqs 18 and 19 have identical shapes but are orthogonal to each other the corresponding shape functions are therefore identical obtaining the discretizised form of eq 6 therefore yields the discretized form of eq 7 as well note that the shape functions n 1 to n 6 satisfies the continuity requirement of the deflections and the slopes at the element ends x 0 and x l eq 20 can be written in a more compact form 23 u x n x r where n is the matrix of shape functions and r is the vector of nodal displacements defined as 24 r u 1 v 1 w 1 θ y 1 θ z 1 u 2 v 2 w 2 θ y 2 θ z 2 the stiffness matrix for the beam elements can be calculated from eq 17 19 using the presented shape functions this derivation can be found in standard finite element literature cook et al 1989 and the derivation will hence not be presented in this work the three equations produces three stiffness matrices as mentioned earlier 6 and 7 produces the same result as they have identical shapes but are orthogonal e q 5 e a l 1 1 1 1 e q 6 e i z l 3 12 6 l 12 6 l 6 l 4 l 2 6 l 2 l 2 12 6 l 2 12 6 l 6 l 2 l 2 6 l

these matrices according to eq 20 the element stiffness matrix can be written as k e e a l 0 0 0 0 e a l 0 0 0 0 0 12 e i z l 3 0 0 6 e i z l 2 0 12 e i z l 3 0 0 6 e i z l 2 0 0 12 e i y l 3 6 e i y

0 4 e i z l where i y and i z are the 2nd moments of inertia with respect to the y and z axes respectively i y and i z are identical for a body with radial symmetry and l is the element length in the matrix representation k m n is the stiffness force in m dof due to a deflection in n dof hence by multiplying the stiffness matrix k e with the deflection vector r the stiffness forces of each element are found the mass matrix for the beam elements is generated using particle lumping rather than using the galerkin approach as was done with the stiffness matrix by lumped mass it is meant that the mass terms in eq 17 19 are split between each element boundary i e at x 0 and x l half the mass is therefore applied to each node of the element by this approach the mass matrix becomes diagonal as no coupling between the different degrees of freedom occur other methods such as consistent or combination mass matrices would not result in a diagonal mass matrix due to the fact that for each time step the mass matrix must be inverted a diagonal matrix is desirable to greatly reduce the computation time it has been proven in literature that lumped mass approximation is consistent with the dynamics of an actual highly flexible cable huang 1994 and a lumped mass approach has accuracy equivalent to that of more complex methods kamman and huston 1999 zhu et al 2008 also showed that the lumped mass parameter model is an effective tool to simulate nonlinear coupled movement of a multi body systems such as rov cages for the lumped mass matrix to be nonsingular rotary inertia must be included and this is done by including the term m e α l 2 the element mass matrix can then be written as vector of diagonal elements m e l m e 2 m e ρ c a a 2 m e ρ c a a 2 m e α l m e α l m e 2 m e ρ c a a 2 m e ρ c a a 2 m e α l m e α l d where m e is the mass pr unit length the added mass is included for transverse translations but neglected for rotational and longitudinal degrees of freedom the added mass coefficient c a for a circular cylinder can be found analytically and is exactly 1 for non oscillating flow the factor α should ideally be negative or zero since the translational end node masses m e 2 greatly overestimates the angular momentum of the element however under the requirement of positive elements in the mass matrix α is determined ad hoc by calculating the associated mass moment of inertia of a slender bar with length l 2 25 i b a r m 2 l 2 2 3 α 1 24 the damping of the cable is mainly governed by the hydrodynamic drag forces this because the drag force is given by the current relative velocity and will therefore act either as a damping force or as a driving force however it is desirable to include some form of structural damping of the cable to ensure numerical stability in this work linear proportional damping is used the main reason for this choice is that the damping model has been utilized extensively in engineering and it s easy to incorporate as it is calculated from the already obtained stiffness and mass matrices the proportional damping for each element can hence be written as hughes 2000 26 c e α 1 k e α 2 m e where c e is the proportional damping matrix for an element α 1 and α 2 are the stiffness and mass proportional damping coefficients respectively usually chosen to be in the range of 0 5 depending on the natural frequencies for marine structures that undergo large rigid body motions the mass proportional damping term is usually neglected as it would give damping to the rigid body motions which is undesirable dnv 2010 as rov cables in many cases undergo large rigid body motions the mass term should be zero α 2 0 the hydrodynamic drag forces on the cable are discretized by writing eq 10 12 as sums of the mean drag force of each element 27 f x i 1 2 ρ c t π d u r i u r i l i f y i 1 2 ρ c d d v r i v r i l i f z i 1 2 ρ c d d w r i w r i l i where u r i v r i and w r i are the current relative element velocity components of element i expressed in the local reference frame l i is the length of element i and f n i is the hydrodynamic force on element i in the local n dof the current relative element velocity components are estimated by taking the average of the two nodal velocities at each element end the element drag force vector is then calculated by lumping the drag force of each element at the ends a disadvantage of this model is the fact that an element simply rotating in resting fluid will experience a zero average velocity of the end nodes and the resulting drag force will become zero the buoyancy force is discretized in the same manner and it is expressed in the inertial reference frame 28 b z i m e i ρ a g l i where b z i is the buoyancy force on element i in the inertial frame and m e i is the mass of element i the element buoyancy force vector is also calculated by lumping the element force between the two element nodes 2 6 global matrix assembly in the previous section all the internal and external element matrices for the cable were calculated by assembling the element matrices the global system of equations can be calculated following the finite element approach by superposing entries from coincident nodes the global matrices can be found that is 29 k i j g e 1 n k i j e m i j g e 1 n m i j e c i j g e 1 n c i j e f d i j g e 1 n f d i j e b i j g e 1 n b i j e the complete matrix system for the global system of equations can then be written 30 r g b m g r g b t r r g b k g r g b t r r g b c g r g b t r r g b f d g b g where m g is the global mass matrix expressed in the local reference frames r is the vector of nodal accelerations k g is the global stiffness matrix expressed in the local reference frames r g b is the global transformation matrix r g b t is the transformed global transformation matrix c g is the global structural damping matrix expressed in the local reference frames f d g is the global hydrodynamic drag force vector expressed in the local reference frames and b g is the global buoyancy force vector expressed in the inertial reference frame 2 7 floating frame of reference formulation the global assembly presented in the previous section grants the deflection for an elastic beam using linear finite elements as the rov i e the bottom end of the cable is able to move the equilibrium position of the cable therefore varies in time therefore a nonlinear model must be used to calculate the stiffness forces given the new equilibrium position this is done by introducing a floating frame of reference ffr formulation using a ffr formulation the displacement vector r can be rewritten as the sum of the elastic displacement and the rigid body displacement of the undeformed cable 31 r r 0 r e l a s t i c where r 0 and r e l a s t i c are the rigid body and elastic displacements of the cable respectively eq 31 can be rewritten in a more convenient form 32 r e l a s t i c r r 0 for the scenarios presented in this work the surface ship is assumed to be stationary during rov operations hence the top end of the cable is assumed fixed the undeformed cable r 0 will therefore only rotate about the top end the elastic deflection r e l a s t i c is used to calculate the tension forces on the rov the elastic tension forces will in turn produce a given response of the rov the response of the rov is used to calculate the rigid body deflection r 0 r 0 is calculated by assuming a straight cable undeformed going from the top end through the connection point of the rov having a length equal the undeformed length of the cable by inserting the expression for r e l a s t i c from eq 32 into the stiffness term in eq 30 the system of equations for the dynamic response of the cable can be found 33 r g b m g r g b t r r g b k g r g b t r r 0 r g b c g r g b t r r g b f d g b g 2 8 initial conditions the initial conditions of the cable depend on the given scenario and must be determined accordingly for simplicity the cable is assumed to be positioned strictly vertical following the finite element approach this translates to positioning all nodal points of the cable vertically the initial conditions for each cable node i hence become in the local reference frame 34 u i 0 v i 0 w i 0 f o r i 1 n 1 2 9 hydrodynamic parameters the hydrodynamic parameters related to the cable are the three coefficients c t c d and c a eqs 5 7 these are the tangential and normal drag coefficients and the added mass coefficient respectively as the cable is assumed to be a circular cylinder operating in a turbulent flow regime the drag coefficients can be determined based on experimental data for circular cylinders and application of the cross flow principle the tangential drag coefficient is estimated using the approximate estimates for a smooth flat plate in turbulent flow conditions schlichting 1979 for the region of relevant reynolds numbers u l ν an approximate value of c t 0 02 is used the normal drag coefficient is more important as the normal drag force will dominate the hydrodynamic loads due to the vertical orientation of the cable the normal drag coefficient c d is given as a function of the normal inflow velocity of each cable element rather than a constant value the reynolds dependent drag coefficients for a circular cylinder are taken from table 10 18 in blevins 2003 as stated in sec 2 5 the normal added mass coefficient c a can be calculated analytically and is exactly 1 tangential added mass is neglected since it is orders of magnitude smaller than the normal coefficient for relevant cable length to width ratios 2 10 compression in real rov operations compression of the cable due to vertical rov motion is a likely scenario the numerical solver should therefore be able to calculate the response when the cable is subjected to compression forces due to the large length to width ratio of the cable the static buckling load compression load is approximately zero the critical buckling load for a slender beam can be written as timoshenko and gere 1989 35 p c r i t π 2 e i l 2 0 where p c r i t is the critical buckling load i e that maximum compression load before the beam will buckle e i is the flexural rigidity and l is the length of the cable hence when the rov produces a load on the cable in the positive vertical direction the cable will buckle the buckling is modeled by introducing a new equilibrium position i e undeformed position vector when calculating the stiffness forces by equilibrium position vector is meant the position vector where the stiffness forces are zero this new equilibrium position is denoted r ˆ 0 and will satisfy four main requirements the element lengths and overall length of the cable is conserved the vertical position of the top and bottom nodes are equal to the vertical position of the surface ship and the rov respectively the cable will buckle in the same direction as already existing deflections the vertical translation of the new r ˆ 0 nodes will be reduced linearly from the bottom end to the top end a generic algorithm for calculating the r ˆ 0 terms for node i can based on these requirements be found note that subscript denotes node number and superscript denotes element number 36a z ˆ i z i δ z r o v i 1 n 36b x ˆ i x i x ˆ i 1 z ˆ i 1 z ˆ i t a n α i c o s β i 36c y ˆ i y i y ˆ i 1 z ˆ i 1 z ˆ i t a n α i s i n β i 36d α i a c o s z ˆ i 1 z ˆ i l i s i g n θ i where x ˆ i y ˆ i z ˆ i is the buckled position r ˆ 0 of node i x i y i z i is the original position r 0 of node i δ z r o v is the vertical position of the rov relative to r 0 n is the number of elements α i is the angle between r 0 and r ˆ 0 of element i β i is the angle between inertial reference frame x axis and the horizontal orientation of element i θ i is the relative angle between r and r 0 of element i and l is the initial element length note that the equations are given in the inertial reference frame hence z is the vertical axis and x y is the horizontal plane in fig 3 a sketch of a buckling scenario displaying the quantities used in eqs 36a and 36d is shown fig 3a shows the scenario for the entire cable while the same scenario is shown for only the last two cable elements in fig 3b 2 11 numerical solver the dynamic problems given in eq 33 are solved in the spatial domain by inverting the mass matrix to solve the equations in the time domain direct time integration using the newmark β method is performed the newmark β method is an implicit method where stability limits depend on the parameters used the newmark β integral equations can be written as huebner et al 2001 37 r t 1 r t 1 λ t r t λ t r t 1 r t 1 r t t r t 1 2 β t 2 r t β t 2 r t 1 where r t is the displacement vector of the previous time step λ and β are free parameters and t is the time increment setting β to 0 25 gives the trapezoidal method of integration which is unconditionally stable λ is set to 0 5 which gives no artificial damping this might become problematic as high frequency noise can be beneficial to remove however introducing artificial damping will damp the solution and is not introduced the following sequence of calculations produces the next state of the coupled system position velocity and acceleration of time step t 1 1 transformation matrix r g b from local reference frames to the inertial reference frame 2 global matrices m g k g c g b g and f d are calculated and transformed to the inertial reference frame 3 eq 30 are solved with respect to the cable acceleration r 4 nodal velocities r and positions r are calculated from eq 37 5 eq 15 is used to calculate the rov tension forces 6 drag thrust inputs and hydrostatic restoring are calculated using rov position and velocity from previous time step 7 the rov acceleration is calculated 8 rov position and velocity is calculated using eq 37 9 surface ship and rov position is used as boundary conditions in the next iteration step where surface ship position is taken as a predetermined input the flowchart of the solver is shown in fig 4 3 experimental validation this section describes the experimental setup employed for the validation of the

system from waterlinked as tension load cell produced by hottinger baldwin messtechnik gmbh the key parameters of the bluerov 2 is shown in table 1 the mass of the rov is approximately 10 kg and it is neutrally buoyant in water the qualisys system requires that minimum two cameras have vision on a marker to determine its position the maximum domain possible to cover with 6 cameras is therefore limited the approximate domain where the qualisys system is able to properly find a marker in space is a vertical cylinder 12 m high and a diameter of 7 m the cable is marked with retro reflective markers about every 1 m as shown in fig 5 the position of the rov is recorded using the waterlinked underwater positioning system utilizing 4 transponders mounted on the rov in addition to the qualisys positioning this is done simply to have redundancy in the rov positioning the tension load cell is positioned on the intersection between the rov and the cable and all forces applied to the rov from the cable will therefore be registered by the load cell the load cell is furthermore synchronized with the qualisys positioning system and both run at 60 hz the 4 transponders and the load cell each require one cable to transfer the signals these additional cables are twisted around the rov tether which change the characteristics of the tether quite significantly most prominently the weight and diameter of the cable but also the flexural rigidity and drag coefficients the axial stiffness is not expected to be affected much by the additional cables this is because the two cable ends are only connected using the rov tether and the tether is able to translate in the axial direction with very limited resistance from the other cables the cable specifications for the experimental setup are shown in table 2 the test setup is shown in fig 5 3 2 test procedure the experiments are performed at constant water depth and the depth of the rov is automatically controlled using a pressure sensor and a pd controller the depth is kept approximately constant to simulate a vertical tether and also to ease the localization of the reflective markers the surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom are controlled using a joystick note that bluerov 2 does not have actuation in roll and pitch the experiments are divided into two different cases of rov motion experiment 1 straight line back and forth experiment 2 straight line sideways for each experiment time series of the load cell force cable position and rov position are recorded at 60 hz the experiments are run for approximately 5 min and the rov is kept at rest for 5 min between each experiment to allow the cable to untwine it should be noted that the position of each qualisys marker is not recorded for all time steps as the position of the markers tend to fall in and out of sight of the qualisys cameras this problem is occurring more frequently near the edges of the domain covered by the cameras the position velocity and acceleration for the markers are therefore interpolated to create continuous inputs to the simulations thus some errors are present in the input signals 4 results this section presents the experimental and simulated numerical results from of the trials conducted at laboceano two experiments were performed and compared with the results from simulations of same motion in sec 4 2 a verification test against already published results is presented before a sensitivity analysis is performed on the most important hydrodynamic parameters of the cable in sec 4 3 4 1 experimental verification 4 1 1 experiment 1 the first experiment was performed simply by driving the rov forwards and backwards on constant depth the path of the rov recorded by the qualisys motion capture system can be seen in fig 6 a and the recorded tension force obtained from the load cell for the same experiment can be seen in fig 6b the recorded cable position is shown for 7 different time instances in fig 6c and d the simulations are performed using the recorded rov position fig 6a as a predetermined input the response of the rov is hence not simulated this is done to remove uncertainties in the rov modeling from the experiment in addition no thruster data was recorded hence simulating the rov response would not have been possible the simulated results for experiment 1 is shown in fig 7 from fig 7a it can clearly be seen that the simulator is able to predict the bottom tension in the cable with fairly good accuracy the root mean square deviation rmsd between the simulated and experimental tension force is 7 21 n the simulated tension is overpredicted during peaks the reason for the overprediction is most likely due to the fact that the interconnection between the rov and the load cell had an initial slack hence the rov was able to move about 2 cm before the load cell was exposed to tension forces this initial slack was not accounted for in the simulations due to the complexity in modeling it the deflections are predicted accurately fig 7c and d for the case where the tension of the cable is significant i e at t 175 s for the case where the tension is low t 30 s the deflection is poorly estimated the nature of a slack cable is chaotic and is therefore difficult to reproduce in the dynamic simulations since the cable in addition had an initial slack the low tension scenario becomes almost impossible to reproduce in the simulation 4 1 2 experiment 2 the second experiment was performed similarly to the first experiment but now the horizontal motion of the rov is mainly in the y direction the rov path recorded by the qualisys motion capture system for this experiment can be seen in fig 8 a and the tension force obtained from the load cell is shown in fig 8b the recorded cable deflection for 7 different time instances is shown in fig 8c and d for x and y direction respectively the simulated results for experiment 2 is shown in fig 9 from fig 9a it can clearly be seen that the simulator is able to predict the bottom tension of the cable with fairly good accuracy the rmsd is 7 26 n which is significant when taking into account the small tension force the simulated tension force is however still in the correct range and taking into account the large uncertainties in the experimental procedure a rmsd of 7 26 n is acceptable the simulated tension is again slightly overpredicted as it was in experiment 1 this is also most likely due to an initial slack in the cable which was not accounted for in the simulations the deflections are also predicted accurately fig 9c and d again it can be noticed that during the low tension case t 53 s the deflection is poorly estimated with a difference of about 0 5 m but for the tension case t 289 s the accuracy is better this coincides good with the observations made in experiment 1 some additional differences between the simulated and experimental deflections can be observed in fig 9c and d especially the deflections in the x direction after 53 s it seems as if the stiffness of the simulated cable is too large compared to the experimental measurement whilst at 113 s the simulated cable looks as if the stiffness is too small this inconsistency most likely comes as a result of the interpolation of the cable measurements the raw data plot from experiment 2 can be seen in fig 10 and it clearly shows that jumps in the position measurements occur this happens when the qualisys automatic identification of markers aim model is unable to separate two markers or is unable to detect one or more markers this tendency is more prominent for the markers closer to the rov 1 and 2 than for the markers higher up on the cable 4 and 5 the reason for this is that the markers closer to the rov experiences larger motions than the markers higher up on the cable which makes them harder for qualisys to follow and identify the uncertainty in the experimental cable deflection is therefore big and should be taken into account when evaluating the results 4 2 comparison with published results a numerical comparison with the results from the static deflection analysis performed in quan et al 2015 is done for the tether management system described in the reference using 3000 and 5000 m cable lengths the simulations yield a root mean square deviation of 4 67 m at 3000 m cable length and 0 79 m at 5000 m cable length which is about 0 16 and 0 016 of the cable length the static horizontal deflection from the proposed model is therefore very similar to the model presented by quan et al 2015 the results from the static deflection simulations are shown in fig 11 4 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic parameters is performed by varying one parameter while keeping all other variables fixed the parameters varied are the transverse added mass and transverse drag coefficients the tests are performed by giving the rov a desired path the response of the rov is taken as a predetermined input since identical rov response for all cases is needed to compare the results the rov response is therefore kept identical to the desired path for all cases in this study the rov system used is the bluerov the elasticity module of the cable is set to 1 gpa and no environmental forces are applied in this study the desired rov path is shown in fig 12 4 3 1 added mass the added mass analysis is performed using the reynolds dependent drag coefficient as discussed in sec 2 3 the results from the sensitivity analysis is shown in fig 13 a it can be seen that the added mass coefficient has no impact on the bottom tension the importance of modeling the added mass coefficient correctly is therefore limited however large oscillations in the tension can be seen for the smallest added mass coefficients this is numerical instability which comes as a result of having less inertia forces on the cable the added mass can therefore remove numerical instabilities if required note that all simulations were performed using the same step sizes to ensure comparability the oscillations could therefore have been removed by decreasing the step size for the smallest added mass coefficients in fig 13b it can be noticed that doubling the added mass coefficient results in only 0 2 peak tension increase which is negligible the prescribed rov path contains very limited accelerations hence it is not surprising that the sensitivity of the added mass coefficient is small for a rov response with larger accelerations the sensitivity of the added mass coefficient would be larger 4 3 2 drag the results from the sensitivity analysis performed on the drag coefficient is shown in fig 14 from fig 14a it can be seen that the drag coefficient has similarly to the added mass very limited effect on the cable forces transferred to the rov in the performed simulation a horizontal peak velocity of 0 64 m s is accomplished during the initial phase 0 40 s which is about 50 of the top speed of the bluerov 2 yet the difference between a drag coefficient of 0 5 and 2 results in a cable peak tension increase of only 8 5 on the rov the difference between the reynolds dependent drag coefficient and the typical drag coefficient of c d 1 is also negligible about 0 2 hence the drag force can easily be represented by a single constant rather than using more complex methods the reason for this is that during the simulations the cable experiences a limited range of reynolds numbers and in this range the reynolds dependent drag coefficient is close to 1 for larger cables or larger range of relative velocities the difference between a reynolds dependent drag coefficient and a constant drag coefficient could be more prominent 5 discussion the overall goal of the experiments were to verify the mathematical cable model implemented in matlab in the following the obtained results are discussed 5 1 experimental validation comparing the experimental results with the numerical simulations some important characteristics were observed the cable tensions measured at the rov end during the experiment were similar in magnitude to the numerical simulations with a root mean square deviation of about 7 n the tension peaks were also similar although the numerical simulations gave higher tension peaks than the experimental results the difference in tension peaks was explained as initial slack in the cable but a number of other possible error sources are present in addition to potential errors in the modeling most of these error sources result from experimental measurement errors due to the small scale of the experiment the measured cable tension is of small magnitude hence the accuracy of the load cell may impact the results significantly the load cell was calibrated and the drift over time was found to be minimal the accuracy of the load cell is however unknown and could therefore affect the results the qualisys motion capture system was not always able to distinguish between the markers hence the rov and cable response had many jumps in the recorded data most of these jumps were removed by smoothing the data and removing outliers but removing all inconsistencies was not possible it is therefore expected to be some differences between the load cell measurements which is a scalar value and the three dimensional cable and rov position recorded by qualisys this error can most likely explain why som tension peaks are underpredicted or not present at all in the experimental results compared to the numerical simulations other possible sources of error are the cable properties the module of elasticity of 0 16 gpa was used based on the experimental results obtained by buckham et al 2000 the cable applied in this experiment could deviate from the cable used in the reference but the module of elasticity should be in the correct range the cable tension measured is directly linked to the module of elasticity the module can therefore be modified to obtain better correspondence between the experimental results and the numerical simulations the cable used in the experiment was in addition not completely circular since it was constructed by one center cable and four surrounding transponder cable the hydrodynamic drag coefficient in the experiment would therefore be different than the assumed cylinder drag coefficient however as observed in sec 4 3 this would not result in any noticeable difference in the cable tension and could therefore be ignored for the cable deflections a better agreement between the simulated and the experimental data were observed when the cable was subjected to tension forces this was not surprising as in the low tension scenario the cable response becomes chaotic and difficult to replicate in a dynamic simulation 5 2 published results when comparing the steady horizontal deflection of a tms rov system with the results obtained in quan et al 2015 using a geometrical exact formulation it was observed that the deflections corresponded very well the root mean square deviation between the presented model and quan et al 2015 was only 4 67 m and 0 79 m for the 3000 m and 5000 m scenarios respectively which showed that the presented model was able to simulate the horizontal steady state tms rov response with good accuracy as a tms rov system is the ideal system to model using beam equations this was expected the large tension in the cable significantly reduces the curvature and the beam equations will therefore perform well as the key assumption in beam theory is satisfied this confirms the findings obtained in eidsvik and schjølberg 2017 where the presented model was used to simulate the dynamic response of a tms 5 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis performed in sec 4 3 yielded interesting results the cable tension acting on the rov did not vary with the added mass of the cable the accelerations of the cable were very limited due to the path of the rov and it can therefore be expected that in cases where the rov has larger accelerations the sensitivity of the added mass coefficient becomes more prominent one interesting observation made in fig 13b is that increasing the added mass actually reduced the tension peaks slightly this observation most likely comes from numerical instabilities in the simulations a higher added mass will increase the inertia of the cable and hence reduce the oscillations of the cable this can also be noticed in fig 13a where c a 0 8 and c a 0 5 shows instabilities due to small amount of inertia resulting from the small added mass coefficient these oscillations could have been removed by reducing the step size or increasing the proportional damping but was not done to keep all variables in the simulations identical for the effect of the drag coefficient the results were more as expected the drag coefficient did for the presented scenario affect the peak tension as well as the overall tension acting on the rov however the effect was also here limited a doubling of the drag coefficient only resulted in a peak tension increase of 7 which is less then expected this shows that for the maneuver performed in the sensitivity analysis the cable stiffness was the most important parameter since the hydrodynamic parameters were of small importance and the cable mass was identical to the added mass using a cable with smaller module of elasticity less than 1 gpa could therefore give a higher relative importance of the hydrodynamic parameters to conclude the discussion it can be said that for the presented rov system and maneuver performed the hydrodynamic parameters have little effect on the rov response a more extensive sensitivity analysis could be performed where different rov systems and maneuvers are investigated this can produce more general results which will be interesting for further research 6 conclusions a novel three dimensional rov cable model is presented the cable is represented using euler bernoulli beam theory which is modified to allow for compression of the cable the spacial discretization is performed using linear finite element theory combined with a floating frame of reference formulation and the resulting discrete equations are solved using the newmark β time integration scheme the model is verified experimentally and the calculated deflections and tension forces show good agreement with the experimental results some differences between the simulated and experimental results are present but taking into account the relative large uncertainties present in the small scale experiment performed a major part of this difference can be attributed to experimental measurement errors the model is able to estimate the tension forces in the cable accurately with an approximate root mean square deviation of 7 n tuning of the parameters such as elasticity modulus hydrodynamic parameters or rigid body parameters could perhaps be performed to achieve better accuracy but this was not done as the experiments were meant to verify the accuracy of the presented model and not modify it verification of the modeling is performed by using published results for the steady state horizontal deflections of a tether management system the presented model is able to estimate the horizontal deflection with good accuracy when compared with the reference having a root mean square deviation rmsd of less than 4 7 m when using a 3000 m long cable and less than 1 m when using a 5000 m long cable a sensitivity analysis is performed on the hydrodynamic parameters and shows that for the presented scenario these parameters have little effect on the cable tension applied to the rov hence using advanced methods for accurately estimating these coefficients based on keulegan carpenter kc and reynolds numbers re would not be beneficial the sensitivity analysis is however only performed on a single rov system performing a single maneuver hence drawing any general conclusions is difficult for the tested case however it can be concluded that the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic parameters of the cable is small the presented model is able to estimate the response and tension forces of the cable used in a rov system with good accuracy it is one of only a few models verified experimentally and the functionality for real rov operations is therefore verified the model can therefore be used in numerical tools such as simulators and operator mission training utilization of the model in rov design is also an important benefit cable forces can dominate the overall response of a rov system including these forces in the design stage can help optimize the rov design with regards to e g maximum working depth required thrust minimum required hydrostatic restoring etc another possible use of the model is state estimation for deep water operations loss of acoustic positioning can frequently occur being able to estimate the response of the rov during this time can be crucial the model therefore presents a useful and versatile tool with applications to many different areas acknowledgment this work has been carried out at the center for

23246,seawater hydraulic axial piston pumps are widely used in underwater apparatus systems in recent years reliability of the valve port plate pair is vital to the performance of seawater hydraulic axial piston pumps as the distribution information of the material combinations and working conditions of seawater hydraulic axial piston pumps are insufficient the probability reliability analysis methods are not available for the valve port plate pair this paper develops a non probabilistic reliability convex model for the valve port plate pair firstly the rotation of the pump cylinder is partitioned into six stages based on this partition the dynamic models of contact pressure and pv value the product of contact specific pressure and linear velocity of the valve port plate pair are derived by accounting for the pre compression angle secondly the marginal interval for the limiting pv value it is the usual criterion to evaluate the critical operating conditions under which the material fails of the material combination was obtained through adhesive wear tests thirdly a limit state function is then established based on the stress strength interference model finally the analysis and sea test results indicate that the reliability of the valve port plate pair has significantly improved by adding auxiliary support on the port plate keywords axial piston pump convex model non probabilistic reliability reliability analysis seawater hydraulics valve port plate pair 1 introduction in the past two decades seawater hydraulic transmission has caught attention as an innovative technique the seawater hydraulic system has the function of pressure self compensation which are often designed into an open circuit system therefore it is suitable for application in ocean engineering and deep underwater apparatus such apparatuses include manned deep sea submersibles unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs autonomous underwater vehicles auvs underwater gliders underwater tool systems and so on liu et al 2010 isa et al 2014 yang et al 2016 seawater hydraulic axial piston pump swhap is a critical power component in underwater apparatus systems it can be widely used in variable ballast systems to control the depth and attitude of the underwater apparatus zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the valve port plate pair is one of the crucial frictional pairs in swhap as most of the leakage flow ripple and frictional loss generated are through this frictional pair which would result in a significant influence on the performance and reliability of swhap therefore the reliability analysis for valve port plate pair is essential to be considered during the development of swhap although the seawater hydraulic transmission technology has developed rapidly the research on the reliability of swhap is under reported due to the similarities between swhap and traditional oil axial piston pump many research efforts discussed in this paper are based on the reliability analysis and design optimization of the traditional oil axial piston pump xu 1991 and sun et al 1992 established the wear probabilistic reliability analysis and design method for the oil axial piston pump by using the stress strength interference model an efficient layered clustering algorithm method to diagnose and predict the reliability of aero hydraulic pump has been formulated by du et al 2013 zhang and liu 2013 presented the reliability design and sensitivity analysis of critical components in the oil axial piston pump and hydraulic pressure pipeline systems based on the random moment of matrix method the reliability applications in wear degradation and mechanism analysis as well as the accelerated life test of the hydraulic pumps and valves have also been reported yang et al 2014 ma et al 2015 daniel et al 2015 guo et al 2016 however these reliability analysis methods primarily are based on the probability theory with the premise that the distribution law of the stress material strength and pv value of the frictional pairs are known hu and du 2012 hu et al 2013 2014 it is believed that the material combinations in swhap such as stainless steel and polyetheretherketone peek engineering plastic are different from the oil axial piston pump the distribution information of the material combinations and working parameters in swhap are insufficient and only the interval value of the mentioned design parameters can be obtained it has been demonstrated that small deviation distribution parameters and their actual values may result in significant errors in the reliability analysis results ben haim and elishakoff 1990 therefore these probability reliability analysis methods for oil axial piston pump cannot be directly applied to the reliability of swhap without detailed distributions of the parameters which may lead to the early failure of the pump to remedy the deficiencies of the traditional probabilistic method and describe the parameter uncertainty when the deterministic information is inadequate the non probabilistic theory such as interval model and the convex model was proposed ben haim 1993 1994 elishakoff and elisseeff 1994 jiang et al 2007 in the past two decades many signs of progress have been made in non probabilistic reliability analysis methodologies guo et al 2001 and li et al 2013 developed some interval models to measure the non probabilistic reliability index for uncertainty structural analysis similarly a non probabilistic reliability model which considered the dependency of the interval variables had been established by xiao et al 2013 cao and duan 2005 established a non probabilistic reliability index to measure the safety of structures with both ellipsoidal models and interval parameters qiu 2003 provided a series of numerical algorithms of the non probabilistic for static structural mechanics and dynamical problems topology optimization based on the multi ellipsoid convex model and reliability analysis method based on a combination of probability and convex set models have been presented to deal with the grouped uncertainties luo et al 2009a 2009b in recent studies many innovations on the convex model have been made to improve its efficiency and accuracy the recent developments include the work of jiang and han where a correlation analysis technique is proposed jiang et al 2011 as well as a general convex model coupled with several practical algorithms jiang et al 2013 besides significant efforts have been reported regarding methods for time variant and time dependent reliability analyses jiang et al 2014a zhang et al 2017 comparatively the multidimensional parallelepiped model process was combined with the first passage failure mechanism to make time variant uncertainty analysis jiang et al 2014b 2015 more recently kang and zhang 2016 presented a minimum volume ellipsoidal convex model with which one can improve the efficiency and enhance the confidence level of the non probabilistic analysis although extensive work has been conducted to study the non probabilistic convex theory some severe problems inevitably will be caused when one introduces the non probabilistic reliability analysis techniques into the swhap problems firstly the seawater hydraulic axial piston pump is still in the stage of small batch design and production with limited available and uncertain information secondly the distribution parameters of the uncertain variables especially the distribution interval of stress pv value the product of the contact specific pressure and the linear velocity and limiting pv value it is the usual criterion to evaluate the critical operating conditions under which the material fails of the valve port plate pair in swhap have rarely been investigated thirdly no evidence has been found in the development of a suitable non probabilistic model to analyze the reliability of valve port plate frictional pair in swhap therefore it seems necessary to obtain the distribution interval of the uncertain variables of valve port plate frictional pair according to the property analyses of the mechanics and furthermore to develop a useful non probabilistic model for analyzing the reliability and optimizing the structure of valve port plate frictional pair in swhap the developed model will consider the uncertainties in the loading rotational speed and material properties of the valve port plate pair the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the force of the valve port plate pair is analyzed and the uncertainty characteristics of the limiting pv value of the material combination is obtained by friction and wear test based on that we establish a limit state function using the stress strength interference model in section 3 the non probabilistic reliability analysis method for the valve port plate pair is presented then the non probabilistic reliability analysis sensitivity analysis and design optimization of the valve port plate pair is given in section 4 discussions and conclusions are provided in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 statement of the problem in this section the failure problem of valve port plate pair in swhap is analyzed and we present the mechanical analysis and friction and wear test to discuss the major factors that affect the reliability of the valve port plate pair and then develop a limit state function for the non probabilistic reliability analysis 2 1 failure mode of valve port plate pair fig 1 illustrates the configuration of the middle pressure swhap that can work in a seawater environment as shown in fig 1 a the drive shaft drives the cylinder block and valve plate and the sliding bearing supports the cylinder and drive shaft component the valve port plate pair is designed based on the principle of redundant squeezing force several screws fix the port plate which is sealed with the o ring to avoid leakage in the port plate port flange gap the floating valve plate and the retainer spring could automatically compensate for the lubricating gap between the valve plate and port plate the rear sliding bearing could balance the eccentric moment caused by the port plate the material combinations of the pump such as aisi630 stainless steel and polyetheretherketone peek engineering plastic could resist wear and seawater corrosion in our preliminary study the safety factor and probabilistic reliability method based on hypothesis have been used to design the critical frictional pairs in swhap which leads to early failure of the port plate after a one hour performance test of swhap as illustrated in fig 1 b because the valve plate and port plate consists of hard and soft materials high contact pressure on the soft port plate would cause the adhesion of peek furthermore it can lead to the spalling of the injected peek from the stainless steel substrate therefore fig 1 b indicates that the primary failure mode of the port plate is the serious adhesion wear and disengaging of the injected peek therefore to improve the reliability of the valve port plate pair it is necessary to develop a non probabilistic reliability model to analyze and measure the reliability index accurately 2 2 mechanical analysis of the valve port plate pair 2 2 1 force analyses it is shown in fig 2 that the frictional pair of valve port plate in swhap is mainly affected by the pressing force p t and hydraulic thrust force p fm as swhap works in the discharge process the pressing force p t consists of retainer spring force p ti and the hydraulic pressure p s 1 p t k p s π d 2 4 p t i z where k is the number of the pistons in the high pressure zone d is the piston diameter and z is the number of pistons moreover the hydraulic thrust force p fm can be expressed as 2 p f m p d ϕ p 4 r 4 2 r 3 2 ln r 4 r 3 r 2 2 r 1 2 ln r 2 r 1 p i ϕ p 2 r 4 2 r 3 2 p i ϕ p 4 r 2 2 r 1 2 ln r 2 r 1 r 4 2 r 3 2 ln r 4 r 3 where p d is the pump discharge pressure p i is the pump inlet pressure r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 are the radiuses of port plate sealing land and ϕ p is the angular length of the high pressure zone to analyze the dynamic force distributions on the port plate ϕ p is an important parameter due to the angular lengths of the intake port are not equal to the discharge port ϕ p changes with the number and position of the pistons in the state of discharge in previous studies the effect of the pre compression angle has often been neglected manring and zhang 2001 in this research it is posited that the pump operation starts while one piston is located at the tdc of the port plate thus the rotation of the cylinder can be divided into six stages as presented in fig 3 by considering the pre compression angle of the port plate ϕ 1 the dynamic relationship between the k and cylinder rotation angle φ can be presented as 3 k z 1 2 0 φ ϕ 1 z 1 2 ϕ 1 φ α 0 2 z 1 2 α 0 2 φ α 0 where α 0 2π z is the angular dimension of a single piston when the cylinder rotates in the range of 0 to 0 φ ϕ 1 ϕ p is given by 4 ϕ p π α 0 2 φ ϕ 1 at this time the number of pistons in the high pressure zone can be represented as 5 k z 1 2 the dynamic relationship between ϕ p and φ in each flow distribution cycle is listed in table 1 where ψ is the angular length of a single kidney port in the valve plate 2 2 2 pv value analyses the contact specific pressure on the port plate is defined by 13 p v a l p t p f m a v a l where a v a l is the contact area of the valve port plate pair 14 a v a l π r 4 2 r 1 2 ϕ m 2 π 1 2 π ψ 0 r 3 2 r 2 2 where ψ 0 is the interval angle between the intake port and the discharge port and ϕ m is the angular length of the port plate sealing area the relative linear velocity of the valve port plate pair is expressed as 15 v v a l 2 π n 60 r 2 r 3 2 where n is the pump rotational speed with eq 13 and 14 the pv value of the valve port plate pair can be obtained as follows 16 p v v a l p v a l v v a l π n p t p f m r 2 r 3 60 a v a l π n r 2 r 3 60 a v a l z 1 π d 2 8 ϕ p 4 r 4 2 r 3 2 ln r 4 r 3 r 2 2 r 1 2 ln r 2 r 1 p s π n r 2 r 3 60 a v a l z 1 2 p t i p i ϕ p 2 r 4 2 r 3 2 p i ϕ p 4 r 4 2 r 3 2 ln r 4 r 3 r 2 2 r 1 2 ln r 2 r 1 n a p s b therefore the p v v a l can be defined as a function of p s and n with the coefficients a and b 2 3 adhesive wear studies for limiting pv due to the precise distribution parameters of the materials in swhap are not available and very expensive to obtain the adhesive wear test is conducted to discern the boundaries of limiting pv value of material combinations 2 3 1 brief introduction of the experiment based on the previous research the cfpeek aisi630 scheme is an ideal selection for the matching pair in middle high pressure seawater hydraulic axial piston pumps yang et al 2003 chen et al 2012 dong et al 2013 in this research the upper specimen was made of cfpeek and manufactured using the hot pressing sintering and molding technique which was filled with 30 volume fraction carbon fiber graphite and ptfe moreover the bottom specimen is the aisi630 stainless steel after solution and aging treatment the main physical and mechanical properties of specimens are listed in table 2 both the upper and bottom specimens were ultrasonically washed in an ethanol bath for fifteen minutes and then dried with hot air before and after each experiment adhesive wear studies were carried out on a rotational friction tester mcf 10 as shown in fig 4 the two dimensional force sensor was used to measure the sliding and frictional force between the material combination aqueous lubrication was achieved by filling the water tank with enough artificial seawater which was continuously circulated to prevent as much friction and wear properties from heat accumulation as possible the artificial seawater was synthesized according to the gb 17378 4 2007 standard and its chemical composition is shown in table 3 thus the sliding condition of the material combination was similar to that of the valve port plate pair in swhap the tests were carried out at a sliding speed from 1 0 to 3 0 m s with an ambient temperature of around 25 c and relative humidity of 45 6 the contact pressure was continuously increased until the adhesive wear occurred with coefficient of friction and torque drastically increasing the worn surface morphology of the specimens was analyzed by a fei quanta 200 scanning electron microscope sem each test condition was carried out five times by using the same standard to obtain reliable results and the average value of the product of linear velocity and the contact pressure is the limiting pv value of the material combination 2 3 2 result analysis of the adhesive wear test as an example the worn surface morphologies of cfpeek and aisi630 under linear velocity of 2 0 m s and contact pressure of 5 4 mpa are illustrated in fig 5 as can be seen in fig 5 a the worn surface of cfpeek is characterized by severe plastic deformation micro cracks delamination and covered with some thick and lumpy transfer film it is evident from fig 5 b that a large number of cfpeek debris is exposed on the aisi630 worn surface additionally the worn surface of aisi630 exhibits some scratches and bushy furrows moreover the carbon fiber debris exposed on the worn surface is served as third body abrasive particles which will induce severe further wear therefore it is evident from the above results that the main wear mechanism of cfpeek sliding against aisi630 steel under the present working condition is the severe adhesive wear fig 6 shows the change of limiting pv value of the cfpeek and aisi630 combination with linear velocity under different contact pressures it can be seen from fig 6 that the limiting pv value has less change under different working conditions moreover it indicates that the limiting pv value can be included within the interval 10 8 11 5 with small differences when the linear velocity varies therefore it can be concluded that the limiting pv value of the cfpeek and aisi630 combination is mainly affected by its inherent attribute 2 4 limit state function for swhap reliability analysis based on the stress strength interference theory the actual pv value of the valve port plate pair in swhap should not exceed the limiting pv value of the material combination therefore the limit state function can be formulated as follows 17 g p v p s n p v p v p v a p s b n when g p v p s n 0 a failure occurs the pv p s and n are the uncertain variables therefore the non probabilistic reliability analysis for valve port plate pair could be defined as a three dimensional problem and the three dimensional ellipsoidal convex model should be developed to calculate the non probabilistic reliability 3 non probabilistic reliability analysis 3 1 non probabilistic reliability index for the non probabilistic uncertainties x γ x the n dimensional vector could collect all the uncertain parameters in a structure so the uncertainty domain γ x of x is then quantified through a multidimensional ellipsoid 18 γ x x x x c t ω x x x c 1 where x c is the central point of the uncertain parameters and ω x denotes a characteristic matrix of the ellipsoid 19 ω x s 11 s 12 s 1 n s 21 s 22 s 1 n s n 1 s n 2 s n 3 s n n the midpoint and variance of the univariant convex model are given 20 x i c x i u x i l 2 21 d x i l x i w 2 x i u x i l 2 2 where x i u x i l and x i w are the upper bound lower bound and radius of each uncertain parameter x i respectively then the uncertain parameters x could be transformed into a set of regularized variables u u space 22 u i x i x i c x i w i 1 2 n the covariance and correlation coefficient for two arbitrary uncertain parameters x 1 and x 2 can be defined 23 cov x 1 x 2 tan γ 1 tan 2 γ d x 1 l d x 2 l 24 ρ x 1 x 2 cov x 1 x 2 d x 1 l d x 2 l where γ is the rotation angle of the ellipse from its normal state then eq 17 can be rewritten by covariance matrix c x 25 x x c t ω x x x c x x c t c x 1 x x c x x c t d x 1 l cov x 1 x 2 cov x 1 x n cov x 2 x 1 d x 2 l cov x 2 x n cov x n x 1 cov x n x 2 d x n l 1 x x c u t ρ 1 u u t ρ u 1 u 1 ρ u 1 u 2 ρ u 1 u n ρ u 2 u 1 ρ u 2 u 2 ρ u 2 u n ρ u n u 1 ρ u n u 2 ρ u n u n 1 u 1 based on the above transformations the uncertainty domain γ x can be changed to a convex set γ u in u space 26 γ u u u t ω u u 1 where ω u denotes a characteristic matrix of the convex model in u space ω u ρ 1 eigenvalue decomposition is then performed on the matrix ω u 27 φ t ω u φ λ φ t φ i where φ denotes an orthogonal matrix formed by the normalized eigenvectors and λ is a diagonal matrix consisting of the eigenvalues of ω u and i is an identity matrix another linear transformation is subsequently introduced 28 δ λ 1 2 φ t u the γ u can be transformed δ space 29 δ ω δ δ δ t δ 1 correspondingly a limit state function g in δ space can be expressed as 30 g δ 1 δ 2 δ n i 1 2 n as shown in fig 7 the parameter uncertainty is bounded by a unit sphere in the transformed standard space the non probabilistic reliability index η is defined as the minimal distance from the original point to the limit state surface jiang et al 2007 xiao et al 2013 which can well reflect the reliability degree of uncertain structures η 1 means that the failure field and the parameter uncertainty domain has an intersection and thus the structure has a possibility of failure conversely η 1 means an absolute safety state for the structure with the increase of η the parameter uncertainty domain will be further from the limit state function and hence the structure will become more reliable the reliability index η can be calculated by solving the following optimization problem 31 η min δ δ s u b j e c t t o g δ 0 a three dimensional problem for this research is considered and illustrated in fig 8 the limit state surface divides the whole ellipse into two different domains one of which separates into the safe region satisfying g δ 0 while the other one separates into the failure region satisfying g δ 0 it should be noted that the non probabilistic reliability index is only an index used to evaluate the safety extent of a structure for convenience not the reliability itself jiang et al 2013 as seen in traditional probability based reliability analysis the well known reliability index can be employed to evaluate the structural safety however the essence of the reliability is the probability of the uncertain parameters falling into the safety region instead of this index therefore the defined reliability r c of this problem can be measured through the following ratio of volumes 32 r c v v 1 v v c v where v denotes the volume of the whole convex model v 1 is the is the volume in the failure domain and v c is the volume in the safety domain respectively although the presented non probabilistic reliability r c can be quantified through the ratio of areas it is worth noting that the probability model and convex model are two types of entirely different means of dealing with the uncertainty the former is based on the detailed distributions of the parameters while the latter only needs the bound information of the uncertainty domain 3 2 implementation procedure the hasofer lind rackwitz fiessler algorithm hl rf and the improved hl rf ihl rf algorithm in the traditional reliability analysis have been proved very efficient for the above optimization problem jiang et al 2011 moreover the hl rf iterations are adopted as follows 33 η k g δ k g δ k t δ k g δ k 34 δ k 1 η k g δ k g δ k where g represents the gradient vector of g concerning the variables δ 35 g δ k g δ 1 g δ 2 g δ n t besides the multidimensional safety volume of an n dimensional problem can be analytically expressed as chen and he 2008 jiang et al 2013 36 v c π n 1 2 γ n 1 2 n 1 n 1 η 1 k 1 n 1 2 2 k 1 2 k 1 η 2 k n 3 is an odd number π n 1 2 γ n 1 2 n 1 n arcsin 1 η 2 η k 1 n 2 2 k 2 2 k 1 1 η 2 2 k 1 n 3 is an even number therefore the volume in the safety domain of the three dimensional problem is obtained by 37 v c 1 3 π 1 η 2 2 η therefore the non probabilistic reliability r c can be rewritten as 38 r c 0 η 1 v v 1 v v c v 1 η 0 v v 1 v v v c v 0 η 1 1 η 1 the flowchart for the non probabilistic reliability calculation is given in fig 9 as a criterion for convergence the numerical solution must be constrained by an additional boundary condition δ k 1 δ k ε the ε is set at a small value 10 5 to improve the accuracy of the iterative calculation 4 results and discussions in this section the non probabilistic reliability analyses of the valve port plate pair in swhap are presented to validate the proposed methodology as well as the sensitivity analysis moreover the structural optimization design of the valve port plate pair is also provided to improve the reliability of swhap the target reliability of the valve port plate pair should not be less than 0 999 xu 1991 ramsamooj and shugar 2002 zhou et al 2013 4 1 valve port plate pair reliability analysis according to the proposed methodology the p v v a l and limiting pv value of the material combination can be defined as stress and strength respectively therefore the limit state function for the valve port plate pair can be constructed as 39 g v p v p s n p v p v v a l p v a p s b n where pv p s and n can be defined as the uncertain interval variables x 1 x 2 x 3 the main geometrical parameters and working conditions of swhap are listed in table 4 accordingly the p v v a l is calculated and plotted in fig 10 it is evident from fig 10 that the maximum value of the valve port plate pair is 11 01 mpa m s as the number of the pistons in the high pressure zone is z 1 2 after substituting the related parameters into eq 38 the limit state function can be represented as 40 g v x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 4 6487 10 4 x 2 7 5813 10 4 x 3 based on the standardization of the variables x 1 x 2 x 3 the limit state function g in δ space is obtained by 41 g v δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 4 δ 1 14 3 1146 10 4 δ 2 7 2663 10 3 50 δ 3 1450 the computational results are efficiently obtained by using the present iterative algorithm in table 5 as the convergence is reached it can be found that the non probabilistic reliability index η and the non probabilistic reliability r c of the valve port plate pair are 0 8251 and 0 9822 respectively in other words the initial reliability of the valve port plate pair did not reach target value 0 999 so the sensitivity analysis of the non probabilistic reliability should be carried out and the structure of the valve port plate pair should be optimized to improve its inherent reliability 4 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis has been implemented to identify which interval variables have the most significant impact on the non probabilistic reliability of the valve port plate pair therefore to examine how the uncertain variables affect the non probabilistic reliability the ratio of deviation to the interval α and the mean value β concerning the uncertain interval variables can be defined by 42 α x i u x i l x i c 43 β x i c 1 x i c x i c the effects of the α on the non probabilistic reliability η are presented in fig 11 the results indicate that the limiting pv value of material combination makes the highest contribution to the non probabilistic reliability index and that the actual contact pressure and rotational speed make the smaller contributions fig 12 illustrated the effects of the β on the non probabilistic reliability η it is clear from fig 12 that the limiting pv value makes a positive contribution to the reliability of the valve port plate pair this means that an increase in limiting pv value will result in an improvement in non probabilistic reliability the selection of a proper material combination is therefore essential on the contrary the rotational speed and contact pressure make a negative contribution to the non probabilistic reliability of valve port plate pair which means that the increase in rotational speed and contact pressure will bring a decrease in non probabilistic reliability therefore the material combination working conditions and structural parameters are all critical to the reliability of valve port plate pair however due to the development limitation of the materials the limiting pv value of the material combination is difficult to increase therefore during the parameter design stage we should focus on the reduction of the structure s effect on the failure of the valve port plate pair moreover the optimization of the structure should be conducted to decrease the contact pv value of the valve port plate pair 4 3 design optimization of the port plate to increase the reliability of the valve port plate pair the increase of the contact area of the port plate is an effective way to decrease the contact pv value of the valve port plate pair it is believed that the internal and external radiuses of sealing land of the port plate are related to the sizes of the intake and discharge ports and the sizes of the intake and discharge ports are associated with the pump displacement and structure of the valve plate due to the increase of the radiuses of the sealing land which goes against the heat dissipation of valve port plate pair it is not suitable to increase the contact area by changing the dimensions of sealing land therefore under the dimensions of the invariable sealing land premise the auxiliary support could be added to the port plate to decrease the contact pv value as shown in fig 13 then eq 14 can be rewritten as 44 a v a l π r 4 2 r 1 2 ϕ m 2 π 1 2 π ψ 0 r 3 2 r 2 2 a f where a f denotes the area of the external auxiliary support integrating eqs 16 17 and 44 the improved limit state function of valve port plate pair is given by 45 g v x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 4 067 10 4 x 2 6 6293 10 4 x 3 moreover the limit state function g in δ space is represented as 46 g v δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 4 δ 1 14 2 7249 10 4 δ 2 6 3567 10 3 50 δ 3 1450 eq 46 can be solved by using the solution method as described in section 3 and the computational results are listed in table 6 it was shown that the non probabilistic reliability index η and the non probabilistic reliability r c of the valve port plate pair are 1 1862 and 1 respectively therefore the improved valve port plate structure is content with the needs of the reliability design 4 4 application of the proposed valve port plate pair based on the previous research an optimized port plate was fabricated and assembled into swhap as illustrated in fig 14 a test system driven by seawater hydraulics is developed to investigate the working performance of the valve port plate pair and swhap in deep sea environment the presented test system can work in 200 m deep sea environment which is mainly composited of the deep sea motor filters seawater hydraulic control valves seawater hydraulic motor and cylinder etc besides an underwater camera was used to observe and record the working pressure of swhap and seawater hydraulic motor as well as the reciprocating motion of the seawater hydraulic cylinder the sea test was carried out in the yellow sea of china longitude 121 10 4503 latitude 36 10 2995 near qingdao on august 28 the swhap has been tested for 6 h at the seawater depth of 33 m under the rotational speed of 1500 rpm with the outlet pressure of 14 mpa during the tests the seawater hydraulic motor and cylinder can operate normally under the working pressure of 14 mpa these results show that the early failure of swhap and the valve port plate pair did not happen during 6 h of loading test therefore it can be concluded that the proposed design optimization method was effective at improving the reliability of the valve port plate pair for further verification of the reliability of the proposed valve port plate pair an accelerated life test of swhap will be carried out in our future study 5 conclusions in this paper a non probabilistic reliability convex model was developed for the valve port plate pair of swhap by considering the pre compression angle the mathematical model and change law of the angular length of the high pressure zone have been obtained subsequently the actual contact pressure and pv value of the valve port plate pair were accurately calculated also the adhesive wear tests were implemented and the marginal interval for the limiting pv value of the material combination has been obtained the stress strength interference model was used to establish the limit state function the results show that the model can efficiently evaluate the reliability of the valve port plate pair under the limited information of the design parameters sensitivity analysis of uncertain variables showed that the contact pressure and rotational speed make the negative contribution to the reliability of valve port plate pair by adding the external auxiliary support on the port plate the contact pv value of the valve port plate pair decreased and the non probabilistic reliability of the valve port plate pair could be increased efficiently the analyses also showed that the deviation to the mean value of the contact pressure and rotational speed could affect the reliability of the valve port plate pair therefore it is crucial to reduce the pressure ripple of the seawater hydraulic axial piston pump on the premise that the rotational speed of the pump is constant acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the national natural science foundation of china

23246,seawater hydraulic axial piston pumps are widely used in underwater apparatus systems in recent years reliability of the valve port plate pair is vital to the performance of seawater hydraulic axial piston pumps as the distribution information of the material combinations and working conditions of seawater hydraulic axial piston pumps are insufficient the probability reliability analysis methods are not available for the valve port plate pair this paper develops a non probabilistic reliability convex model for the valve port plate pair firstly the rotation of the pump cylinder is partitioned into six stages based on this partition the dynamic models of contact pressure and pv value the product of contact specific pressure and linear velocity of the valve port plate pair are derived by accounting for the pre compression angle secondly the marginal interval for the limiting pv value it is the usual criterion to evaluate the critical operating conditions under which the material fails of the material combination was obtained through adhesive wear tests thirdly a limit state function is then established based on the stress strength interference model finally the analysis and sea test results indicate that the reliability of the valve port plate pair has significantly improved by adding auxiliary support on the port plate keywords axial piston pump convex model non probabilistic reliability reliability analysis seawater hydraulics valve port plate pair 1 introduction in the past two decades seawater hydraulic transmission has caught attention as an innovative technique the seawater hydraulic system has the function of pressure self compensation which are often designed into an open circuit system therefore it is suitable for application in ocean engineering and deep underwater apparatus such apparatuses include manned deep sea submersibles unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs autonomous underwater vehicles auvs underwater gliders underwater tool systems and so on liu et al 2010 isa et al 2014 yang et al 2016 seawater hydraulic axial piston pump swhap is a critical power component in underwater apparatus systems it can be widely used in variable ballast systems to control the depth and attitude of the underwater apparatus zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the valve port plate pair is one of the crucial frictional pairs in swhap as most of the leakage flow ripple and frictional loss generated are through this frictional pair which would result in a significant influence on the performance and reliability of swhap therefore the reliability analysis for valve port plate pair is essential to be considered during the development of swhap although the seawater hydraulic transmission technology has developed rapidly the research on the reliability of swhap is under reported due to the similarities between swhap and traditional oil axial piston pump many research efforts discussed in this paper are based on the reliability analysis and design optimization of the traditional oil axial piston pump xu 1991 and sun et al 1992 established the wear probabilistic reliability analysis and design method for the oil axial piston pump by using the stress strength interference model an efficient layered clustering algorithm method to diagnose and predict the reliability of aero hydraulic pump has been formulated by du et al 2013 zhang and liu 2013 presented the reliability design and sensitivity analysis of critical components in the oil axial piston pump and hydraulic pressure pipeline systems based on the random moment of matrix method the reliability applications in wear degradation and mechanism analysis as well as the accelerated life test of the hydraulic pumps and valves have also been reported yang et al 2014 ma et al 2015 daniel et al 2015 guo et al 2016 however these reliability analysis methods primarily are based on the probability theory with the premise that the distribution law of the stress material strength and pv value of the frictional pairs are known hu and du 2012 hu et al 2013 2014 it is believed that the material combinations in swhap such as stainless steel and polyetheretherketone peek engineering plastic are different from the oil axial piston pump the distribution information of the material combinations and working parameters in swhap are insufficient and only the interval value of the mentioned design parameters can be obtained it has been demonstrated that small deviation distribution parameters and their actual values may result in significant errors in the reliability analysis results ben haim and elishakoff 1990 therefore these probability reliability analysis methods for oil axial piston pump cannot be directly applied to the reliability of swhap without detailed distributions of the parameters which may lead to the early failure of the pump to remedy the deficiencies of the traditional probabilistic method and describe the parameter uncertainty when the deterministic information is inadequate the non probabilistic theory such as interval model and the convex model was proposed ben haim 1993 1994 elishakoff and elisseeff 1994 jiang et al 2007 in the past two decades many signs of progress have been made in non probabilistic reliability analysis methodologies guo et al 2001 and li et al 2013 developed some interval models to measure the non probabilistic reliability index for uncertainty structural analysis similarly a non probabilistic reliability model which considered the dependency of the interval variables had been established by xiao et al 2013 cao and duan 2005 established a non probabilistic reliability index to measure the safety of structures with both ellipsoidal models and interval parameters qiu 2003 provided a series of numerical algorithms of the non probabilistic for static structural mechanics and dynamical problems topology optimization based on the multi ellipsoid convex model and reliability analysis method based on a combination of probability and convex set models have been presented to deal with the grouped uncertainties luo et al 2009a 2009b in recent studies many innovations on the convex model have been made to improve its efficiency and accuracy the recent developments include the work of jiang and han where a correlation analysis technique is proposed jiang et al 2011 as well as a general convex model coupled with several practical algorithms jiang et al 2013 besides significant efforts have been reported regarding methods for time variant and time dependent reliability analyses jiang et al 2014a zhang et al 2017 comparatively the multidimensional parallelepiped model process was combined with the first passage failure mechanism to make time variant uncertainty analysis jiang et al 2014b 2015 more recently kang and zhang 2016 presented a minimum volume ellipsoidal convex model with which one can improve the efficiency and enhance the confidence level of the non probabilistic analysis although extensive work has been conducted to study the non probabilistic convex theory some severe problems inevitably will be caused when one introduces the non probabilistic reliability analysis techniques into the swhap problems firstly the seawater hydraulic axial piston pump is still in the stage of small batch design and production with limited available and uncertain information secondly the distribution parameters of the uncertain variables especially the distribution interval of stress pv value the product of the contact specific pressure and the linear velocity and limiting pv value it is the usual criterion to evaluate the critical operating conditions under which the material fails of the valve port plate pair in swhap have rarely been investigated thirdly no evidence has been found in the development of a suitable non probabilistic model to analyze the reliability of valve port plate frictional pair in swhap therefore it seems necessary to obtain the distribution interval of the uncertain variables of valve port plate frictional pair according to the property analyses of the mechanics and furthermore to develop a useful non probabilistic model for analyzing the reliability and optimizing the structure of valve port plate frictional pair in swhap the developed model will consider the uncertainties in the loading rotational speed and material properties of the valve port plate pair the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the force of the valve port plate pair is analyzed and the uncertainty characteristics of the limiting pv value of the material combination is obtained by friction and wear test based on that we establish a limit state function using the stress strength interference model in section 3 the non probabilistic reliability analysis method for the valve port plate pair is presented then the non probabilistic reliability analysis sensitivity analysis and design optimization of the valve port plate pair is given in section 4 discussions and conclusions are provided in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 statement of the problem in this section the failure problem of valve port plate pair in swhap is analyzed and we present the mechanical analysis and friction and wear test to discuss the major factors that affect the reliability of the valve port plate pair and then develop a limit state function for the non probabilistic reliability analysis 2 1 failure mode of valve port plate pair fig 1 illustrates the configuration of the middle pressure swhap that can work in a seawater environment as shown in fig 1 a the drive shaft drives the cylinder block and valve plate and the sliding bearing supports the cylinder and drive shaft component the valve port plate pair is designed based on the principle of redundant squeezing force several screws fix the port plate which is sealed with the o ring to avoid leakage in the port plate port flange gap the floating valve plate and the retainer spring could automatically compensate for the lubricating gap between the valve plate and port plate the rear sliding bearing could balance the eccentric moment caused by the port plate the material combinations of the pump such as aisi630 stainless steel and polyetheretherketone peek engineering plastic could resist wear and seawater corrosion in our preliminary study the safety factor and probabilistic reliability method based on hypothesis have been used to design the critical frictional pairs in swhap which leads to early failure of the port plate after a one hour performance test of swhap as illustrated in fig 1 b because the valve plate and port plate consists of hard and soft materials high contact pressure on the soft port plate would cause the adhesion of peek furthermore it can lead to the spalling of the injected peek from the stainless steel substrate therefore fig 1 b indicates that the primary failure mode of the port plate is the serious adhesion wear and disengaging of the injected peek therefore to improve the reliability of the valve port plate pair it is necessary to develop a non probabilistic reliability model to analyze and measure the reliability index accurately 2 2 mechanical analysis of the valve port plate pair 2 2 1 force analyses it is shown in fig 2 that the frictional pair of valve port plate in swhap is mainly affected by the pressing force p t and hydraulic thrust force p fm as swhap works in the discharge process the pressing force p t consists of retainer spring force p ti and the hydraulic pressure p s 1 p t k p s π d 2 4 p t i z where k is the number of the pistons in the high pressure zone d is the piston diameter and z is the number of pistons moreover the hydraulic thrust force p fm can be expressed as 2 p f m p d ϕ p 4 r 4 2 r 3 2 ln r 4 r 3 r 2 2 r 1 2 ln r 2 r 1 p i ϕ p 2 r 4 2 r 3 2 p i ϕ p 4 r 2 2 r 1 2 ln r 2 r 1 r 4 2 r 3 2 ln r 4 r 3 where p d is the pump discharge pressure p i is the pump inlet pressure r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 are the radiuses of port plate sealing land and ϕ p is the angular length of the high pressure zone to analyze the dynamic force distributions on the port plate ϕ p is an important parameter due to the angular lengths of the intake port are not equal to the discharge port ϕ p changes with the number and position of the pistons in the state of discharge in previous studies the effect of the pre compression angle has often been neglected manring and zhang 2001 in this research it is posited that the pump operation starts while one piston is located at the tdc of the port plate thus the rotation of the cylinder can be divided into six stages as presented in fig 3 by considering the pre compression angle of the port plate ϕ 1 the dynamic relationship between the k and cylinder rotation angle φ can be presented as 3 k z 1 2 0 φ ϕ 1 z 1 2 ϕ 1 φ α 0 2 z 1 2 α 0 2 φ α 0 where α 0 2π z is the angular dimension of a single piston when the cylinder rotates in the range of 0 to 0 φ ϕ 1 ϕ p is given by 4 ϕ p π α 0 2 φ ϕ 1 at this time the number of pistons in the high pressure zone can be represented as 5 k z 1 2 the dynamic relationship between ϕ p and φ in each flow distribution cycle is listed in table 1 where ψ is the angular length of a single kidney port in the valve plate 2 2 2 pv value analyses the contact specific pressure on the port plate is defined by 13 p v a l p t p f m a v a l where a v a l is the contact area of the valve port plate pair 14 a v a l π r 4 2 r 1 2 ϕ m 2 π 1 2 π ψ 0 r 3 2 r 2 2 where ψ 0 is the interval angle between the intake port and the discharge port and ϕ m is the angular length of the port plate sealing area the relative linear velocity of the valve port plate pair is expressed as 15 v v a l 2 π n 60 r 2 r 3 2 where n is the pump rotational speed with eq 13 and 14 the pv value of the valve port plate pair can be obtained as follows 16 p v v a l p v a l v v a l π n p t p f m r 2 r 3 60 a v a l π n r 2 r 3 60 a v a l z 1 π d 2 8 ϕ p 4 r 4 2 r 3 2 ln r 4 r 3 r 2 2 r 1 2 ln r 2 r 1 p s π n r 2 r 3 60 a v a l z 1 2 p t i p i ϕ p 2 r 4 2 r 3 2 p i ϕ p 4 r 4 2 r 3 2 ln r 4 r 3 r 2 2 r 1 2 ln r 2 r 1 n a p s b therefore the p v v a l can be defined as a function of p s and n with the coefficients a and b 2 3 adhesive wear studies for limiting pv due to the precise distribution parameters of the materials in swhap are not available and very expensive to obtain the adhesive wear test is conducted to discern the boundaries of limiting pv value of material combinations 2 3 1 brief introduction of the experiment based on the previous research the cfpeek aisi630 scheme is an ideal selection for the matching pair in middle high pressure seawater hydraulic axial piston pumps yang et al 2003 chen et al 2012 dong et al 2013 in this research the upper specimen was made of cfpeek and manufactured using the hot pressing sintering and molding technique which was filled with 30 volume fraction carbon fiber graphite and ptfe moreover the bottom specimen is the aisi630 stainless steel after solution and aging treatment the main physical and mechanical properties of specimens are listed in table 2 both the upper and bottom specimens were ultrasonically washed in an ethanol bath for fifteen minutes and then dried with hot air before and after each experiment adhesive wear studies were carried out on a rotational friction tester mcf 10 as shown in fig 4 the two dimensional force sensor was used to measure the sliding and frictional force between the material combination aqueous lubrication was achieved by filling the water tank with enough artificial seawater which was continuously circulated to prevent as much friction and wear properties from heat accumulation as possible the artificial seawater was synthesized according to the gb 17378 4 2007 standard and its chemical composition is shown in table 3 thus the sliding condition of the material combination was similar to that of the valve port plate pair in swhap the tests were carried out at a sliding speed from 1 0 to 3 0 m s with an ambient temperature of around 25 c and relative humidity of 45 6 the contact pressure was continuously increased until the adhesive wear occurred with coefficient of friction and torque drastically increasing the worn surface morphology of the specimens was analyzed by a fei quanta 200 scanning electron microscope sem each test condition was carried out five times by using the same standard to obtain reliable results and the average value of the product of linear velocity and the contact pressure is the limiting pv value of the material combination 2 3 2 result analysis of the adhesive wear test as an example the worn surface morphologies of cfpeek and aisi630 under linear velocity of 2 0 m s and contact pressure of 5 4 mpa are illustrated in fig 5 as can be seen in fig 5 a the worn surface of cfpeek is characterized by severe plastic deformation micro cracks delamination and covered with some thick and lumpy transfer film it is evident from fig 5 b that a large number of cfpeek debris is exposed on the aisi630 worn surface additionally the worn surface of aisi630 exhibits some scratches and bushy furrows moreover the carbon fiber debris exposed on the worn surface is served as third body abrasive particles which will induce severe further wear therefore it is evident from the above results that the main wear mechanism of cfpeek sliding against aisi630 steel under the present working condition is the severe adhesive wear fig 6 shows the change of limiting pv value of the cfpeek and aisi630 combination with linear velocity under different contact pressures it can be seen from fig 6 that the limiting pv value has less change under different working conditions moreover it indicates that the limiting pv value can be included within the interval 10 8 11 5 with small differences when the linear velocity varies therefore it can be concluded that the limiting pv value of the cfpeek and aisi630 combination is mainly affected by its inherent attribute 2 4 limit state function for swhap reliability analysis based on the stress strength interference theory the actual pv value of the valve port plate pair in swhap should not exceed the limiting pv value of the material combination therefore the limit state function can be formulated as follows 17 g p v p s n p v p v p v a p s b n when g p v p s n 0 a failure occurs the pv p s and n are the uncertain variables therefore the non probabilistic reliability analysis for valve port plate pair could be defined as a three dimensional problem and the three dimensional ellipsoidal convex model should be developed to calculate the non probabilistic reliability 3 non probabilistic reliability analysis 3 1 non probabilistic reliability index for the non probabilistic uncertainties x γ x the n dimensional vector could collect all the uncertain parameters in a structure so the uncertainty domain γ x of x is then quantified through a multidimensional ellipsoid 18 γ x x x x c t ω x x x c 1 where x c is the central point of the uncertain parameters and ω x denotes a characteristic matrix of the ellipsoid 19 ω x s 11 s 12 s 1 n s 21 s 22 s 1 n s n 1 s n 2 s n 3 s n n the midpoint and variance of the univariant convex model are given 20 x i c x i u x i l 2 21 d x i l x i w 2 x i u x i l 2 2 where x i u x i l and x i w are the upper bound lower bound and radius of each uncertain parameter x i respectively then the uncertain parameters x could be transformed into a set of regularized variables u u space 22 u i x i x i c x i w i 1 2 n the covariance and correlation coefficient for two arbitrary uncertain parameters x 1 and x 2 can be defined 23 cov x 1 x 2 tan γ 1 tan 2 γ d x 1 l d x 2 l 24 ρ x 1 x 2 cov x 1 x 2 d x 1 l d x 2 l where γ is the rotation angle of the ellipse from its normal state then eq 17 can be rewritten by covariance matrix c x 25 x x c t ω x x x c x x c t c x 1 x x c x x c t d x 1 l cov x 1 x 2 cov x 1 x n cov x 2 x 1 d x 2 l cov x 2 x n cov x n x 1 cov x n x 2 d x n l 1 x x c u t ρ 1 u u t ρ u 1 u 1 ρ u 1 u 2 ρ u 1 u n ρ u 2 u 1 ρ u 2 u 2 ρ u 2 u n ρ u n u 1 ρ u n u 2 ρ u n u n 1 u 1 based on the above transformations the uncertainty domain γ x can be changed to a convex set γ u in u space 26 γ u u u t ω u u 1 where ω u denotes a characteristic matrix of the convex model in u space ω u ρ 1 eigenvalue decomposition is then performed on the matrix ω u 27 φ t ω u φ λ φ t φ i where φ denotes an orthogonal matrix formed by the normalized eigenvectors and λ is a diagonal matrix consisting of the eigenvalues of ω u and i is an identity matrix another linear transformation is subsequently introduced 28 δ λ 1 2 φ t u the γ u can be transformed δ space 29 δ ω δ δ δ t δ 1 correspondingly a limit state function g in δ space can be expressed as 30 g δ 1 δ 2 δ n i 1 2 n as shown in fig 7 the parameter uncertainty is bounded by a unit sphere in the transformed standard space the non probabilistic reliability index η is defined as the minimal distance from the original point to the limit state surface jiang et al 2007 xiao et al 2013 which can well reflect the reliability degree of uncertain structures η 1 means that the failure field and the parameter uncertainty domain has an intersection and thus the structure has a possibility of failure conversely η 1 means an absolute safety state for the structure with the increase of η the parameter uncertainty domain will be further from the limit state function and hence the structure will become more reliable the reliability index η can be calculated by solving the following optimization problem 31 η min δ δ s u b j e c t t o g δ 0 a three dimensional problem for this research is considered and illustrated in fig 8 the limit state surface divides the whole ellipse into two different domains one of which separates into the safe region satisfying g δ 0 while the other one separates into the failure region satisfying g δ 0 it should be noted that the non probabilistic reliability index is only an index used to evaluate the safety extent of a structure for convenience not the reliability itself jiang et al 2013 as seen in traditional probability based reliability analysis the well known reliability index can be employed to evaluate the structural safety however the essence of the reliability is the probability of the uncertain parameters falling into the safety region instead of this index therefore the defined reliability r c of this problem can be measured through the following ratio of volumes 32 r c v v 1 v v c v where v denotes the volume of the whole convex model v 1 is the is the volume in the failure domain and v c is the volume in the safety domain respectively although the presented non probabilistic reliability r c can be quantified through the ratio of areas it is worth noting that the probability model and convex model are two types of entirely different means of dealing with the uncertainty the former is based on the detailed distributions of the parameters while the latter only needs the bound information of the uncertainty domain 3 2 implementation procedure the hasofer lind rackwitz fiessler algorithm hl rf and the improved hl rf ihl rf algorithm in the traditional reliability analysis have been proved very efficient for the above optimization problem jiang et al 2011 moreover the hl rf iterations are adopted as follows 33 η k g δ k g δ k t δ k g δ k 34 δ k 1 η k g δ k g δ k where g represents the gradient vector of g concerning the variables δ 35 g δ k g δ 1 g δ 2 g δ n t besides the multidimensional safety volume of an n dimensional problem can be analytically expressed as chen and he 2008 jiang et al 2013 36 v c π n 1 2 γ n 1 2 n 1 n 1 η 1 k 1 n 1 2 2 k 1 2 k 1 η 2 k n 3 is an odd number π n 1 2 γ n 1 2 n 1 n arcsin 1 η 2 η k 1 n 2 2 k 2 2 k 1 1 η 2 2 k 1 n 3 is an even number therefore the volume in the safety domain of the three dimensional problem is obtained by 37 v c 1 3 π 1 η 2 2 η therefore the non probabilistic reliability r c can be rewritten as 38 r c 0 η 1 v v 1 v v c v 1 η 0 v v 1 v v v c v 0 η 1 1 η 1 the flowchart for the non probabilistic reliability calculation is given in fig 9 as a criterion for convergence the numerical solution must be constrained by an additional boundary condition δ k 1 δ k ε the ε is set at a small value 10 5 to improve the accuracy of the iterative calculation 4 results and discussions in this section the non probabilistic reliability analyses of the valve port plate pair in swhap are presented to validate the proposed methodology as well as the sensitivity analysis moreover the structural optimization design of the valve port plate pair is also provided to improve the reliability of swhap the target reliability of the valve port plate pair should not be less than 0 999 xu 1991 ramsamooj and shugar 2002 zhou et al 2013 4 1 valve port plate pair reliability analysis according to the proposed methodology the p v v a l and limiting pv value of the material combination can be defined as stress and strength respectively therefore the limit state function for the valve port plate pair can be constructed as 39 g v p v p s n p v p v v a l p v a p s b n where pv p s and n can be defined as the uncertain interval variables x 1 x 2 x 3 the main geometrical parameters and working conditions of swhap are listed in table 4 accordingly the p v v a l is calculated and plotted in fig 10 it is evident from fig 10 that the maximum value of the valve port plate pair is 11 01 mpa m s as the number of the pistons in the high pressure zone is z 1 2 after substituting the related parameters into eq 38 the limit state function can be represented as 40 g v x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 4 6487 10 4 x 2 7 5813 10 4 x 3 based on the standardization of the variables x 1 x 2 x 3 the limit state function g in δ space is obtained by 41 g v δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 4 δ 1 14 3 1146 10 4 δ 2 7 2663 10 3 50 δ 3 1450 the computational results are efficiently obtained by using the present iterative algorithm in table 5 as the convergence is reached it can be found that the non probabilistic reliability index η and the non probabilistic reliability r c of the valve port plate pair are 0 8251 and 0 9822 respectively in other words the initial reliability of the valve port plate pair did not reach target value 0 999 so the sensitivity analysis of the non probabilistic reliability should be carried out and the structure of the valve port plate pair should be optimized to improve its inherent reliability 4 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis has been implemented to identify which interval variables have the most significant impact on the non probabilistic reliability of the valve port plate pair therefore to examine how the uncertain variables affect the non probabilistic reliability the ratio of deviation to the interval α and the mean value β concerning the uncertain interval variables can be defined by 42 α x i u x i l x i c 43 β x i c 1 x i c x i c the effects of the α on the non probabilistic reliability η are presented in fig 11 the results indicate that the limiting pv value of material combination makes the highest contribution to the non probabilistic reliability index and that the actual contact pressure and rotational speed make the smaller contributions fig 12 illustrated the effects of the β on the non probabilistic reliability η it is clear from fig 12 that the limiting pv value makes a positive contribution to the reliability of the valve port plate pair this means that an increase in limiting pv value will result in an improvement in non probabilistic reliability the selection of a proper material combination is therefore essential on the contrary the rotational speed and contact pressure make a negative contribution to the non probabilistic reliability of valve port plate pair which means that the increase in rotational speed and contact pressure will bring a decrease in non probabilistic reliability therefore the material combination working conditions and structural parameters are all critical to the reliability of valve port plate pair however due to the development limitation of the materials the limiting pv value of the material combination is difficult to increase therefore during the parameter design stage we should focus on the reduction of the structure s effect on the failure of the valve port plate pair moreover the optimization of the structure should be conducted to decrease the contact pv value of the valve port plate pair 4 3 design optimization of the port plate to increase the reliability of the valve port plate pair the increase of the contact area of the port plate is an effective way to decrease the contact pv value of the valve port plate pair it is believed that the internal and external radiuses of sealing land of the port plate are related to the sizes of the intake and discharge ports and the sizes of the intake and discharge ports are associated with the pump displacement and structure of the valve plate due to the increase of the radiuses of the sealing land which goes against the heat dissipation of valve port plate pair it is not suitable to increase the contact area by changing the dimensions of sealing land therefore under the dimensions of the invariable sealing land premise the auxiliary support could be added to the port plate to decrease the contact pv value as shown in fig 13 then eq 14 can be rewritten as 44 a v a l π r 4 2 r 1 2 ϕ m 2 π 1 2 π ψ 0 r 3 2 r 2 2 a f where a f denotes the area of the external auxiliary support integrating eqs 16 17 and 44 the improved limit state function of valve port plate pair is given by 45 g v x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 4 067 10 4 x 2 6 6293 10 4 x 3 moreover the limit state function g in δ space is represented as 46 g v δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 4 δ 1 14 2 7249 10 4 δ 2 6 3567 10 3 50 δ 3 1450 eq 46 can be solved by using the solution method as described in section 3 and the computational results are listed in table 6 it was shown that the non probabilistic reliability index η and the non probabilistic reliability r c of the valve port plate pair are 1 1862 and 1 respectively therefore the improved valve port plate structure is content with the needs of the reliability design 4 4 application of the proposed valve port plate pair based on the previous research an optimized port plate was fabricated and assembled into swhap as illustrated in fig 14 a test system driven by seawater hydraulics is developed to investigate the working performance of the valve port plate pair and swhap in deep sea environment the presented test system can work in 200 m deep sea environment which is mainly composited of the deep sea motor filters seawater hydraulic control valves seawater hydraulic motor and cylinder etc besides an underwater camera was used to observe and record the working pressure of swhap and seawater hydraulic motor as well as the reciprocating motion of the seawater hydraulic cylinder the sea test was carried out in the yellow sea of china longitude 121 10 4503 latitude 36 10 2995 near qingdao on august 28 the swhap has been tested for 6 h at the seawater depth of 33 m under the rotational speed of 1500 rpm with the outlet pressure of 14 mpa during the tests the seawater hydraulic motor and cylinder can operate normally under the working pressure of 14 mpa these results show that the early failure of swhap and the valve port plate pair did not happen during 6 h of loading test therefore it can be concluded that the proposed design optimization method was effective at improving the reliability of the valve port plate pair for further verification of the reliability of the proposed valve port plate pair an accelerated life test of swhap will be carried out in our future study 5 conclusions in this paper a non probabilistic reliability convex model was developed for the valve port plate pair of swhap by considering the pre compression angle the mathematical model and change law of the angular length of the high pressure zone have been obtained subsequently the actual contact pressure and pv value of the valve port plate pair were accurately calculated also the adhesive wear tests were implemented and the marginal interval for the limiting pv value of the material combination has been obtained the stress strength interference model was used to establish the limit state function the results show that the model can efficiently evaluate the reliability of the valve port plate pair under the limited information of the design parameters sensitivity analysis of uncertain variables showed that the contact pressure and rotational speed make the negative contribution to the reliability of valve port plate pair by adding the external auxiliary support on the port plate the contact pv value of the valve port plate pair decreased and the non probabilistic reliability of the valve port plate pair could be increased efficiently the analyses also showed that the deviation to the mean value of the contact pressure and rotational speed could affect the reliability of the valve port plate pair therefore it is crucial to reduce the pressure ripple of the seawater hydraulic axial piston pump on the premise that the rotational speed of the pump is constant acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the national natural science foundation of china

23247,the main object of this paper is to investigate the deformation characteristics of a composite hydrofoil via numerical simulations the aims of this paper are to 1 validate the 3d numerical simulation method with fluid structure interaction modeling of composite materials 2 investigate the effects of ply angles on hydrodynamics forces and structural deformations of the composite hydrofoil and 3 investigate the relationship between tip twist angle β and properties of the composite hydrofoil based on the classical laminate theory analysis numerical results are presented for a modified naca0009 composite hydrofoil which has an unswept trapezoidal planform of aspect ratio 3 33 the fluid structure coupling method is proposed and validated with the experiment data by zarruk et al 7 the hydrodynamic forces and structural deformations of the composite hydrofoil with different ply angles have been investigated at re 1 106 and initial angle of attack α 6 the results show that lift and drag coefficients and tip twist angle decrease as the ply angle increases from negative ply angle to positive ply angle the twist angle plays a significant role in lift and drag coefficients as well as the distribution of normalized lift and drag along spanwise direction it should be noted that the composite hydrofoil with larger deformation is more probable to fail according to the inverse reserve factor with tsai wu criteria the expression on elements of bending stiffness matrices d has been derived to estimate tip twist angle keywords composite hydrofoil deformation characteristics ply angles bending twisting coupling 1 introduction propellers have been traditionally made from metal alloys which are prone to fatigue induced cracking and have relatively poor acoustic damping and low fuel efficiency andersen et al 2009 recently with the increasing development of the hydraulic machinery and marine propulsion the composite material has been used to replace metal material for the main components as it can improve the performance and fuel efficiency of propulsors lin and lee lin et al 2009 investigated the performance of two composite propellers with different stacking sequences the results showed that composite materials can reduce torque and increase efficiency due to the decrease of pitch the composite materials provide valuable applications in the aerospace industry due to its great advantages such as higher strength to weight ratios improved vibration damping properties and reduced magnetic electric signatures mouritz et al 2001 the composite materials have been applied in helicopter wing to reduce vibration and loads glaz et al 2009 the x 29a plane utilizes swept forward composite wings to control divergence and reduce bending moments near the wing root krone considering the different fluid properties of air and water as well as varying harsh marine environment spatially and temporally with cavitation and ventilation the structural response of composite materials in water becomes more complex than that in air wu et al 2017 because the intrinsic bending twisting and bend extension coupling behaviors of composite materials also have significant effects on structural response it has been very necessary to investigate the structural responses of composite materials and the influence of intrinsic coupling behaviors on fluid structure interaction of composite materials in water zarruk et al 2014 compared two modified naca0009 hydrofoils used fiber reinforced polymers with the carbon fibers aligned at 0 and 30 along the spanwise of hydrofoil they found that cfrp30 had a trend of decrease on incidence angle under loads which was different from cfrp00 and metallic materials gowing et al 1998 presented experimental data for two composite materials which showed that under appropriate loading tip deflections reduced the effective angle of attack and therefore reduced loading in the tip region in order to investigate the influence of layer properties of composite materials more effectively the numerical method are more effective than experiment because experiment may face some problems such as huge costs with many factors and a wide variation in constitutive properties or material strengths with imperfections potter et al 2008 the coupling method is crucial to the numerical simulations many numerical studies on isotropic flexible hydrofoils have been presented utilizing several coupling methods wu et al 2015 2018 and wang et al 2017 investigated hydroelastic response of a flexible naca66 hydrofoil in cavitating flows with a two degrees of freedom model describing the bending h and the twisting θ of foil the results showed that cavitation had significant effects on the foil deformation and the unsteady characteristics of the hydroelastic response the bending deformation was enhanced when the cavitation occurred ducoin et al 2009 numerically analyzed a deformable hydrofoil with transient pitching motion with a cfd finite volume code cfx for the fluid and a csd finite element code ansys for the structure which showed the structural response appeared to be strongly linked to hydrodynamic phenomena such as boundary layer laminar to turbulent transition and leading edge vortex shedding wang et al 2008 combined fluent and abaqus to achieve a coupling simulation on 3 d wing deformation in a subsonic flow the results showed that lift and drag data were made up with several periodic elements of different frequencies which were on the basis of wing s nature frequencies composite structures are manufactured by many layers thus the properties of composite structures are influenced by many factors such as ply angles stacking sequence and material properties of single layer it s necessary to consider the properties of composite materials in the numerical model the finite element analysis models for composites have developed from equivalent single layer theories such as classical lamination theory or the first order shear deformation theory to continuum based 3d elasticity theory zhang and yang 2008 kim and gupta 1990 guo et al 2002 as a classical theory the clt has been used to study the effects of ply angles on twist of a laminate murray et al 2015 liu and young 2007 the results showed that twist curvatures could represent the twist of a laminate qualitatively young 2008 utilized a coupled boundary element and finite element approach to study fsi effects on composite propellers and validated numerical results with experiments which showed improved performance of propeller due to decrease of rake and pitch angle by bend twist coupling effects although the effects of ply angles on structural response have been studied by some experiments and numerical researches from structure view there are lack of a validated numerical method considered 3d structure of composite materials and systematical studies on effects of ply angle under hydrodynamic conditions the objective of this paper is to validate 3d numerical simulation method with fluid structure interaction of composite materials comparing to experiments investigate the hydrodynamic forces and deformations influenced by different ply angles and study the relation between tip twist angle and properties of the composite hydrofoil 2 numerical model 2 1 solid model the geometry of the hydrofoil has an unswept trapezoidal planform with 0 3 m span 0 12 m base chord and 0 06 m tip chord as shown in fig 1 the section profile of the hydrofoil is a modified naca0009 whose equation is shown as below 1 y i c i 0 45 0 2969 x i c i 0 5 0 126 x i c i 0 3516 x i c i 2 0 2843 x i c i 3 0 08890 x i c i 4 where x i y i and c i mean distance along chord distance perpendicular to chord and chord in i section respectively also shown in fig 1 the layers of the composite hydrofoil which are in accordance with zarruk et al 2014 which are mixed with carbon fabrics and three kinds of e glass fabrics table 1 shows the structural properties of the four fabric layers the stacking sequence of the composite hydrofoil is 0 90 g basket 0 90 g biaxial θ 5c 0 90 2g biaxial θ 4c s with one glass mat layer in the center of the hydrofoil where the subscript g and c represent glass fabrics and carbon fabrics respectively the subscript s means that the layers are symmetrical about the mid plan and θ refers to the angle between axes of carbon fabrics and local axes the stacking sequence and definition of ply angle are shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b respectively the finite elements model of the composite hydrofoil is established based on ansys acp and mechanical which is shown in fig 3 the type of element is solid186 3 d 20 node layered structural solid which can undergo large pressure gradient and nonlinearity to obtain more accurate deformations 2 2 fluid model the governing equations for incompressible flow without gravitational force are described as below 2 v j x j 0 3 ρ f v i t ρ f v i v j x j p x i μ f 2 v i x j x j where v j ρ f μ f and p refer to velocity density dynamic viscosity and pressure and the subscript i j represent the coordinates the k ω sst turbulence model menter 1993 is adopted in the present work 4 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k d k x j μ μ t σ k k x j 5 ρ ω t ρ u j ω x j c ω p ω β ω ρ ω 2 x j μ μ t σ k ω x j 2 ρ 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j where k and ω represent turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent frequency respectively p k and p ω are production terms d k is the destruction term and f 1 is blending functions the fluid domain is consistent with the experimental setup zarruk et al 2014 whose test section is 0 6m square by 2 6m long the hydrofoil is located at the 0 7 m from the entrance the boundary conditions of the 3 d fluid domain are shown in fig 4 the free stream velocity u of inlet is calculated from reynolds numbers re u c νf where c respects mean chord c 0 09 m the absolute pressure of outlet is set as 1atm to prevent cavitation the overall mesh consists about 3 52m elements the mesh refinement near the hydrofoil is adopted near the hydrofoil to obtain the accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic performance as shown in fig 5 2 3 fsi coupling modeling fig 6 shows the flow chart of the fsi coupling algorithm used in this paper firstly the structure solver solves the structural deformation with applied loads from cfd solver in the previous time iteration step or initialization then the cfd solver commercial software cfx is used to update the mesh of fluid domain according to the structural deformation and to solve the flow fields to realize the data transfer the interfaces have been applied which can transfer fluid force from cfd solver to structure solver and displacements in the opposed direction with predefined relation the boundary definition for the interfaces has been presented in fig 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical validations the steady state simulation has been adopted in this work and the predicted lift coefficient c l 2 l ρ l u 2 s c and drag coefficient c d 2 d ρ l u 2 s c are compared to the experiments by zarruk et al 2014 for two reynolds numbers with different initial angles of attack α 0 at ply angle θ 0 as shown in fig 8 where l d and s refer to lift drag and hydrofoil span s 0 3 m respectively the trends of lift and drag coefficients are consistent with the experiment as initial attack of angle increases both lift and drag coefficients experience an increase with reynolds number increasing the lift coefficient has same trend with reynolds number while the drag coefficient is opposite to further validate the numerical methods the deformation of composite hydrofoils for two ply angles is calculated with different initial angles of attack as shown in fig 9 and the detailed mean deflections δ and twist angles β at tip are extracted and compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 both the twist angle and the mean deflection at tip for two ply angles show a good agreement with the experimental results for both hydrofoils the twist angle has a linear dependence on initial angles of attack while the twist angle at tip is negative at θ 30 which is in opposed to the positive twist angle with θ 0 the deflection increases from base to tip and the largest deflection can be observed at tip and both maximum deformation for two ply angles increase linearly as incidence angle increases 3 2 the effects of ply angles on hydrodynamic forces and structural deformations to further investigate the intrinsic coupling effects of composite materials the effects of ply angles on hydrodynamic forces and deformations have been studied at re 1 106 and α 0 6 with different ply angles fig 12 shows the lift and drag coefficients with different ply angles for re 1 106 and α 0 6 as the ply angle increases from negative ply angle to positive ply angle the lift and drag coefficients decrease get minimum at θ 35 and then increase again considering that the variation of forces is determined by the distribution of pressure on the composite hydrofoil and influenced by the deformations of the composite hydrofoil fig 13 shows the pressure contours and deformation at tip of the hydrofoil as a function of ply angles the twist angle at tip has similar trend with lift and drag coefficients and gets minimum at θ 40 when the effective angle increases the region of higher and lower pressure enlarge which can lead to larger forces thus the twist angle plays a significant role in variation of fluid field as the structural responses of the composite hydrofoil is solved based on a three dimensional fluid field it is necessary to consider variation of the hydrodynamic forces and structural deformations in spanwise direction which is helpful to understand the fluid structure interaction comprehensively divide the geometry into several parts as shown in fig 14 and calculate the sectional lift and drag in green lines fig 15 shows the normalized lift and drag per unit width along spanwise direction where l x and d x mean sectional lift and drag in spanwise direction respectively which are lift and drag per unit width at this section and calculated by equation 6 and equation 7 respectively 6 l x x p l cos l y d l 7 d x x p l sin l y d l where p l respects distribution of pressure at green lines of a certain section as shown in fig 14 and l y means the angle between green line and local y direction according to fig 15 the distribution is not uniform along the spanwise direction the normalized lift forces close to base as labeled 0 in fig 14 have more contribution to the whole lift the normalized drag forces close to both base and tip take up larger proportion of the whole drag as ply angle increases the normalized lift and drag almost remain unchanged at the position x s 0 4 while that at the position x s less than 0 4 rise and that at the position of x s over 0 4 reduce compared to the case without deflection when ply angle is positive the normalized lift and drag are larger in position less than x s 0 4 and smaller in that above x s 0 4 when ply angle is below zero the condition is opposed due to the impact of twist angle the normalized forces during spanwise direction show obvious discrepancies as shown in fig 15 fig 16 shows the twist angle in spanwise direction for θ 15 and θ 45 for positive ply angle when the position is near base x s 0 the twist angle is diminutive so that the lift and drag forces per unit width seldom change which causes the normalized forces to increase with entire forces decreasing while the position over x s 0 4 the negative twist angle plays an important role than entire forces due to the decrease of effective angle the lift and drag forces per unit width decrease when ply angle is below zero the positive twist angle and increased entire forces cause the opposed condition in distribution of normalized forces different deformations can lead to changed stress and strain state with variation of ply angles the failure of composite may be generated which is significant in application of structure considered anisotropy of composite materials the tsai wu criteria tsai and wu 1971 is utilized at present work fig 17 shows inverse reserve factor with different ply angles which indicates the margin of structural failure the composite structure is more probable to fail as inverse reserve factor is larger the inverse reserve factor values more than one indicate failure of the composite according to fig 17 the maximum of inverse reserve factor is located at the bottom of the base of the composite hydrofoil when ply angle is above zero the more probable failure place is located near the trailing edge while the location of failure place is close to leading edge with negative ply angle which may be due to the sign of twist angle besides the variation of maximum of inverse reserve factor is dependent on the value of deformation seen in fig 18 and the value of tip mean deflection gets minimum at θ 0 with maximal modulus in local x axis 3 3 the classical lamination theory analysis as for composite hydrofoils the intrinsic coupling behaviors offer difficulties to the design of composite structures and as described above the twist angle plays a key role in forces and varies with ply angles thus it s paramount for design to investigate the relationship between twist angle and ply angle directly due to thickness of the composite hydrofoil in this paper is much smaller than the length of chord and span the solid model can be regarded as a laminate and the influence of shape can be ignored tentatively then the classical lamination theory jones 1975 clt can be employed to represent intrinsic coupling behavior with different ply angles the definition of midplane twist curvature in clt is shown as 8 κ x y 2 2 ω 0 x y where ω0 represents the displacement of the composite hydrofoil in global z direction according to reference guo et al 2002 the midplane twist curvatures κ xy could represent twist of a laminate qualitatively the average midplane twist curvature κ x y is adopted in this paper according to fig 19 the tip twist angle is calculated by the expression 9 9 β ω 0 a ω 0 b l a b b a ω 0 y d y l a b l 3 ω 0 y d y l a b by green s theorem the

stacking sequence of the layers due to the symmetry of geometry and ply sequence the structure can be considered as a symmetric laminate which causes the bij 0 and all the elements in the matrices a and d would be present therefore the laminate exists extension shear coupling and bending twisting coupling resulted in by a and d respectively in this paper the bending twisting coupling which is due to the existence of d16 and d26 is investigated primarily thus the average midplane twist curvature can be written as 16 κ x y λ 1 m x λ 2 m y λ 3 m x y where m x m y and m x y are average internal

according to equation 20 for fixed midplane and similar forces the tip twist angle is mainly determined by λ1 and λ3 the λ1 and λ3 are calculated from material properties layer thickness and stacking sequence of the layers equation 20 shows a quantitative relation between tip twist angle and some influence factors thus it can be employed to predict the twist angle of structure under different material properties or ply angles and offer help to the design of marine propulsors 4 conclusions the trapezoidal composite hydrofoil whose section profile is modified naca0009 has been employed to validate the 3d numerical model with fluid structure coupling model considered and investigate the effects of ply angles on hydrodynamic forces and deformation characteristics the relation between the twist angle and the deformation behavior of the composite hydrofoil has also been presented based on the classical lamination theory analysis the main conclusions are as below 1 the numerical results show a good agreement with the experiment and can effectively predict the hydrodynamic and deformation performance of the composite hydrofoil as initial attack of angle increases both lift and drag coefficients of the composite hydrofoil experience an increase with reynolds number increasing the lift coefficient has the same trend with reynolds number which is opposed to the evolution of the drag coefficient as for the structural deformation with different ply angles the twist angle at the foil tip is negative with ply angle θ 30 while that is positive with ply angle θ 0 the maximum deflection at the hydrofoil tip is linearly dependent on initial angles of attack which is all consistent with experiment 2 the ply angle has an effect on the hydrodynamics forces and structural deformations of the composite hydrofoil as ply angle increases the lift and drag coefficients decrease and get minimum with ply angle θ 35 the trend of variation of tip twist angle is consistent with dimensionless coefficients and get minimum at ply angle θ 40 the pressure contour at the hydrofoil tip shows that twist angle plays a key role in whole lift and drag and normalized forces which causes that the distribution of normalized sectional forces is not uniform during spanwise direction as ply angle increases the normalized lift and drag rise in position x s less than 0 4 and reduce in that above 0 4 for positive ply angle when the position is near base the twist angle is diminutive so that the lift and drag forces per unit width seldom change which causes the normalized forces to increase with entire forces decreasing while the position over x s 0 4 due to decrease of effective angle the lift and drag forces per unit width decrease according to the inverse reserve factor of the composite hydrofoil with tsai wu criteria the maximum of inverse reserve factor is dependent on deflection of the composite hydrofoil 3 the tip twist angle shows a linear relationship with average

simulation method with fluid structure interaction modeling of composite materials 2 investigate the effects of ply angles on hydrodynamics forces and structural deformations of the composite hydrofoil and 3 investigate the relationship between tip twist angle β and properties of the composite hydrofoil based on the classical laminate theory analysis numerical results are presented for a modified naca0009 composite hydrofoil which has an unswept trapezoidal planform of aspect ratio 3 33 the fluid structure coupling method is proposed and validated with the experiment data by zarruk et al 7 the hydrodynamic forces and structural deformations of the composite hydrofoil with different ply angles have been investigated at re 1 106 and initial angle of attack α 6 the results show that lift and drag coefficients and tip twist angle decrease as the ply angle increases from negative ply angle to positive ply angle the twist angle plays a significant role in lift and drag coefficients as well as the distribution of normalized lift and drag along spanwise direction it should be noted that the composite hydrofoil with larger deformation is more probable to fail according to the inverse reserve factor with tsai wu criteria the expression on elements of bending stiffness matrices d has been derived to estimate tip twist angle keywords composite hydrofoil deformation characteristics ply angles bending twisting coupling 1 introduction propellers have been traditionally made from metal alloys which are prone to fatigue induced cracking and have relatively poor acoustic damping and low fuel efficiency andersen et al 2009 recently with the increasing development of the hydraulic machinery and marine propulsion the composite material has been used to replace metal material for the main components as it can improve the performance and fuel efficiency of propulsors lin and lee lin et al 2009 investigated the performance of two composite propellers with different stacking sequences the results showed that composite materials can reduce torque and increase efficiency due to the decrease of pitch the composite materials provide valuable applications in the aerospace industry due to its great advantages such as higher strength to weight ratios improved vibration damping properties and reduced magnetic electric signatures mouritz et al 2001 the composite materials have been applied in helicopter wing to reduce vibration and loads glaz et al 2009 the x 29a plane utilizes swept forward composite wings to control divergence and reduce bending moments near the wing root krone considering the different fluid properties of air and water as well as varying harsh marine environment spatially and temporally with cavitation and ventilation the structural response of composite materials in water becomes more complex than that in air wu et al 2017 because the intrinsic bending twisting and bend extension coupling behaviors of composite materials also have significant effects on structural response it has been very necessary to investigate the structural responses of composite materials and the influence of intrinsic coupling behaviors on fluid structure interaction of composite materials in water zarruk et al 2014 compared two modified naca0009 hydrofoils used fiber reinforced polymers with the carbon fibers aligned at 0 and 30 along the spanwise of hydrofoil they found that cfrp30 had a trend of decrease on incidence angle under loads which was different from cfrp00 and metallic materials gowing et al 1998 presented experimental data for two composite materials which showed that under appropriate loading tip deflections reduced the effective angle of attack and therefore reduced loading in the tip region in order to investigate the influence of layer properties of composite materials more effectively the numerical method are more effective than experiment because experiment may face some problems such as huge costs with many factors and a wide variation in constitutive properties or material strengths with imperfections potter et al 2008 the coupling method is crucial to the numerical simulations many numerical studies on isotropic flexible hydrofoils have been presented utilizing several coupling methods wu et al 2015 2018 and wang et al 2017 investigated hydroelastic response of a flexible naca66 hydrofoil in cavitating flows with a two degrees of freedom model describing the bending h and the twisting θ of foil the results showed that cavitation had significant effects on the foil deformation and the unsteady characteristics of the hydroelastic response the bending deformation was enhanced when the cavitation occurred ducoin et al 2009 numerically analyzed a deformable hydrofoil with transient pitching motion with a cfd finite volume code cfx for the fluid and a csd finite element code ansys for the structure which showed the structural response appeared to be strongly linked to hydrodynamic phenomena such as boundary layer laminar to turbulent transition and leading edge vortex shedding wang et al 2008 combined fluent and abaqus to achieve a coupling simulation on 3 d wing deformation in a subsonic flow the results showed that lift and drag data were made up with several periodic elements of different frequencies which were on the basis of wing s nature frequencies composite structures are manufactured by many layers thus the properties of composite structures are influenced by many factors such as ply angles stacking sequence and material properties of single layer it s necessary to consider the properties of composite materials in the numerical model the finite element analysis models for composites have developed from equivalent single layer theories such as classical lamination theory or the first order shear deformation theory to continuum based 3d elasticity theory zhang and yang 2008 kim and gupta 1990 guo et al 2002 as a classical theory the clt has been used to study the effects of ply angles on twist of a laminate murray et al 2015 liu and young 2007 the results showed that twist curvatures could represent the twist of a laminate qualitatively young 2008 utilized a coupled boundary element and finite element approach to study fsi effects on composite propellers and validated numerical results with experiments which showed improved performance of propeller due to decrease of rake and pitch angle by bend twist coupling effects although the effects of ply angles on structural response have been studied by some experiments and numerical researches from structure view there are lack of a validated numerical method considered 3d structure of composite materials and systematical studies on effects of ply angle under hydrodynamic conditions the objective of this paper is to validate 3d numerical simulation method with fluid structure interaction of composite materials comparing to experiments investigate the hydrodynamic forces and deformations influenced by different ply angles and study the relation between tip twist angle and properties of the composite hydrofoil 2 numerical model 2 1 solid model the geometry of the hydrofoil has an unswept trapezoidal planform with 0 3 m span 0 12 m base chord and 0 06 m tip chord as shown in fig 1 the section profile of the hydrofoil is a modified naca0009 whose equation is shown as below 1 y i c i 0 45 0 2969 x i c i 0 5 0 126 x i c i 0 3516 x i c i 2 0 2843 x i c i 3 0 08890 x i c i 4 where x i y i and c i mean distance along chord distance perpendicular to chord and chord in i section respectively also shown in fig 1 the layers of the composite hydrofoil which are in accordance with zarruk et al 2014 which are mixed with carbon fabrics and three kinds of e glass fabrics table 1 shows the structural properties of the four fabric layers the stacking sequence of the composite hydrofoil is 0 90 g basket 0 90 g biaxial θ 5c 0 90 2g biaxial θ 4c s with one glass mat layer in the center of the hydrofoil where the subscript g and c represent glass fabrics and carbon fabrics respectively the subscript s means that the layers are symmetrical about the mid plan and θ refers to the angle between axes of carbon fabrics and local axes the stacking sequence and definition of ply angle are shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b respectively the finite elements model of the composite hydrofoil is established based on ansys acp and mechanical which is shown in fig 3 the type of element is solid186 3 d 20 node layered structural solid which can undergo large pressure gradient and nonlinearity to obtain more accurate deformations 2 2 fluid model the governing equations for incompressible flow without gravitational force are described as below 2 v j x j 0 3 ρ f v i t ρ f v i v j x j p x i μ f 2 v i x j x j where v j ρ f μ f and p refer to velocity density dynamic viscosity and pressure and the subscript i j represent the coordinates the k ω sst turbulence model menter 1993 is adopted in the present work 4 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k d k x j μ μ t σ k k x j 5 ρ ω t ρ u j ω x j c ω p ω β ω ρ ω 2 x j μ μ t σ k ω x j 2 ρ 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j where k and ω represent turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent frequency respectively p k and p ω are production terms d k is the destruction term and f 1 is blending functions the fluid domain is consistent with the experimental setup zarruk et al 2014 whose test section is 0 6m square by 2 6m long the hydrofoil is located at the 0 7 m from the entrance the boundary conditions of the 3 d fluid domain are shown in fig 4 the free stream velocity u of inlet is calculated from reynolds numbers re u c νf where c respects mean chord c 0 09 m the absolute pressure of outlet is set as 1atm to prevent cavitation the overall mesh consists about 3 52m elements the mesh refinement near the hydrofoil is adopted near the hydrofoil to obtain the accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic performance as shown in fig 5 2 3 fsi coupling modeling fig 6 shows the flow chart of the fsi coupling algorithm used in this paper firstly the structure solver solves the structural deformation with applied loads from cfd solver in the previous time iteration step or initialization then the cfd solver commercial software cfx is used to update the mesh of fluid domain according to the structural deformation and to solve the flow fields to realize the data transfer the interfaces have been applied which can transfer fluid force from cfd solver to structure solver and displacements in the opposed direction with predefined relation the boundary definition for the interfaces has been presented in fig 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical validations the steady state simulation has been adopted in this work and the predicted lift coefficient c l 2 l ρ l u 2 s c and drag coefficient c d 2 d ρ l u 2 s c are compared to the experiments by zarruk et al 2014 for two reynolds numbers with different initial angles of attack α 0 at ply angle θ 0 as shown in fig 8 where l d and s refer to lift drag and hydrofoil span s 0 3 m respectively the trends of lift and drag coefficients are consistent with the experiment as initial attack of angle increases both lift and drag coefficients experience an increase with reynolds number increasing the lift coefficient has same trend with reynolds number while the drag coefficient is opposite to further validate the numerical methods the deformation of composite hydrofoils for two ply angles is calculated with different initial angles of attack as shown in fig 9 and the detailed mean deflections δ and twist angles β at tip are extracted and compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 both the twist angle and the mean deflection at tip for two ply angles show a good agreement with the experimental results for both hydrofoils the twist angle has a linear dependence on initial angles of attack while the twist angle at tip is negative at θ 30 which is in opposed to the positive twist angle with θ 0 the deflection increases from base to tip and the largest deflection can be observed at tip and both maximum deformation for two ply angles increase linearly as incidence angle increases 3 2 the effects of ply angles on hydrodynamic forces and structural deformations to further investigate the intrinsic coupling effects of composite materials the effects of ply angles on hydrodynamic forces and deformations have been studied at re 1 106 and α 0 6 with different ply angles fig 12 shows the lift and drag coefficients with different ply angles for re 1 106 and α 0 6 as the ply angle increases from negative ply angle to positive ply angle the lift and drag coefficients decrease get minimum at θ 35 and then increase again considering that the variation of forces is determined by the distribution of pressure on the composite hydrofoil and influenced by the deformations of the composite hydrofoil fig 13 shows the pressure contours and deformation at tip of the hydrofoil as a function of ply angles the twist angle at tip has similar trend with lift and drag coefficients and gets minimum at θ 40 when the effective angle increases the region of higher and lower pressure enlarge which can lead to larger forces thus the twist angle plays a significant role in variation of fluid field as the structural responses of the composite hydrofoil is solved based on a three dimensional fluid field it is necessary to consider variation of the hydrodynamic forces and structural deformations in spanwise direction which is helpful to understand the fluid structure interaction comprehensively divide the geometry into several parts as shown in fig 14 and calculate the sectional lift and drag in green lines fig 15 shows the normalized lift and drag per unit width along spanwise direction where l x and d x mean sectional lift and drag in spanwise direction respectively which are lift and drag per unit width at this section and calculated by equation 6 and equation 7 respectively 6 l x x p l cos l y d l 7 d x x p l sin l y d l where p l respects distribution of pressure at green lines of a certain section as shown in fig 14 and l y means the angle between green line and local y direction according to fig 15 the distribution is not uniform along the spanwise direction the normalized lift forces close to base as labeled 0 in fig 14 have more contribution to the whole lift the normalized drag forces close to both base and tip take up larger proportion of the whole drag as ply angle increases the normalized lift and drag almost remain unchanged at the position x s 0 4 while that at the position x s less than 0 4 rise and that at the position of x s over 0 4 reduce compared to the case without deflection when ply angle is positive the normalized lift and drag are larger in position less than x s 0 4 and smaller in that above x s 0 4 when ply angle is below zero the condition is opposed due to the impact of twist angle the normalized forces during spanwise direction show obvious discrepancies as shown in fig 15 fig 16 shows the twist angle in spanwise direction for θ 15 and θ 45 for positive ply angle when the position is near base x s 0 the twist angle is diminutive so that the lift and drag forces per unit width seldom change which causes the normalized forces to increase with entire forces decreasing while the position over x s 0 4 the negative twist angle plays an important role than entire forces due to the decrease of effective angle the lift and drag forces per unit width decrease when ply angle is below zero the positive twist angle and increased entire forces cause the opposed condition in distribution of normalized forces different deformations can lead to changed stress and strain state with variation of ply angles the failure of composite may be generated which is significant in application of structure considered anisotropy of composite materials the tsai wu criteria tsai and wu 1971 is utilized at present work fig 17 shows inverse reserve factor with different ply angles which indicates the margin of structural failure the composite structure is more probable to fail as inverse reserve factor is larger the inverse reserve factor values more than one indicate failure of the composite according to fig 17 the maximum of inverse reserve factor is located at the bottom of the base of the composite hydrofoil when ply angle is above zero the more probable failure place is located near the trailing edge while the location of failure place is close to leading edge with negative ply angle which may be due to the sign of twist angle besides the variation of maximum of inverse reserve factor is dependent on the value of deformation seen in fig 18 and the value of tip mean deflection gets minimum at θ 0 with maximal modulus in local x axis 3 3 the classical lamination theory analysis as for composite hydrofoils the intrinsic coupling behaviors offer difficulties to the design of composite structures and as described above the twist angle plays a key role in forces and varies with ply angles thus it s paramount for design to investigate the relationship between twist angle and ply angle directly due to thickness of the composite hydrofoil in this paper is much smaller than the length of chord and span the solid model can be regarded as a laminate and the influence of shape can be ignored tentatively then the classical lamination theory jones 1975 clt can be employed to represent intrinsic coupling behavior with different ply angles the definition of midplane twist curvature in clt is shown as 8 κ x y 2 2 ω 0 x y where ω0 represents the displacement of the composite hydrofoil in global z direction according to reference guo et al 2002 the midplane twist curvatures κ xy could represent twist of a laminate qualitatively the average midplane twist curvature κ x y is adopted in this paper according to fig 19 the tip twist angle is calculated by the expression 9 9 β ω 0 a ω 0 b l a b b a ω 0 y d y l a b l 3 ω 0 y d y l a b by green s theorem the line integral can be converted into a surface integral 10 l ω 0 y d y l 1 ω 0 y d y l 2 ω 0 y d y l 3 ω 0 y d y l 4 ω 0 y d y d 2 ω x y d x d y obviously 11 l 1 ω 0 y d y 0 assuming that 12 l 2 ω 0 y d y l 4 ω 0 y d y b c o n s t thus 13 2 ω 0 x y d s d β l a b b according to the definition of the midplane twist curvature 14 β κ x y s d 2 l a b b 0 225 κ x y b equation 14 shows the quantitative relation between tip twist angle and average midplane twist curvature κ x y with unknown constant b the sign of the slope is determined by the direction of coordinates fig 20 shows the variation of tip twist angle with average midplane twist curvature κ x y by the numerical methods the slope between numerical results and theory agrees well each other and the assumption of b is feasible under variation of ply angles according to clt the relation between force and midplane twist curvature is shown as below 15 n m a b b d ε κ where n and m represent inplane forces and moments respectively ε is midplane strain and κ means midplane curvatures a b and d are extensional coupling and bending stiffness matrices respectively which are functions of the material properties layer thickness and stacking sequence of the layers due to the symmetry of geometry and ply sequence the structure can be considered as a symmetric laminate which causes the bij 0 and all the elements in the matrices a and d would be present therefore the laminate exists extension shear coupling and bending twisting coupling resulted in by a and d respectively in this paper the bending twisting coupling which is due to the existence of d16 and d26 is investigated primarily thus the average midplane twist curvature can be written as 16 κ x y λ 1 m x λ 2 m y λ 3 m x y where m x m y and m x y are average internal moment in x and y directions and average internal torque per unit width respectively and the definitions of coefficients λ1 λ2 and λ3 are shown as below 17 λ 1 d 16 d 22 d 12 d 26 d 66 d 12 2 2 d 12 d 16 d 26 d 22 d 16 2 d 11 d 26 2 d 11 d 22 d 66 18 λ 2 d 11 d 26 d 12 d 16 d 66 d 12 2 2 d 12 d 16 d 26 d 22 d 16 2 d 11 d 26 2 d 11 d 22 d 66 19 λ 3 d 12 d 12 d 11 d 22 d 66 d 12 2 2 d 12 d 16 d 26 d 22 d 16 2 d 11 d 26 2 d 11 d 22 d 66 due to the constraint of the composite hydrofoil equation 10 can reduce to raither et al 2012 20 κ x y λ 1 m x λ 3 m x y thus 21 β s d l a b λ 1 m x λ 3 m x y b according to equation 20 for fixed midplane and similar forces the tip twist angle is mainly determined by λ1 and λ3 the λ1 and λ3 are calculated from material properties layer thickness and stacking sequence of the layers equation 20 shows a quantitative relation between tip twist angle and some influence factors thus it can be employed to predict the twist angle of structure under different material properties or ply angles and offer help to the design of marine propulsors 4 conclusions the trapezoidal composite hydrofoil whose section profile is modified naca0009 has been employed to validate the 3d numerical model with fluid structure coupling model considered and investigate the effects of ply angles on hydrodynamic forces and deformation characteristics the relation between the twist angle and the deformation behavior of the composite hydrofoil has also been presented based on the classical lamination theory analysis the main conclusions are as below 1 the numerical results

23248,numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the effect of an augmentation channel on the performance of a straight blade vertical axis turbine the flow field is simulated with a commercial software fluent in which the finite volume method is used to solve reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the sst k ω turbulence model the rotation of the rotor is simulated by solving a rotation motion equation a comparison between a standalone turbine in a free open stream versus one in an augmentation channel is drawn with discussion regarding variation of hydrodynamic torques on the blade and rotor the power and torque output by the shaft and the rotational speed the comparison reveals that for a turbine in a channel the fluctuations of hydrodynamic torques and rotational speed are dramatically reduced and the power output is more than 30 higher than that of the standalone turbine keywords tidal current power vertical axis turbine augmentation channel numerical simulation 1 introduction tidal current energy is more predictable than other marine renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and wave energy in principle the technique used to extract tidal current energy is the same as that used by the wind power industry a straightforward method of converting tidal current power into electricity extensively utilized by the wind power industry involves using a horizontal axis turbine hat it is found that incorporating a horizontal axis turbine with a duct device is a valid way to increase the power output of the turbine the performance of horizontal axis ducted wind and tidal turbines has been investigated by many researchers including gilbert and foreman 1983 lawn 2003 and setoguchi et al 2004 vertical axis turbines vat offer an alternative technique for tidal current power extraction vats have attracted interest because of their structural simplicity and adaptability with flows of arbitrary direction the main drawbacks of vat are relatively lower efficiency and higher torque fluctuation compared to hat some studies such as goude and ågren 2014 confirms that the vat performance better in a channel although the channel is referred to in geographical sense a number of studies show that an augmentation duct or channel can increase the power output of a vat alidadi et al 2008 and substantially reduce the torque fluctuation alidadi et al 2012 malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 this compensates for the drawbacks of a vat to some degree making it an attractive option for tidal current power exploitation one third of tidal turbines that are deployed or in the r d stage are vat s half of these vats have been considered as candidates for incorporating some kind of augmentation device khan et al 2009 although some research has focused on the current acceleration effect of a solo channel without a turbine in it ponta and dutt 2000 ponta and jacovkis 2008 there are relatively few reports which systematically assess the effect of an augmentation device on the performance of vats this is due to several factors for physical model tests the width of the flume has to be much larger than that of the duct with incorporated turbine to prevent the blockage effect from contaminating the results for numerical model tests rans simulations are more reliable but are very time consuming as alidadi et al 2008 had pointed out this is because compared to simulations of standalone vats in open free streams the computational domain size for ducted vat needs to be extremely large in order to avoid boundary effects also the grids around the turbine and duct walls need to be fine enough to properly resolve the boundary layers in their numerical investigations most researchers assume that the turbine rotates at a constant speed jung et al 2009 li and calisal 2010a alidadi et al 2008 alidadi et al 2012 malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 jung et al 2009 li and calisal 2010a alidadi et al 2008 alidadi et al 2012 and malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 the power output is then derived by multiplying the hydrodynamic torque with rotational speed it should be noticed that this is possible only when the electrical architecture and control system are sophisticatedly designed to maintain constant rotational speed of the rotor this is difficult because unlike the case of horizontal axis turbine the driven torque on blades of a vat varies periodically in principle and naturally lead to rotation speed variation alidadi et al 2012 experimentally and numerically examined the effects of ducts on vats their numerical predicted phase angle and magnitude of torque are different from the experimentally measured torque they attribute this difference to the assumption of constant angular velocity of the rotor in the numerical model while it varied in experiments in some reality cases without dedicated control system the rotational speed of the turbine would fluctuate widely what would be the effects of an augmentation channel on a vat rotates at variable speed is worthy of studying in this paper the performance of a straight blade vertical axis tidal turbine incorporated in an augmentation channel is investigated numerically for turbines in open free streams and in channels the power output hydrodynamic torques on the blade and rotor and the rotational speed are recorded in the investigation instead of assuming a constant rotational speed the rotation speed of the turbine is derived by solving an equation of motion the results for both cases are compared to assess the effect of the channel on how the turbine runs a two dimensional model is used to carry out this investigation if the channeled turbine is placed close to the free surface of water an open channel flow appears between channel walls in this case friction or obstruction can give rise to changes in local head and flow speed consistent with conservation of mass and thus to transfers between potential and kinetic energy balance as explained by henderson 1966 tidal turbines mainly target kinetic energy therefore such hydraulic effects although small can cause a discernible difference from unbounded flows assumed by a two dimensional model another 3 d effect cannot be accounted for is the effect of vat s arms through which the blades are mounted on the shaft of the rotor according to the data of li and calisal 2010b for tip speed ratio tsr less than 2 5 the dropping of the power coefficient caused by the arm effect is less than 0 05 they suggest the two dimensional model is more cost effective in the initial design stage therefore the arm effect is omitted in this study like other researchers have done e g wang et al 2007 li and calisal 2011 and chen et al 2011 etc although the 2 d analysis could give inaccurate prediction in specific cases such as in open channel flow but it is much more cost effective than a full 3 d analysis therefore it is used in this stage of study 2 design of vat and channel a straight bladed vertical axis turbine known as an h darrieus turbine is used in this study the rotor has 3 blades with the symmetric naca0018 aerofoil the vat specifications are given in table 1 ponta and jacovkis 2008 experimentally tested the behaviour of channels with different hydrodynamic profiled pontoons the basic profile of the channel s pontoon used in this study follows those tested by ponta and jacovkis 2008 with the following modifications the main body of the pontoon is forward backward symmetric i e the curves of the nozzle and diffuser parts are the same second the flat tail of the deflector is replaced by a sharp trailing edge tail in practice the device features two foldable deflectors which are installed on both ends of the pontoon in tidal currents the deflector at the upstream end is folded and closed to the main body of the pontoon with the other one at the downstream end opened and functioning when the tidal current reverses the upstream and downstream ends swaps and the function and position of both deflectors also swap accordingly lastly the sharp leading edge of the pontoon is rounded off to avoid severe flow separation when the current does not align perfectly with the center line of the channel the geometric characteristics of the pontoon are shown in fig 1 3 numerical model 3 1 flow model a commercial computational fluid dynamic cfd software fluent is used to simulate the flow field this software is based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations solved via the cell based finite volume method for turbulence closure we adopt the shear stress transport sst k ω model which adequately predicts the boundary layers and flow separations the above flow model has been used successfully in similar studies such as jung et al 2009 and malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 for brevity the equations of the flow model are omitted since they are well known and can readily be found in other literature the flow model is run on the supercomputer of the national supercomputer center in tianjin china 3 2 equation of rotor s motion the hydrodynamic force on a blade and its torque about a rotational center can be obtained directly from intrinsic functions of fluent the hydrodynamic torque on the rotor t h can be obtained by summating the hydrodynamic torques on all three blades the power output by the shaft of the vat is usually input into a mechanical transmission system for example a gear box which increases the rotational speed at a specific ratio and then drives an electricity generator in an electrical circuit or grid the electromagnetic force between the stator and the translator of the generator apply a resistant torque through the mechanical transmission system which eventually acts on the shaft of the turbine in addition to this torque there is also resistant torque caused by friction occurring at the bearings seal rings and between gear teeth all resistant torques are categorized into a load torque t l in this paper the rotational motion equation of the rotor is 1 j z d ω d t t h t t l t in which j z is the rotational inertia of the rotor about its vertical axis and ω is the angular velocity of the rotor which is solved at every time step the above equation is solved by a user defined function udf in fluent as mentioned above the hypothesis of constant rotational speed of rotor is not always true while in the case of varied rotational speed determining the accurate load torque is very difficult bai et al 2014 found in their experiments of a permanent magnet generator used for wind turbine that measured generator torques are almost linear with the rotational speeds but the linear relation between the load torque and the rotational speed is not universally valid it depend not only on the electrical architecture but also affected by the friction in mechanical system for the sake of simplicity the load torque is supposed to be proportional to the rotational speed of the shaft in this paper therefore 2 t l t b ω t in which the load coefficient b is a positive constant which reflects the features of the electricity generator and the electrical load in the circuit or grid 3 3 computational domain and boundary conditions the layout of the computation domain is shown in fig 2 the length of the computation domain is 15 l where l is the length of augmentation channel the distance from the inflow boundary to the leading edge of the channel is 5 l the width of the computation domain is 4 5 l which makes the blockage ratio due to the existence of pontoons less than 5 the axis of the vat lies in the center of the straight channel the velocity is specified at the inflow boundary a zero reference pressure is given at the outflow boundary full slip boundary conditions are applied at both the lower and upper lateral boundaries a non slip velocity condition is applied on the surface of the blades shaft and pontoons in summary the boundary conditions are as follows 3 u u 0 at inflow boundary p 0 at outflow boundary u n 0 at lateral boundaries u 0 on surfaces of pontoons u ω x b x c on surfaces of blades and shaft where x b and x c are respectively the coordinate vectors of points on the surfaces and the center of the rotor s axis ω is the vector of angular velocity which needs to be solved from the equation of rotor s motion at every time step flow is suddenly started at the beginning of the simulation i e all variables throughout the flow field are set to zero at t 0 except for the boundary condition of velocity which gets applied on the inflow boundary the last velocity boundary condition in eq 3 is automatically applied when ω is derived by udf and returned to the cfd solver 3 4 factors affecting the performance of a vat according to the equation of motion of the rotor the resistant load torque has a great influence on the performance of turbine a load that is too light will leave the turbine in an idling state in which the rotational speed is high but the torque output by the rotor is very small a load that is too heavy will stagnate the turbine leading to a small tip speed ratio which worsens the hydrodynamic performance of the blades resulting ultimately in a low power output a load must match the turbine to enable it to operate in an optimized state where the rotational speed is appropriate so that the blades work at an efficient hydrodynamic level while keeping the shaft torque at a reasonable level for a specified turbine in a given current speed the optimum state can be found by the varying load coefficient b with the corresponding maximum power efficiency to reduce the number of variables a dimensionless load coefficient b is adopted the form of this definition is derived from nondimensionalization of eq 1 4 b b d j z u a channel device with a gradually narrowing channel width causes the flow velocity in the neighborhood of the rotor to become higher than that of the ambient tidal current however a turbine incorporated in the channel will resist and slow down the flow this resistant effect may drive part of the flow outside the channel hence reducing the tidal kinetic power flux passing through the rotor and lowering the power output of the turbine the narrower the channel is the greater the resistant effect is provided that the rotor parameters and pontoon size are given an optimal channel width exists which should gain enough benefit of flow augmentation while maintaining an acceptable level of resistance effect at the same time the influence of the relative width of the straight channel defined as the ratio of the channel width over the rotor diameter w 0 d on the performance of the turbine is worth studying tidal current speed varies from slack to flood in a tidal cycle the speed of the incoming tidal current u has great impact on torques and power output of a tidal turbine shiono et al 2000 experimentally tested a vat with flow speed varying from 0 6 to 1 4 m s their study shows that although the absolute power increases with flow speed the relationship between power efficiency and tip speed ratio is almost the same except in the lowest speed case they believe one reason for this exception is due to the fact that the frictional and mechanical losses occupy a relatively lager portion of power output in lowest flow speed case hence compromising the apparent power efficiency therefore it is unnecessary to investigate the impact of tidal current speeds as long as the reynolds number falls in the same range in this study u 1 5 m s is adopted which is a typical stream speed in practical sites in chinese waters the reynolds number based on the chord length of the blade is re u c ν 9 105 in this study the impact of b and w 0 d on the rotational speed of the rotor the torque output by the rotor and the power coefficient of the turbine are investigated with respect to a given incoming tidal current speed u in the simulations b ranges from 3 2 to 7 3 and w 0 d ranges from 1 09 to 1 6 exhaustive testing on the combinations of b and w 0 d have to be done to find the exact optimal conditions for turbine s performance a large number of simulations are needed to complete this optimization process if the performance of the turbine is supposed to be not sensitive to parameters when they are already close to optimal state a less computational expensive process is adopted to get to a close to optimal condition a standalone vat without a channel is simulated first by varying the load coefficient an optimal value is found when the maximum power coefficient is achieved the turbine with this optimal load coefficient is then incorporated in the channel the width of straight channel is varied to get an optimum relative width when the maximum power coefficient is achieved with this optimum relative width the load coefficient is varied again to find the maximum power coefficient for the channeled turbine 3 5 data acquisition and analysis method the following descriptions of data acquisition and derivation are conducted in udfs of fluent the hydrodynamic force torque on each blade can be obtained directly via intrinsic functions of fluent other variables are derived from known data the hydrodynamic torque on the rotor is the sum of the hydrodynamic torques on all three blades when the rotational motion equation of the rotor is solved to get the angular acceleration the rotational velocity and the azimuthal angle of the rotor can be obtained by integrating the angular acceleration with respect to time t 5 ω t 0 t d ω d t d t θ t 0 t ω d t the instantaneous shaft torque t o torque output by the rotor is identical to the load torque t l but with opposite sign because they are a pair of action and reaction torque that is 6 t o t t l t b ω t according to eq 1 the shaft torque differs from the hydrodynamic driving torque t h by the acceleration term due to the effect of inertia the instantaneous power output by the turbine is the product of the shaft torque and the rotational speed of the shaft 7 p t t o t ω t b ω t 2 for the convenience of comparison the averaged non dimensional power output is defined as a power coefficient c k following alidadi et al 2012 8 c k p 1 2 ρ u 3 d h in which ρ is the water density u is the speed of the undisturbed tidal current d is diameter of the rotor h is height of the blade p is power output averaged over cycles of rotation for a standalone turbine the power coefficient is in fact the efficiency of the power extraction but it is not the case for a channeled turbine this will be explained in section 5 2 all the torques including hydrodynamic torque and shaft torque are normalized to torque coefficients 9 c t t t t 1 2 ρ u 2 d h r in which r is the radius of the rotor r d 2 the instantaneous dimensionless rotational speed ω and its complete cycle averaged value i e the tip speed ratio λ are defined as 10 ω t ω t r u λ ω r u there are cycle to cycle variations in hydrodynamic forces torques on the blade and rotor rotational speed torque and power output even in quasi steady running state for convenience of comparison these variables are phase averaged based on data of 7 or 8 rotational cycles in a quasi steady state to yield representative variations in a rotational cycle a main disadvantage of a vat is that the instantaneous hydrodynamic torque rotational speed shaft torque and power output fluctuate periodically the fluctuations of shaft torque and thrust can cause the turbine to risk structural fatigue damage and the fluctuation of power output have an unfavorable effect on the electric circuit grid therefore the features of these fluctuations are worth studying ripple factors of these variables are defined below to measure the fluctuations 11 r f f max f min f in which f represents hydrodynamic torque rotational speed shaft torque and power output respectively f max f min and f are the phase averaged maximum and minimum instantaneous values and time averaged values of these variables 3 6 grid and time step size independence the computational domain is divided into several sub domains according to geometric features each sub domain is mapped by a structural grid the sub domains surrounding the rotor shaft and blades rotate while the rest of the sub domains are stationary during computation the interfaces between the rotating sub domains and the stationary sub domains are set to be slippery interfaces in fluent so that flow field information can be exchanged across these interfaces fig 3 a shows the grid zones i e the sub domains in different color and marks the interfaces between them fig 3 b reveals the details of grid around a blade a series of numerical tests for a turbine in an open free stream are run to make sure that numerical results do not vary with grid and time step size the instantaneous dimensionless power output for progressively finer grids are shown in fig 4 a the instantaneous rotational speeds for these grids have similar curves because the power output is equal to the square of the rotational speed multiplied by a constant load coefficient as shown in eq 7 numerical results predict a higher rotational speed with the coarser grid as time elapsed the different rotational speeds resulted in apparent phase differences between the results of the coarse grid and those of finer grids except for the phase difference the overall results predicted with different grids are very close the relative error of averaged power output predicted by a grid with 251924 nodes compared to one with 522312 nodes is only 3 28 the curves of instantaneous dimensionless power output predicted by a grid with 436530 nodes are almost identical to one with 522312 nodes the relative difference of averaged power output between these two cases is only 0 17 therefore the grid with 436530 nodes for a turbine in an open free stream is adopted in this study for cases involving channeled turbines the total number of nodes is between 650 thousand to 750 thousand depending on channel width but the grid around the turbine never changes in these grids the grid size in the normal direction on the surfaces of blades are set to be 0 0006 m which is 0 001 times the blade chord length the sizes of the shaft surfaces and pontoon surface in the channel are 0 0014 m in this grid which is 0 0035 times the diameter of the shaft 0 0023 times the blade chord length similar to the grid size independence check various time increments ranging from δt 0 00035s 0 005s are tested in our numerical simulations the instantaneous dimensionless power output for different time steps are shown in fig 4 b for δt 0 002s the average power coefficient c k and ripple factors of power output r p are around 0 45 and 0 72 respectively the relative difference in the results of δt 0 00035 0 0005 and 0 002s are less than 1 but the c k and r p of δt 0 005s are 3 3 and 21 9 higher than those of the δt 0 00035s case it is also shown in fig 4 b that there is a phase difference between the time history of δt 0 002 and 0 0005s while those of δt 0 00035 and 0 0005s are almost identical therefore δt 0 0005s is used throughout this study 4 validation of the numerical model the above numerical model is validated before it is applied in this study although there have been reports on the results of vat experiments very few are able to offer sufficient and clear details for the sake of comparison another complexity is that the results of existing experiments seems rather scattered for example kiho et al 1996 tested a 3 blades 1 6 m diameter darrieus turbine in a 0 8 1 5 m s tidal current with the solidity equal to 0 179 and report the highest power efficiency 56 at the tip speed ratio equal to 2 1 the same group of authors conduct another experiment shiono et al 2000 using a 0 3 m diameter turbine with the same number of blades the same airfoil and solidity as previous but report a maximum power efficiency only 23 5 at a tip speed ratio of 1 82 in a 0 6 1 4 m s stream the scattered results could be attributed to the uncertainties often encountered in experiments e g the mechanical and electrical losses the experimental study on darrieus turbines by shiono et al 2000 is conducted in a circulating water tank the aerofoil of the blade is naca633 018 which is a symmetric foil but by joining the camber line to the circumference of the rotor it becomes asymmetric a series of turbines with different numbers of blades and varying solidity were tested in different flow speeds the variations of power efficiency with respect to tip speed ratio of a 3 blades turbine with solidity of 0 366 blade chord is 115 2 mm are given in more details so we are able to use it to validate the computational method in our present study both variable speed rotation and forced constant speed rotation cases are simulated the results of them are discussed respectively 4 1 forced rotation at constant speeds in the case of forced constant speed rotation the power efficiency is obtained by eq 12 in which t is the hydrodynamic torques on the rotor ω the rotational speed s the swept area of the rotor and b l ω 2 represents mechanical losses such as frictional losses in the bearings 12 c k t ω b l ω 2 1 2 ρ u 3 s the comparison between the power efficiency in the experiment conducted by shiono et al 2000 and that predicted by our numerical model is shown in fig 5 in the forced constant speed rotations the coefficient b l 0 means no mechanical losses are considered all hydrodynamic power is assumed being converted to mechanical power of the turbine in this case the predicted maximum power efficiency is 29 4 at a tip speed ratio 1 45 whilst the experiment obtained a maximum power efficiency of 20 23 at a tip speed ratio 1 2 1 3 at first sight the discrepancy between prediction and measurement is remarkable but if mechanical losses are taken into account the prediction are greatly improved when the coefficient b l is set to 0 15 the predicted maximum power efficiency is 21 6 at a tip speed ratio 1 25 these data agree very well with the experimental results for the sake of brevity the results of variable speed rotations with mechanical losses correction i e b l 0 are not included in this figure the effect of the correction is similar to that in the cases of constant speed rotations except indicating that the frictional losses are responsible for the poor efficiency in the 0 6 m s stream case as shown in fig 5 a there is no indication of the proportion that mechanical losses occupied in output in shiono et al 2000 it can be seen from fig 5 b that there is a remarkable difference in the results with and without considering mechanical losses also the maximum power efficiency falls since part of the extracted power is being consumed by mechanical losses the optimum tip speed ratio also may lower in the view of maximum usable power in the above simulations for model validation the independence of the different parameters is checked the grid with nodes from around 100 thousands to more than 300 thousands time increments δt from 0 0001s to 0 003s turbulent intensity on inlet boundary from 1 to 5 are tested it is found that simulations with more than 200 thousands grid nodes keeping y 2 for grid points nearest to the blade and time increments δt 0 002s will keep the relative errors less than 5 the influence of turbulent intensity is negligible the results shown in fig 5 b are calculated with δt 0 0002s turbulent intensity on inlet boundary 5 and on a grid with 232617 nodes 4 2 variable speed rotation and influence of inertial when the rotation of the rotor is governed by eq 1 the rotation speed is variable in this case the friction torque on the shaft is adjusted to get different tip speed ratios the power efficiency is obtained by eqs 7 and 8 fig 6 gives examples of time series of instantaneous non dimensional rotation speed and azimuth angle in the cases of different non dimensional load coefficient b in these examples the inertia of rotor j z 4j z0 where jz 0 equals to 0 015 kg m2 which is the smallest inertia used in assessing the inertia influence when b is relative small the instantaneous rotation speed varies periodically around a mean value in a highly repetitive pattern the time periods of each rotation cycle are almost identical such as that in fig 6 a if b is very high the resistant torque could be very small when the rotor is nearly stationary but grows quickly when rotation speed increasing in comparison in the case of smaller b the resistant torque is more stable but its maximum is relative lower thus in the case of very high b the rotor rotates in pulsate and discontinuous way it can suddenly accelerate to an instantaneous high speed even larger than that in the case of smaller b but also could be stagnated for a while or even rotating backwards due to negative instantaneous hydrodynamic torque this negative torque sometimes occurs when the rotor is close to stagnation it is the reason why a vertical axis turbine is difficult to self start as shown in fig 6 b the variation of instantaneous rotation speed and azimuth angle is irregular the time periods of each rotation cycle are obviously different from cycle to cycle although the tip speed ratio and power coefficient could still be obtained from the manipulating the data but they don t make practical sense since a turbine is never supposed to operate in that fashion it is found when b is high enough to make the tip speed ratio smaller than 0 75 the backward rotation happened and the time series of results are irregular like that in fig 6 b this irregular rotation cannot be correctly predicted by forced rotation model although b has included the inertia of rotor it is more straight forward to discuss the influence of inertia on the performance of a turbine fig 7 shows the results of turbine with inertia of rotor equals to j z0 and 2 4 and 10 times of j z0 for comparison the results of forced constant speed rotation is also included in the figure the stream velocity is 0 8 m s for all the cases in fig 7 no mechanical losses correction are applied the maximum power coefficient of the forced rotation case in fig 7 a is slightly lower than that in fig 5 a in which the stream velocity is 1 0 m s this could be attributed to the difference in blade reynolds number from fig 7 a the variations of power coefficients versus tip speed ratio λ predicted by both forced rotation model and variable speed model are quite similar at high tip speed ratios the power coefficients for larger inertia turbines seems higher than that for smaller inertia turbines but this tendency is not consistently valid for all λ when λ 0 75 the data of power coefficients are quite scattered due to the irregular variation of time series of results compare to the rather ambiguous influence of inertia on the power coefficient its influence on the ripple factor of power output r p is much clearer when λ 0 75 i e r p decreases as inertia and tip speed ratio increase as shown in fig 7 b when λ 0 75 the values of r p are scattered and as high as 4 8 since the backward rotation could results in quite small mean power output therefore data of r p at λ 0 75 are omitted in fig 7 b to avoid misleading it is interesting to note that r p for the forced rotation case increases as λ increases at high tip speed ratios this variation is in opposite to that of variable speed rotation cases since in forced rotation case the power output is calculated from the product of resultant hydrodynamic torque and constant rotation speed larger r p implies the ripple factor of resultant hydrodynamic torque increased carefully checking the data shows that the growing of this ripple factor comes not from growing amplitude of torque variation but from lowering of the mean torque the negative torque created by rapidly growing drag on blades cancel a large part of driving torque whilst the power output of variable speed rotation turbine is proportion to the square of rotation speed its fluctuation does decrease as inertia and tip speed ratio increases it should also be noted from fig 7 b that r p in forced rotation case are close not to that in largest inertia case but rather to much smaller inertia cases this means to take forced rotation as an asymptote of variable speed rotation of large inertia rotor is questionable 5 results and discussions from the discussion in last section although a forced rotation model predicts power coefficient variation similar to that of variable speed rotation model it is not capable of predicting fluctuations in rotation speed and power output of variable speed rotating turbines these fluctuations is important for performance assessing except delicate electrical architecture and control system are designed to maintain a vat rotor rotating at constant speed therefore in this section all the results are come from the variable speed rotation model prediction 5 1 flow field the flow around an empty channel i e channel without an incorporated turbine is simulated at first to assess its augmentation effect on flow speed fig 8 shows the distribution of the velocity amplification factor which is defined as the ratio of the in line component of velocity u over the incoming flow speed u in the straight channel the amplification factor is between 2 0 and 2 1 this means the flow speed is increased 100 110 ponta and dutt 2000 and ponta and jacovkis 2008 report a 70 80 maximum speed increment in a similarly shaped open channel as mentioned in introduction section a two dimensional model tends to overestimate velocity augmentation effect in an open channel the present model predicted a stronger augmentation effect than that measured in experiments as expected two pontoons of the channel generate separate wakes and small vortices shed downstream of the pontoons can be recognized in fig 8 vorticity distributions around standalone and channeled turbine are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively for a standalone turbine in fig 9 the blades move in circular paths and leave wakes of vortices behind them these vortices are then conveyed downstream to form spiral shape wakes the vortexes shed from the blades and from the shaft interact with each other creating a chaotic pattern in the downstream half of the rotor roughly consisting of strips with alternative signed vortices since part of the kinetic energy of flow has been extracted out by the rotor the average flow velocity in the wake downstream of the rotor is lower than that of the main flow therefore shear layers are created between the main flow and the wake interacting periodically with the rotating blades the shear layers at both edges of the wake rolled up into series of vortexes the vortexes in the shear layers and in the rotor s wake gradually mixed and merged into vortices as large as the rotor at a downstream distance of about twice the diameter of the rotor a vortex street consisting of these large vortexes emerged which is quite similar to the vortex street formed behind a rotor size blunt body for a turbine incorporated in the channel the flow pattern in the near wake is similar to that of a standalone turbine as shown in fig 10 a but the width of rotor s wake is slightly narrower than that of standalone turbine due to the restriction of the channel walls in fig 10 b the shear layers at the edges of the rotor s wake enrolled with the wakes of the pontoons of the channel again a vortex street emerged downstream of the turbine channel system the size of the vortexes in the street are decided by the size of channel it should be noted that for the channel with a turbine incorporated the average flow velocity at its mouth is only 73 of that of incoming flow the existence of the turbine resists the flow and causes the average velocities inside the channel to slow down but this does not mean the power of the flow inside the channel is lower in this case the power is equal to the pressure drop across the rotor times the volume flux of the flow the numerical predicted pressure drop across the rotor of a channeled turbine is about 800 pa compared to only 150 pa in the case of a turbine in an open free stream therefore the power output by the channeled turbine is higher than that of a standalone turbine therefore in the case of channel incorporated with a turbine the channel effect does not appear in the form of flow speed augmentation but appear in the form of creating much larger pressure drop in the problem of flow around the body the pressure difference created is increase as the incoming flow speed increase following the same principle an empty channel capable of producing high speed flow inside will also produce high pressure drop when a turbine is incorporated therefore it is always good to start with a channel that can achieve high augmentation effect in design 5 2 power output the power output is a major factor in the design of a turbine it is derived by eqs 7 and 8 based on data recorded in numerical tests such data includes the time histories of shaft torque coefficient dimensionless rotational speed and azimuthal angle θ 0 θ 2π as shown in fig 11 since the flow is suddenly started the initial hydrodynamic forces torques on the blades are extremely large as shown in fig 11 a after a few cycles of rotation a more realistic flow field gradually builds up and hydrodynamic forces torques recover to a reasonable level where the turbine runs in a quasi steady state as shown in fig 11 b only the data obtained during a quasi steady state period is meaningful the unrealistic data from the initial stage is abandoned for a standalone turbine in an open free stream c k indicates how much kinetic power being extracted from tidal current passing through the frontal area of rotor dh at speed u hence is the efficiency of the power extraction it is also the dimensionless power output of the turbine in the case of a channeled turbine the tidal current in the width of full system including channel walls is converged to the rotor the current velocity passing the rotor has already been changed by the existence of the channel for convenience c k for channeled turbine is still evaluated based on u and the frontal area of rotor obviously c k lost the meaning of power extraction efficiency in this case but it still represents the dimensionless power output of the channeled turbine for a turbine in a specific flow speed the optimum running state can be determined by varying the load coefficient fig 12 shows the variation of c k with respect to the dimensionless load coefficient b for both standalone and channeled turbines for a standalone turbine the maximum c k is 0 45 at b 5 67 it is a fairly high efficiency but bear in mind that this efficiency is in fact for primary conversion because no mechanical and electrical losses are taken into account if these loses are considered the efficiency could be lower by up to 10 as explained in the section on model validation for a channeled turbine with w 0 d 1 35 the maximum c k is 0 61 at b 6 49 it seems that by incorporating a channel device the optimal load is increased but in fact when b increases from 5 67 to 6 49 c k increases from 0 60 to 0 61 which is only a 1 7 increase it should be noted that a heavier load means larger coils and stronger magnets are required in the generator which implies higher building costs it seems wiser to use the same load as that which optimally matches the standalone turbine therefore a channeled turbine with b 5 67 is used for comparison with a standalone turbine throughout this paper similar to load matching an optimal channel width exists which allows the turbine to achieve maximum power output fig 13 shows the variation of c k with respect to the relative width of straight channel w 0 d at a constant current speed and load coefficient when w 0 d 1 14 1 65 the c k of a channeled turbine is at least 20 higher than that of a standalone turbine the optimum relative width is w 0 d 1 35 at which point the maximum power coefficient reaches up to 0 60 which is 32 higher than that of a standalone turbine this result is comparable to that of malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 who reported an increase of power conversion factor from 0 40 to 0 63 but this is not as encouraging as the 85 increase reported by alidadi et al 2012 the duct shape of alidadi et al 2012 is greatly optimized for a unidirectional current while the symmetric main body profile combined with a foldable deflector as used in this study is more suitable to most sites where the tidal current is bi directional the performance in a unidirectional current is compromised bear in mind that the channel could be used as the turbine s supporting structure which is needed anyway and there are other advantages such as reducing torque fluctuations it is ultimately worth using channels for tidal current energy exploitation since the instantaneous rotational speed of a turbine fluctuates even in a quasi steady state the instantaneous power output of a turbine will also fluctuate fig 14 shows the variation in the ripple factor of power output r p with respect to w 0 d r p increases from 0 40 to 0 65 when w 0 d increases from 1 14 to 1 65 with u 1 5 m s and b 5 67 at the optimal relative width of w 0 d 1 35 r p is 0 52 in the same ambient tidal current and load coefficient r p is 0 72 for a standalone turbine this means that compared to a standalone turbine the power output ripple factor of a channeled turbine is 27 lower when it runs in the maximum power output state 5 3 hydrodynamic torques all the variation in the turbine s power output comes from its hydrodynamic performance fig 15 shows the phase averaged dimensionless hydrodynamic torques referred to as c th hereafter on each blade of a standalone turbine the resultant torques of all blades constitutes the torque on the rotor the c th on the rotor and the azimuthal angle of the blade 1 are also shown in fig 15 blade 1 s center lies on the positive y axis when θ 0 in fig 2 the curve of c th on each blade has a main hump which occupies 40 of the rotational cycle period from t t 0 07 0 47 where t is duration of time of a rotational cycle the maximum torque happens at θ 2π 0 266 for blade 1 this means that for each blade the maximum torque takes place when it runs just past the most upstream point where θ 2π 0 25 of its rotational path in the remaining 60 time period of the rotational cycle the torque on the blade is close to zero the peak torque on the rotor occurs almost synchronously with the maximum torques of each blade this means that when the torque on a blade reaches its maximum in a rotational cycle the other two blades have almost no contribution to torque on the rotor to understand how a channel affects the performance of a turbine comparisons of phase averaged c th on the blade and rotor of the standalone and channeled turbines are shown in fig 16 the comparison of c th on the blade is very similar to malipeddi and chatterjee s 2012 results as shown in fig 16 a the maximum torque on the blade of a channeled turbine is lower than that of a standalone turbine the most profound difference between standalone and channeled turbine cases lies in the value of dimensionless hydrodynamic torque in the downstream half cycle of rotation for channeled turbines c th on the blade is 0 03 0 05 compared to almost zero in the standalone turbine the reason for this difference comes from the different current speed downstream the rotor in the case of a channeled turbine the channel walls constrict the flow so that the average current speed over the section of straight channel remain constant which increases the local tip speed ratio of the blades in the downstream half cycle and improves their hydrodynamic performance however in the case of a standalone turbine the streamlines in the downstream half cycle expand when the resistance effect of the rotor slows the current in fig 16 b the peak value of c th on the rotor of the channeled turbine is 0 37 which is 6 higher than the 0 35 of the standalone turbine the trough value of c th dramatically increases from around 0 07 in the case of the standalone turbine to 0 19 in the channeled turbine which is a significant 170 increase the time averaged c th on the rotor increases from 0 2 in the case of the standalone turbine to 0 28 in the channeled turbine which is a 40 increase meanwhile the ripple factor of hydrodynamic torque on the rotor decreases 20 from 0 85 for the standalone turbine to 0 68 for the channeled turbine the comparison shows that a channel device can increase the average hydrodynamic torque on the rotor and lower the ripple of its fluctuation it should be pointed out that with or without the augmentation channel torque curves always have three repetitions in a rotation cycle because there are 3 blades in this study malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 showed that the frequency of the torque curve for a ducted turbine doubled without explanation the direct reason for this is that the peak value of the torque on the blade of a ducted turbine dropped more severely than that of the ductless turbine in their study it also implies that the geometry of the duct channel may have great impact on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the blade finally the contribution of an assumed constant rotational speed is unclear these combined factors lead to the results 5 4 shaft torque and rotational speed fig 17 shows the phase averaged time histories of dimensionless shaft torques and rotational speed of standalone and channeled turbines dimensionless hydrodynamic torques on rotors are also drawn for reference for a standalone turbine the shaft torque coefficient c t and tip speed ratio λ corresponding to its optimized state are 0 21 and 2 05 respectively the rotational speed fluctuates in the same phase with the shaft torque the phase of hydrodynamic torque on the rotor is about π 4 ahead that of the shaft torque this phase difference between hydrodynamic torque and shaft torque is a result of rotor inertia as shown in fig 16 the hydrodynamic torque on the rotor reaches the peak when the hydrodynamic torque on a blade reaches its peak this happens when a blade running just past the most upstream point of its rotational path at that time the instantaneous rotational speed as well as the instantaneous load torque are still low the resultant positive torque accelerates the rotation of the rotor the load torque grows when the rotational speed grows whilst the hydrodynamic torque decrease when all the blades are some distance away from the most upstream point when the growing load torque exceed the dropping hydrodynamic torque the resultant negative torque decelerates the rotor and then leads to a local minimum rotational speed the load torque decrease and reaches local minimum along with the rotational speed when the next blade approaching the most upstream point the hydrodynamic torque increase and the load torque is small then the rotor accelerate and repeat the above procedure again the larger the rotational inertia of the rotor the slower the acceleration and deceleration and then the smaller the rotational speed and load torque fluctuations figs 18 and 19 show the variations in shaft torque coefficient c t and tip speed ratio λ for a channeled turbine with respect to the relative width of straight channel w 0 d for comparison c t and λ are drawn at the right side of the figures for a standalone turbine in an optimum state when the turbine is incorporated with a channel both the shaft torque coefficient and the rotational speed increase from w 0 d 1 14 to1 65 c t increases from 0 24 to 0 28 and then drops to 0 26 meanwhile λ increases from 2 08 to 2 16 and then drops to 2 06 both the maximum c t and λ occur at relative channel width w 0 d 1 35 the ripple factors of rotational speed r ω and shaft torque r t are important parameters besides the rotational speed and torque as they have a direct influence on the strength and fatigue features of the parts of the mechanical transmission system since shaft torque is equal to the rotational speed multiplied by a constant load coefficient the two ripple factors have equal value fig 20 shows the variation of r ω and r t with respect to the relative width of the straight channel they increase from 0 22 to 0 33 when w 0 d increases from 1 14 to 1 65 with u 1 5 m s and b 5 67 in the same ambient tidal current and load coefficient r ω and r t are 0 36 for the standalone turbine this indicates that the turbine runs steadier in a narrower channel than in a wider one or in open free flow 6 conclusions in this paper numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of an augmentation channel on the performance of a straight blade vertical axis turbine commercial cfd software called fluent is used which is based on navier stokes equations and sst k ω turbulence model discretized in space with finite volume method the hydrodynamic torques on the blades and rotor the power output and the rotational speed of turbines in both an open free stream and in an augmentation channel are systematically compared and discussed based on the results the following conclusions are drawn 1 for the specific designs of vat and channel device used in this paper the maximum power coefficient for a standalone turbine in an open free stream is 0 45 for a channeled turbine in an optimum relative straight channel featuring width w 0 d 1 35 the power output could be 32 higher than that of a standalone turbine in the same ambient tidal current 2 the ripple factor of power output r p for a standalone turbine is 0 72 when w 0 d equals 1 35 the ripple factor of a channeled turbine is 0 52 which is 72 that of the standalone turbine 3 for a standalone turbine the shaft torque coefficient c t and tip speed ratio λ corresponding to the optimized state are 0 21 and 2 05 respectively for a channeled turbine c t increases to 0 28 and λ increases to 2 16 if the width of the channel is optimal for power extraction that means c t could be increased 33 and λ increased more than 5 4 the ripple factors of rotational speed and shaft torque r ω and r t are equal in value for a standalone turbine these ripple factors are 0 36 the turbine runs steadier in a narrower channel than in a wider one or in open free flow when w 0 d equals the optimal value 1 35 where a channeled turbine achieves maximum power output these ripple factors are 0 26 which is 72 that of the standalone turbine in should be noted that the cost of a large channel such as that in this paper could be very expensive therefore building a channel device only for improve the performance of the turbine is not a good choice however sometimes a channel device could be embedded in the supporting structure of the turbine for example for a turbine installed on a floating carrier the channel walls could serve as the buoyancy chamber either in this case it is worthy of trying channel design since not much extra investment would lead to great performance enhancing acknowledgement this work is supported by the general program from the natural science foundation of china nsfc with grant no 51379036 the calculations were performed on the supercomputer tianhe 1a at the national supercomputer center in tianjin china 
23248,numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the effect of an augmentation channel on the performance of a straight blade vertical axis turbine the flow field is simulated with a commercial software fluent in which the finite volume method is used to solve reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the sst k ω turbulence model the rotation of the rotor is simulated by solving a rotation motion equation a comparison between a standalone turbine in a free open stream versus one in an augmentation channel is drawn with discussion regarding variation of hydrodynamic torques on the blade and rotor the power and torque output by the shaft and the rotational speed the comparison reveals that for a turbine in a channel the fluctuations of hydrodynamic torques and rotational speed are dramatically reduced and the power output is more than 30 higher than that of the standalone turbine keywords tidal current power vertical axis turbine augmentation channel numerical simulation 1 introduction tidal current energy is more predictable than other marine renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and wave energy in principle the technique used to extract tidal current energy is the same as that used by the wind power industry a straightforward method of converting tidal current power into electricity extensively utilized by the wind power industry involves using a horizontal axis turbine hat it is found that incorporating a horizontal axis turbine with a duct device is a valid way to increase the power output of the turbine the performance of horizontal axis ducted wind and tidal turbines has been investigated by many researchers including gilbert and foreman 1983 lawn 2003 and setoguchi et al 2004 vertical axis turbines vat offer an alternative technique for tidal current power extraction vats have attracted interest because of their structural simplicity and adaptability with flows of arbitrary direction the main drawbacks of vat are relatively lower efficiency and higher torque fluctuation compared to hat some studies such as goude and ågren 2014 confirms that the vat performance better in a channel although the channel is referred to in geographical sense a number of studies show that an augmentation duct or channel can increase the power output of a vat alidadi et al 2008 and substantially reduce the torque fluctuation alidadi et al 2012 malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 this compensates for the drawbacks of a vat to some degree making it an attractive option for tidal current power exploitation one third of tidal turbines that are deployed or in the r d stage are vat s half of these vats have been considered as candidates for incorporating some kind of augmentation device khan et al 2009 although some research has focused on the current acceleration effect of a solo channel without a turbine in it ponta and dutt 2000 ponta and jacovkis 2008 there are relatively few reports which systematically assess the effect of an augmentation device on the performance of vats this is due to several factors for physical model tests the width of the flume has to be much larger than that of the duct with incorporated turbine to prevent the blockage effect from contaminating the results for numerical model tests rans simulations are more reliable but are very time consuming as alidadi et al 2008 had pointed out this is because compared to simulations of standalone vats in open free streams the computational domain size for ducted vat needs to be extremely large in order to avoid boundary effects also the grids around the turbine and duct walls need to be fine enough to properly resolve the boundary layers in their numerical investigations most researchers assume that the turbine rotates at a constant speed jung et al 2009 li and calisal 2010a alidadi et al 2008 alidadi et al 2012 malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 jung et al 2009 li and calisal 2010a alidadi et al 2008 alidadi et al 2012 and malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 the power output is then derived by multiplying the hydrodynamic torque with rotational speed it should be noticed that this is possible only when the electrical architecture and control system are sophisticatedly designed to maintain constant rotational speed of the rotor this is difficult because unlike the case of horizontal axis turbine the driven torque on blades of a vat varies periodically in principle and naturally lead to rotation speed variation alidadi et al 2012 experimentally and numerically examined the effects of ducts on vats their numerical predicted phase angle and magnitude of torque are different from the experimentally measured torque they attribute this difference to the assumption of constant angular velocity of the rotor in the numerical model while it varied in experiments in some reality cases without dedicated control system the rotational speed of the turbine would fluctuate widely what would be the effects of an augmentation channel on a vat rotates at variable speed is worthy of studying in this paper the performance of a straight blade vertical axis tidal turbine incorporated in an augmentation channel is investigated numerically for turbines in open free streams and in channels the power output hydrodynamic torques on the blade and rotor and the rotational speed are recorded in the investigation instead of assuming a constant rotational speed the rotation speed of the turbine is derived by solving an equation of motion the results for both cases are compared to assess the effect of the channel on how the turbine runs a two dimensional model is used to carry out this investigation if the channeled turbine is placed close to the free surface of water an open channel flow appears between channel walls in this case friction or obstruction can give rise to changes in local head and flow speed consistent with conservation of mass and thus to transfers between potential and kinetic energy balance as explained by henderson 1966 tidal turbines mainly target kinetic energy therefore such hydraulic effects although small can cause a discernible difference from unbounded flows assumed by a two dimensional model another 3 d effect cannot be accounted for is the effect of vat s arms through which the blades are mounted on the shaft of the rotor according to the data of li and calisal 2010b for tip speed ratio tsr less than 2 5 the dropping of the power coefficient caused by the arm effect is less than 0 05 they suggest the two dimensional model is more cost effective in the initial design stage therefore the arm effect is omitted in this study like other researchers have done e g wang et al 2007 li and calisal 2011 and chen et al 2011 etc although the 2 d analysis could give inaccurate prediction in specific cases such as in open channel flow but it is much more cost effective than a full 3 d analysis therefore it is used in this stage of study 2 design of vat and channel a straight bladed vertical axis turbine known as an h darrieus turbine is used in this study the rotor has 3 blades with the symmetric naca0018 aerofoil the vat specifications are given in table 1 ponta and jacovkis 2008 experimentally tested the behaviour of channels with different hydrodynamic profiled pontoons the basic profile of the channel s pontoon used in this study follows those tested by ponta and jacovkis 2008 with the following modifications the main body of the pontoon is forward backward symmetric i e the curves of the nozzle and diffuser parts are the same second the flat tail of the deflector is replaced by a sharp trailing edge tail in practice the device features two foldable deflectors which are installed on both ends of the pontoon in tidal currents the deflector at the upstream end is folded and closed to the main body of the pontoon with the other one at the downstream end opened and functioning when the tidal current reverses the upstream and downstream ends swaps and the function and position of both deflectors also swap accordingly lastly the sharp leading edge of the pontoon is rounded off to avoid severe flow separation when the current does not align perfectly with the center line of the channel the geometric characteristics of the pontoon are shown in fig 1 3 numerical model 3 1 flow model a commercial computational fluid dynamic cfd software fluent is used to simulate the flow field this software is based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations solved via the cell based finite volume method for turbulence closure we adopt the shear stress transport sst k ω model which adequately predicts the boundary layers and flow separations the above flow model has been used successfully in similar studies such as jung et al 2009 and malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 for brevity the equations of the flow model are omitted since they are well known and can readily be found in other literature the flow model is run on the supercomputer of the national supercomputer center in tianjin china 3 2 equation of rotor s motion the hydrodynamic force on a blade and its torque about a rotational center can be obtained directly from intrinsic functions of fluent the hydrodynamic torque on the rotor t h can be obtained by summating the hydrodynamic torques on all three blades the power output by the shaft of the vat is usually input into a mechanical transmission system for example a gear box which increases the rotational speed at a specific ratio and then drives an electricity generator in an electrical circuit or grid the electromagnetic force between the stator and the translator of the generator apply a resistant torque through the mechanical transmission system which eventually acts on the shaft of the turbine in addition to this torque there is also resistant torque caused by friction occurring at the bearings seal rings and between gear teeth all resistant torques are categorized into a load torque t l in this paper the rotational motion equation of the rotor is 1 j z d ω d t t h t t l t in which j z is the rotational inertia of the rotor about its vertical axis and ω is the angular velocity of the rotor which is solved at every time step the above equation is solved by a user defined function udf in fluent as mentioned above the hypothesis of constant rotational speed of rotor is not always true while in the case of varied rotational speed determining the accurate load torque is very difficult bai et al 2014 found in their experiments of a permanent magnet generator used for wind turbine that measured generator torques are almost linear with the rotational speeds but the linear relation between the load torque and the rotational speed is not universally valid it depend not only on the electrical architecture but also affected by the friction in mechanical system for the sake of simplicity the load torque is supposed to be proportional to the rotational speed of the shaft in this paper therefore 2 t l t b ω t in which the load coefficient b is a positive constant which reflects the features of the electricity generator and the electrical load in the circuit or grid 3 3 computational domain and boundary conditions the layout of the computation domain is shown in fig 2 the length of the computation domain is 15 l where l is the length of augmentation channel the distance from the inflow boundary to the leading edge of the channel is 5 l the width of the computation domain is 4 5 l which makes the blockage ratio due to the existence of pontoons less than 5 the axis of the vat lies in the center of the straight channel the velocity is specified at the inflow boundary a zero reference pressure is given at the outflow boundary full slip boundary conditions are applied at both the lower and upper lateral boundaries a non slip velocity condition is applied on the surface of the blades shaft and pontoons in summary the boundary conditions are as follows 3 u u 0 at inflow boundary p 0 at outflow boundary u n 0 at lateral boundaries u 0 on surfaces of pontoons u ω x b x c on surfaces of blades and shaft where x b and x c are respectively the coordinate vectors of points on the surfaces and the center of the rotor s axis ω is the vector of angular velocity which needs to be solved from the equation of rotor s motion at every time step flow is suddenly started at the beginning of the simulation i e all variables throughout the flow field are set to zero at t 0 except for the boundary condition of velocity which gets applied on the inflow boundary the last velocity boundary condition in eq 3 is automatically applied when ω is derived by udf and returned to the cfd solver 3 4 factors affecting the performance of a vat according to the equation of motion of the rotor the resistant load torque has a great influence on the performance of turbine a load that is too light will leave the turbine in an idling state in which the rotational speed is high but the torque output by the rotor is very small a load that is too heavy will stagnate the turbine leading to a small tip speed ratio which worsens the hydrodynamic performance of the blades resulting ultimately in a low power output a load must match the turbine to enable it to operate in an optimized state where the rotational speed is appropriate so that the blades work at an efficient hydrodynamic level while keeping the shaft torque at a reasonable level for a specified turbine in a given current speed the optimum state can be found by the varying load coefficient b with the corresponding maximum power efficiency to reduce the number of variables a dimensionless load coefficient b is adopted the form of this definition is derived from nondimensionalization of eq 1 4 b b d j z u a channel device with a gradually narrowing channel width causes the flow velocity in the neighborhood of the rotor to become higher than that of the ambient tidal current however a turbine incorporated in the channel will resist and slow down the flow this resistant effect may drive part of the flow outside the channel hence reducing the tidal kinetic power flux passing through the rotor and lowering the power output of the turbine the narrower the channel is the greater the resistant effect is provided that the rotor parameters and pontoon size are given an optimal channel width exists which should gain enough benefit of flow augmentation while maintaining an acceptable level of resistance effect at the same time the influence of the relative width of the straight channel defined as the ratio of the channel width over the rotor diameter w 0 d on the performance of the turbine is worth studying tidal current speed varies from slack to flood in a tidal cycle the speed of the incoming tidal current u has great impact on torques and power output of a tidal turbine shiono et al 2000 experimentally tested a vat with flow speed varying from 0 6 to 1 4 m s their study shows that although the absolute power increases with flow speed the relationship between power efficiency and tip speed ratio is almost the same except in the lowest speed case they believe one reason for this exception is due to the fact that the frictional and mechanical losses occupy a relatively lager portion of power output in lowest flow speed case hence compromising the apparent power efficiency therefore it is unnecessary to investigate the impact of tidal current speeds as long as the reynolds number falls in the same range in this study u 1 5 m s is adopted which is a typical stream speed in practical sites in chinese waters the reynolds number based on the chord length of the blade is re u c ν 9 105 in this study the impact of b and w 0 d on the rotational speed of the rotor the torque output by the rotor and the power coefficient of the turbine are investigated with respect to a given incoming tidal current speed u in the simulations b ranges from 3 2 to 7 3 and w 0 d ranges from 1 09 to 1 6 exhaustive testing on the combinations of b and w 0 d have to be done to find the exact optimal conditions for turbine s performance a large number of simulations are needed to complete this optimization process if the performance of the turbine is supposed to be not sensitive to parameters when they are already close to optimal state a less computational expensive process is adopted to get to a close to optimal condition a standalone vat without a channel is simulated first by varying the load coefficient an optimal value is found when the maximum power coefficient is achieved the turbine with this optimal load coefficient is then incorporated in the channel the width of straight channel is varied to get an optimum relative width when the maximum power coefficient is achieved with this optimum relative width the load coefficient is varied again to find the maximum power coefficient for the channeled turbine 3 5 data acquisition and analysis method the following descriptions of data acquisition and derivation are conducted in udfs of fluent the hydrodynamic force torque on each blade can be obtained directly via intrinsic functions of fluent other variables are derived from known data the hydrodynamic torque on the rotor is the sum of the hydrodynamic torques on all three blades when the rotational motion equation of the rotor is solved to get the angular acceleration the rotational velocity and the azimuthal angle of the rotor can be obtained by integrating the angular acceleration with respect to time t 5 ω t 0 t d ω d t d t θ t 0 t ω d t the instantaneous shaft torque t o torque output by the rotor is identical to the load torque t l but with opposite sign because they are a pair of action and reaction torque that is 6 t o t t l t b ω t according to eq 1 the shaft torque differs from the hydrodynamic driving torque t h by the acceleration term due to the effect of inertia the instantaneous power output by the turbine is the product of the shaft torque and the rotational speed of the shaft 7 p t t o t ω t b ω t 2 for the convenience of comparison the averaged non dimensional power output is defined as a power coefficient c k following alidadi et al 2012 8 c k p 1 2 ρ u 3 d h in which ρ is the water density u is the speed of the undisturbed tidal current d is diameter of the rotor h is height of the blade p is power output averaged over cycles of rotation for a standalone turbine the power coefficient is in fact the efficiency of the power extraction but it is not the case for a channeled turbine this will be explained in section 5 2 all the torques including hydrodynamic torque and shaft torque are normalized to torque coefficients 9 c t t t t 1 2 ρ u 2 d h r in which r is the radius of the rotor r d 2 the instantaneous dimensionless rotational speed ω and its complete cycle averaged value i e the tip speed ratio λ are defined as 10 ω t ω t r u λ ω r u there are cycle to cycle variations in hydrodynamic forces torques on the blade and rotor rotational speed torque and power output even in quasi steady running state for convenience of comparison these variables are phase averaged based on data of 7 or 8 rotational cycles in a quasi steady state to yield representative variations in a rotational cycle a main disadvantage of a vat is that the instantaneous hydrodynamic torque rotational speed shaft torque and power output fluctuate periodically the fluctuations of shaft torque and thrust can cause the turbine to risk structural fatigue damage and the fluctuation of power output have an unfavorable effect on the electric circuit grid therefore the features of these fluctuations are worth studying ripple factors of these variables are defined below to measure the fluctuations 11 r f f max f min f in which f represents hydrodynamic torque rotational speed shaft torque and power output respectively f max f min and f are the phase averaged maximum and minimum instantaneous values and time averaged values of these variables 3 6 grid and time step size independence the computational domain is divided into several sub domains according to geometric features each sub domain is mapped by a structural grid the sub domains surrounding the rotor shaft and blades rotate while the rest of the sub domains are stationary during computation the interfaces between the rotating sub domains and the stationary sub domains are set to be slippery interfaces in fluent so that flow field information can be exchanged across these interfaces fig 3 a shows the grid zones i e the sub domains in different color and marks the interfaces between them fig 3 b reveals the details of grid around a blade a series of numerical tests for a turbine in an open free stream are run to make sure that numerical results do not vary with grid and time step size the instantaneous dimensionless power output for progressively finer grids are shown in fig 4 a the instantaneous rotational speeds for these grids have similar curves because the power output is equal to the square of the rotational speed multiplied by a constant load coefficient as shown in eq 7 numerical results predict a higher rotational speed with the coarser grid as time elapsed the different rotational speeds resulted in apparent phase differences between the results of the coarse grid and those of finer grids except for the phase difference the overall results predicted with different grids are very close the relative error of averaged power output predicted by a grid with 251924 nodes compared to one with 522312 nodes is only 3 28 the curves of instantaneous dimensionless power output predicted by a grid with 436530 nodes are almost identical to one with 522312 nodes the relative difference of averaged power output between these two cases is only 0 17 therefore the grid with 436530 nodes for a turbine in an open free stream is adopted in this study for cases involving channeled turbines the total number of nodes is between 650 thousand to 750 thousand depending on channel width but the grid around the turbine never changes in these grids the grid size in the normal direction on the surfaces of blades are set to be 0 0006 m which is 0 001 times the blade chord length the sizes of the shaft surfaces and pontoon surface in the channel are 0 0014 m in this grid which is 0 0035 times the diameter of the shaft 0 0023 times the blade chord length similar to the grid size independence check various time increments ranging from δt 0 00035s 0 005s are tested in our numerical simulations the instantaneous dimensionless power output for different time steps are shown in fig 4 b for δt 0 002s the average power coefficient c k and ripple factors of power output r p are around 0 45 and 0 72 respectively the relative difference in the results of δt 0 00035 0 0005 and 0 002s are less than 1 but the c k and r p of δt 0 005s are 3 3 and 21 9 higher than those of the δt 0 00035s case it is also shown in fig 4 b that there is a phase difference between the time history of δt 0 002 and 0 0005s while those of δt 0 00035 and 0 0005s are almost identical therefore δt 0 0005s is used throughout this study 4 validation of the numerical model the above numerical model is validated before it is applied in this study although there have been reports on the results of vat experiments very few are able to offer sufficient and clear details for the sake of comparison another complexity is that the results of existing experiments seems rather scattered for example kiho et al 1996 tested a 3 blades 1 6 m diameter darrieus turbine in a 0 8 1 5 m s tidal current with the solidity equal to 0 179 and report the highest power efficiency 56 at the tip speed ratio equal to 2 1 the same group of authors conduct another experiment shiono et al 2000 using a 0 3 m diameter turbine with the same number of blades the same airfoil and solidity as previous but report a maximum power efficiency only 23 5 at a tip speed ratio of 1 82 in a 0 6 1 4 m s stream the scattered results could be attributed to the uncertainties often encountered in experiments e g the mechanical and electrical losses the experimental study on darrieus turbines by shiono et al 2000 is conducted in a circulating water tank the aerofoil of the blade is naca633 018 which is a symmetric foil but by joining the camber line to the circumference of the rotor it becomes asymmetric a series of turbines with different numbers of blades and varying solidity were tested in different flow speeds the variations of power efficiency with respect to tip speed ratio of a 3 blades turbine with solidity of 0 366 blade chord is 115 2 mm are given in more details so we are able to use it to validate the computational method in our present study both variable speed rotation and forced constant speed rotation cases are simulated the results of them are discussed respectively 4 1 forced rotation at constant speeds in the case of forced constant speed rotation the power efficiency is obtained by eq 12 in which t is the hydrodynamic torques on the rotor ω the rotational speed s the swept area of the rotor and b l ω 2 represents mechanical losses such as frictional losses in the bearings 12 c k t ω b l ω 2 1 2 ρ u 3 s the comparison between the power efficiency in the experiment conducted by shiono et al 2000 and that predicted by our numerical model is shown in fig 5 in the forced constant speed rotations the coefficient b l 0 means no mechanical losses are considered all hydrodynamic power is assumed being converted to mechanical power of the turbine in this case the predicted maximum power efficiency is 29 4 at a tip speed ratio 1 45 whilst the experiment obtained a maximum power efficiency of 20 23 at a tip speed ratio 1 2 1 3 at first sight the discrepancy between prediction and measurement is remarkable but if mechanical losses are taken into account the prediction are greatly improved when the coefficient b l is set to 0 15 the predicted maximum power efficiency is 21 6 at a tip speed ratio 1 25 these data agree very well with the experimental results for the sake of brevity the results of variable speed rotations with mechanical losses correction i e b l 0 are not included in this figure the effect of the correction is similar to that in the cases of constant speed rotations except indicating that the frictional losses are responsible for the poor efficiency in the 0 6 m s stream case as shown in fig 5 a there is no indication of the proportion that mechanical losses occupied in output in shiono et al 2000 it can be seen from fig 5 b that there is a remarkable difference in the results with and without considering mechanical losses also the maximum power efficiency falls since part of the extracted power is being consumed by mechanical losses the optimum tip speed ratio also may lower in the view of maximum usable power in the above simulations for model validation the independence of the different parameters is checked the grid with nodes from around 100 thousands to more than 300 thousands time increments δt from 0 0001s to 0 003s turbulent intensity on inlet boundary from 1 to 5 are tested it is found that simulations with more than 200 thousands grid nodes keeping y 2 for grid points nearest to the blade and time increments δt 0 002s will keep the relative errors less than 5 the influence of turbulent intensity is negligible the results shown in fig 5 b are calculated with δt 0 0002s turbulent intensity on inlet boundary 5 and on a grid with 232617 nodes 4 2 variable speed rotation and influence of inertial when the rotation of the rotor is governed by eq 1 the rotation speed is variable in this case the friction torque on the shaft is adjusted to get different tip speed ratios the power efficiency is obtained by eqs 7 and 8 fig 6 gives examples of time series of instantaneous non dimensional rotation speed and azimuth angle in the cases of different non dimensional load coefficient b in these examples the inertia of rotor j z 4j z0 where jz 0 equals to 0 015 kg m2 which is the smallest inertia used in assessing the inertia influence when b is relative small the instantaneous rotation speed varies periodically around a mean value in a highly repetitive pattern the time periods of each rotation cycle are almost identical such as that in fig 6 a if b is very high the resistant torque could be very small when the rotor is nearly stationary but grows quickly when rotation speed increasing in comparison in the case of smaller b the resistant torque is more stable but its maximum is relative lower thus in the case of very high b the rotor rotates in pulsate and discontinuous way it can suddenly accelerate to an instantaneous high speed even larger than that in the case of smaller b but also could be stagnated for a while or even rotating backwards due to negative instantaneous hydrodynamic torque this negative torque sometimes occurs when the rotor is close to stagnation it is the reason why a vertical axis turbine is difficult to self start as shown in fig 6 b the variation of instantaneous rotation speed and azimuth angle is irregular the time periods of each rotation cycle are obviously different from cycle to cycle although the tip speed ratio and power coefficient could still be obtained from the manipulating the data but they don t make practical sense since a turbine is never supposed to operate in that fashion it is found when b is high enough to make the tip speed ratio smaller than 0 75 the backward rotation happened and the time series of results are irregular like that in fig 6 b this irregular rotation cannot be correctly predicted by forced rotation model although b has included the inertia of rotor it is more straight forward to discuss the influence of inertia on the performance of a turbine fig 7 shows the results of turbine with inertia of rotor equals to j z0 and 2 4 and 10 times of j z0 for comparison the results of forced constant speed rotation is also included in the figure the stream velocity is 0 8 m s for all the cases in fig 7 no mechanical losses correction are applied the maximum power coefficient of the forced rotation case in fig 7 a is slightly lower than that in fig 5 a in which the stream velocity is 1 0 m s this could be attributed to the difference in blade reynolds number from fig 7 a the variations of power coefficients versus tip speed ratio λ predicted by both forced rotation model and variable speed model are quite similar at high tip speed ratios the power coefficients for larger inertia turbines seems higher than that for smaller inertia turbines but this tendency is not consistently valid for all λ when λ 0 75 the data of power coefficients are quite scattered due to the irregular variation of time series of results compare to the rather ambiguous influence of inertia on the power coefficient its influence on the ripple factor of power output r p is much clearer when λ 0 75 i e r p decreases as inertia and tip speed ratio increase as shown in fig 7 b when λ 0 75 the values of r p are scattered and as high as 4 8 since the backward rotation could results in quite small mean power output therefore data of r p at λ 0 75 are omitted in fig 7 b to avoid misleading it is interesting to note that r p for the forced rotation case increases as λ increases at high tip speed ratios this variation is in opposite to that of variable speed rotation cases since in forced rotation case the power output is calculated from the product of resultant hydrodynamic torque and constant rotation speed larger r p implies the ripple factor of resultant hydrodynamic torque increased carefully checking the data shows that the growing of this ripple factor comes not from growing amplitude of torque variation but from lowering of the mean torque the negative torque created by rapidly growing drag on blades cancel a large part of driving torque whilst the power output of variable speed rotation turbine is proportion to the square of rotation speed its fluctuation does decrease as inertia and tip speed ratio increases it should also be noted from fig 7 b that r p in forced rotation case are close not to that in largest inertia case but rather to much smaller inertia cases this means to take forced rotation as an asymptote of variable speed rotation of large inertia rotor is questionable 5 results and discussions from the discussion in last section although a forced rotation model predicts power coefficient variation similar to that of variable speed rotation model it is not capable of predicting fluctuations in rotation speed and power output of variable speed rotating turbines these fluctuations is important for performance assessing except delicate electrical architecture and control system are designed to maintain a vat rotor rotating at constant speed therefore in this section all the results are come from the variable speed rotation model prediction 5 1 flow field the flow around an empty channel i e channel without an incorporated turbine is simulated at first to assess its augmentation effect on flow speed fig 8 shows the distribution of the velocity amplification factor which is defined as the ratio of the in line component of velocity u over the incoming flow speed u in the straight channel the amplification factor is between 2 0 and 2 1 this means the flow speed is increased 100 110 ponta and dutt 2000 and ponta and jacovkis 2008 report a 70 80 maximum speed increment in a similarly shaped open channel as mentioned in introduction section a two dimensional model tends to overestimate velocity augmentation effect in an open channel the present model predicted a stronger augmentation effect than that measured in experiments as expected two pontoons of the channel generate separate wakes and small vortices shed downstream of the pontoons can be recognized in fig 8 vorticity distributions around standalone and channeled turbine are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively for a standalone turbine in fig 9 the blades move in circular paths and leave wakes of vortices behind them these vortices are then conveyed downstream to form spiral shape wakes the vortexes shed from the blades and from the shaft interact with each other creating a chaotic pattern in the downstream half of the rotor roughly consisting of strips with alternative signed vortices since part of the kinetic energy of flow has been extracted out by the rotor the average flow velocity in the wake downstream of the rotor is lower than that of the main flow therefore shear layers are created between the main flow and the wake interacting periodically with the rotating blades the shear layers at both edges of the wake rolled up into series of vortexes the vortexes in the shear layers and in the rotor s wake gradually mixed and merged into vortices as large as the rotor at a downstream distance of about twice the diameter of the rotor a vortex street consisting of these large vortexes emerged which is quite similar to the vortex street formed behind a rotor size blunt body for a turbine incorporated in the channel the flow pattern in the near wake is similar to that of a standalone turbine as shown in fig 10 a but the width of rotor s wake is slightly narrower than that of standalone turbine due to the restriction of the channel walls in fig 10 b the shear layers at the edges of the rotor s wake enrolled with the wakes of the pontoons of the channel again a vortex street emerged downstream of the turbine channel system the size of the vortexes in the street are decided by the size of channel it should be noted that for the channel with a turbine incorporated the average flow velocity at its mouth is only 73 of that of incoming flow the existence of the turbine resists the flow and causes the average velocities inside the channel to slow down but this does not mean the power of the flow inside the channel is lower in this case the power is equal to the pressure drop across the rotor times the volume flux of the flow the numerical predicted pressure drop across the rotor of a channeled turbine is about 800 pa compared to only 150 pa in the case of a turbine in an open free stream therefore the power output by the channeled turbine is higher than that of a standalone turbine therefore in the case of channel incorporated with a turbine the channel effect does not appear in the form of flow speed augmentation but appear in the form of creating much larger pressure drop in the problem of flow around the body the pressure difference created is increase as the incoming flow speed increase following the same principle an empty channel capable of producing high speed flow inside will also produce high pressure drop when a turbine is incorporated therefore it is always good to start with a channel that can achieve high augmentation effect in design 5 2 power output the power output is a major factor in the design of a turbine it is derived by eqs 7 and 8 based on data recorded in numerical tests such data includes the time histories of shaft torque coefficient dimensionless rotational speed and azimuthal angle θ 0 θ 2π as shown in fig 11 since the flow is suddenly started the initial hydrodynamic forces torques on the blades are extremely large as shown in fig 11 a after a few cycles of rotation a more realistic flow field gradually builds up and hydrodynamic forces torques recover to a reasonable level where the turbine runs in a quasi steady state as shown in fig 11 b only the data obtained during a quasi steady state period is meaningful the unrealistic data from the initial stage is abandoned for a standalone turbine in an open free stream c k indicates how much kinetic power being extracted from tidal current passing through the frontal area of rotor dh at speed u hence is the efficiency of the power extraction it is also the dimensionless power output of the turbine in the case of a channeled turbine the tidal current in the width of full system including channel walls is converged to the rotor the current velocity passing the rotor has already been changed by the existence of the channel for convenience c k for channeled turbine is still evaluated based on u and the frontal area of rotor obviously c k lost the meaning of power extraction efficiency in this case but it still represents the dimensionless power output of the channeled turbine for a turbine in a specific flow speed the optimum running state can be determined by varying the load coefficient fig 12 shows the variation of c k with respect to the dimensionless load coefficient b for both standalone and channeled turbines for a standalone turbine the maximum c k is 0 45 at b 5 67 it is a fairly high efficiency but bear in mind that this efficiency is in fact for primary conversion because no mechanical and electrical losses are taken into account if these loses are considered the efficiency could be lower by up to 10 as explained in the section on model validation for a channeled turbine with w 0 d 1 35 the maximum c k is 0 61 at b 6 49 it seems that by incorporating a channel device the optimal load is increased but in fact when b increases from 5 67 to 6 49 c k increases from 0 60 to 0 61 which is only a 1 7 increase it should be noted that a heavier load means larger coils and stronger magnets are required in the generator which implies higher building costs it seems wiser to use the same load as that which optimally matches the standalone turbine therefore a channeled turbine with b 5 67 is used for comparison with a standalone turbine throughout this paper similar to load matching an optimal channel width exists which allows the turbine to achieve maximum power output fig 13 shows the variation of c k with respect to the relative width of straight channel w 0 d at a constant current speed and load coefficient when w 0 d 1 14 1 65 the c k of a channeled turbine is at least 20 higher than that of a standalone turbine the optimum relative width is w 0 d 1 35 at which point the maximum power coefficient reaches up to 0 60 which is 32 higher than that of a standalone turbine this result is comparable to that of malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 who reported an increase of power conversion factor from 0 40 to 0 63 but this is not as encouraging as the 85 increase reported by alidadi et al 2012 the duct shape of alidadi et al 2012 is greatly optimized for a unidirectional current while the symmetric main body profile combined with a foldable deflector as used in this study is more suitable to most sites where the tidal current is bi directional the performance in a unidirectional current is compromised bear in mind that the channel could be used as the turbine s supporting structure which is needed anyway and there are other advantages such as reducing torque fluctuations it is ultimately worth using channels for tidal current energy exploitation since the instantaneous rotational speed of a turbine fluctuates even in a quasi steady state the instantaneous power output of a turbine will also fluctuate fig 14 shows the variation in the ripple factor of power output r p with respect to w 0 d r p increases from 0 40 to 0 65 when w 0 d increases from 1 14 to 1 65 with u 1 5 m s and b 5 67 at the optimal relative width of w 0 d 1 35 r p is 0 52 in the same ambient tidal current and load coefficient r p is 0 72 for a standalone turbine this means that compared to a standalone turbine the power output ripple factor of a channeled turbine is 27 lower when it runs in the maximum power output state 5 3 hydrodynamic torques all the variation in the turbine s power output comes from its hydrodynamic performance fig 15 shows the phase averaged dimensionless hydrodynamic torques referred to as c th hereafter on each blade of a standalone turbine the resultant torques of all blades constitutes the torque on the rotor the c th on the rotor and the azimuthal angle of the blade 1 are also shown in fig 15 blade 1 s center lies on the positive y axis when θ 0 in fig 2 the curve of c th on each blade has a main hump which occupies 40 of the rotational cycle period from t t 0 07 0 47 where t is duration of time of a rotational cycle the maximum torque happens at θ 2π 0 266 for blade 1 this means that for each blade the maximum torque takes place when it runs just past the most upstream point where θ 2π 0 25 of its rotational path in the remaining 60 time period of the rotational cycle the torque on the blade is close to zero the peak torque on the rotor occurs almost synchronously with the maximum torques of each blade this means that when the torque on a blade reaches its maximum in a rotational cycle the other two blades have almost no contribution to torque on the rotor to understand how a channel affects the performance of a turbine comparisons of phase averaged c th on the blade and rotor of the standalone and channeled turbines are shown in fig 16 the comparison of c th on the blade is very similar to malipeddi and chatterjee s 2012 results as shown in fig 16 a the maximum torque on the blade of a channeled turbine is lower than that of a standalone turbine the most profound difference between standalone and channeled turbine cases lies in the value of dimensionless hydrodynamic torque in the downstream half cycle of rotation for channeled turbines c th on the blade is 0 03 0 05 compared to almost zero in the standalone turbine the reason for this difference comes from the different current speed downstream the rotor in the case of a channeled turbine the channel walls constrict the flow so that the average current speed over the section of straight channel remain constant which increases the local tip speed ratio of the blades in the downstream half cycle and improves their hydrodynamic performance however in the case of a standalone turbine the streamlines in the downstream half cycle expand when the resistance effect of the rotor slows the current in fig 16 b the peak value of c th on the rotor of the channeled turbine is 0 37 which is 6 higher than the 0 35 of the standalone turbine the trough value of c th dramatically increases from around 0 07 in the case of the standalone turbine to 0 19 in the channeled turbine which is a significant 170 increase the time averaged c th on the rotor increases from 0 2 in the case of the standalone turbine to 0 28 in the channeled turbine which is a 40 increase meanwhile the ripple factor of hydrodynamic torque on the rotor decreases 20 from 0 85 for the standalone turbine to 0 68 for the channeled turbine the comparison shows that a channel device can increase the average hydrodynamic torque on the rotor and lower the ripple of its fluctuation it should be pointed out that with or without the augmentation channel torque curves always have three repetitions in a rotation cycle because there are 3 blades in this study malipeddi and chatterjee 2012 showed that the frequency of the torque curve for a ducted turbine doubled without explanation the direct reason for this is that the peak value of the torque on the blade of a ducted turbine dropped more severely than that of the ductless turbine in their study it also implies that the geometry of the duct channel may have great impact on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the blade finally the contribution of an assumed constant rotational speed is unclear these combined factors lead to the results 5 4 shaft torque and rotational speed fig 17 shows the phase averaged time histories of dimensionless shaft torques and rotational speed of standalone and channeled turbines dimensionless hydrodynamic torques on rotors are also drawn for reference for a standalone turbine the shaft torque coefficient c t and tip speed ratio λ corresponding to its optimized state are 0 21 and 2 05 respectively the rotational speed fluctuates in the same phase with the shaft torque the phase of hydrodynamic torque on the rotor is about π 4 ahead that of the shaft torque this phase difference between hydrodynamic torque and shaft torque is a result of rotor inertia as shown in fig 16 the hydrodynamic torque on the rotor reaches the peak when the hydrodynamic torque on a blade reaches its peak this happens when a blade running just past the most upstream point of its rotational path at that time the instantaneous rotational speed as well as the instantaneous load torque are still low the resultant positive torque accelerates the rotation of the rotor the load torque grows when the rotational speed grows whilst the hydrodynamic torque decrease when all the blades are some distance away from the most upstream point when the growing load torque exceed the dropping hydrodynamic torque the resultant negative torque decelerates the rotor and then leads to a local minimum rotational speed the load torque decrease and reaches local minimum along with the rotational speed when the next blade approaching the most upstream point the hydrodynamic torque increase and the load torque is small then the rotor accelerate and repeat the above procedure again the larger the rotational inertia of the rotor the slower the acceleration and deceleration and then the smaller the rotational speed and load torque fluctuations figs 18 and 19 show the variations in shaft torque coefficient c t and tip speed ratio λ for a channeled turbine with respect to the relative width of straight channel w 0 d for comparison c t and λ are drawn at the right side of the figures for a standalone turbine in an optimum state when the turbine is incorporated with a channel both the shaft torque coefficient and the rotational speed increase from w 0 d 1 14 to1 65 c t increases from 0 24 to 0 28 and then drops to 0 26 meanwhile λ increases from 2 08 to 2 16 and then drops to 2 06 both the maximum c t and λ occur at relative channel width w 0 d 1 35 the ripple factors of rotational speed r ω and shaft torque r t are important parameters besides the rotational speed and torque as they have a direct influence on the strength and fatigue features of the parts of the mechanical transmission system since shaft torque is equal to the rotational speed multiplied by a constant load coefficient the two ripple factors have equal value fig 20 shows the variation of r ω and r t with respect to the relative width of the straight channel they increase from 0 22 to 0 33 when w 0 d increases from 1 14 to 1 65 with u 1 5 m s and b 5 67 in the same ambient tidal current and load coefficient r ω and r t are 0 36 for the standalone turbine this indicates that the turbine runs steadier in a narrower channel than in a wider one or in open free flow 6 conclusions in this paper numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of an augmentation channel on the performance of a straight blade vertical axis turbine commercial cfd software called fluent is used which is based on navier stokes equations and sst k ω turbulence model discretized in space with finite volume method the hydrodynamic torques on the blades and rotor the power output and the rotational speed of turbines in both an open free stream and in an augmentation channel are systematically compared and discussed based on the results the following conclusions are drawn 1 for the specific designs of vat and channel device used in this paper the maximum power coefficient for a standalone turbine in an open free stream is 0 45 for a channeled turbine in an optimum relative straight channel featuring width w 0 d 1 35 the power output could be 32 higher than that of a standalone turbine in the same ambient tidal current 2 the ripple factor of power output r p for a standalone turbine is 0 72 when w 0 d equals 1 35 the ripple factor of a channeled turbine is 0 52 which is 72 that of the standalone turbine 3 for a standalone turbine the shaft torque coefficient c t and tip speed ratio λ corresponding to the optimized state are 0 21 and 2 05 respectively for a channeled turbine c t increases to 0 28 and λ increases to 2 16 if the width of the channel is optimal for power extraction that means c t could be increased 33 and λ increased more than 5 4 the ripple factors of rotational speed and shaft torque r ω and r t are equal in value for a standalone turbine these ripple factors are 0 36 the turbine runs steadier in a narrower channel than in a wider one or in open free flow when w 0 d equals the optimal value 1 35 where a channeled turbine achieves maximum power output these ripple factors are 0 26 which is 72 that of the standalone turbine in should be noted that the cost of a large channel such as that in this paper could be very expensive therefore building a channel device only for improve the performance of the turbine is not a good choice however sometimes a channel device could be embedded in the supporting structure of the turbine for example for a turbine installed on a floating carrier the channel walls could serve as the buoyancy chamber either in this case it is worthy of trying channel design since not much extra investment would lead to great performance enhancing acknowledgement this work is supported by the general program from the natural science foundation of china nsfc with grant no

23249,in the present study an attempt is made to understand the effect of continental and nearshore slopes on the transmission propagation and run up of tsunami a numerical model study is carried out using shallow water equations that are solved using crank nicolson finite difference approximation method on a staggered grid a rectangular solitary wave is considered to propagate over typical continental slopes and nearshore profiles available along the indian coast the amplification or attenuation of tsunami characteristics over these cross sections was studied it was observed that the tsunami run up is altered with varying continental slope water depth on continental shelf and nearshore slope the study suggests that tsunami height on the continental shelf increases for shallow continental shelf depths the percentage increase in tsunami height with decrease in continental shelf depth from 200 m to 50 m is found to be 31 higher tsunami run up was observed for deeper continental shelf and steeper continental slope whereas lower tsunami run up for deeper continental shelf and flatter continental slope it was observed that for a steep continental slope 1 0 1 a reduction in nearshore slope steep to flat increases tsunami run up up to a slope of 1 632 and then decreases keywords tsunami shallow water equation crank nicolson method run up continental slope nearshore slope 1 introduction tsunamis earthquake generated waves are created in the deep portion of the ocean and propagate towards the shore tsunami a shallow water wave undergoes transformation as it propagates along the continental slope towards the coast this transformation is in the form of reduction in speed which leads to increase in wave height kowalik et al 2006 sriram et al 2006 after reaching the shore tsunami will break and travel over the land with huge energy which creates severe impact and disaster in the society sriram et al 2006 it is necessary to understand the effect of near shore bathymetry on tsunami characteristics and prediction of run up behera et al 2011 which will help in adopting appropriate measures to reduce the tsunami effect on society in the past various studies had been carried out to investigate the tsunami run up on different beach slopes and empirical formulae were suggested for computation of tsunami run up gjevik and pedersen 1983 developed a numerical model based on a lagrangian description for studying run up of long water waves on beach slopes varying from 0 to 45 synolakis 1987 studied the run up of solitary wave on plane beaches by conducting various laboratory experiments over different beach slopes varying from 2 to 45 the author observed that run up variation will behave differently for breaking and non breaking waves grilli et al 1997 had reported that waves will not break on beach with slope steeper than 1 4 7 they have also concluded that shoaling rate decreases for slopes steeper than 1 15 at the same time waves may break very close to the shore line for moderately steep slopes postacioglu et al 2017 have investigated the resonance aspect of coastal run up as a response to incident tsunami they have observed that the resonance is highly dependent on the discontinuity in depth at the toe of the slope in case of no discontinuity in depth the run up amplitude increases steadily with negligible resonance similarly long wave run up on a segmented beach slope was investigated by ezersky et al 2013 and reported that resonance effects lead to the sufficient increase of run up heights for the weakest earthquakes gedik et al 2005 observed that armor units used for beach protection cause 50 reduction in run up height if wave steepness h l is greater than 0 015 the run up decreases with increasing value of bed friction borthwick et al 2006 hsiao et al 2008 conducted laboratory experiments and developed a formula to compute maximum run up height for beach slopes varying from 1 15 to 1 60 madsen and fuhrman 2008 observed that the impact of run up on flat beaches with slope 1 100 is much higher than that on steep beaches with slope 1 15 the reflection coefficient decreases when run up height and wave steepness increase gedik et al 2011 lin et al 2014 had concluded that the maximum run up velocity increases gradually along the slope before the solitary wave reaches its breaking point zhao et al 2017 carried out numerical and experimental study to investigate the effect of submarine gentle slopes and coastal cliffs on the nearshore tsunami characteristics and concluded that critical cliff angle is 45 there were numerous experimental analytical and numerical model studies carried out on behavior of tsunami along the coast gjevik and pedersen 1983 grilli et al 1997 lin et al 2014 most of the studies were based on the analysis of solitary wave propagation over different beach profiles and the subsequent run up beach slopes are more flatter than continental slopes and expected to affect the tsunami characteristics differently the effect of continental slopes on tsunami characteristics and subsequent run up along the coast has not been investigated in the past studies the tsunami characteristics in the continental shelf region is of great importance as they are going to affect large number of offshore structures present in these regions thus a 1d numerical study is carried out to investigate the effect of continental and nearshore slopes on tsunami characteristics 2 numerical model although tsunami is generally simulated using 2d or 3d models for realistic modelling in the present study a 1d model is used to understand the effect of continental and nearshore slope profiles on the tsunami characteristics the 1d model study also helps in avoiding the effect of lateral energy transfers due continental shelf geometry thus using the 1d model study we intend to quantify the effect of continental slope and nearshore slope alone tsunami being a shallow water wave can be simulated using shallow water equations 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions in the present study a numerical model is developed using 1d shallow water equations swe and are given as 1 η t q x 0 2 q t u q x h ρ p a x g h η x τ b ρ h 3 τ b ρ k b h 2 q q where η is sea surface elevation h is total depth of water still water depth from mean sea level d sea surface elevation η u is average velocity of the water particle q is the flow discharge in the x direction uh g is acceleration due to gravity ρ is density of sea water τ b is bottom stress and k b is dimensionless bottom friction coefficient the value of friction coefficient k b varies from 1 0 10 3 to 3 0 10 3 dotsenko 1998 in this study k b 2 0 10 3 is considered as suggested by behera et al 2011 here pa is atmospheric pressure and the gradient equals to 0 then the modified momentum equation can be written as 4 q t u q x g h η x τ b ρ h the shoreline boundary is assumed as an abrupt end of the coast with finite water depth and no flow condition is applied open boundary is imposed with radiation condition given by flather 1976 the velocity of tsunami at the open boundary is given by 5 u g h η 2 2 solution of swe equations 1 and 4 can be solved by using crank nicolson finite difference method on a staggered grid fig 1 with first order difference in time and space the staggered grid arrangement is shown in fig 1 where the sea surface elevations η are defined by filled circles and discharges q are defined by empty circles the staggered grid requires either sea level or velocity as boundary condition input kowalik and murty 1993 the continuity and momentum equations in central difference form are given as 6 η n 1 η n 1 2 δ t q i 1 n q i 1 n 2 δ x 0 7 q n 1 q n 1 2 δ t u i q i 1 n q i 1 n 2 δ x q i

the nodes except at the boundary are obtained by solving the above equations 3 validation of the numerical model in general a numerical model is validated with standard numerical model or physical model results the 1d numerical model developed using the shallow water equations is validated with the results of kowalik et al 2006 who have studied the tide tsunami interaction for gulf of alaska region a numerical model domain same as of kowalik et al 2006 is considered for the study the model domain consists of 1000 km long channel with constant water depth up to 875 km from the open boundary 0 km and varying depth for a stretch of 125 km towards the shore fig 2 a the water depth in the domain is 3000 m from the open boundary to 875 km and then reduces from 3000 m to 5 m at the truncated shoreline boundary in the present model the shoreline boundary is assigned with finite water depth of 5 m for numerical stability unlike the wet dry boundary condition used in the study of kowalik et al 2006 simulation of tsunami was carried out by generating a perturbation with uniform bottom uplift of height 2 m and length 200 km located between 200 km and 400 km kowalik et al 2006 fig 2 b the model was initialized with zero elevation and zero velocity all through the domain except the tsunami perturbation given in fig 2 b the simulation was carried out and tsunami elevation profiles were recorded at 2min 16 67min 39min 57 6min 1hr 16min and 1hr 27min intervals the extracted tsunami profiles were compared with that of kowalik et al 2006 and are found to be in acceptable agreement however the comparison plot for t 1hr 27min fig 3 f show higher values for present numerical model results compared to kowalik s results this difference is expected as the shoreline boundary in the present study is imposed with no flow condition unlike the wet dry boundary condition used in the study of kowalik et al 2006 it was observed that the tsunami splits into two waves of 1 m height travelling in opposite direction t 16 67min the wave travelling towards the open boundary travels across and moves out of the domain whereas the wave travelling towards the shore propagates with constant amplitude t 39min and is considered as incident wave at 57 6min the tsunami strikes on the shore following which the reflection of tsunami from the shore is observed the tsunami attains maximum run up height when the complete wave hits the shore as seen in fig 3 f the tsunami elevation and velocity at open and shoreline boundary were obtained and compared with results obtained by kowalik et al 2006 figs 4 and 5 in fig 4 the elevations and velocities obtained from the present model are found to be in good agreement with the results of kowalik et al 2006 up to the arrival of initial tsunami whereas an over estimation is observed in the case of reflected wave recorded around 4 h of the simulation this difference is due to the reflection from the wall boundary condition imposed at the shoreline in the present model in comparison the wet dry boundary imposed in the kowalik et al 2006 model similarly fig 5 shows the elevation and velocities close to the shoreline a finite depth is considered at the shoreline in the present model for numerical stability and hence the negative elevation is recorded whereas the kowalik et al 2006 model shows zero elevation in case of drawdowns however the positive elevations are in good comparison that refers to the run up in the present study the velocity at the shoreline captures the initial run up and run down phenomena with some oscillations later on due to the truncated vertical wall at the shoreline as the focus of the study was to investigate the effect of continental and nearshore slopes on tsunami efforts were not made to incorporate the wet dry boundary condition in the present model that is more useful during inundation modelling 4 numerical model domain the model was used to investigate the effect of various continental slopes on tsunami propagation amplification and its profiles although the study has been undertaken for preliminary understanding the effect of typical continental slopes on tsunami run up the slopes present in the actual continental shelves along india are considered for the study the continental slopes are obtained from the gebco 30 arc seconds bathymetry data https www gebco net depth profiles of 18 salient cross sections along the indian coast are obtained fig 6 selected cross section tracks are mostly perpendicular to the continental shelf profile that represents the actual slope the continental slopes available along the indian coast are given in table 1 and typical continental shelf profiles for cross sections 4 and 6 are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively table 1 shows that the continental slopes available along the indian coast are varying from 1 63 7 to 1 7 there are steeper slopes also present at locations along the coast of andaman islands for the overall understanding the slopes varying from 1 75 to 1 0 1 are considered in this study given in table 2 the present study is carried out by considering a domain of 1200 km long channel having constant water depth of 3 km up to a distance of 875 km the bathymetry profile used for this study is shown in fig 8 an initial tsunami profile of height 2 m 2h0 and length 200 km spanning between 200 km and 400 km is considered in the study fig 8 tsunami elevations are recorded at three locations p1 p2 and p3 as shown in fig 8 the first location is placed in deep ocean 3 km depth at p1 800 km from the open boundary to record the incident tsunami profile the second is placed at p2 1100 km from the open boundary which is on the continental shelf to observe the transformations in the tsunami profile due to continental slope the third location is placed at shore p3 to observe the tsunami run up characteristics at the shore 5 effect of continental slope on tsunami characteristics the simulation was initiated by releasing the initial tsunami perturbation that splits into two waves and each wave propagates on opposite directions the wave that propagates towards the open radiation boundary moves out of the domain without any reflection the tsunami that propagates towards the shore incident tsunami undergoes various transformations in its wave height and wave length along the channel the transformation of the tsunami characteristics occurs mainly due to continental slope and nearshore slope the effect of slopes on the tsunami can be analysed by recording its profile at the three probe locations as specified in fig 8 the effect of continental slope is observed by the probe at location p2 with a specified continental shelf depth the continental shelf depth varies from coast to coast thus the simulations were carried out for four different continental shelf depths 50 m 75 m 100 m and 200 m the simulations were carried out for different continental slope and continental shelf depth combinations the tsunami height h0 is measured at probe p1 and is considered as incident tsunami height to ride over the continental slope the tsunami height hs is measured at probe location p2 after shoaling over the continental slope the recorded values of hs on the continental shelf depth are plotted with respect to continental slope in terms of normalised tsunami height ratio of tsunami height on the continental shelf hs and incident tsunami height h0 as shown in fig 9 the results show that tsunami height on continental shelf is lower for steeper slope in comparison to flatter slope it is observed that a nearly vertical face results in a normalised tsunami height hs h0 varying from 1 5 to 1 6 fig 9 whereas for a slope of 1 75 the normalised tsunami height hs h0 varies between 1 8 and 2 4 fig 9 this shows that as the continental slope becomes flatter more energy is transmitted to the shelf and higher tsunami height is observed this in turn suggests that for steeper slopes more energy is reflected back to the deep ocean this aspect has been observed during the simulations which show higher tsunami height towards the deep ocean side of shelf in case of steeper continental slope it is also observed in fig 9 that for a lower continental shelf depth the amplification in tsunami height is higher which is mainly driven by the water depth the celerity and length of tsunami reduces in lower water depths whereas tsunami height is amplified thus continental shelf with higher water depth will encounter comparatively lower tsunami height in other words the offshore structures located on shallow continental shelf are prone to higher tsunami height the recorded values of tsunami run up rs at the shore are plotted with respect to slope in terms of normalised maximum run up ratio of tsunami run up at the shore rs and incident tsunami height h0 as shown in fig 10 a although tsunami height over the continental shelf has been obtained the resulting tsunami run up rs at the shore is more important to the coastal community the run up is defined as the maximum vertical elevation of tsunami above the mean sea level at the shore thus the rs values are recorded at probe location p3 and analysed for 50 m 75 m 100 m and 200 m continental shelf depths and the results are shown in fig 10 a it is observed that for a particular water depth on the shelf if the continental slope is steep higher amount of energy is being reflected back which results in smaller tsunami height on the shelf however as the tsunami propagates towards the shore its height is amplified due to shoaling while propagating on the near shore slope study with different shelf depths shows that the rs h0 value is less 4 5 m for shallower shelf depth 50 m and high 5 2 m for deeper shelf depth 200 m for steep continental slope as shown in fig 10 a but the variation of rs h0 is not same as hs h0 hs h0 is high 1 58 m for smaller shelf depth 50 m and less 1 5 m for higher shelf depth 200 m shown in fig 9 for steep continental slope these variations can be attributed to the change in momentum over different continental shelf depths and the corresponding effect of nearshore slope a deeper continental shelf depth leads to a steeper nearshore slope as observed in this study thus for a deeper continental shelf the momentum transmitted to the shelf is higher however at the same time the transmitted energy will have higher dissipation while tsunami rides over steep slope similarly for shallow continental shelf less energy is transmitted and less energy is dissipated on the nearshore slope it is observed that for flatter continental slope rs h0 value is following the same trend as hs h0 whereas it is less for deeper continental shelf depth the normalised runup heights are plotted against the slopes vertical to horizontal ratio varying from 1 5 to 1 75 and shown in fig 10 b the power fit for the curve shows that the run up scales with 0 16th power of the slope whereas the analytical solution by postacioglu et al 2017 shows a value of 0 25th power relation the variation in the present study could be due to the difference in the considered bottom profile and tsunami profiles 6 effect of nearshore slope on tsunami characteristics the earlier analysis was mainly focused on the effect of continental slope on tsunami however the run up at the shore will be a combined effect of continental slope and nearshore slope thus it is necessary to investigate the effect of nearshore slope on tsunami run up the slopes present in the actual nearshore region for all 18 cross sections shown in fig 6 are considered to get the range of nearshore slopes and are given in table 3 it was observed that the nearshore slopes available along the indian coast are varying from 1 132 to 1 985 table 3 for understanding the effect of nearshore slope on tsunami characteristics nearshore slopes varying from 1 132 to 1 1000 are considered in the study table 4 the slopes are considered in such a way that they are nearly equal distributed and are as close as possible to the actual slopes change in tsunami characteristics at the shore due to nearshore slopes are studied by keeping continental slope as constant here two critical continental slopes one with steep slope of 1 0 1 and another with flat slope of 1 75 are considered the tsunami is simulated along the channel for 50 m 75 m and 100 m deep continental shelves and tsunami heights at 3 locations are measured the normalised tsunami run up at the shore are plotted for different nearshore slopes and shelf depths for continental slope of 1 0 1 and shown in fig 11 it was observed from the simulations that the tsunami height on the continental shelf remain undisturbed up to the starting of near shore slope without any transformation the change in the tsunami characteristics again takes place once it starts riding on the nearshore slope the resulting change in tsunami can be seen from the measured tsunami run up at the shore as shown in fig 11 however it was apparent that for a steep continental slope the variation in the nearshore slope does not have much influence it was observed that as nearshore slope vary from steep to flat tsunami run up increases up to a slope of 1 632 and then decreases the difference in the maximum normalised run up 5 3 and minimum normalised run up 4 8 is 0 5 which is 10 4 change for continental shelf depth of 100 m this pattern is found to be similar for other continental shelf depths the value of rs h0 is found to be higher for deep continental shelf and lesser for shallow continental shelf depths in the earlier section the effect of nearshore slope on tsunami characteristics was studied for a steep continental slope of 1 0 1 to understand the tsunami behavior at the shore due to different nearshore slopes with a flatter continental slope similar study was carried out with a flatter continental slope of 1 75 tsunami is simulated along the channel for 50 m 75 m and 100 m deep continental shelves and tsunami run up at shore is measured the normalised value of tsunami run ups at shore are plotted for different nearshore slopes and shelf depths for continental slope of 1 75 and are shown in fig 12 it was noticed that as nearshore slope vary from steep to flat tsunami run up increases up to a slope of 1 457 and then decreases the difference in the maximum normalised run up 7 72 and minimum normalised run up 6 0 is 1 72 which is 28 7 change for continental shelf depth of 100 m fig 12 this percentage change is almost 3 times than that of the percentage change for step continental slope 1 0 1 similar results were observed for other continental shelf depths of 75 m and 50 m however the rs h0 is found to be higher for deep continental shelf and lesser for shallow continental shelf depths for flatter nearshore slopes only starting from 1 457 to 1 1000 for steeper nearshore slopes up to 1 284 the rs h0 values are similar and do not show any significant difference fig 12 7 resonance effect on run up on the coast ezersky et al 2013 have carried out a detailed investigation on the resonance phenomena at the long wave run up on the coast the study reported that resonance effects lead to the sufficient increase of run up heights for the weakest earthquakes which means for a higher earthquake magnitude the normalised run up height is expected to be lower simulations were carried out in line with the investigation of ezersky et al 2013 considering the same bottom profile and gaussian impulse generated due to earthquake magnitude of 8 and 8 5 as described by ezersky et al 2013 fig 13 shows the typical tsunami profile along the computational domain for earthquake magnitude of 8 it can be seen that the initial tsunami profile 12 6 m splits into two with almost half the height one of these propagate towards the coast incident tsunami of 6 3 m and hit the coast with a run up value of almost 40 m the run up heights were obtained at the shoreline and the normalised run up heights were found to be 6 35 and 5 67 for the magnitude of 8 and 8 5 respectively the normalised maximum run ups reported by ezersky et al 2013 were as approximately 6 6 and 5 2 for earthquake magnitude of 8 5 and 8 0 respectively this shows that the model also captures the resonance effect on the run up 8 conclusions in the present study a 1d numerical model was developed using shallow water equations to study the effect of continental and nearshore slopes on tsunami characteristics first the effects of continental slope on tsunami characteristics were studied and the variations were observed the transformed tsunami was allowed to propagate over various nearshore slopes and the resulting tsunami run ups were recorded the study suggests that tsunami height on the continental shelf increases for flatter continental slopes and shallow continental shelf depths this increase in tsunami height due to decrease in continental shelf depth is not significant for steeper continental slopes however for flatter continental slopes a decrease in continental shelf depth leads to a significant increase in tsunami height the percentage increase in tsunami height for decreasing continental shelf depth from 200 m to 50 m is found to be 31 overall it was observed that the run up scales with 0 16th power of the slope tsunami run up at the shore was analysed and presented in terms of normalised tsunami run up rs h0 it was noted that for deeper continental shelf the momentum transmitted to the shelf and energy dissipation on corresponding nearshore slope is high similarly for shallow continental shelf less energy is transmitted and less energy is dissipated on the nearshore slope the above process results in higher tsunami run up for deeper continental shelf and steeper continental slope whereas lower tsunami run up for deeper continental shelf and flatter continental slope the study on effect of nearshore slope on tsunami characteristics for particular continental slopes was carried out by varying nearshore slopes from steep 1 132 to flat 1 1000 over different continental shelf depths 50 m 75 m and 100 m it was observed that for a steep continental slope 1 0 1 a reduction in nearshore slope steep to flat increases tsunami run up up to a slope of 1 632 and then decreases similarly for a flat continental slope 1 75 a reduction in the nearshore slope increases tsunami run up up to a slope of 1 457 and then decreases the normalised tsunami run up at shore rs h0 is found to be higher for deep continental shelf and less for shallow continental shelf depths for both cases of continental slopes thus it can be concluded that the maximum tsunami run up depends on a combination of continental shelf profile and nearshore slope using the present interpretation a 2d model study may be carried out in future to investigate the effect of dispersion refraction and lateral energy transfers due to changing continental shelf geometry in tsunami propagation and transformation 
23249,in the present study an attempt is made to understand the effect of continental and nearshore slopes on the transmission propagation and run up of tsunami a numerical model study is carried out using shallow water equations that are solved using crank nicolson finite difference approximation method on a staggered grid a rectangular solitary wave is considered to propagate over typical continental slopes and nearshore profiles available along the indian coast the amplification or attenuation of tsunami characteristics over these cross sections was studied it was observed that the tsunami run up is altered with varying continental slope water depth on continental shelf and nearshore slope the study suggests that tsunami height on the continental shelf increases for shallow continental shelf depths the percentage increase in tsunami height with decrease in continental shelf depth from 200 m to 50 m is found to be 31 higher tsunami run up was observed for deeper continental shelf and steeper continental slope whereas lower tsunami run up for deeper continental shelf and flatter continental slope it was observed that for a steep continental slope 1 0 1 a reduction in nearshore slope steep to flat increases tsunami run up up to a slope of 1 632 and then decreases keywords tsunami shallow water equation crank nicolson method run up continental slope nearshore slope 1 introduction tsunamis earthquake generated waves are created in the deep portion of the ocean and propagate towards the shore tsunami a shallow water wave undergoes transformation as it propagates along the continental slope towards the coast this transformation is in the form of reduction in speed which leads to increase in wave height kowalik et al 2006 sriram et al 2006 after reaching the shore tsunami will break and travel over the land with huge energy which creates severe impact and disaster in the society sriram et al 2006 it is necessary to understand the effect of near shore bathymetry on tsunami characteristics and prediction of run up behera et al 2011 which will help in adopting appropriate measures to reduce the tsunami effect on society in the past various studies had been carried out to investigate the tsunami run up on different beach slopes and empirical formulae were suggested for computation of tsunami run up gjevik and pedersen 1983 developed a numerical model based on a lagrangian description for studying run up of long water waves on beach slopes varying from 0 to 45 synolakis 1987 studied the run up of solitary wave on plane beaches by conducting various laboratory experiments over different beach slopes varying from 2 to 45 the author observed that run up variation will behave differently for breaking and non breaking waves grilli et al 1997 had reported that waves will not break on beach with slope steeper than 1 4 7 they have also concluded that shoaling rate decreases for slopes steeper than 1 15 at the same time waves may break very close to the shore line for moderately steep slopes postacioglu et al 2017 have investigated the resonance aspect of coastal run up as a response to incident tsunami they have observed that the resonance is highly dependent on the discontinuity in depth at the toe of the slope in case of no discontinuity in depth the run up amplitude increases steadily with negligible resonance similarly long wave run up on a segmented beach slope was investigated by ezersky et al 2013 and reported that resonance effects lead to the sufficient increase of run up heights for the weakest earthquakes gedik et al 2005 observed that armor units used for beach protection cause 50 reduction in run up height if wave steepness h l is greater than 0 015 the run up decreases with increasing value of bed friction borthwick et al 2006 hsiao et al 2008 conducted laboratory experiments and developed a formula to compute maximum run up height for beach slopes varying from 1 15 to 1 60 madsen and fuhrman 2008 observed that the impact of run up on flat beaches with slope 1 100 is much higher than that on steep beaches with slope 1 15 the reflection coefficient decreases when run up height and wave steepness increase gedik et al 2011 lin et al 2014 had concluded that the maximum run up velocity increases gradually along the slope before the solitary wave reaches its breaking point zhao et al 2017 carried out numerical and experimental study to investigate the effect of submarine gentle slopes and coastal cliffs on the nearshore tsunami characteristics and concluded that critical cliff angle is 45 there were numerous experimental analytical and numerical model studies carried out on behavior of tsunami along the coast gjevik and pedersen 1983 grilli et al 1997 lin et al 2014 most of the studies were based on the analysis of solitary wave propagation over different beach profiles and the subsequent run up beach slopes are more flatter than continental slopes and expected to affect the tsunami characteristics differently the effect of continental slopes on tsunami characteristics and subsequent run up along the coast has not been investigated in the past studies the tsunami characteristics in the continental shelf region is of great importance as they are going to affect large number of offshore structures present in these regions thus a 1d numerical study is carried out to investigate the effect of continental and nearshore slopes on tsunami characteristics 2 numerical model although tsunami is generally simulated using 2d or 3d models for realistic modelling in the present study a 1d model is used to understand the effect of continental and nearshore slope profiles on the tsunami characteristics the 1d model study also helps in avoiding the effect of lateral energy transfers due continental shelf geometry thus using the 1d model study we intend to quantify the effect of continental slope and nearshore slope alone tsunami being a shallow water wave can be simulated using shallow water equations 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions in the present study a numerical model is developed using 1d shallow water equations swe and are given as 1 η t q x 0 2 q t u q x h ρ p a x g h η x τ b ρ h 3 τ b ρ k b h 2 q q where η is sea surface elevation h is total depth of water still water depth from mean sea level d sea surface elevation η u is average velocity of the water particle q is the flow discharge in the x direction uh g is acceleration due to gravity ρ is density of sea water τ b is bottom stress and k b is dimensionless bottom friction coefficient the value of friction coefficient k b varies from 1 0 10 3 to 3 0 10 3 dotsenko 1998 in this study k b 2 0 10 3 is considered as suggested by behera et al 2011 here pa is atmospheric pressure and the gradient equals to 0 then the modified momentum equation can be written as 4 q t u q x g h η x τ b ρ h the shoreline boundary is assumed as an abrupt end of the coast with finite water depth and no flow condition is applied open boundary is imposed with radiation condition given by flather 1976 the velocity of tsunami at the open boundary is given by 5 u g h η 2 2 solution of swe equations 1 and 4 can be solved by using crank nicolson finite difference method on a staggered grid fig 1 with first order difference in time and space the staggered grid arrangement is shown in fig 1 where the sea surface elevations η are defined by filled circles and discharges q are defined by empty circles the staggered grid requires either sea level or velocity as boundary condition input kowalik and murty 1993 the continuity and momentum equations in central difference form are given as 6 η n 1 η n 1 2 δ t q i 1 n q i 1 n 2 δ x 0 7 q n 1 q n 1 2 δ t u i q i 1 n q i 1 n 2 δ x q i

the nodes except at the boundary are obtained by solving the above equations 3 validation of the numerical model in general a numerical model is validated with standard numerical model or physical model results the 1d numerical model developed using the shallow water equations is validated with the results of kowalik et al 2006 who have studied the tide tsunami interaction for gulf of alaska region a numerical model domain same as of kowalik et al 2006 is considered for the study the model domain consists of 1000 km long channel with constant water depth up to 875 km from the open boundary 0 km and varying depth for a stretch of 125 km towards the shore fig 2 a the water depth in the domain is 3000 m from the open boundary to 875 km and then reduces from 3000 m to 5 m at the truncated shoreline boundary in the present model the shoreline boundary is assigned with finite water depth of 5 m for numerical stability unlike the wet dry boundary condition used in the study of kowalik et al 2006 simulation of tsunami was carried out by generating a perturbation with uniform bottom uplift of height 2 m and length 200 km located between 200 km and 400 km kowalik et al 2006 fig 2 b the model was initialized with zero elevation and zero velocity all through the domain except the tsunami perturbation given in fig 2 b the simulation was carried out and tsunami elevation profiles were recorded at 2min 16 67min 39min 57 6min 1hr 16min and 1hr 27min intervals the extracted tsunami profiles were compared with that of kowalik et al 2006 and are found to be in acceptable agreement however the comparison plot for t 1hr 27min fig 3 f show higher values for present numerical model results compared to kowalik s results this difference is expected as the shoreline boundary in the present study is imposed with no flow condition unlike the wet dry boundary condition used in the study of kowalik et al 2006 it was observed that the tsunami splits into two waves of 1 m height travelling in opposite direction t 16 67min the wave travelling towards the open boundary travels across and moves out of the domain whereas the wave travelling towards the shore propagates with constant amplitude t 39min and is considered as incident wave at 57 6min the tsunami strikes on the shore following which the reflection of tsunami from the shore is observed the tsunami attains maximum run up height when the complete wave hits the shore as seen in fig 3 f the tsunami elevation and velocity at open and shoreline boundary were obtained and compared with results obtained by kowalik et al 2006 figs 4 and 5 in fig 4 the elevations and velocities obtained from the present model are found to be in good agreement with the results of kowalik et al 2006 up to the arrival of initial tsunami whereas an over estimation is observed in the case of reflected wave recorded around 4 h of the simulation this difference is due to the reflection from the wall boundary condition imposed at the shoreline in the present model in comparison the wet dry boundary imposed in the kowalik et al 2006 model similarly fig 5 shows the elevation and velocities close to the shoreline a finite depth is considered at the shoreline in the present model for numerical stability and hence the negative elevation is recorded whereas the kowalik et al 2006 model shows zero elevation in case of drawdowns however the positive elevations are in good comparison that refers to the run up in the present study the velocity at the shoreline captures the initial run up and run down phenomena with some oscillations later on due to the truncated vertical wall at the shoreline as the focus of the study was to investigate the effect of continental and nearshore slopes on tsunami efforts were not made to incorporate the wet dry boundary condition in the present model that is more useful during inundation modelling 4 numerical model domain the model was used to investigate the effect of various continental slopes on tsunami propagation amplification and its profiles although the study has been undertaken for preliminary understanding the effect of typical continental slopes on tsunami run up the slopes present in the actual continental shelves along india are considered for the study the continental slopes are obtained from the gebco 30 arc seconds bathymetry data https www gebco net depth profiles of 18 salient cross sections along the indian coast are obtained fig 6 selected cross section tracks are mostly perpendicular to the continental shelf profile that represents the actual slope the continental slopes available along the indian coast are given in table 1 and typical continental shelf profiles for cross sections 4 and 6 are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively table 1 shows that the continental slopes available along the indian coast are varying from 1 63 7 to 1 7 there are steeper slopes also present at locations along the coast of andaman islands for the overall understanding the slopes varying from 1 75 to 1 0 1 are considered in this study given in table 2 the present study is carried out by considering a domain of 1200 km long channel having constant water depth of 3 km up to a distance of 875 km the bathymetry profile used for this study is shown in fig 8 an initial tsunami profile of height 2 m 2h0 and length 200 km spanning between 200 km and 400 km is considered in the study fig 8 tsunami elevations are recorded at three locations p1 p2 and p3 as shown in fig 8 the first location is placed in deep ocean 3 km depth at p1 800 km from the open boundary to record the incident tsunami profile the second is placed at p2 1100 km from the open boundary which is on the continental shelf to observe the transformations in the tsunami profile due to continental slope the third location is placed at shore p3 to observe the tsunami run up characteristics at the shore 5 effect of continental slope on tsunami characteristics the simulation was initiated by releasing the initial tsunami perturbation that splits into two waves and each wave propagates on opposite directions the wave that propagates towards the open radiation boundary moves out of the domain without any reflection the tsunami that propagates towards the shore incident tsunami undergoes various transformations in its wave height and wave length along the channel the transformation of the tsunami characteristics occurs mainly due to continental slope and nearshore slope the effect of slopes on the tsunami can be analysed by recording its profile at the three probe locations as specified in fig 8 the effect of continental slope is observed by the probe at location p2 with a specified continental shelf depth the continental shelf depth varies from coast to coast thus the simulations were carried out for four different continental shelf depths 50 m 75 m 100 m and 200 m the simulations were carried out for different continental slope and continental shelf depth combinations the tsunami height h0 is measured at probe p1 and is considered as incident tsunami height to ride over the continental slope the tsunami height hs is measured at probe location p2 after shoaling over the continental slope the recorded values of hs on the continental shelf depth are plotted with respect to continental slope in terms of normalised tsunami height ratio of tsunami height on the continental shelf hs and incident tsunami height h0 as shown in fig 9 the results show that tsunami height on continental shelf is lower for steeper slope in comparison to flatter slope it is observed that a nearly vertical face results in a normalised tsunami height hs h0 varying from 1 5 to 1 6 fig 9 whereas for a slope of 1 75 the normalised tsunami height hs h0 varies between 1 8 and 2 4 fig 9 this shows that as the continental slope becomes flatter more energy is transmitted to the shelf and higher tsunami height is observed this in turn suggests that for steeper slopes more energy is reflected back to the deep ocean this aspect has been observed during the simulations which show higher tsunami height towards the deep ocean side of shelf in case of steeper continental slope it is also observed in fig 9 that for a lower continental shelf depth the amplification in tsunami height is higher which is mainly driven by the water depth the celerity and length of tsunami reduces in lower water depths whereas tsunami height is amplified thus continental shelf with higher water depth will encounter comparatively lower tsunami height in other words the offshore structures located on shallow continental shelf are prone to higher tsunami height the recorded values of tsunami run up rs at the shore are plotted with respect to slope in terms of normalised maximum run up ratio of tsunami run up at the shore rs and incident tsunami height h0 as shown in fig 10 a although tsunami height over the continental shelf has been obtained the resulting tsunami run up rs at the shore is more important to the coastal community the run up is defined as the maximum vertical elevation of tsunami above the mean sea level at the shore thus the rs values are recorded at probe location p3 and analysed for 50 m 75 m 100 m and 200 m continental shelf depths and the results are shown in fig 10 a it is observed that for a particular water depth on the shelf if the continental slope is steep higher amount of energy is being reflected back which results in smaller tsunami height on the shelf however as the tsunami propagates towards the shore its height is amplified due to shoaling while propagating on the near shore slope study with different shelf depths shows that the rs h0 value is less 4 5 m for shallower shelf depth 50 m and high 5 2 m for deeper shelf depth 200 m for steep continental slope as shown in fig 10 a but the variation of rs h0 is not same as hs h0 hs h0 is high 1 58 m for smaller shelf depth 50 m and less 1 5 m for higher shelf depth 200 m shown in fig 9 for steep continental slope these variations can be attributed to the change in momentum over different continental shelf depths and the corresponding effect of nearshore slope a deeper continental shelf depth leads to a steeper nearshore slope as observed in this study thus for a deeper continental shelf the momentum transmitted to the shelf is higher however at the same time the transmitted energy will have higher dissipation while tsunami rides over steep slope similarly for shallow continental shelf less energy is transmitted and less energy is dissipated on the nearshore slope it is observed that for flatter continental slope rs h0 value is following the same trend as hs h0 whereas it is less for deeper continental shelf depth the normalised runup heights are plotted against the slopes vertical to horizontal ratio varying from 1 5 to 1 75 and shown in fig 10 b the power fit for the curve shows that the run up scales with 0 16th power of the slope whereas the analytical solution by postacioglu et al 2017 shows a value of 0 25th power relation the variation in the present study could be due to the difference in the considered bottom profile and tsunami profiles 6 effect of nearshore slope on tsunami characteristics the earlier analysis was mainly focused on the effect of continental slope on tsunami however the run up at the shore will be a combined effect of continental slope and nearshore slope thus it is necessary to investigate the effect of nearshore slope on tsunami run up the slopes present in the actual nearshore region for all 18 cross sections shown in fig 6 are considered to get the range of nearshore slopes and are given in table 3 it was observed that the nearshore slopes available along the indian coast are varying from 1 132 to 1 985 table 3 for understanding the effect of nearshore slope on tsunami characteristics nearshore slopes varying from 1 132 to 1 1000 are considered in the study table 4 the slopes are considered in such a way that they are nearly equal distributed and are as close as possible to the actual slopes change in tsunami characteristics at the shore due to nearshore slopes are studied by keeping continental slope as constant here two critical continental slopes one with steep slope of 1 0 1 and another with flat slope of 1 75 are considered the tsunami is simulated along the channel for 50 m 75 m and 100 m deep continental shelves and tsunami heights at 3 locations are measured the normalised tsunami run up at the shore are plotted for different nearshore slopes and shelf depths for continental slope of 1 0 1 and shown in fig 11 it was observed from the simulations that the tsunami height on the continental shelf remain undisturbed up to the

was observed that as nearshore slope vary from steep to flat tsunami run up increases up to a slope of 1 632 and then decreases the difference in the maximum normalised run up 5 3 and minimum normalised run up 4 8 is 0 5 which is 10 4 change for continental shelf depth of 100 m this pattern is found to be similar for other continental shelf depths the value of rs h0 is found to be higher for deep continental shelf and lesser for shallow continental shelf depths in the earlier section the effect of nearshore slope on tsunami characteristics was studied for a steep continental slope of 1 0 1 to understand the tsunami behavior at the shore due to different nearshore slopes with a flatter continental slope similar study was carried out with a flatter continental slope of 1 75 tsunami is simulated along the channel for 50 m 75 m and 100 m deep continental shelves and tsunami run up at shore is measured the normalised value of tsunami run ups at shore are plotted for different nearshore slopes and shelf depths for continental slope of 1 75 and are shown in fig 12 it was noticed that as nearshore slope vary from steep to flat tsunami run up increases up to a slope of 1 457 and then decreases the difference in the maximum normalised run up 7 72 and minimum normalised run up 6 0 is 1 72 which is 28 7 change for continental shelf depth of 100 m fig 12 this percentage change is almost 3 times than that of the percentage change for step continental slope 1 0 1 similar results were observed for other continental shelf depths of 75 m and 50 m however the rs h0 is found to be higher for deep continental shelf and lesser for shallow continental shelf depths for flatter nearshore slopes only starting from 1 457 to 1 1000 for steeper nearshore slopes up to 1 284 the rs h0 values are similar and do not show any significant difference fig 12 7 resonance effect on run up on the coast ezersky et al 2013 have carried out a detailed investigation on the resonance phenomena at the long wave run up on the coast the study reported that resonance effects lead to the sufficient increase of run up heights for the weakest earthquakes which means for a higher earthquake magnitude the normalised run up height is expected to be lower simulations were carried out in line with the investigation of ezersky et al 2013 considering the same bottom profile and

maximum run ups reported by ezersky et al 2013 were as approximately 6 6 and 5 2 for earthquake magnitude of 8 5 and 8 0 respectively this shows that the model also captures the resonance effect on the run up 8 conclusions in the present study a 1d numerical model was developed using shallow water equations to study the effect of continental and nearshore slopes on tsunami characteristics first

different continental shelf depths 50 m 75 m and 100 m it was observed that for a steep continental slope 1 0 1 a reduction in nearshore slope steep to flat increases tsunami run up up to a slope of 1 632 and then decreases similarly for a flat continental slope 1 75 a reduction in the nearshore slope increases tsunami run up up to a slope of 1 457 and then decreases the normalised tsunami run up at shore rs h0 is found to be higher for deep continental shelf and less for shallow continental shelf depths for both cases of continental slopes thus it can be concluded that the maximum tsunami run up depends on a combination of continental shelf profile and nearshore slope using the present interpretation a 2d model study may be carried out in future to investigate the effect of dispersion refraction and lateral energy transfers due to changing continental shelf geometry in tsunami propagation and transformation
