anode ca flow pattern compared with that for anode to cathode ac the modelling results showed the ca flow pattern to be more favourable for bta oxidation mediated by electro generated oh by preventing

through pattern graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electroactive ceramic membrane benzotriazole flow pattern 1 introduction benzotriazole bta is a typical corrosion inhibitor with an estimated worldwide production in excess of 9000 tons per year felis et al 2016 the excellent corrosion resistance of bta originates from the nitrogen atom in the upper n h group of the bta triazole ring containing unshared pair electrons and the π bond formed on the benzene ring can combine with sp orbit of metal atom to form covalent bonds mamaş et al 2005 this results in the formation of adsorbed polymeric film with multiple chains protecting target metal materials from corrosion gelman et al 2014 as such bta has been extensively used in a wide range of corrosion prone processes such as water conveyance underground mining and seawater industries avagyan et al 2015 wieduwilt et al 2020 this inevitably produces a large amount of wastewater containing residual bta at concentration ranging from several micrograms to tens of milligrams per liter liu et al 2017 molins delgado et al 2017 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2016 bta has been characterized to be of endurance bioaccumulation and toxicity wang et al 2013 leading to high risk of endocrine disruption and sexual differentiation of organisms speltini et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis and fenton have been tested for removing bta but are limited by low efficiency 80 narrow range of operational ph and secondary pollution de la cruz et al 2013 lee et al 2019 xu et al 2013 in general bta wastewater has a relatively high electrical conductivity and thus electrochemical oxidation may be a suitable option li et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 where recalcitrant organic pollutants can be removed under the synergistic action of anodic oxidation via direct electron transfer and indirect oxidation mediated by electro generated oh pei et al 2020 inactive electrode such as pbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd is shown capable of removing various kind of persistent and recalcitrant organic contaminants ansari and nematollahi 2018 thiam et al 2018 zhu et al 2009 however overall removal efficiency remains low indicated by only 68 removal for 5 h electrolysis by bdd film electrode for several reasons xing et al 2012 first mechanisms for electrochemical removal of bta remain fundamentally ambiguous for example we will show that the bta removal is highly ph sensitive but it is unlikely to control ph in conventional flow by electrolytic cell unless active adjustment is implemented second bta removal is limited significantly by electrostatic repulsion between the anode and protonated bta ph 3 near anode and the formation of bta film on the electrode surface third mass transfer may be a concern due to insufficient contact between low concentration bta and short lived electro produced oh to the proximity of electrode recently porous anodes made of electrified membrane have drawn increasing interest because they can conduct electrolysis in the flow through mode with convection enhanced mass transfer compared with mechanical agitation and flow by operation ganiyu et al 2016 hua et al 2020 liang et al 2018 introducing electroactivity to membrane offers new opportunities to develop a variety of electro filtration processes for water purification sun et al 2021 carbon based materials e g carbon paper carbon felt and carbon nanotubes have been widely adopted to fabricate electrified membrane li et al 2021 one major shortage of these carbon membrane electrodes is electrochemical instability and low oxygen evolution potential making it less affordable at high current density or high electrode potential this will restrict their application in removing recalcitrant organic contaminants under practically relevant conditions titanium suboxides tiso are preferred in favor of higher oxygen evolution potential conductivity approaching that of metal and excellent corrosion resistance being close to ceramics geng and chen 2016 zaky and chaplin 2013 the effectiveness of tiso anode has been illustrated by its capability to removal a variety of organic pollutions such as chlorophenols xie et al 2021 pesticides merenda et al 2019 perfluorinated compounds shi et al 2019 antibiotics ganiyu et al 2016 landfill leachate lin et al 2021 and pharmaceuticals and personal care products teng et al 2020 specifically the convection induced by flow through operation can alter hydraulic condition of acidic and basic boundary layers near the anode and cathode thereby the profile of local ph is modified we will show that such modification would be beneficial for ph sensitive electrochemical removal of bta and to the best of our knowledge there is no relevant study up to present the objective of this study is to develop a flow through electrochemical oxidation system based on tiso electroactive ceramic membrane ecm to removal bta in water first we

qsar methodologies 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the tiso ecm the crystal structure of tiso ecm was characterized using xrd spectra fig 1 a showing the characteristic peaks of ti4o7

fig 1b shows developed porous structure with an average size ranging between 1 2 μm for the as prepared tiso ecm the inter connected particles created the porous channels available for mass transfer when the fluid passed through the inner space of electrode the mercury intrusion porosimetry analysis confirmed the distribution of macro scaled porous structure of tiso ecm with overall porosity of 33 29 total specific pore area of 0 332 m2 g 1 and average pore size of 1 04 μm fig 1c and 1d the highly interconnected macroporous structure of tiso ecm made it possible to perform flow through electrolysis which was favorable for electrochemical water treatment 3 2 electrochemical removal of bta in tiso ecm system the performances of tiso ecm for bta removal were investigated as a function of flow pattern current density and permeate flux fig 2 depicts a significant increase of bta removal with increase in current density and permeate flux for the two flow patterns ac or ca mode similar results were also reported that electrochemical oxidation efficiency was enhanced at higher permeate flux and higher applied current densities ganzenko et al 2021 mameda et al 2017 the current density constitutes one of the most important parameters for electrochemical reactions and bta degradation fig 2a illustrates the positive correlation between bta removal and current density 5 30 ma cm 2 under ca and ac mode following 60 min electrolysis under recirculation at permeate flux of 462 lmh bta removal efficiency was increased from 8 1 to 94 5 for ca mode and from 4 1 to 55 for ac mode respectively when current density was increased from 5 ma cm 2 to 30 ma cm 2 the corresponding reaction rate constant for ca mode 0 007 0 097 min 1 was approximately 2 3 7 0 times of that for ac mode 0 001 0 042 min 1 this was also in line with observation of increase by one order of magnitude in cod removal rate from 0 14 to 1 59 g m 2 h 1 for ca mode and from 0 06 to 0 76 g m 2 h 1 for ac mode fig s2 respectively despite improved bta removal for higher current density more energy was consumed due to undesired side reactions for example with increased current density the volumetric energy consumption was firstly decreased reaching the minimum of 4 25 kw h m 3 at 15 20 ma cm 2 followed by going up back to 7 12 kw h m 3 when current density was further elevated to 30 ma cm 2 in ca mode fig 2c these values were comparable with that of the state of the art electrochemical oxidation processes with energy consumption in the range of 1 10 kw h m 3 radjenovic et al 2020 and several other manners for bta degradation table s1 the side reactions of anodic oxygen evolution eq 9 and cathodic hydrogen evolution eq 10 should be responsible for relatively high energy consumption being in line with ce not exceeding 37 these values appeared to be consistent with previous electro oxidation systems zaky and chaplin 2013 especially for those operated under high current density conditions notably the reaction rate constant exhibited insignificant change when the current density was above 20 ma cm 2 for ca mode indicating mass transfer limitation at higher current density wang et al 2018 9 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 10 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h flow through electrolysis allowed enhancement of mass transfer by horizontal convection and thus the correlation was established between bta oxidation rate and permeate flux 5 692 lmh following 60 min electrolysis at current density of 20 ma cm 2 bta removal efficiency of 98 1 was obtained at the permeate flux of 692 lmh for ca mode fig 2b enhanced mass transfer was believed to play an important role because increasing permeate flux from 5 lmh to 692 lmh resulted in five fold increase in oxidation rate constant from 0 026 to 0 124 min 1 this appeared to be in agreement with observation of increase by nearly one order of magnitude in mass transfer coefficient estimated by limiting current technique text s1 table s2 since the limiting current density was positively related to mass transfer coefficient the current efficiency was thus increased by 9 9 38 1 with respect to permeate flux fig 2d in comparison bta removal rate in ac mode appeared to be insensitive to permeate flux indicated by less than two fold increase in oxidation rate constant this suggested dominance of mass transfer to oh mediated oxidation of bta when the wastewater stream was flowing from the cathode to the anode 3 3 mechanistic insight into bta degradation it has been reported that the anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction can be linked by the hydraulic connection of the flow stream in a flow through electrochemical process liu et al 2019 to decouple the role played by two electrodes the anode and cathode was separated by proton exchange membrane fig s3a as a result bta removal efficiency as low as 0 5 was observed for individual cathodic reduction whereas anodic oxidation contributed 45 1 removal fig s3b anodic oxidation is generally relevant to direct electron transfer det and indirect attack by oh generated from water electrolysis peng et al 2020 to probe det reaction lsv measurements were performed under both ca and ac mode in the presence of bta as shown in fig 3 a the current peak was not observed upon bta addition whereas a remarkable decrease in current occurred under ac mode we attributed the anodic water oxidation to predominate in bta solution at positive potential and the bta tended to be adsorbed on the anode jing and chaplin 2017 this indicated that det of bta was unlikely to occur as the det rate was much slower than that of water oxidation donaghue and chaplin 2013 as illustrated in table s3 and fig 3b it is evident that the observed rate constant kobs was increased with the anodic potential for ac mode which was seen similar as that of ca mode at potential of 1 6 v vs she slight bta degradation was observed within a time of 60 min via combined adsorption electrosorption and det under ca mode however n heterocyclic in bta molecule presented an inhibition against heterogeneous electron transfer at the anode surface di giulio et al 2007 indicating the det to be the rate limiting step at potential lower than that of oh formation 2 2 v vs she for tiso ecm zaky and chaplin 2013 with elevated potential the reaction rate constant was firstly increased reaching the maximum of 0 094 min 1 at 2 8 v vs she followed by slight increase to 0 105 min 1 when the potential was further elevated to 3 2 v vs she the oxidation potential of bta 2 15 v vs she derived from fig 3b was seen close to that of oh formation which indicated that the bta removal was more likely to take place via oh mediated oxidation reactive oxygen species ros like oh so4 and h2o2 may be generated on the anode surface when na2so4 is employed as electrolyte eqs s3 s7 next the influent was bubbled by n2 gas to eliminate the impact of h2o2 generated from cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen eq s5 as a consequence h2o2 was not detected for both ac and ca modes possibly due to low catalytic activity of ss cathode for h2o2 formation based on kinetic selection theory proposed in our previous study pei et al 2020 electro generated oh could be identified upon a qualitative basis using esr technique fig 3c the role of oh in bta degradation was further probed by radical scavengers aa and tba where the π orbitals and allylic carbon in aa molecule make it more reactive for oh on the positively charged anode surface ohads and tba is more affinitive for free radical ohfree barazesh et al 2016 fig 3d shows 78 9 inhibition by aa and 17 6 inhibition by tba indicating higher contribution of surface bound ohads than that of ohfree to bta degradation on tiso ecm 3 4 impact of flow pattern during anodic oxidation strong interaction between tiso ecm and water molecules is essential for producing oh however addition of bta led to nearly 50 inhibition on the response of current for ac mode fig 3a similar results were also reported by grekulović et al 2012 who found the formation of adsorbed polymeric film on agcu50 electrode in the presence of bta according to the metal bta redox potential in aqueous system gelman et al 2014 the solution chemistry has a considerable impact to the state of bta film and the bta film can exist stable over a wide range of ph from 2 to 10 based on this fact we next performed electrochemical characterization of tiso ecm in the presence of bta at different ph values in ca and ac mode fig 4 a and 4b reveals a slight variation of corrosion current caused by addition of bta under alkaline condition ph 11 in comparison with remarkable decline in response of current under acidic condition ph 3 the results of tafel plots were also confirmed by eis data fig 4c and 4d showing a marginal difference in charge transfer resistance 8 0 caused by bta under alkaline condition on the contrary the charge resistance in the presence of bta anti corrosion layer was 36 2 greater than that in the absence under acidic condition these results suggested that acidic condition was more favorable for the formation of bta anti corrosion layer thereafter the impact of ph on bta degradation was examined in ca and ac mode at the current density of 20 ma cm 2 fig 5 a in ca mode higher than 90 removal of bta was achieved over a wide ph range of 3 11 compared with marked change from 42 ph 3 to 74 ph 11 in ac mode bta oxidation rate obtained for ac mode appeared to be more sensitive to solution ph indicated by 2 3 fold increase 0 027 0 064 min 1 compared with 1 1 fold increase for ca mode 0 084 0 094 min 1 in aqueous solution owing to the presence of n h group bta has pka1 2 3 and pka2 8 6 and thus the fraction of protonated bta rnh2 molecular bta rnh and deprotonated bta rn is dependent on solution ph according to the henderson hassel bach equation as 11 ph p k a 1 log 10 c rnh c rnh 2 12 ph p k a 2 log 10 c r n c rnh as illustrated in fig s4 when solution ph was below 2 3 the rnh2 was dominant for ph higher than 8 6 bta was transformed from neutral state to anionic state being rich in electrons thus accumulation of h produced from anodic water oxidation in ac mode triggered the electrostatic repulsion between rnh2 and positively charged anode within electric double layer and vice versa oh generation by cathodic reduction also resulted in the electrostatic repulsion between rn and negatively charged cathodic double layer under ca mode ph 11 5 was observed on the tiso ecm surface fig 5b which created a local environment in the double layer being favorable for electrostatic attraction between rn and anode for electrolysis under flow through mode h and oh were produced via anodic oxidation of water and h2 cathodic hydrogen evolution and cathodic reduction of water and o2 anodic oxygen evolution respectively as 13 h 2 2 h 2 e 14 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 4 h 4 e 15 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h 16 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h based on in situ sampling method the local ph on tiso ecm surface in ca mode ca a and ac mode ac a were measured under permeate flux of 462 lmh and current density of 5 30 ma cm 2 as shown in fig 5b after treatment with the cathode in ca mode or the anode in ac mode the ph of the collected solution on tiso ecm surface exhibited strong alkaline ph of 8 12 5 or acidic values ph of 2 5 4 in agreement with recent results about generation of h on anode and oh on cathode scialdone et al 2009 lei et al 2017 while the bulk solution ph for two modes was close to that of influent ph 6 75 which indicated that the produced oh or h from upstream cathode or anode were neutralized or consumed by downstream anode or cathode in the two modes according to eqs 17 19 as 17 h o h h 2 o 18 2 h 2 e h 2 19 o h oh e in addition to experimentally characterizing ph of electrode surface and bulk electrolyte theoretical simulation was also performed fig 6 a shows ph polarization by production of h and oh on the region of anode and cathode surface under static electrolysis with the development of boundary layer for ac mode a significant difference was noticed between local and bulk ph and the h in the anodic region was gradually distributed over the bulk flow region that extended to the cathodic surface fig 6b on the contrary the acidic boundary layer near the anode surface almost disappeared for ca mode fig 6c despite higher mobility of h than oh more h tended to be confined in the double layer of porous tiso anode rather than transfer to the cathode this can be partially illustrated by our previous studies liu et al 2019 where proton concentration in the porous structure was nearly four order magnitude higher than that in bulk solution in comparison double layer capacitance of non porous ss cathode was much smaller than that of porous anode which facilitated oh to transfer over the whole flow region therefore we attributed electrochemical degradation of bta to be flow pattern and ph relevant for ca flow pattern the ph neutral influent turned to be alkaline along with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction this led bulk solution ph to be raised from initial 6 75 to 13 2 fig 5b in this case strong electrostatic repulsion existed between the cathodic double layer and rn resulting in 0 5 bta removal under oh concentrated condition fig s3b when solution flowed from the cathode to the anode oh was transported by convection creating an alkaline boundary layer at the anode electrolyte interface ph 11 8 fig 5b this would alleviate the formation of anti corrosion bta film on the anode according to tafel and eis plots shown in fig 4 as such bta in the form of rn could be removed efficiently 94 1 on the tiso ecm anode for ac flow pattern water oxidation took place to produce h thereby acidic boundary layer ph of 2 1 was developed at the anode electrolyte interface which readily led to the formation of deactivated bta film and thus decrease in oh yield by preventing active sites additionally h confined within the porous anode strengthened electrostatic repulsion of rnh2 and the anode resulting in bta removal as low as 48 2 a value far lower than that for ca flow pattern 3 5 bta removal pathways and toxicity of intermediates to underline the pathway for electrochemical removal of bta under ca mode uplc qtof ms was used to identify the intermediates table s4 and meanwhile the fukui indices based on dft calculations was also employed to reflect the active sites of species the sites with the largest f 0 value were the preferred site for bta molecules when they are subjected to radical attack yao et al 2020 as shown in table s5 and fig s5 higher f 0 values for c2 c5 and n8 sites indicated the active sites to be attacked by oh this was seen to be consistent with the formation of r1 m z 135 0433 r2 m z 151 0382 and r3 m z 121 064 detected by uplc qtof ms measurement thus the most likely pathways for bta degradation were proposed in fig 7 pathway i involved a series of hydroxylation addition and cleavage of the phenyl structure mediated by electro generated oh in brief bta degradation was initiated from oh attack at c2 position f 0 0 117 with high electron density followed by the formation of unstable multi hydroxyl structure such as r1 and r2 yao et al 2020 subsequently ring opening reactions occurred to form intermediates with aldehyde and carboxyl groups r6 m z 167 0331 r7 m z 157 0124 until eventual mineralization pathway ii involved the cleavage of triazole ring structure to form r5 m z 93 0578 and r8 m z 94 0419 resulting from the substitution of hydroxyl group at n8 site f 0 0 105 zhang et al 2020 the tiso ecm could achieved 94 1 bta removal under ca mode but only 47 5 toc removal was obtained hence we performed evaluation on toxicity of degradation intermediates as shown in fig 8 a the oral rat ld50 value of bta was 435 36 mg kg 1 a value reflecting high toxicity of bta following electrochemical degradation an increased ld50 values were obtained for majority of degradation intermediates indicating decline in acute toxicity expect for initially unstable oh added intermediates r1 r2 and r4 that would be subject to further transformation in addition bioaccumulation factor was greatly decreased from initial 8 27 for bta to 0 04 4 33 for the intermediates r1 r8 fig 8b indicating the products were much less toxic than the parent compound 3 6 stability and scalability to evaluate the stability of tiso ecm system we performed the test for 20 cycles of bta degradation as a result the bta removal could be sustained for a long period of operation during successive 20 cycle test indicated by performance decline less than 10 fig s6 this suggested a relatively high stability of tiso ecm for degradation of bta pollutant our recently published work also demonstrated that the electrochemical reactor could be scale up easily and viably by numbering up the tiso ecm modules without increasing the ohmic resistance and decreasing the specific area of electrodes pei et al 2022 these results demonstrated that the tiso ecm were competitive for decentralized treatment of industrial bta wastewater 4 conclusions based on the above results the main conclusion could be drawn as follows bta anti corrosive agent could be electrochemically removed by tiso ecm with overall efficiency of 98 1 under cathode to anode ca flow pattern flow pattern had an essential impact of bta degradation depending on ph dependent formation of anti corrosive bta film on the tiso anode ca flow pattern was more favorable for bta oxidation mediated by electro generated oh by preventing the formation of deactivation film via creating an alkaline boundary layer at the anode electrolyte interface the most likely pathway for electrochemical degradation of bta was underlined by using experimental analysis and theoretical dft calculations both oral rat ld50 values and bioaccumulation factor were decreased remarkably during electrochemical

adsorbed polymeric film with multiple chains protecting target metal materials from corrosion gelman et al 2014 as such bta has been extensively used in a wide range of corrosion prone processes such as water conveyance underground mining and seawater industries avagyan et al 2015 wieduwilt et al 2020 this inevitably produces a large amount of wastewater containing residual bta at concentration ranging from several micrograms to tens of milligrams per liter liu et al 2017 molins delgado et al 2017 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2016 bta has been characterized to be of endurance bioaccumulation and toxicity wang et al 2013 leading to high risk of endocrine disruption and sexual differentiation of organisms speltini et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis and fenton have been tested for removing bta but are limited by low efficiency 80 narrow range of operational ph and secondary pollution de la cruz et al 2013 lee et al 2019 xu et al 2013 in general bta wastewater has a relatively high electrical conductivity and thus electrochemical oxidation may be a suitable option li et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 where recalcitrant organic pollutants can be removed under the synergistic action of anodic oxidation via direct electron transfer and indirect oxidation mediated by electro generated oh pei et al 2020 inactive electrode such as pbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd is shown capable of removing various kind of persistent and recalcitrant organic contaminants ansari and nematollahi 2018 thiam et al 2018 zhu et al 2009 however overall removal efficiency remains low indicated by only 68 removal for 5 h electrolysis by bdd film electrode for several reasons xing et al 2012 first mechanisms for electrochemical removal of bta remain fundamentally ambiguous for example we will show that the bta removal is highly ph sensitive but it is unlikely to control ph in conventional flow by electrolytic cell unless active adjustment is implemented second bta removal is limited significantly by electrostatic repulsion between the anode and protonated bta ph 3 near anode and the formation of bta film on the electrode surface third mass transfer may be a concern due to insufficient contact between low concentration bta and short lived electro produced oh to the proximity of electrode recently porous anodes made of electrified membrane have drawn increasing interest because they can conduct electrolysis in the flow through mode with convection enhanced mass transfer compared with mechanical agitation and flow by operation ganiyu et al 2016 hua et al 2020 liang et al 2018 introducing electroactivity to membrane offers new opportunities to develop a variety of electro filtration processes for water purification sun et al 2021 carbon based materials e g carbon paper carbon felt and carbon nanotubes have been widely adopted to fabricate electrified membrane li et al 2021 one major shortage of these carbon membrane electrodes is electrochemical instability and low oxygen evolution potential making it less affordable at high current density or high electrode potential this will restrict their application in removing recalcitrant organic contaminants under practically relevant conditions titanium suboxides tiso are preferred in favor of higher oxygen evolution potential conductivity approaching that of metal and excellent corrosion resistance being close to ceramics geng and chen 2016 zaky and chaplin 2013 the effectiveness of tiso anode has been illustrated by its capability to removal a variety of organic pollutions such as chlorophenols xie et al 2021 pesticides merenda et al 2019 perfluorinated compounds shi et al 2019 antibiotics ganiyu et al 2016 landfill leachate lin et al 2021 and pharmaceuticals and personal care products teng et al 2020 specifically the convection induced by flow through operation can alter hydraulic condition of acidic and basic boundary layers near the anode and cathode thereby the profile of local ph is modified we will show that such modification would be beneficial for ph sensitive electrochemical removal of bta and to the best of our knowledge there is no relevant study up to present the objective of this study is to develop a flow through electrochemical oxidation system based on tiso electroactive ceramic membrane ecm to removal bta in water first we

qsar methodologies 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the tiso ecm the crystal structure of tiso ecm was characterized using xrd spectra fig 1 a showing the characteristic peaks of ti4o7

fig 1b shows developed porous structure with an average size ranging between 1 2 μm for the as prepared tiso ecm the inter connected particles created the porous channels available for mass transfer when the fluid passed through the inner space of electrode the mercury intrusion porosimetry analysis confirmed the distribution of macro scaled porous structure of tiso ecm with overall porosity of 33 29 total specific pore area of 0 332 m2 g 1 and average pore size of 1 04 μm fig 1c and 1d the highly interconnected macroporous structure of tiso ecm made it possible to perform flow through electrolysis which was favorable for electrochemical water treatment 3 2 electrochemical removal of bta in tiso ecm system the performances of tiso ecm for bta removal were investigated as a function of flow pattern current density and permeate flux fig 2 depicts a significant increase of bta removal with increase in current density and permeate flux for the two flow patterns ac or ca mode similar results were also reported that electrochemical oxidation efficiency was enhanced at higher permeate flux and higher applied current densities ganzenko et al 2021 mameda et al 2017 the current density constitutes one of the most important parameters for electrochemical reactions and bta degradation fig 2a illustrates the positive correlation between bta removal and current density 5 30 ma cm 2 under ca and ac mode following 60 min electrolysis under recirculation at permeate flux of 462 lmh bta removal efficiency was increased from 8 1 to 94 5 for ca mode and from 4 1 to 55 for ac mode respectively when current density was increased from 5 ma cm 2 to 30 ma cm 2 the corresponding reaction rate constant for ca mode 0 007 0 097 min 1 was approximately 2 3 7 0 times of that for ac mode 0 001 0 042 min 1 this was also in line with observation of increase by one order of magnitude in cod removal rate from 0 14 to 1 59 g m 2 h 1 for ca mode and from 0 06 to 0 76 g m 2 h 1 for ac mode fig s2 respectively despite improved bta removal for higher current density more energy was consumed due to undesired side reactions for example with increased current density the volumetric energy consumption was firstly decreased reaching the minimum of 4 25 kw h m 3 at 15 20 ma cm 2 followed by going up back to 7 12 kw h m 3 when current density was further elevated to 30 ma cm 2 in ca mode fig 2c these values were comparable with that of the state of the art electrochemical oxidation processes with energy consumption in the range of 1 10 kw h m 3 radjenovic et al 2020 and several other manners for bta degradation table s1 the side reactions of anodic oxygen evolution eq 9 and cathodic hydrogen evolution eq 10 should be responsible for relatively high energy consumption being in line with ce not exceeding 37 these values appeared to be consistent with previous electro oxidation systems zaky and chaplin 2013 especially for those operated under high current density conditions notably the reaction rate constant exhibited insignificant change when the current density was above 20 ma cm 2 for ca mode indicating mass transfer limitation at higher current density wang et al 2018 9 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 10 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h flow through electrolysis allowed enhancement of mass transfer by horizontal convection and thus the correlation was established between bta oxidation rate and permeate flux 5 692 lmh following 60 min electrolysis at current density of 20 ma cm 2 bta removal efficiency of 98 1 was obtained at the permeate flux of 692 lmh for ca mode fig 2b enhanced mass transfer was believed to play an important role because increasing permeate flux from 5 lmh to 692 lmh resulted in five fold increase in oxidation rate constant from 0 026 to 0 124 min 1 this appeared to be in agreement with observation of increase by nearly one order of magnitude in mass transfer coefficient estimated by limiting current technique text s1 table s2 since the limiting current density was positively related to mass transfer coefficient the current efficiency was thus increased by 9 9 38 1 with respect to permeate flux fig 2d in comparison bta removal rate in ac mode appeared to be insensitive to permeate flux indicated by less than two fold increase in oxidation rate constant this suggested dominance of mass transfer to oh mediated oxidation of bta when the wastewater stream was flowing from the cathode to the anode 3 3 mechanistic insight into bta degradation it has been reported that the anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction can be linked by the hydraulic connection of the flow stream in a flow through electrochemical process liu et al 2019 to decouple the role played by two electrodes the anode and cathode was separated by proton exchange membrane fig s3a as a result bta removal efficiency as low as 0 5 was observed for individual cathodic reduction whereas anodic oxidation contributed 45 1 removal fig s3b anodic oxidation is generally relevant to direct electron transfer det and indirect attack by oh generated from water electrolysis peng et al 2020 to probe det reaction lsv measurements were performed under both ca and ac mode in the presence of bta as shown in fig 3 a the current peak was not observed upon bta addition whereas a remarkable decrease in current occurred under ac mode we attributed the anodic water oxidation to predominate in bta solution at positive potential and the bta tended to be adsorbed on the anode jing and chaplin 2017 this indicated that det of bta was unlikely to occur as the det rate was much slower than that of water oxidation donaghue and chaplin 2013 as illustrated in table s3 and fig 3b it is evident that the observed rate constant kobs was increased with the anodic potential for ac mode which was seen similar as that of ca mode at potential of 1 6 v vs she slight bta degradation was observed within a time of 60 min via combined adsorption electrosorption and det under ca mode however n heterocyclic in bta molecule presented an inhibition against heterogeneous electron transfer at the anode surface di giulio et al 2007 indicating the det to be the rate limiting step at potential lower than that of oh formation 2 2 v vs she for tiso ecm zaky and chaplin 2013 with elevated potential the reaction rate constant was firstly increased reaching the maximum of 0 094 min 1 at 2 8 v vs she followed by slight increase to 0 105 min 1 when the potential was further elevated to 3 2 v vs she the oxidation potential of bta 2 15 v vs she derived from fig 3b was seen close to that of oh formation which indicated that the bta removal was more likely to take place via oh mediated oxidation reactive oxygen species ros like oh so4 and h2o2 may be generated on the anode surface when na2so4 is employed as electrolyte eqs s3 s7 next the influent was bubbled by n2 gas to eliminate the impact of h2o2 generated from cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen eq s5 as a consequence h2o2 was not detected for both ac and ca modes possibly due to low catalytic activity of ss cathode for h2o2 formation based on kinetic selection theory proposed in our previous study pei et al 2020 electro generated oh could be identified upon a qualitative basis using esr technique fig 3c the role of oh in bta degradation was further probed by radical scavengers aa and tba where the π orbitals and allylic carbon in aa molecule make it more reactive for oh on the positively charged anode surface ohads and tba is more affinitive for free radical ohfree barazesh et al 2016 fig 3d shows 78 9 inhibition by aa and 17 6 inhibition by tba indicating higher contribution of surface bound ohads than that of ohfree to bta degradation on tiso ecm 3 4 impact of flow pattern during anodic oxidation strong interaction between tiso ecm and water molecules is essential for producing oh however addition of bta led to nearly 50 inhibition on the response of current for ac mode fig 3a similar results were also reported by grekulović et al 2012 who found the formation of adsorbed polymeric film on agcu50 electrode in the presence of bta according to the metal bta redox potential in aqueous system gelman et al 2014 the solution chemistry has a considerable impact to the state of bta film and the bta film can exist stable over a wide range of ph from 2 to 10 based on this fact we next performed electrochemical characterization of tiso ecm in the presence of bta at different ph values in ca and ac mode fig 4 a and 4b reveals a slight variation of corrosion current caused by addition of bta under alkaline condition ph 11 in comparison with remarkable decline in response of current under acidic condition ph 3 the results of tafel plots were also confirmed by eis data fig 4c and 4d showing a marginal difference in charge transfer resistance 8 0 caused by bta under alkaline condition on the contrary the charge resistance in the presence of bta anti corrosion layer was 36 2 greater than that in the absence under acidic condition these results suggested that acidic condition was more favorable for the formation of bta anti corrosion layer thereafter the impact of ph on bta degradation was examined in ca and ac mode at the current density of 20 ma cm 2 fig 5 a in ca mode higher than 90 removal of bta was achieved over a wide ph range of 3 11 compared with marked change from 42 ph 3 to 74 ph 11 in ac mode bta oxidation rate obtained for ac mode appeared to be more sensitive to solution ph indicated by 2 3 fold increase 0 027 0 064 min 1 compared with 1 1 fold increase for ca mode 0 084 0 094 min 1 in aqueous solution owing to the presence of n h group bta has pka1 2 3 and pka2 8 6 and thus the fraction of protonated bta rnh2 molecular bta rnh and deprotonated bta rn is dependent on solution ph according to the henderson hassel bach equation as 11 ph p k a 1 log 10 c rnh c rnh 2 12 ph p k a 2 log 10 c r n c rnh as illustrated in fig s4 when solution ph was below 2 3 the rnh2 was dominant for ph higher than 8 6 bta was transformed from neutral state to anionic state being rich in electrons thus accumulation of h produced from anodic water oxidation in ac mode triggered the electrostatic repulsion between rnh2 and positively charged anode within electric double layer and vice versa oh generation by cathodic reduction also resulted in the electrostatic repulsion between rn and negatively charged cathodic double layer under ca mode ph 11 5 was observed on the tiso ecm surface fig 5b which created a local environment in the double layer being favorable for electrostatic attraction between rn and anode for electrolysis under flow through mode h and oh were produced via anodic oxidation of water and h2 cathodic hydrogen evolution and cathodic reduction of water and o2 anodic oxygen evolution respectively as 13 h 2 2 h 2 e 14 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 4 h 4 e 15 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h 16 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h based on in situ sampling method the local ph on tiso ecm surface in ca mode ca a and ac mode ac a were measured under permeate flux of 462 lmh and current density of 5 30 ma cm 2 as shown in fig 5b after treatment with the cathode in ca mode or the anode in ac mode the ph of the collected solution on tiso ecm surface exhibited strong alkaline ph of 8 12 5 or acidic values ph of 2 5 4 in agreement with recent results about generation of h on anode and oh on cathode scialdone et al 2009 lei et al 2017 while the bulk solution ph for two modes was close to that of influent ph 6 75 which indicated that the produced oh or h from upstream cathode or anode were neutralized or consumed by downstream anode or cathode in the two modes according to eqs 17 19 as 17 h o h h 2 o 18 2 h 2 e h 2 19 o h oh e in addition to experimentally characterizing ph of electrode surface and bulk electrolyte theoretical simulation was also performed fig 6 a shows ph polarization by production of h and oh on the region of anode and cathode surface under static electrolysis with the development of boundary layer for ac mode a significant difference was noticed between local and bulk ph and the h in the anodic region was gradually distributed over the bulk flow region that extended to the cathodic surface fig 6b on the contrary the acidic boundary layer near the anode surface almost disappeared for ca mode fig 6c despite higher mobility of h than oh more h tended to be confined in the double layer of porous tiso anode rather than transfer to the cathode this can be partially illustrated by our previous studies liu et al 2019 where proton concentration in the porous structure was nearly four order magnitude higher than that in bulk solution in comparison double layer capacitance of non porous ss cathode was much smaller than that of porous anode which facilitated oh to transfer over the whole flow region therefore we attributed electrochemical degradation of bta to be flow pattern and ph relevant for ca flow pattern the ph neutral influent turned to be alkaline along with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction this led bulk solution ph to be raised from initial 6 75 to 13 2 fig 5b in this case strong electrostatic repulsion existed between the cathodic double layer and rn resulting in 0 5 bta removal under oh concentrated condition fig s3b when solution flowed from the cathode to the anode oh was transported by convection creating an alkaline boundary layer at the anode electrolyte interface ph 11 8 fig 5b this would alleviate the formation of anti corrosion bta film on the anode according to tafel and eis plots shown in fig 4 as such bta in the form of rn could be removed efficiently 94 1 on the tiso ecm anode for ac flow pattern water oxidation took place to produce h thereby acidic boundary layer ph of 2 1 was developed at the anode electrolyte interface which readily led to the formation of deactivated bta film and thus decrease in oh yield by preventing active sites additionally h confined within the porous anode strengthened electrostatic repulsion of rnh2 and the anode resulting in bta removal as low as 48 2 a value far lower than that for ca flow pattern 3 5 bta removal pathways and toxicity of intermediates to underline the pathway for electrochemical removal of bta under ca mode uplc qtof ms was used to identify the intermediates table s4 and meanwhile the fukui indices based on dft calculations was also employed to reflect the active sites of species the sites with the largest f 0 value were the preferred site for bta molecules when they are subjected to radical attack yao et al 2020 as shown in table s5 and fig s5 higher f 0 values for c2 c5 and n8 sites indicated the active sites to be attacked by oh this was seen to be consistent with the formation of r1 m z 135 0433 r2 m z 151 0382 and r3 m z 121 064 detected by uplc qtof ms measurement thus the most likely pathways for bta degradation were proposed in fig 7 pathway i involved a series of hydroxylation addition and cleavage of the phenyl structure mediated by electro generated oh in brief bta degradation was initiated from oh attack at c2 position f 0 0 117 with high electron density followed by the formation of unstable multi hydroxyl structure such as r1 and r2 yao et al 2020 subsequently ring opening reactions occurred to form intermediates with aldehyde and carboxyl groups r6 m z 167 0331 r7 m z 157 0124 until eventual mineralization pathway ii involved the cleavage of triazole ring structure to form r5 m z 93 0578 and r8 m z 94 0419 resulting from the substitution of hydroxyl group at n8 site f 0 0 105 zhang et al 2020 the tiso ecm could achieved 94 1 bta removal under ca mode but only 47 5 toc removal was obtained hence we performed evaluation on toxicity of degradation intermediates as shown in fig 8 a the oral rat ld50 value of bta was 435 36 mg kg 1 a value reflecting high toxicity of bta following electrochemical degradation an increased ld50 values were obtained for majority of degradation intermediates indicating decline in acute toxicity expect for initially unstable oh added intermediates r1 r2 and r4 that would be subject to further transformation in addition bioaccumulation factor was greatly decreased from initial 8 27 for bta to 0 04 4 33 for the intermediates r1 r8 fig 8b indicating the products were much less toxic than the parent compound 3 6 stability and scalability to evaluate the stability of tiso ecm system we performed the test for 20 cycles of bta degradation as a result the bta removal could be sustained for a long period of operation during successive 20 cycle test indicated by performance decline less than 10 fig s6 this suggested a relatively high stability of tiso ecm for degradation of bta pollutant our recently published work also demonstrated that the electrochemical reactor could be scale up easily and viably by numbering up the tiso ecm modules without increasing the ohmic resistance and decreasing the specific area of electrodes pei et al 2022 these results demonstrated that the tiso ecm were competitive for decentralized treatment of industrial bta wastewater 4 conclusions based on the above results the main conclusion could be drawn as follows bta anti corrosive agent could be electrochemically removed by tiso ecm with overall efficiency of 98 1 under cathode to anode ca flow pattern flow pattern had an essential impact of bta degradation depending on ph dependent formation of anti corrosive bta film on the tiso anode ca flow pattern was more favorable for bta oxidation mediated by electro generated oh by preventing the formation of deactivation film via creating an alkaline boundary layer at the anode electrolyte interface the most likely pathway for electrochemical degradation of bta was underlined by using experimental analysis and theoretical dft calculations both oral rat ld50 values and bioaccumulation factor were decreased remarkably during electrochemical degradation of bta this study provides a promising manner for effective removal of anti corrosive emerging pollutants by tiso ecm under flow through pattern appendix a supplementary data supplementary

15956,the discharge of produced water from offshore oil platforms is an emerging concern due to its potential adverse effects on marine ecosystems in this study we investigated the feasibility and capability of using marine sediments for the bioremediation of produced water we utilized a combination of porewater and solid phase analysis in a series of sediment batch incubations amended with produced water and synthetic produced water to determine the biodegradation of hydrocarbons under different redox conditions significant removal of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex compounds was observed under different redox conditions with biodegradation efficiencies of 93 97 in oxic incubations and 45 93 in anoxic incubations with nitrate iron oxide or sulfate as the electron acceptor higher biodegradation rates of btex were obtained by incubations dominated by nitrate reduction 104 149 nmolc cm3 d and oxygen respiration 52 57 nmolc cm3 d followed by sulfate reduction 14 76 nmolc cm3 d and iron reduction 29 39 nmolc cm3 d chemical fingerprint analysis showed that hydrocarbons were biodegraded to smaller alcohols acids under oxic conditions compared to anoxic conditions with nitrate indicating that the presence of oxygen facilitated a more complete biodegradation process toxicity of treated produced water to the marine copepod acartia tonsa was reduced by half after sediment incubations with oxygen and nitrate our study emphasizes the possibility to use marine sediment as a biofilter for treating produced water at sea without extending the oil and gas

hydrocyclone coupled with dosage of various treatment chemicals e g biocides and corrosion inhibitors are often used to remove the oil and suspended solids during produced water treatment liu et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 many water soluble compounds like btex are not removed by these techniques and end up in marine environment hence more effective and sustainable treatment of produced water is required after physical and chemical treatment processes degradation of natural organic material in the upper layers of marine sediments occurs under oxic conditions with oxygen o2 as the electron acceptor o2 serves both as a high energy yielding terminal electron acceptor both during heterotrophic carbon degradation and oxidation of reduced metabolites from anaerobic processes below the oxic zone canfield et al 2005 during aerobic decomposition highly reactive oxygen containing radicals are formed like superoxide anion o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh which can break bonds and depolymerize relative refractory organic compounds canfield et al 2005 in coastal sediment aerobic mineralization of organic material is usually limited to the upper 1 5 mm while o2 penetrates deeper in offshore and sandy sediments 3 8 mm mcginnis et al 2014 a large fraction of hydrocarbon biodegradations therefore occurs under anoxic conditions in the anoxic zone large and complex organic compounds will be degraded into smaller and more water soluble molecules under the production of energy by hydrolyzing and fermenting microorganisms canfield et al 2005 1993b the smaller organic molecules are then mineralized to inorganic carbon during respiration using different oxidized inorganic compounds as electron acceptors these processes generally occur in the following sequence with depth in the sediment manganese oxides mnox nitrate no3 iron oxides feooh sulfate so4 2 and inorganic carbon respiration while burrow dwelling invertebrates fecal pellets and plant roots create mosaics of oxic and anoxic microenvironments microbial degradations of recalcitrant organic contaminants have been observed in the marine environment for instance in connection with intensive oil spills margesin and schinner 1999 both field after oil spills and laboratory studies have widely demonstrated aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons e g btex and phenol with o2 no3 feooh and so4 2 as terminal electron acceptors under both marine and freshwater conditions alain et al 2012 cunningham et al 2001 dou et al 2008 head et al 2006 miralles et al 2007 villatoro monzón et al 2003 zhu et al 2020 strains of aerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria identified in marine sediments after oil spills belong to the genera acinetobacter marinobacter pseudomonas rhodococcus etc el naas et al 2014 mcgenity 2014 key anaerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria associated with denitrification feooh and so4 2 reduction have been shown to be phylogenetically affiliated to azoarcus thauera geobacter and desulfobacula desulfotignum respectively bin et al 2002 weelink et al 2010 although hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms are ubiquitous in the marine environment and hydrocarbon biodegradation abilities in natural marine sediments have been previously reported head et al 2006 a quantitative comparison of hydrocarbon biodegradation rates under different redox conditions in marine sediments and contributions of hydrocarbon biodegradation to aerobic and anaerobic organic carbon mineralization have to our knowledge not been investigated the principal goal of the present study was to examine the feasibility and capability of using marine sediments for bioremediation of produced water we designed a sediment incubation experiment to determine the biodegradation rates of btex in produced water and synthetic produced water under different redox conditions and to examine the role of btex in aerobic and anaerobic organic carbon mineralization the organic components of produced water and biodegradation products formed during oxic and anoxic incubations in the presence of no3 were examined through novel chemical fingerprint analysis the biodegradation experiments were combined with an evaluation of the impact of untreated and treated produced water on the life cycle of a tonsa by assessing its growth reproduction and mortality to provide further insights into the effect of bio remediated produced water on marine living organisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling sediments were sampled at a station south of knähagen 55 58 n 12 41 e in a relatively pristine area in øresund without any regular oil contaminations in a recent study a hydrocarbon content of 1 3 0 32 µg g dry wt sediment was measured in the area of the sampling site sánchez garcía et al 2010 which was 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than that reported in heavy oil contaminated sediments kimes et al 2014 miralles et al 2007 sediments were collected in polycarbonate tubes on board rv ophelia equipped with conductivity temperature depth ctd sensors and haps cores the water depth was 31 m salinity temperature and o2 in the bottom water were 26 5 4 c and 298 µmol l respectively seawater was sampled on shore through a direct connection to the bottom water in øresund the sediment cores were stored open in the dark at near in situ temperature until further handling within 2 weeks produced water from an oil handling installation in the danish section of the north sea was collected at the release point after flotation treatment to remove suspended oil during the treatment various production chemicals including biocides and corrosion inhibitors were used a batch portion was stored without headspace at 4 c until the onset of incubations considering previous findings where hydrocarbon mineralization rates by marine microorganisms appeared to be primarily controlled by the extent of pollutant loading and not by variations in the salinity regime kerr and capone 1988 produced water was diluted with seawater to mimic the salinity at the sampling site in order to avoid a lag period in bacteria activity pending adaptation to higher salinity in the following batch incubations produced water pw refers to the produced water collected from the north sea oil facility while synthetic produced water synthetic pw refers sterile filtered seawater from øresund amended with btex mimicking the concentrations in pw and excluding potential degradation by microorganisms in pw supplementary materials table s1 the pw used for incubations consisted of 14 µmol l of benzene 2 1 µmol l of toluene 0 5 µmol l of ethylbenzene m xylene and p xylene and 4 5 µmol l of o xylene table s1 2 2 sediment handling and batch incubations to examine the biodegradation of produced water components under oxic and anoxic conditions and the role of btex degradation in aerobic and anaerobic organic carbon oxidation the changes in btex concentrations and end products of mineralization i e total dissolved inorganic carbon co2 and ammonium nh4 were monitored in sediment slurry incubations with different electron acceptors mimicking redox conditions in seafloor table s2 briefly 18 sediment cores were sliced into the intervals 0 1 cm 1 4 cm and 4 10 cm at near in situ temperature and parallel sections were pooled homogenized and filled in 0 5 and 1 l bluecap bottles the depth intervals of 0 1 cm 1 4 cm and 4 10 cm were chosen to represent the zones of o2 no3 consumption fe reduction and so4 2 reduction respectively indeed the dominance of so4 2 reduction below 4 cm of depth was indicated visually by color going from brownish to black sediment the sediment from each depth interval was homogenized and mixed with onsite sterile filtered seawater to obtain slurries sediment slurries were filled into glass bottles closed with gastight stoppers and sampling ports purged with n2 gas and left over night to consume any traces of o2 and no3 incubations were initiated by adding pw synthetic pw and different electron acceptors to the slurries table s2 the incubations were named after the electron acceptor corresponding to certain depth intervals and amendment for example incubations from 0 1 cm without pw and synthetic pw were named o2 control no3 control while slurries with pw or synthetic pw were called o2 pw no3 pw or o2 synthetic pw no3 synthetic pw table s2 parallel anoxic incubations no3 synthetic pw acetate fe synthetic pw acetate and so4 2 synthetic pw acetate were amended with acetate in a concentration of 1 5 mmol l to investigate co metabolic degradations of btex table s2 for oxic incubations with sediment from 0 1 cm o2 control o2 pw and o2 synthetic pw pure o2 gas was added to the headspace at the onset of incubation o2 concentrations in both oxic and anoxic incubations were monitored with non invasive optical oxygen sensors pyroscience germany to stimulate no3 reduction in the anoxic slurries with sediment from 0 1 cm no3 control no3 pw no3 synthetic pw and no3 synthetic pw acetate no3 was added to an end concentration of 3 mmol l throughout the incubations no3 concentrations were measured and maintained above 0 9 mmol l through additional spikes of no3 sediment from 1 4 cm was incubated with feooh addition fe control fe synthetic pw and fe synthetic pw acetate and without feooh addition fe control and fe synthetic pw the concentrations of poorly crystalline fe iii and particulate fe ii were 2 5 0 8 µmol cm3 and 12 0 2 5 µmol cm3 respectively before the amendment with feooh the concentration of poorly crystalline fe iii was increased by a factor of 10 38 table s2 to ensure fe reduction throughout the entire incubations as the concentration of so4 2 was 21 mmol l at the onset of incubation with pooled sediment from 4 10 cm so4 2 control so4 2 synthetic pw and so4 2 synthetic pw acetate there was no need to stimulate so4 2 reduction with additional spike of so4 2 sediment slurries were incubated on shakers 2 2 1 sediment porewater sampling and analysis the temporal pattern of btex concentrations as well as aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation processes were followed for 35 d table s3 subsampling from the sediment slurry incubations was initiated 5 h after amendments where only trace amount of o2 from the amendments was left 1 7 µm in anoxic incubations and repeated on nine following occasions t0 t9 throughout the incubation period table s3 sampling from the anoxic sediment slurries and handling of porewater were performed under n2 atmosphere in a glove bag subsamples of sediment slurry were centrifuged 4000 rpm for 10 15 min at 4 c and the supernatant was filtered 0 22 µm pore diameter polypropylene filters under n2 atmosphere the conservation of porewater samples was described in supplementary materials section s1 co2 was measured by flow injection with conductivity detection hall and aller 1992 dissolved hydrogen sulfide h2s was measured colorimetrically using the methylene blue method cline 1969 while so4 2 was quantified by suppressed anion chromatography dionex dissolved fe2 was quantified colorimetrically using ferrozine without reducing agent stookey 1970 thamdrup et al 1994 an air segmented continuous flow analyzer skalar san netherlands was used for colorimetric analysis of nh4 nitrite no2 and nox i e no2 no3 2 2 2 sediment characteristics and solid phase analysis separate samples of sediment slurry were taken from each bottle under n2 on several occasions during the incubation for the determination of ph btex sulfate reduction rates srr solid phase fe pools and density water content porosity ph was monitored by a ph probe wtw gmbh weilheim germany porosity was calculated by multiplying wet density weight of a known volume and water content weight loss after drying at 105 c for 24 h subsamples of sediment slurry for btex analysis were extracted immediately with hexane containing fluorobenzene as internal standard in septum capped glass vials after 18 h of mixing in a rotator the hexane phase was extracted and frozen in 1 8 ml glass vials until analysis btex concentrations were quantified by headspace mass spectrometry coupled to gas chromatography gc ms agilent technologies rates of so4 2 reduction were quantified using 35so4 2 tracer method jørgensen 1978 separate samples of sediment slurry 5 ml were added to 10 ml serum bottles which were plugged with gas tight stoppers and incubated anoxically at 10 c after the addition of 35so4 2 tracer after 6 h in the dark the samples were fixed in 5 ml of 20 zinc acetate and stored frozen until distillation the reduced 35s pools were recovered by single step distillation with boiling acidic cr2 solution fossing and barker 1989 concentrations of solid phase fe iii and fe ii pools were determined through cold hcl extraction kostka and luther 1994 this assay extracts poorly crystalline fe iii oxides and particulate fe ii such as fes and feco3 canfield et al 1993b thamdrup et al 1994 extractions were performed with 10 ml extractant and 100 mg wet sediment for 1 h under shaking in the dark the concentrations of the oxidation stages of fe were determined colorimetrically using a ferrozine solution 50 mmol l hepes 0 08 ferrozine ph 7 with and without 1 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride for quantification of total fe and fe ii respectively canfield et al 1993b 2 3 calculation of rates total carbon oxidation rates and btex degradation rates were calculated from the slope of linear regression of porewater co2 accumulation and total btex concentrations versus time respectively volumetric rates nmol c cm3 d were calculated instead of mass rates to evaluate the potential of using the seafloor as a biofilter to remove organic components in produced water sulfate reduction rates were calculated from the fraction of reduced sulfur produced and the concentration of so4 2 as described in fossing and barker 1989 after the correction by subtracting 35s recovered from distillation of sediment fixed immediately in zinc acetate after injection of the tracer assuming an overall stoichiometry of 2 molar of organic carbon oxidized per 1 molar of so4 2 reduced the difference between total carbon oxidation and carbon oxidation coupled to so4 2 reduction gave a measurement of carbon oxidation coupled to other anaerobic respiration pathways as o2 was undetectable in the anoxic incubations fig 1 b 2 4 chemical fingerprint analysis a chemical fingerprint analysis of naturally occurring and pw organic components was performed on the oxic incubation o2 pw fingerprint and anoxic incubation with no3 no3 pw fingerprint due to the high amount of sample needed for this analysis these two incubations were run in parallel to the aforementioned incubations of o2 pw and no3 pw table s2 slurry samples taken at the beginning t0 and end of incubation t9 were acidified with 6 mol l hcl to ph 1 3 to reduce microbial activity and stored at 4 c until analysis the sample preparation workflow was designed to target water soluble and oxygen containing organics e g carboxylic acids and alcohols these are the dominant classes of compounds present in produced water after removal of any dispersed oil bergfors et al 2020 samanipour et al 2020 sørensen et al 2019 strømgren et al 1995 the chemical fingerprint of the extracted samples was analyzed using an agilent 7890b gc coupled to a 7200b qtof high resolution mass spectrometer common and unique features were evaluated using the investigator software the details of sample preparation and qtof high resolution mass spectrometer were listed in supplementary materials section s2 2 5 toxicity tests the focus of the toxicity experiments was to investigate the effects of untreated and treated pw on the mortality and physiology of the coastal copepod a tonsa i e egg and fecal pellet production the ingestion was evaluated by the quantification of fecal pellet production while the egg production rate was used as proxy for reproduction experimental details of toxicity tests including the cultivation of a tonsa estimation of lethal concentration 50 lc50 of untreated pw and synthetic pw and median effective concentration ec50 of untreated and treated pw for egg and pellet production were described in supplementary materials section s3 and tables s4 s5 3 results and discussions 3 1 total carbon oxidation based on solid phase and porewater chemistry the main diagenetic reactions occurring in the sediment incubations can be inferred concentrations of co2 h2co3 hco3 co3 2 increased linearly during the first 355 h of incubations indicating constant rates of organic material oxidation figs 1a s1 quantification of total carbon oxidation rates from accumulation of co2 in porewater over time can be effected by carbonate precipitation or dissolution caco3 feco3 and mnco3 jensen et al 2005 thamdrup et al 2000 during anoxic incubations co2 and nh4 accumulated in parallel with good linearity of co2 versus nh4 concentrations for each incubation r2 0 84 data not shown examples of nh4 accumulation were shown in fig s2 also ph values 7 2 8 2 were stable over time in all incubations and within the typical range of marine sediments excluding substantial carbonate precipitations the carbon oxidation rates in the control incubations agreed with the total carbon oxidation rates previously reported in short term sediment incubations from the baltic north sea transition 10 574 nmol c cm3 d table 1 canfield et al 1993a 1993b jensen et al 2005 the highest total carbon oxidation rates were obtained in the oxic control incubations and the anoxic control incubations with no3 corresponding well with higher rates in the surface of marine sediments table 1 jensen et al 2005 the availability of organic material tends to decrease with depth which is reflected in lower carbon oxidation rates with depth table 1 jensen et al 2005 in the incubations with o2 and no3 the amendment with pw enhanced the total carbon oxidation rates by a factor of 1 8 and 3 7 respectively compared to the controls there were no significant differences in the total carbon oxidation rates between synthetic pw amended incubations and controls p 0 05 unpaired t test the addition of acetate stimulated mineralization rates in the anoxic incubations by a factor of 3 4 compared to the unamended incubations p 0 05 unpaired t test table 1 a previous study of carbon oxidation pathways in sediments of the baltic north sea transition showed that one of the five carbon oxidation pathways i e heterotrophic o2 respiration denitrification mn iv fe or so4 2 reduction can be dominant at a given site as the different respiration pathways are affected by various different environmental factors such as water depth rate of sedimentation and sediment type rysgaard et al 2001 in our experimental setup we aimed to stimulate one mineralization pathway over the others to look at the potential biodegradation of produced water components under different redox regimes in the oxic incubations o2 control o2 pw and o2 synthetic pw dissolved o2 concentrations gradually decreased from 206 2 µmol cm3 to 164 12 µmol cm3 during the initial incubation period of 355 h and to 35 3 µmol l at the end of incubations fig 1b the decrease in dissolved o2 concentration with time was partly caused by heterotrophic o2 respiration organic carbon decomposition as indicated by the simultaneous co2 accumulation and o2 consumption figs 1 s1 table 1 in addition o2 was consumed by the reoxidation of reduced inorganic metabolites associated with respiration e g nh4 and h2s in the anoxic incubations amended with no3 plots of co2 versus no3 yielded a c n ratio 0 73 0 13 n 4 data not shown close to 0 80 in agreement with the theoretical stoichiometry from the biodegradation of organic carbon through denitrification canfield et al 2005 the addition of feooh generally suppressed the carbon oxidation coupled to so4 2 reduction compared to unamended incubations without feooh addition table 1 the divergence of total carbon oxidation and so4 2 based carbon oxidation in the incubations amended with feooh implied that other anaerobic respiration pathways were important the excess carbon oxidation was assigned to microbial fe reduction due to i in the anoxic control incubations o2 remained undetectable implying there was no contamination with o2 in the anoxic incubations fig 1b ii no no3 was detected throughout the entire incubation period in any of the incubations from 1 4 cm with and without feooh detection limit of 10 µmol l data now shown iii the concentration of reactive mnox is often low below 1 cm depth jensen et al 2003 iv large pools of poorly crystalline fe iii were measured in the incubations with feooh amendment i e fe control fe synthetic pw and fe synthetic pw acetate while smaller pools were observed in the incubations with unamended sediment from the same depth i e fe control and fe synthetic pw fig 2 a v the role of fe reduction was partly supported by the accumulation of soluble fe2 in the porewater fig 2b the much lower concentrations of soluble fe2 over solid fe ii and co2 in the incubations indicated rapid adsorption or precipitation of fe2 ions e g fes taking all together a large fraction of the anaerobic decomposition of organic material was conveyed by fe reduction in the incubations amended with feooh 50 80 in fe control fe synthetic pw and fe synthetic pw acetate and fe reduction was therefore inferred as the main carbon oxidation pathway table 1 fe reduction was of minor importance in incubations without feooh amendment using sediment from 1 4 cm fe control and fe synthetic pw although the total fe content was relatively high fig 2a table 1 fe iii was present yet in low concentrations and while dissolved fe2 accumulated in the porewater in fe control and fe synthetic pw fe2 remained undetectable during the entire period of so4 2 incubations with sediments from 4 10 cm fig 2 in addition rates of carbon oxidation and so4 2 reduction converted to carbon units were similar implying that so4 2 reduction was the main anaerobic carbon oxidation pathway in the rest of anoxic incubations with subsurface sediment 65 100 in fe control fe synthetic pw so4 2 control so4 2 synthetic pw and so4 2 synthetic pw acetate table 1 3 2 btex biodegradation and the role of btex in organic matter mineralization as btex are known human carcinogens and highly toxic to a variety of living organisms the removal of these contaminants is of great importance dean 1985 the biodegradation of btex compounds is feasible under both oxic and anoxic conditions in the presence of various electron acceptors e g o2 no3 feooh and so4 2 burland and edwards 1999 lovley et al 1996 1995 in this study significant btex removals were observed in all incubations figs 3 s3 biodegradation was considered the main removal process for btex in our sediment incubations while removal through volatilization and or adsorption was expected to be negligible as btex concentrations remained stable after the fast degradation within 284 h figs 3 s3 also the applied hexane extraction on sediment samples detached efficiently any adsorbed btex from solids in sediment as confirmed by the high recovery efficiencies of internal standards 99 3 we observed rapid biodegradations of btex compounds with minimum rates of 52 57 nmolc cm3 d in oxic incubations and 14 149 nmolc cm3 d in anoxic incubations figs 3 s3 table 1 the highest biodegradation efficiencies were obtained by incubations with o2 93 97 and no3 85 93 followed by fe reduction 53 56 and so4 2 reduction 45 76 figs 3 s3 for oxic incubations the btex biodegradation rates were 57 32 nmolc cm3 d for pw and 52 1 6 nmolc cm3 d for synthetic pw table 1 the fast btex biodegradation observed in the oxic incubations was consistent with observations in previous pure culture experiments with aerobic heterotrophic bacteria where btex compounds were readily degraded under oxic conditions with rates ranging from 0 6 to 17 mmolc l d hocinat et al 2020 jin et al 2013 morlett chávez et al 2010 robledo ortíz et al 2011 xin et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 during aerobic btex biodegradation the compounds are initially converted into catechol intermediates via direct oxidation of the aromatic ring catalyzed by monooxygenases kahng et al 2001 or dioxygenase zylstra and gibson 1989 then the produced catechol intermediates undergo ring cleavage by catechol 1 2 dioxygenase or catechol 3 4 dioxygenase in the β ketoadipate pathways to krebs cycle intermediates el naas et al 2014 in our study aerobic btex biodegradation contributed to 20 35 of total carbon oxidation table 1 this is consistent with previous studies on aerobic btex biodegradation where 33 of benzene was converted to co2 in hypersaline soils nicholson and fathepure 2005 while 34 89 of the carbon from toluene was recovered as co2 and biomass using marinobacter vinifirmus in a pure culture study berlendis et al 2010 both no3 burland and edwards 1999 cunningham et al 2001 fe iii lovley et al 1996 villatoro monzón et al 2003 and so4 2 reducing bacteria cunningham et al 2001 lovley et al 1995 have been connected to anaerobic btex biodegradation here we found the highest btex biodegradation rates in the presence of no3 as terminal electron acceptor such as 104 and 149 nmolc cm3 d for no3 amended incubations with pw and synthetic pw respectively figs 3 s3 table 1 this was up to 5 and 10 times faster than rates in incubations dominated by fe iii and so4 2 reduction respectively figs 3 s3 table 1 similarly more efficient anaerobic btex biodegradations up to 4 times higher rates have been reported under no3 compared to under fe iii and so4 2 reducing conditions using bacterial enrichments obtained from gasoline contaminated soils and sediments cunningham et al 2001 dou et al 2008 phelps and young 1999 according to thermodynamic principles higher reaction energy can be obtained during btex degradation when utilizing no3 as electron acceptor compared to fe iii and so4 2 dou et al 2008 ulrich and edwards 2003 for instance standard free energy changes g of benzene oxidation with no3 as the electron acceptor is 2990 kj mol while it is 2660 kj mol and 200 kj mol for fe iii and so4 2 respectively ulrich and edwards 2003 therefore no3 is a more favorable electron acceptor than fe iii and so4 2 for btex biodegradation aromatic compounds like btex can be anaerobically degraded via benzoyl coa resorcinol phloroglucinol hydroxyhydroquinone and possibly other pathways involving reactions of carboxylation methylation and hydroxylation bin et al 2002 godin et al 2020 harwood et al 1998 during biodegradation coupled to no3 reduction btex compounds were potentially mineralized to co2 accounting for 25 98 of total carbon oxidation table 1 the relative contribution to total carbon mineralization estimated for no3 synthetic pw 98 in our study was in well agreement with previous experiments with enrichment cultures from soil and groundwater where approximately 92 95 of benzene was recovered in co2 during anaerobic biodegradation linked to no3 reduction burland and edwards 1999 results in previous studies further suggested that during anaerobic benzene biodegradation no3 could be stoichiometrically reduced to no2 and further to n2 with the reduction of no2 to n2 being the rate limiting steps burland and edwards 1999 ulrich and edwards 2003 in our experiments capacities and rates of btex biodegradation in both incubations with pw and synthetic pw were comparable for incubations with o2 and no3 figs 3 s3 table 1 the addition of acetate increased the total mineralization rates but did not facilitate any potential co metabolic degradations of btex table 1 possible explanation could be that microorganisms present were able to metabolically degrade btex as an energy and or carbon source el naas et al 2014 weelink et al 2010 or the co metabolic activities were not limited by organic carbons due to the availability of other easily degradable carbon sources in the sediment canfield et al 2005 there was likely a decrease in nitrification activity during oxic incubations with pw and synthetic pw as indicated by nh4 accumulation and lower no3 production over time compared to the control incubation examples given in fig s2 autotrophic ammonia oxidizers are able to co metabolically degrade certain organic molecules including various hydrocarbons through their key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo su et al 2021 yet they are sensitive to the toxicity of hydrocarbons caused by noncompetitive and competitive inhibitions on amo su et al 2021 in fact ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea were 100 and 1000 times respectively more sensitive than typical heterotrophs to hydrocarbon toxicity urakawa et al 2019 2012 our results showed that the functional heterotrophic microorganisms were not inhibited by btex or other toxic compounds in pw as indicated by 1 8 3 7 times higher total carbon oxidation rates obtained in pw amended incubations with o2 and no3 compared to the controls figs 3 s3 table 1 3 3 chemical fingerprint before and after biodegradations more than 1000 compounds were detected by non target screening at the beginning and end of pw incubations with o2 and no3 as electron acceptors a subset of approximately 100 compounds were tentatively identified via a library search nist library 2017 match factor 700 degradation of btex type compounds was assumed to produce oxygenated analogs e g carboxylic acids and alcohols as intermediates during the mineralization chakraborty and coates 2004 gibson et al 1968 meckenstock et al 2004 yoshikawa et al 2017 the presence of these intermediates can be utilized as an indicator of the overall degradation progress among the analyzed samples taken at the beginning t0 and end t9 of the oxic incubation with pw o2 pw fingerprint the identified compounds were mainly classified as alcohols and acids fig 4 a some pahs were detected in low amounts with no significant differences between the samples taken at t0 and t9 fig 4a interestingly there was a large proportion of phenol and its alkylated analogs at the onset of oxic incubation t0 which were not detected at the end of oxic incubation t9 fig 4a instead the slurry sample at t9 contained a larger proportion of c6 to c10 linear carboxylic acids and alcohols fig 4a these linear carboxylic acids and alcohols were likely biodegradation products formed by stepwise oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons to phenols followed by ring opening and reduction fig 4c the reactions proposed based on chemical fingerprint corresponded to the aerobic biodegradation pathway suggested for btex i e stepwise oxidation and cleavage of aromatic ring performed by monooxygenases and or dioxygenase under oxic conditions the ratios of long versus short carboxylic acids did not show evident trends this was in line with the fact that produced water is a highly complex mixture of natural chemicals and biodegradation products bergfors et al 2020 incomplete biodegradation could be a plausible explanation of the high richness of organics in the treated samples another indication of stepwise degradation pathways was the presence of benzenebutanoic acid at the beginning of oxic incubation t0 which was missing at the end of oxic incubation t9 fig 4a in contrast the abundance of benzenepropanoic benzeneacetic and benzoic acids increased at t9 these results indicated a preference for saturated decarboxylation followed by oxidation over ring opening type reactions fig 4c however more research is required to clarify the exact biodegradation mechanisms the comparison of biodegradation products formed during oxic and anoxic incubations demonstrated that the chromatogram of the slurry sample after oxic incubation o2 pw fingerprint at t9 was heavily populated in the low retention time region in both dimensions while the proportion intensity for anoxic incubation amended with no3 no3 pw fingerprint at t9 was slightly shifted to higher retention time region fig 4b in simplified terms an increase in retention time corresponded to an increase in the boiling point size and polarity fig 4b the region marked in green primarily contained smaller alcohols acids e g butanoic acid octanol and cyclohexanol while the region marked in red was dominated by aromatic acids e g terephthalic acid toluic acid and 3 4 dimethylbenzoic acid fig 4b these compounds were potential intermediates during the degradation of alkylated phenols mei et al 2019 van schie and young 2000 thus a larger number of small molecules were produced during aerobic biodegradation whereas anaerobic biodegradation resulted in higher concentrations of uncleaved aromatics o2 seemed to facilitate a more complete degradation process the result was in agreement with the previous observation in marine sediments where aerobic mineralization of complex organic material was 2 3 times faster than that under anoxic conditions kristensen et al 1995 the relatively incomplete decomposition in the anoxic zones of most sediments can be explained by the limited ability of anaerobic microorganisms to hydrolyze certain classes of structurally complex and aromatic organic compounds kristensen et al 1995 3 4 toxicity analysis according to the toxicity tests on a tonsa lc50 was 22 for untreated pw i e dilution factor of 4 5 and 8 for untreated and concentrated synthetic pw i e dilution factor of 12 5 which was equal to 4 6 and 2451 µmol l of btex in pw and synthetic pw respectively fig 5 a b furthermore untreated pw also inhibited egg and pellet production of a tonsa with ec50 values of 0 4 and 0 7 respectively fig 5c d the lower ec50 values than lc50 values indicated that egg and pellet production of copepods were more sensitive than mortality to untreated pw which were consistent with previous toxicity tests of pahs and antifouling biocides on a tonsa bellas and thor 2007 wendt et al 2016 compared to untreated pw higher ec50 values of egg and pellet production were estimated for treated o2 pw i e 0 8 and 1 respectively and no3 pw 1 and 1 3 respectively thus toxic effects of produced water on the physiology of a tonsa were reduced by half after microbial treatments since btex type compounds were efficiently removed in both oxic and anoxic incubations figs 3 s3 the remaining toxicity of treated pw on a tonsa might be related to other compounds such as pahs which was detected in low amounts with no significant removal during incubations fig 4a or chemical additives biocides corrosion inhibitors etc dosed in drilling to prevent operational problems and enhance oil water separation fakhru l razi et al 2009 jiménez et al 2018 a toxicity identification evaluation is needed in future studies 3 5 practical implications our study demonstrated the feasibility of using bacteria naturally harboring in marine sediments as an efficient and sustainable option for treating certain components in produced water on the basis of btex removal rates measured in no3 amended incubations we estimated the hydraulic retention time hrt of produced water in a continuous flow biofilter system for complete removal of the individual btex compounds i e below the analytical detection limits of 0 3 0 3 0 2 and 0 2 0 5 µmol l for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes respectively table s6 a hrt of 1 day is needed to remove btex in 1000 l of produced water passing through a sediment filter of 1 m3 with no3 as the electron acceptor in the light of these findings we propose to use marine sediment as a biofilter where produced water could be distributed through perforated submerged horizontal tubes fig 6 the tubes would serve as flow distributors allowing an upflow of produced water through the overlying sediment produced water should be supplied with favorable electron acceptors o2 and no3 as these only penetrate mm to cm into the sediment and the reduction would exceed the natural supply produced water would be subject to continuous microbial degradations along with the upward movement through the seabed a continuous mode would reduce the mass transfer resistance associated with batch incubations allowing a more effective contact between dissolved pollutant and microorganisms which are mainly associated with the solid phases of the sediment the depth and cross sectional area of discharge flow distribution at discharge that determines the effective flow volume combined with the actual discharge rate will determine the actual hrt before full scale implementation a pilot scale biofilter reactor with sediments from an area closer to the oil platform should be operated over a long period of time this would allow for a better understanding of long term performance design optimization and validation adaptation and proliferation of the microbial community in addition to the actual impact on the benthic fauna the development of a diagnostic tool for effective measurements of cleaning efficiency is also required for future application 4 conclusions the present study examined the feasibility and capability of using marine sediments for the bioremediation of produced water we obtained significant btex removals in a series of sediment batch incubations under different redox conditions with biodegradation efficiencies of 93 97 in oxic incubations and 45 93 in no3 fe and so4 2 amended anoxic incubations higher biodegradation rates of btex were obtained by incubations dominated by no3 reduction 104 149 nmolc cm3 d and o2 respiration 52 57 nmolc cm3 d followed by so4 2 reduction 14 76 nmolc cm3 d and fe reduction 29 39 nmolc cm3 d chemical fingerprint analysis suggested that the presence of o2 facilitated a more complete biodegradation process as hydrocarbons were found to be biodegraded to smaller alcohols acids under oxic conditions compared to anoxic conditions with no3 toxicity of treated produced water to the marine copepod a tonsa was reduced by half after sediment incubations with o2 and no3 the results advance our understanding of hydrocarbon biodegradation under different redox conditions in marine sediments and highlight the option to use marine sediment as a biofilter for treating produced water at sea without extending the oil and gas platform or implementing a large scale construction

15956,the discharge of produced water from offshore oil platforms is an emerging concern due to its potential adverse effects on marine ecosystems in this study we investigated the feasibility and capability of using marine sediments for the bioremediation of produced water we utilized a combination of porewater and solid phase analysis in a series of sediment batch incubations amended with produced water and synthetic produced water to determine the biodegradation of hydrocarbons under different redox conditions significant removal of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex compounds was observed under different redox conditions with biodegradation efficiencies of 93 97 in oxic incubations and 45 93 in anoxic incubations with nitrate iron oxide or sulfate as the electron acceptor higher biodegradation rates of btex were obtained by incubations dominated by nitrate reduction 104 149 nmolc cm3 d and oxygen respiration 52 57 nmolc cm3 d followed by sulfate reduction 14 76 nmolc cm3 d and iron reduction 29 39 nmolc cm3 d chemical fingerprint analysis showed that hydrocarbons were biodegraded to smaller alcohols acids under oxic conditions compared to anoxic conditions with nitrate indicating that the presence of oxygen facilitated a more complete biodegradation process toxicity of treated produced water to the marine copepod acartia tonsa was reduced by half after sediment incubations with oxygen and nitrate our study emphasizes the possibility to use marine sediment as a biofilter for treating produced water at sea without extending the oil and gas

toxicity test 1 introduction significant amounts of produced water are generated from conventional oil and natural gas production veil et al 2004 produced water is a complex mixture of dissolved and particulate organic and inorganic chemicals including heavy metals and organic material from geological formations e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and alkylphenols as well as polymers and other chemical additives bakke et al 2013 fakhru l razi et al 2009 jiménez et al 2018 among these chemicals monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons i e benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex pahs and related heterocyclic aromatic compounds are considered major toxicants in produced water bakke et al 2013 liu et al 2021 neff et al 2011 compared to other hydrocarbons in produced water btex are relatively water soluble ekins et al 2007 van agteren et al 1998 and can therefore be transported far from the original source of discharge these aromatic hydrocarbons can bioaccumulate in marine organisms and cause acute and chronic toxicities neff et al 2011 neff 2002 for instance aromatic hydrocarbons are found to influence the reproduction of the marine copepod acatia tonsa which plays a key role in the marine ecosystem due to a link between primary producers and fish production bellas and thor 2007 girling 1989 therefore due to their high toxicity and serious adverse environmental impacts the removal of these oil contaminants is of great importance because of space and weight restrictions on offshore platforms compact physical equipment e g gravity sedimentation and hydrocyclone coupled with dosage of various treatment chemicals e g biocides and corrosion inhibitors are often used to remove the oil and suspended solids during produced water treatment liu et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 many water soluble compounds like btex are not removed by these techniques and end up in marine environment hence more effective and sustainable treatment of produced water is required after physical and chemical treatment processes degradation of natural organic material in the upper layers of marine sediments occurs under oxic conditions with oxygen o2 as the electron acceptor o2 serves both as a high energy yielding terminal electron acceptor both during heterotrophic carbon degradation and oxidation of reduced metabolites from anaerobic processes below the oxic zone canfield et al 2005 during aerobic decomposition highly reactive oxygen containing radicals are formed like superoxide anion o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh which can break bonds and depolymerize relative refractory organic compounds canfield et al 2005 in coastal sediment aerobic mineralization of organic material is usually limited to the upper 1 5 mm while o2 penetrates deeper in offshore and sandy sediments 3 8 mm mcginnis et al 2014 a large fraction of hydrocarbon biodegradations therefore occurs under anoxic conditions in the anoxic zone large and complex organic compounds will be degraded into smaller and more water soluble molecules under the production of energy by hydrolyzing and fermenting microorganisms canfield et al 2005 1993b the smaller organic molecules are then mineralized to inorganic carbon during respiration using different oxidized inorganic compounds as electron acceptors these processes generally occur in the following sequence with depth in the sediment manganese oxides mnox nitrate no3 iron oxides feooh sulfate so4 2 and inorganic carbon respiration while burrow dwelling invertebrates fecal pellets and plant roots create mosaics of oxic and anoxic microenvironments microbial degradations of recalcitrant organic contaminants have been observed in the marine environment for instance in connection with intensive oil spills margesin and

as terminal electron acceptors under both marine and freshwater conditions alain et al 2012 cunningham et al 2001 dou et al 2008 head et al 2006 miralles et al 2007 villatoro monzón et al 2003 zhu et al 2020 strains of aerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria identified in marine sediments after oil spills belong to the genera acinetobacter marinobacter pseudomonas rhodococcus etc el naas et al 2014 mcgenity 2014 key anaerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria associated with denitrification feooh and so4 2 reduction have been shown to be phylogenetically affiliated to azoarcus thauera geobacter and desulfobacula desulfotignum respectively bin et al 2002 weelink et al 2010 although hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms are ubiquitous in the marine environment and hydrocarbon biodegradation abilities in natural marine sediments have been previously reported head et al 2006 a quantitative comparison of hydrocarbon biodegradation rates under different redox conditions in marine sediments and contributions of hydrocarbon biodegradation to aerobic and anaerobic organic carbon mineralization have to our knowledge not been investigated the principal goal of the present study was to examine the feasibility and capability of using marine sediments for bioremediation of produced water we designed a sediment incubation experiment to determine the biodegradation rates of btex in produced water and synthetic produced water under different redox conditions and to examine the role of btex in aerobic and anaerobic organic carbon mineralization the organic components of produced water and biodegradation products formed during oxic and anoxic incubations in the presence of no3 were examined through novel chemical fingerprint analysis the biodegradation experiments were combined with an evaluation of the impact of untreated and treated produced water on the life cycle of a tonsa by assessing its growth reproduction and mortality to provide further insights into the effect of bio remediated produced water on marine living organisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling sediments were sampled at a station south of knähagen 55 58 n 12 41 e in a relatively pristine area in øresund without any regular oil contaminations in a recent study a hydrocarbon content of 1 3 0 32 µg g dry wt sediment was measured in the area of the sampling site sánchez garcía et al 2010 which was 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than that reported in heavy oil contaminated sediments kimes et al 2014 miralles et al 2007 sediments were collected in polycarbonate tubes on board rv ophelia equipped with conductivity temperature depth ctd sensors and haps cores the water depth was 31 m salinity temperature and o2 in the bottom water were 26 5 4 c and 298 µmol l respectively seawater was sampled on shore through a direct connection to the bottom water in øresund the sediment cores were stored open in the dark at near in situ temperature until further handling within 2 weeks produced water from an oil handling installation in the danish section of the north sea was collected at the release point after flotation treatment to remove suspended oil during the treatment various production chemicals including biocides and corrosion inhibitors were used a batch portion was stored without headspace at 4 c until the onset of incubations considering previous findings where hydrocarbon mineralization rates by marine microorganisms appeared to be primarily controlled by the extent of pollutant loading and not by variations in the salinity regime kerr and capone 1988 produced water was diluted with seawater to mimic the salinity at the sampling site in order to avoid a lag period in bacteria activity pending adaptation to higher salinity in the following batch incubations produced water pw refers to the produced water collected from the north sea oil facility while synthetic produced water synthetic pw refers sterile filtered seawater from øresund amended with btex mimicking the concentrations in pw and excluding potential degradation by microorganisms in pw supplementary materials table s1 the pw used for incubations consisted of 14 µmol l of benzene 2 1 µmol l of toluene 0 5 µmol l of ethylbenzene m xylene and p xylene and 4 5 µmol l of o xylene table s1 2 2 sediment handling and batch incubations to examine the biodegradation of produced water components under oxic and anoxic conditions and the role of btex degradation in aerobic and anaerobic organic carbon oxidation the changes in btex concentrations and end products of mineralization i e total dissolved inorganic carbon co2 and ammonium nh4 were monitored in sediment slurry incubations with different electron acceptors mimicking redox conditions in seafloor table s2 briefly 18 sediment cores were sliced into the intervals 0 1 cm 1 4 cm and 4 10 cm at near in situ temperature and parallel sections were pooled homogenized and filled in 0 5 and 1 l bluecap bottles the depth intervals of 0 1 cm 1 4 cm and 4 10 cm were chosen to represent the zones of o2 no3 consumption fe reduction and so4 2 reduction respectively indeed the dominance of so4 2 reduction below 4 cm of depth was indicated visually by color going from brownish to black sediment the sediment from each depth interval was homogenized and mixed with onsite sterile filtered seawater to obtain slurries sediment slurries were filled into glass bottles closed with gastight stoppers and sampling ports purged with n2 gas and left over night to consume any traces of o2 and no3 incubations were initiated by adding pw synthetic pw and different electron acceptors to the slurries table s2 the incubations were named after the electron acceptor corresponding to certain depth intervals and amendment for example incubations from 0 1 cm without pw and synthetic pw were named o2 control no3 control while slurries with pw or synthetic pw were called o2 pw no3 pw or o2 synthetic pw no3 synthetic pw table s2 parallel anoxic incubations no3 synthetic pw acetate fe synthetic pw acetate and so4 2 synthetic pw acetate were amended with acetate in a concentration of 1 5 mmol l to investigate co metabolic degradations of btex table s2 for oxic incubations with sediment from 0 1 cm o2 control o2 pw and o2 synthetic pw pure o2 gas was added to the headspace at the onset of incubation o2 concentrations in both oxic and anoxic incubations were monitored with non invasive optical oxygen sensors pyroscience germany to stimulate no3 reduction in the anoxic slurries with sediment from 0 1 cm no3 control no3 pw no3 synthetic pw and no3 synthetic pw acetate no3 was added to an end concentration of 3 mmol l throughout the incubations no3 concentrations were measured and maintained above 0 9 mmol l through additional spikes of no3 sediment from 1 4 cm was incubated with feooh addition fe control fe synthetic pw and fe synthetic pw acetate and without feooh addition fe control and fe synthetic pw the concentrations of poorly crystalline fe iii and particulate fe ii were 2 5 0 8 µmol cm3 and 12 0 2 5 µmol cm3 respectively before the amendment with feooh the concentration of poorly crystalline fe iii was increased by a factor of 10 38 table s2 to ensure fe reduction throughout the entire incubations as the concentration of so4 2 was 21 mmol l at the onset of incubation with pooled sediment from 4 10 cm so4 2 control so4 2 synthetic pw and so4 2 synthetic pw acetate there was no need to stimulate so4 2 reduction with additional spike of so4 2 sediment slurries were incubated on shakers 2 2 1 sediment porewater sampling and analysis the temporal pattern of btex concentrations as well as aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation processes were followed for 35 d table s3 subsampling from the sediment slurry incubations was initiated 5 h after amendments where only trace amount of o2 from the amendments was left 1 7 µm in anoxic incubations and repeated on nine following occasions t0 t9 throughout the incubation period table s3 sampling from the anoxic sediment slurries and handling of porewater were performed under n2 atmosphere in a glove bag subsamples of sediment slurry were centrifuged 4000 rpm for 10 15 min at 4 c and the supernatant was filtered 0 22 µm pore diameter polypropylene filters under n2 atmosphere the conservation of porewater samples was described in supplementary materials section s1 co2 was measured by flow injection with conductivity detection hall and aller 1992 dissolved hydrogen sulfide h2s was measured colorimetrically using the methylene blue method cline 1969 while so4 2 was quantified by suppressed anion chromatography dionex dissolved fe2 was quantified colorimetrically using ferrozine without reducing agent stookey 1970 thamdrup et al 1994 an air segmented continuous flow analyzer skalar san netherlands was used for colorimetric analysis of nh4 nitrite no2 and nox i e no2 no3 2 2 2 sediment characteristics and solid phase analysis separate samples of sediment slurry were taken from each bottle under n2 on several occasions during the incubation for the determination of ph btex sulfate reduction rates srr solid phase fe pools and density water content porosity ph was monitored by a ph probe wtw gmbh weilheim germany porosity was calculated by multiplying wet density weight of a known volume and water content weight loss after drying at 105 c for 24 h subsamples of sediment slurry for btex analysis were extracted immediately with hexane containing fluorobenzene as internal standard in septum capped glass vials after 18 h of mixing in a rotator the hexane phase was extracted and frozen in 1 8 ml glass vials until analysis btex concentrations were quantified by headspace mass spectrometry coupled to gas chromatography gc ms agilent technologies rates of so4 2 reduction were quantified using 35so4 2 tracer method jørgensen 1978 separate samples of sediment slurry 5 ml were added to 10 ml serum bottles which were plugged with gas tight stoppers and incubated anoxically at 10 c after the addition of 35so4 2 tracer after 6 h in the dark the samples were fixed in 5 ml of 20 zinc acetate and stored frozen until distillation the reduced 35s pools were recovered by single step distillation with boiling acidic cr2 solution fossing and barker 1989 concentrations of solid phase fe iii and fe ii pools were determined through cold hcl extraction kostka and luther 1994 this assay extracts poorly crystalline fe iii oxides and particulate fe ii such as fes and feco3 canfield et al 1993b thamdrup et al 1994 extractions were performed with 10 ml extractant and 100 mg wet sediment for 1 h under shaking in the dark the concentrations of the oxidation stages of fe were determined colorimetrically using a ferrozine solution 50 mmol l hepes 0 08 ferrozine ph 7 with and without 1 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride for quantification of total fe and fe ii respectively canfield et al 1993b 2 3 calculation of rates total carbon oxidation rates and btex degradation rates were calculated from the slope of linear regression of porewater co2 accumulation and total btex concentrations versus time respectively volumetric rates nmol c cm3 d were calculated instead of mass rates to evaluate the potential of using the seafloor as a biofilter to remove organic components in produced water sulfate reduction rates were calculated from the fraction of reduced sulfur produced and the concentration of so4 2 as described in fossing and barker 1989 after the correction by subtracting 35s recovered from distillation of sediment fixed immediately in zinc acetate after injection of the tracer assuming an overall stoichiometry of 2 molar of organic carbon oxidized per 1 molar of so4 2 reduced the difference between total carbon oxidation and carbon oxidation coupled to so4 2 reduction gave a measurement of carbon oxidation coupled to other anaerobic respiration pathways as o2 was undetectable in the anoxic incubations fig 1 b 2 4 chemical fingerprint analysis a chemical fingerprint analysis of naturally occurring and pw organic components was performed on the oxic incubation o2 pw fingerprint and anoxic incubation with no3 no3 pw fingerprint due to the high amount of sample needed for this analysis these two incubations were run in parallel to the aforementioned incubations of o2 pw and no3 pw table s2 slurry samples taken at the beginning t0 and end of incubation t9 were acidified with 6 mol l hcl to ph 1 3 to reduce microbial activity and stored at 4 c until analysis the sample preparation workflow was designed to target water soluble and oxygen containing organics e g carboxylic acids and alcohols these are the dominant classes of compounds present in produced water after removal of any dispersed oil bergfors et al 2020 samanipour et al 2020 sørensen et al 2019 strømgren et al 1995 the chemical fingerprint of the extracted samples was analyzed using an agilent 7890b gc coupled to a 7200b qtof high resolution mass spectrometer common and unique features were evaluated using the investigator software the details of sample preparation and qtof high resolution mass spectrometer were listed in supplementary materials section s2 2 5 toxicity tests the focus of the toxicity experiments was to investigate the effects of untreated and treated pw on the mortality and physiology of the coastal copepod a tonsa i e egg and fecal pellet production the ingestion was evaluated by the quantification of fecal pellet production while the egg production rate was used as proxy for reproduction experimental details of toxicity tests including the cultivation of a tonsa estimation of lethal concentration 50 lc50 of untreated pw and synthetic pw and median effective concentration ec50 of untreated and treated pw for egg and pellet production were described in supplementary materials section s3 and tables s4 s5 3 results and discussions 3 1 total carbon oxidation based on solid phase and porewater chemistry the main diagenetic reactions occurring in the sediment incubations can be inferred concentrations of co2 h2co3 hco3 co3 2 increased linearly during the first 355 h of incubations indicating constant rates of organic material oxidation figs 1a s1 quantification of total carbon oxidation rates from accumulation of co2 in porewater over time can be effected by carbonate precipitation or dissolution caco3 feco3 and mnco3 jensen et al 2005 thamdrup et al 2000 during anoxic incubations co2 and nh4 accumulated in parallel with good linearity of co2 versus nh4 concentrations for each incubation r2 0 84 data not shown examples of nh4 accumulation were shown in fig s2 also ph values 7 2 8 2 were stable over time in all incubations and within the typical range of marine sediments excluding substantial carbonate precipitations the carbon oxidation rates in the control incubations agreed with the total carbon oxidation rates previously reported in short term sediment incubations from the baltic north sea transition 10 574 nmol c cm3 d table 1 canfield et al 1993a 1993b jensen et al 2005 the highest total carbon oxidation rates were obtained in the oxic control incubations and the anoxic control incubations with no3 corresponding well with higher rates in the surface of marine sediments table 1 jensen et al 2005 the availability of organic material tends to decrease with depth which is reflected in lower carbon oxidation rates with depth table 1 jensen et al 2005 in the incubations with o2 and no3 the amendment with pw enhanced the total carbon oxidation rates by a factor of 1 8 and 3 7 respectively compared to the controls there were no significant differences in the total carbon oxidation rates between synthetic pw amended incubations and controls p 0 05 unpaired t test the addition of acetate stimulated mineralization rates in the anoxic incubations by a factor of 3 4 compared to the unamended incubations p 0 05 unpaired t test table 1 a previous study of carbon oxidation pathways in sediments of the baltic north sea transition showed that one of the five carbon oxidation pathways i e heterotrophic o2 respiration denitrification mn iv fe or so4 2 reduction can be dominant at a given site as the different respiration pathways are affected by various different environmental factors such as water depth rate of sedimentation and sediment type rysgaard et al 2001 in our experimental setup we aimed to stimulate one mineralization pathway over the others to look at the potential biodegradation of produced water components under different redox regimes in the oxic incubations o2 control o2 pw and o2 synthetic pw dissolved o2 concentrations gradually decreased from 206 2 µmol cm3 to 164 12 µmol cm3 during the initial incubation period of 355 h and to 35 3 µmol l at the end of incubations fig 1b the decrease in dissolved o2 concentration with time was partly caused by heterotrophic o2 respiration organic carbon decomposition as indicated by the simultaneous co2 accumulation and o2 consumption figs 1 s1 table 1 in addition o2 was consumed by the reoxidation of reduced inorganic metabolites associated with respiration e g nh4 and h2s in the anoxic incubations amended with no3 plots of co2 versus no3 yielded a c n ratio 0 73 0 13 n 4 data not shown close to 0 80 in agreement with the theoretical stoichiometry from the biodegradation of organic carbon through denitrification canfield et al 2005 the addition of feooh generally suppressed the carbon oxidation coupled to so4 2 reduction compared to unamended incubations without feooh addition table 1 the divergence of total carbon oxidation and so4 2 based carbon oxidation in the incubations amended with feooh implied that other anaerobic respiration pathways were important the excess carbon oxidation was assigned to microbial fe reduction due to i in the anoxic control incubations o2 remained undetectable implying there was no contamination with o2 in the anoxic incubations fig 1b ii no no3 was detected throughout the entire incubation period in any of the incubations from 1 4 cm with and without feooh detection limit of 10 µmol l data now shown iii the concentration of reactive mnox is often low below 1 cm depth jensen et al 2003 iv large pools of poorly crystalline fe iii were measured in the incubations with feooh amendment i e fe control fe synthetic pw and fe synthetic pw acetate while smaller pools were observed in the incubations with unamended sediment from the same depth i e fe control and fe synthetic pw fig 2 a v the role of fe reduction was partly supported by the accumulation of soluble fe2 in the porewater fig 2b the much lower concentrations of soluble fe2 over solid fe ii and co2 in the incubations indicated rapid adsorption or precipitation of fe2 ions e g fes taking all together a large fraction of the anaerobic decomposition of organic material was conveyed by fe reduction in the incubations amended with feooh 50 80 in fe control fe synthetic pw and fe synthetic pw acetate and fe reduction was therefore inferred as the main carbon oxidation pathway table 1 fe reduction was of minor importance in incubations without feooh amendment using sediment from 1 4 cm fe control and fe synthetic pw although the total fe content was relatively high fig 2a table 1 fe iii was present yet in low concentrations and while dissolved fe2 accumulated in the porewater in fe control and fe synthetic pw fe2 remained undetectable during the entire period of so4 2 incubations with sediments from 4 10 cm fig 2 in addition rates of carbon oxidation and so4 2 reduction converted to carbon units were similar implying that so4 2 reduction was the main anaerobic carbon oxidation pathway in the rest of anoxic incubations with subsurface sediment 65 100 in fe control fe synthetic pw so4 2 control so4 2 synthetic pw and so4 2 synthetic pw acetate table 1 3 2 btex biodegradation and the role of btex in organic matter mineralization as btex are known human carcinogens and highly toxic to a variety of living organisms the removal of these contaminants is of great importance dean 1985 the biodegradation of btex compounds is feasible under both oxic and anoxic conditions in the presence of various electron acceptors e g o2 no3 feooh and so4 2 burland and edwards 1999 lovley et al 1996 1995 in this study significant btex removals were observed in all incubations figs 3 s3 biodegradation was considered the main removal process for btex in our sediment incubations while removal through volatilization and or adsorption was expected to be negligible as btex concentrations remained stable after the fast degradation within 284 h figs 3 s3 also the applied hexane extraction on sediment samples detached efficiently any adsorbed btex from solids in sediment as confirmed by the high recovery efficiencies of internal standards 99 3 we observed rapid biodegradations of btex compounds with minimum rates of 52 57 nmolc cm3 d in oxic incubations and 14 149 nmolc cm3 d in anoxic incubations figs 3 s3 table 1 the highest biodegradation efficiencies were obtained by incubations with o2 93 97 and no3 85 93 followed by fe reduction 53 56 and so4 2 reduction 45 76 figs 3 s3 for oxic incubations the btex biodegradation rates were 57 32 nmolc cm3 d for pw and 52 1 6 nmolc cm3 d for synthetic pw table 1 the fast btex biodegradation observed in the oxic incubations was consistent with observations in previous pure culture experiments with aerobic heterotrophic bacteria where btex compounds were readily degraded under oxic conditions with rates ranging from 0 6 to 17 mmolc l d hocinat et al 2020 jin et al 2013 morlett chávez et al 2010 robledo ortíz et al 2011 xin et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 during aerobic btex biodegradation the compounds are initially converted into catechol intermediates via direct oxidation of the aromatic ring catalyzed by monooxygenases kahng et al 2001 or dioxygenase zylstra and gibson 1989 then the produced catechol intermediates undergo ring cleavage by catechol 1 2 dioxygenase or catechol 3 4 dioxygenase in the β ketoadipate pathways to krebs cycle intermediates el naas et al 2014 in our study aerobic btex biodegradation contributed to 20 35 of total carbon oxidation table 1 this is consistent with previous studies on aerobic btex biodegradation where 33 of benzene was converted to co2 in hypersaline soils nicholson and fathepure 2005 while 34 89 of the carbon from toluene was recovered as co2 and biomass using marinobacter vinifirmus in a pure culture study berlendis et al 2010 both no3 burland and edwards 1999 cunningham et al 2001 fe iii lovley et al 1996 villatoro monzón et al 2003 and so4 2 reducing bacteria cunningham et al 2001 lovley et al 1995 have been connected to anaerobic btex biodegradation here we found the highest btex biodegradation rates in the presence of no3 as terminal electron acceptor such as 104 and 149 nmolc cm3 d for no3 amended incubations with pw and synthetic pw respectively figs 3 s3 table 1 this was up to 5 and 10 times faster than rates in incubations dominated by fe iii and so4 2 reduction respectively figs 3 s3 table 1 similarly more efficient anaerobic btex biodegradations up to 4 times higher rates have been reported under no3 compared to under fe iii and so4 2 reducing conditions using bacterial enrichments obtained from gasoline contaminated soils and sediments cunningham et al 2001 dou et al 2008 phelps and young 1999 according to thermodynamic principles higher reaction energy can be obtained during btex degradation when utilizing no3 as electron acceptor compared to fe iii and so4 2 dou et al 2008 ulrich and edwards 2003 for instance standard free energy changes g of benzene oxidation with no3 as the electron acceptor is 2990 kj mol while it is 2660 kj mol and 200 kj mol for fe iii and so4 2 respectively ulrich and edwards 2003 therefore no3 is a more favorable electron acceptor than fe iii and so4 2 for btex biodegradation aromatic compounds like btex can be anaerobically degraded via benzoyl coa resorcinol phloroglucinol hydroxyhydroquinone and possibly other pathways involving reactions of carboxylation methylation and hydroxylation bin et al 2002 godin et al 2020 harwood et al 1998 during biodegradation coupled to no3 reduction btex compounds were potentially mineralized to co2 accounting for 25 98 of total carbon oxidation table 1 the relative contribution to total carbon mineralization estimated for no3 synthetic pw 98 in our study was in well agreement with previous experiments with enrichment cultures from soil and groundwater where approximately 92 95 of benzene was recovered in co2 during anaerobic biodegradation linked to no3 reduction burland and edwards 1999 results in previous studies further suggested that during anaerobic benzene biodegradation no3 could be stoichiometrically reduced to no2 and further to n2 with the reduction of no2 to n2 being the rate limiting steps burland and edwards 1999 ulrich and edwards 2003 in our experiments capacities and rates of btex biodegradation in both incubations with pw and synthetic pw were comparable for incubations with o2 and no3 figs 3 s3 table 1 the addition of acetate increased the total mineralization rates but did not facilitate any potential co metabolic degradations of btex table 1 possible explanation could be that microorganisms present were able to metabolically degrade btex as an energy and or carbon source el naas et al 2014 weelink et al 2010 or the co metabolic activities were not limited by organic carbons due to the availability of other easily degradable carbon sources in the sediment canfield et al 2005 there was likely a decrease in nitrification activity during oxic incubations with pw and synthetic pw as indicated by nh4 accumulation and lower no3 production over time compared to the control incubation examples given in fig s2 autotrophic ammonia oxidizers are able to co metabolically degrade certain organic molecules including various hydrocarbons through their key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo su et al 2021 yet they are sensitive to the toxicity of hydrocarbons caused by noncompetitive and competitive inhibitions on amo su et al 2021 in fact ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea were 100 and 1000 times respectively more sensitive than typical heterotrophs to hydrocarbon toxicity urakawa et al 2019 2012 our results showed that the functional heterotrophic microorganisms were not inhibited by btex or other toxic compounds in pw as indicated by 1 8 3 7 times higher total carbon oxidation rates obtained in pw amended incubations with o2 and no3 compared to the controls figs 3 s3 table 1 3 3 chemical fingerprint before and after biodegradations more than 1000 compounds were detected by non target screening at the beginning and end of pw incubations with o2 and no3 as electron acceptors a subset of approximately 100 compounds were tentatively identified via a library search nist library 2017 match factor 700 degradation of btex type compounds was assumed to produce oxygenated analogs e g carboxylic acids and alcohols as intermediates during the mineralization chakraborty and coates 2004 gibson et al 1968 meckenstock et al 2004 yoshikawa et al 2017 the presence of these intermediates can be utilized as an indicator of the overall degradation progress among the analyzed samples taken at the beginning t0 and end t9 of the oxic incubation with pw o2 pw fingerprint the identified compounds were mainly classified as alcohols and acids fig 4 a some pahs were detected in low amounts with no significant differences between the samples taken at t0 and t9 fig 4a interestingly there was a large proportion of phenol and its alkylated analogs at the onset of oxic incubation t0 which were not detected at the end of oxic incubation t9 fig 4a instead the slurry sample at t9 contained a larger proportion of c6 to c10 linear carboxylic acids and alcohols fig 4a these linear carboxylic acids and alcohols were likely biodegradation products formed by stepwise oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons to phenols followed by ring opening and reduction fig 4c the reactions proposed based on chemical fingerprint corresponded to the aerobic biodegradation pathway suggested for btex i e stepwise oxidation and cleavage of aromatic ring performed by monooxygenases and or dioxygenase under oxic conditions the ratios of long versus short carboxylic acids did not show evident trends this was in line with the fact that produced water is a highly complex mixture of natural chemicals and biodegradation products bergfors et al 2020 incomplete biodegradation could be a plausible explanation of the high richness of organics in the treated samples another indication of stepwise degradation pathways was the presence of benzenebutanoic acid at the beginning of oxic incubation t0 which was missing at the end of oxic incubation t9 fig 4a in contrast the abundance of benzenepropanoic benzeneacetic and benzoic acids increased at t9 these results indicated a preference for saturated decarboxylation followed by oxidation over ring opening type reactions fig 4c however more research is required to clarify the exact biodegradation mechanisms the comparison of biodegradation products formed during oxic and anoxic incubations demonstrated that the chromatogram of the slurry sample after oxic incubation o2 pw fingerprint at t9 was heavily populated in the low retention time region in both dimensions while the proportion intensity for anoxic incubation amended with no3 no3 pw fingerprint at t9 was slightly shifted to higher retention time region fig 4b in simplified terms an increase in retention time corresponded to an increase in the boiling point size and polarity fig 4b the region marked in green primarily contained smaller alcohols acids e g butanoic acid octanol and cyclohexanol while the region marked in red was dominated by aromatic acids e g terephthalic acid toluic acid and 3 4 dimethylbenzoic acid fig 4b these compounds were potential intermediates during the degradation of alkylated phenols mei et al 2019 van schie and young 2000 thus a larger number of small molecules were produced during aerobic biodegradation whereas anaerobic biodegradation resulted in higher concentrations of uncleaved aromatics o2 seemed to facilitate a more complete degradation process the result was in agreement with the previous observation in marine sediments where aerobic mineralization of complex organic material was 2 3 times faster than that under anoxic conditions kristensen et al 1995 the relatively incomplete decomposition in the anoxic zones of most sediments can be explained by the limited ability of anaerobic microorganisms to hydrolyze certain classes of structurally complex and aromatic organic compounds kristensen et al 1995 3 4 toxicity analysis according to the toxicity tests on a tonsa lc50 was 22 for untreated pw i e dilution factor of 4 5 and 8 for untreated and concentrated synthetic pw i e dilution factor of 12 5 which was equal to 4 6 and 2451 µmol l of btex in pw and synthetic pw respectively fig 5 a b furthermore untreated pw also inhibited egg and pellet production of a tonsa with ec50 values of 0 4 and 0 7 respectively fig 5c d the lower ec50 values than lc50 values indicated that egg and pellet production of copepods were more sensitive than mortality to untreated pw which were consistent with previous toxicity tests of pahs and antifouling biocides on a tonsa bellas and thor 2007 wendt et al 2016 compared to untreated pw higher ec50 values of egg and pellet production were estimated for treated o2 pw i e 0 8 and 1 respectively and no3 pw 1 and 1 3 respectively thus toxic effects of produced water on the physiology of a tonsa were reduced by half after microbial treatments since btex type compounds were efficiently removed in both oxic and anoxic incubations figs 3 s3 the remaining toxicity of treated pw on a tonsa might be related to other compounds such as pahs which was detected in low amounts with no significant removal during incubations fig 4a or chemical additives biocides corrosion inhibitors etc dosed in drilling to prevent operational problems and enhance oil water separation fakhru l razi et al 2009 jiménez et al 2018 a toxicity identification evaluation is needed in future studies 3 5 practical implications our study demonstrated the feasibility of using bacteria naturally harboring in marine sediments as an efficient and sustainable option for treating certain components in produced water on the basis of btex removal rates measured in no3 amended incubations we estimated the hydraulic retention time hrt of produced water in a continuous flow biofilter system for complete removal of the individual btex compounds i e below the analytical detection limits of 0 3 0 3 0 2 and 0 2 0 5 µmol l for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes respectively table s6 a hrt of 1 day is needed to remove btex in 1000 l of produced water passing through a sediment filter of 1 m3 with no3 as the electron acceptor in the light of these findings we propose to use marine sediment as a biofilter where produced water could be distributed through perforated submerged horizontal tubes fig 6 the tubes would serve as flow distributors allowing an upflow of produced water through the overlying sediment produced water should be supplied with favorable electron acceptors o2 and no3 as these only penetrate mm to cm into the sediment and the reduction would exceed the natural supply produced water would be subject to continuous microbial degradations along with the upward movement through the seabed a continuous mode would reduce the mass transfer resistance associated with batch incubations allowing a more effective contact between dissolved pollutant and microorganisms which are mainly associated with the solid phases of the sediment the depth and cross sectional area of discharge flow distribution at discharge that determines the effective flow volume combined with the actual discharge rate will determine the actual hrt before full scale implementation a pilot scale biofilter reactor with sediments from an area closer to the oil platform should be operated over a long period of time this would allow for a better understanding of long term performance design optimization and validation adaptation and proliferation of the microbial community in addition to the actual impact on the benthic fauna the development of a diagnostic tool for effective measurements of cleaning efficiency is also required for future application 4 conclusions the present study examined the feasibility and capability of using marine sediments for the bioremediation of produced water we obtained significant btex removals in a series of sediment batch incubations under different redox conditions with biodegradation efficiencies of 93 97 in oxic incubations and 45 93 in no3 fe and so4 2 amended anoxic incubations higher biodegradation rates of btex were obtained by incubations dominated by no3 reduction 104 149 nmolc cm3 d and o2 respiration 52 57 nmolc cm3 d followed by so4 2 reduction 14 76 nmolc cm3 d and fe reduction 29 39 nmolc cm3 d chemical fingerprint analysis suggested that the presence of o2 facilitated a more complete biodegradation process as hydrocarbons were found to be biodegraded to smaller alcohols acids under oxic conditions compared to anoxic conditions with no3 toxicity of treated produced water to the marine copepod a tonsa was reduced by half after sediment incubations with o2 and no3 the results advance our understanding of hydrocarbon biodegradation under different redox conditions in marine sediments and highlight the option to use marine sediment as a biofilter for treating produced water at sea without extending the oil and gas platform or implementing a large scale construction

15957,electrode materials occupy most of the construction cost of the microbial electrochemical system mes and the low mechanical strength and poor electrochemical performance of the commonly used traditional carbon based materials restrict the promotion and application of this technology in this study polymer based three dimensional 3d honeycomb structure hs materials with good mechanical properties were used as supporting materials graphene gr carbon nanotube cnt and polypyrrole ppy was separately chosen as a surface conductivity coating layer for preparing mes anodes the introduction of gr cnt and ppy on hs increased surface roughness hydrophilicity o and n content electrochemically active surface area and decreased charge transfer internal resistance which promoted the adhesion of microorganisms on their surface and enhanced the extracellular electron transfer process at the electrode microbe interface the cnt hs anode system got the better maximal power density 1700 7 149 0 mw m2 of the three modified anode systems and 3 60 times that of mes using cc 471 8 27 2 mw m2 as the anode the accelerated reactions of the redox species in the outer cell membrane the promoted electron shuttle secretion and the enhanced abundance of the tricarboxylic acid cycle related functional genes in biofilm led to better performance of the cnt hs anode system the cnt hs anode system

keywords microbial electrochemical system honeycomb structure polymer hs based anode graphene carbon nanotube and polypyrrole cost effectiveness extracellular electron transfer 1 introduction the microbial electrochemical system mes is an environmental friendly device utilizing microorganisms as catalysts to remove pollutants for electricity generation and has been explored for more than 40 years suzuki 1976 microorganisms produce carbon dioxide protons and electrons by metabolizing organic matter in an anodic anaerobic environment bennetto et al 1983 stirling et al 1983 due to the rich organics content of wastewater mes was used to perform wastewater treatment 30 years ago habermann and pommer 1991 after long term development mes has been proven to be an effective domestic wastewater treatment technology and the energy consumption was much lower than that of conventional wastewater treatment technology feng et al 2014 he et al 2019 rossi et al 2022 therefore mes technology has been gradually promoted and applied in contaminants remediation and wastewater treatment dong et al 2019 li et al 2017a liang et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 usually in mes the anode provides sites for eab attachment and the acceptor of extracellular electrons significantly influencing system performance li et al 2020a therefore the anode material is essential for the application of mes technology traditional carbon based materials such as carbon cloth carbon brush and carbon mesh have been widely applied as anode material in mes feng et al 2010 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2009 many studies have also been devoted to improving the microbial extracellular electron transfer eet efficiency and system performance such as introducing transmembrane material cao et al 2021 yang et al 2020 electrode surface treatment feng et al 2010 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2009 and material modification li et al 2020c 2021 carbon based nanomaterials graphene gr and carbon nanotube cnt and conductive polymers polypyrrole ppy are considered candidates for anode materials owing to their excellent conductivity high surface area and good biocompatibility sonawane et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xie et al 2011 however their powder like characteristic is not conducive to direct use as mes freestanding electrodes researchers tried to combine these materials with some supporting materials to construct freestanding anodes to pursue better system performance yang et al loaded gr and ppy on glassy carbon by cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition the introduction of gr and ppy increased microbial affinity and eet efficiency and the maximal current density of the system with the modified anode 4 10 0 02 ma cm 2 was 8 times higher than that of the control anode 0 51 0 03 ma cm 2 yang et al 2019 zhao et al prepared anodes by loading cnt and ppy on a carbon brush cb the modified anode system obtained a shorter start up time 200 h and higher power output 1876 62 mw m 2 than the unmodified cb anode system 350 h and 713 26 mw m 2 zhao et al 2019 another study case by li et al used gr modified carbon cloth cc as an mes anode the wrinkled structure and excellent electrochemical activity of the modified anode made increased the maximal power density by about 725 mw m2 li et al 2020c gr cnt and ppy were fully exploited on carbon brush carbon cloth or glassy carbon and super system performance was achieved however the above mentioned modification processes electrodeposition calcine are generally complicated and hard to large scale prepare the supporting material such as glassy carbon carbon brush or carbon cloth is also expensive and fragile considering practical applications kumar et al 2013 wang et al 2009 so focused on system scaling up and application it is necessary to develop a simple and easy to prepare anode modification method with less expensive supporting material polymer based three dimensional 3d honeycomb structure hs materials processed by polyethylene were widely used in geotechnical applications and environmental remediation hegde 2017 vibhoosha et al 2021 the hs material has good mechanical strength and a large surface area with low cost yet the conductivity of this material was low and cannot be applied for mes anodes li et al 2017a li et al 2017b therefore it is significant to develop high performance hs based conductive anode materials based on retaining the excellent characteristics of hs to improve the performance of hs material gr cnt and ppy were loaded on hs supporting material to form a conductive coating layer thus three kinds of conductive layer loaded hs based material were fabricated and applied as mes anode tensile strength sem surface roughness xps contact angle zeta potential and resistivity tests were

anodic chamber once the voltage dropped to 50 mv in batch feed mode the voltage time curve was monitored for more than six months to evaluate the long term operational performance of anode materials 1000 ω external resistance three parallel reactors were operated for each anode as duplicate tests all the reactors were operated under anaerobic conditions at 29 1 c domestic wastewater used in this experiment was collected from the municipal sewer tube harbin institute of technology harbin china the ionic conductivity of influent wastewater was about 0 98 0 13 ms cm while the ph value was about 7 2 0 1 the influent cod concentration was 284 8 5 mg l 2 3 analytical methods and characterization of anode material the mechanical strength of hs and cc were tested by an electronic universal

germany tian et al 2022 the total nitrogen tn was tested by a total nitrogen analyzer n5 665 n analytik jena ag germany 2 4 morphology biomass of anodic biofilm and bacterial community analysis the characterization of anodic biofilm was observed by sem please refer to supplementary materials for preparation process li et al 2021 before observing the long term stability of hs based anode by sem the biofilm was removed by washing with deionized water and ultrasound for 30 min the biomass of anodic biofilm was quantified with proteins which comprise 50 of biomass by dry weight li et al 2020b the protein content was tested by a bca protein kit modified bca protein assay kit sangon biotech shanghai co ltd china the community structure of each anodic biofilm was analyzed by 16s rrna based on high throughput sequencing sangon biotech shanghai co ltd china the pcr amplifications were conducted with the general primer 338f and 806r which amplified the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states 2 picrust2 was performed to predict tricarboxylic acid tca cycle metabolism genomics functional profiles based on 16s rrna gene data 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of anodes to illustrate the good mechanical strength of hs compared to cc the tensile strength of hs and cc were tested fig 1 a and b when the stretching distance reached 4 99 mm the cc material broke the corresponding maximum force was only 72 3 n however the hs material could withstand the maximum force of 672 0 n without breaking until the stretching distance was 20 00 mm furthermore the tensile strength of hs was calculated as 14 96 mpa which was 1 86 times that of cc 8 03 mpa the excellent mechanical strength of hs material has the potential to be used in various environmental conditions without worrying about the risk of damage compared to cc then the morphologies of different anodes were observed by sem as shown in fig 1f the surface of the original hs supporting material was smooth and clean which showed the minimum surface roughness of 1 59 0 59 μm fig s1a b and table s3 after coating by gr cnt and ppy they were evenly covered on the hs material without agglomeration or shedding and the roughness was increased to 7 19 0 16 μm 8 98 0 16 μm and 5 79 0 03 μm respectively fig s1c h and table s3 in detail the gr hs anode exhibited a wrinkled surface and might be conducive to biofilm growth fig 1g after spraying carbon nanotube based paint on the surface of hs supporting material the cnt was loaded on the hs anode with good dispersion fig 1h a rough silk like film could be observed and this structure might be favorable for enriching bacteria the surface of the ppy hs anode was wrapped by homogeneous particles and formed a porous structure which might be beneficial to the enrichment of microorganisms fig 1i however the surface of cc was extremely smooth and clean with no impurities corresponding to lower surface roughness 2 45 0 37 μm fig 1j s1i j and table s3 mes anode needs to possess good conductivity to accept extracellular electrons and transfer electrons to the cathode the lower resistivity of the anode can reduce the power loss of electrons during the transport process and improve the system performance li et al 2022 hs supporting material was not conductive due to its plastic character however gr cnt and ppy loading hs based anodes exhibited a certain degree of conductivity the resistivity of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes were 2 30 0 97 mω cm 2 18 0 91 mω cm and 5 10 0 10 mω cm which were not much higher than cc anode 0 73 0 13 mω cm the kinds and content of elements on an anode surface significantly influence system performance more contents of o and n on an anode surface can improve hydrophilicity and biocompatibility li et al 2020a 2020b this is helpful to accumulate eab in anodic biofilm and enhance the system performance feng et al 2010 li et al 2020b wang et al 2009 the elemental analysis by xps supplied some information of element content and types of each anode shown in table 1 and fig 1c for cc anode the content of o and n was only 3 52 and 1 24 after spraying by two kinds of carbon nanomaterial paints the content of o and n for gr hs o from 13 06 to 16 99 n from 0 49 to 0 77 and cnt hs o from 13 06 to 15 90 n from 0 49 to 0 78 increased compared to hs for the ppy hs anode the o and n element content increased to 21 30 and 5 75 through the high resolution n1s spectrum pyrrolic n 400 1 ev and graphitic n 401 3 ev were the main nitrogen containing functional groups fig 1d pyrrolic n can effectively promote eab accumulation in anodic biofilm and graphitic n can help reduce surface resistance and improve the electron transfer process li et al 2020a therefore gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes have better biocompatibility than cc and original hs the hydrophilicity of the anode has a crucial influence on system performance because it affects the affinity between the biofilm and the anode li et al 2020b the hydrophilicity of different anodes was tested by contact angle measurement fig 1e the cc anode was hydrophobic due to the contact angle of 127 2 4 2 which is not favorable for bacterial adhesion and growth the o and n content of the original hs material increased after coating by gr cnt and ppy leading the corresponding contact angles were changed from 71 3 4 5 to 44 2 1 0 51 2 5 6 and 26 7 5 0 respectively the results indicated that gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes have better hydrophilicity than original hs and cc which are conducive to bacterial attachment and improve the electrochemical interaction at the anode microbe interface li et al 2020b 2020c the surface zeta potential is another important index to evaluate the mes anode more positive of the zeta potential of the anodic surface is conducive to the rapid enrichment of eab thus improving the system start up time and output performance zhao et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 the zeta potential measurements illustrated the changes in the surface characteristics of the anodes table s4 the zeta potential value of the cc anode was 19 7 2 5 mv which was similar to the hs anode 20 6 2 1 mv after coating by gr and cnt paints the zeta potential values of gr hs 17 4 1 2 mv and cnt hs 17 2 1 1 mv anodes were no apparent change however the ppy hs anode exhibited a more positive value 2 5 0 8 mv due to the formation of nitrogen containing functional groups on the surface wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2019 considering that the surface charge of the eab is usually negative zhong et al 2018 the ppy hs anode might enrich eab faster and shorten the start up time of the system 3 2 electrochemical measurement the electrochemically active of different anodes were estimated by the cv test under a three electrode system due to its non conductivity characteristic the original hs supporting material had almost no electrochemical activity fig s2 however the cv curves of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes exhibited good electrochemical activity after coating gr cnt and ppy on hs supporting material fig 2 a the peak current of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes was 1 56 ma 1 14 ma and 0 56 ma which were 10 4 7 6 and 3 7 times higher than that of cc anode 0 15 ma respectively a higher peak current corresponds to a larger electrochemically active surface area wang et al 2009 this indicated that gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes could provide more electrochemically active sites to complete bio electrochemical reactions which is beneficial to decrease the interfacial charge transfer resistance and enhance the interface electron transfer eis test of different anodes verified the above inference fig 2b according to the fitting results the charge transfer resistance r ct of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes were 2 32 0 05 ω 2 79 0 02 ω and 13 55 0 05 ω which were 86 3 83 5 and 20 0 lower than that of cc anode 16 93 0 06 ω the r ct represents the transport ability of electrons at the material interface logan 2008 the decrease in r ct could be ascribed to the good electrochemical activity of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs and lower r ct was beneficial to enhance electron transport and electronic interactions zhu et al 2020 zou et al 2019 the bio electrochemical performance of different anodes was evaluated in the mes inoculated by mixed culture the output voltage curve of mes equipped with the original hs anode is shown in fig s3 almost no voltage was produced due to its non conductive characteristic in contrast gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems exhibited good bio electrochemical performance fig 2c the produced maximal voltage of the gr hs anode system could reach 520 8 7 5 mv which was 18 3 higher than that of the cc anode system 440 3 23 1 mv this could be attributed to the excellent conductivity and good electrochemical activity of gr li et al 2020b the cnt hs anode system produced a better output voltage 586 0 10 6 mv than the cc anode system the enhanced voltage could be attributed to the excellent conductivity of cnt which was facilitated by the electron transfer process at the electrode microbe interface li et al 2020a furthermore the ppy hs anode system obtained a higher maximal output voltage 469 0 17 3 mv than the cc anode system with a shorter start up time 85 h this could be attributed to biocompatibility nontoxic and positive surface charge of ppy which could be conducive to the growth of eab and thus shorten the start up time of the system zhao et al 2019 power density and polarization curve tests further illustrated the bio electrochemical performances of mes with different anodes fig 2d the maximal power density of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems were 1084 4 81 3 mw m2 1700 7 149 0 mw m2 and 946 8 16 3 mw m2 2 29 3 60 and 2 01 times those of the cc anode system 471 8 27 2 mw m2 more importantly the obtained power density of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems were higher than previously reported systems equipped with gr cnt and ppy modified anodes table s5 this indicated the system performance was not affected by the hs supporting material and the excellent properties of gr cnt and ppy were well exploited on the hs supporting material furthermore the anodic and cathodic polarization curves gave the contribution of each electrode to the system performance fig 2e the polarization behavior of each cathode was almost the same but the polarization behavior of different anodes was significantly different that means the difference in power output of each system was caused by the over potential generated by anode polarization the lower polarization degree of the cnt hs anode led to higher power generation of the system the ce of each system further reflected the difference between each anode gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems demonstrated stronger abilities to convert organic substrate to electricity than the cc anode system fig 2f the ce of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems were 57 8 1 2 82 4 2 0 and 48 9 0 9 which were almost 20 2 44 8 and 11 3 higher than those of cc anode systems 37 6 2 0 respectively 3 3 performance of pollutants removal efficiency of mes with cnt hs anodes the cnt hs anode system was chosen to evaluate its ability to treat domestic wastewater due to its excellent bio electrochemical performance at the end of the operating cycle fed with sodium acetate the domestic wastewater was injected into the anodic chamber of the cnt hs system the effluent cod of three operating cycles under domestic wastewater feed was detected fig 3 a the calculated effluent cod concentration was 42 5 2 3 mg l which met the grade a standard of cod for municipal wastewater treatment plants in china 50 mg l this indicated that the cnt hs bioanode system could effectively remove cod in actual wastewater the change of n in the anodic chamber was also detected fig 3b interestingly the effluent tn concentration of each operating cycle 5 57 0 87 mg l could meet the grade a standard of tn for municipal wastewater treatment plants in china 15 mg l the initial form of nitrogen in domestic sewage is almost ammonia which means it is difficult to be metabolized in the anaerobic environment of the anodic chamber without an anammox process however the effluent ammonia and nitrate concentrations were only 3 54 0 80 mg l and 1 75 0 15 mg l no nitrite was detected combined with the community structure results section 3 4 this result was presumed to be the diffusion of ammonium ions through the cem into the cathode compartment to maintain ion balance based on previously reported similar phenomenon in two chamber mes systems kim et al 2007 kim et al 2008 therefore the removal mechanism of tn in this experiment mainly resulted from a physical process 3 4 enhancement mechanism analysis the eet process biomass community structure and functional genes prediction of biofilm were investigated to reveal the system enhancement mechanism indirect electron transfer iet mediated by electron shuttle and direct electron transfer det via outer membrane c type cytochromes om c cyts are the two main eet processes zhang et al 2017a the non turnover and turnover cvs tests of different anodic biofilm revealed the eet process of different systems li et al 2020c the non turnover cv curve of the cc anode had two pairs of characteristic redox peaks fig 4 a which are similar in shape to electroactive biofilms in previously reported studies hu et al 2019 liu et al 2008 these two redox pairs are omcz outer membrane c type cytochrome z formal potentials around 0 41 v vs sce and omcb outer membrane c type cytochrome b formal potentials around 0 33 v vs sce which are two major om c cyts essential for det between bacteria and anode in mess inoue et al 2010 richter et al 2009 for gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes similar redox peaks were observed and increased current were obtained the redox peak current intensity is related to the electrocatalytic activity of redox species in anodic biofilms liu et al 2005 this indicated the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the gr cnt and ppy improved the det process at the anode microbe interface in addition gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes exhibited a weak redox peak with formal potential around 0 12 v corresponding to the electrochemical response of the binding of om c cyts and flavins okamoto et al 2014 this indicated that the gr cnt and ppy could manifest the flavins bound om c cyts mediated electron transfer at the microbe anode interface compared to the cc the cvs under turnover condition further supported the above results distinct redox peaks were exhibited in each anode consistent with the catalytic oxidation of sodium acetate li et al 2020c fig 4b the peak current of the gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes was 1 14 ma 1 33 ma and 1 09 ma which were 1 29 1 51 and 1 24 times those of the cc anode 0 88 ma respectively the increased current resulted from the enhanced catalytic activity on the anodic surface the electrochemical dynamic behaviors of each anode were analyzed by the cv at scan rates of 5 25 mv s 1 the anodic and cathodic peak current increased with the scan rate for four anodes fig 4c j a good linear relationship between scan rates and the peak current was obtained for each anode the results indicated that the electrochemical reactions on the four anodes were typical surface controlled processes therefore the electron transfer process for each anode was dominated by det according to the results of pure geobacter species biofilm fed with acetate liang et al 2021 after the end of the experiment the biofilm morphologies were observed by sem fig s4 a large number of microorganisms were observed on gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes the measured biomass for gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes was 660 5 4 7 μg cm2 850 6 2 9 μg cm2 and 541 9 4 0 μg cm2 which were 2 14 2 76 and 1 76 times than those of cc anode 308 3 2 6 μg cm2 respectively the greater amount of biomass on three hs based anodes could be due to increased surface hydrophilicity and surface roughness fig s5 providing a suitable interface environment for the attached bacteria the bacterial community of anodic biofilms for different anodes was analyzed by high throughput sequencing the bacterial community structure on the phylum level showed a noticeable difference fig s6 the proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and ignavibacteriae were the significant components in four anodic biofilms on phylum level proteobacteria and firmicutes were considered potential exoelectrogens to produce bioelectricity du et al 2017 li et al 2020b the total abundances of two typical phyla for gr hs cnt hs ppy hs and cc were 83 72 91 37 75 56 and 40 71 corresponding to the performance of the four systems the bacterial community compositions on the genus level are shown in fig 5 a geobacter is a typical eab with strong extracellular electron transfer ability li et al 2020a logan et al 2019 the abundance of geobacter in cnt hs anodic biofilm was 16 55 which was higher than gr hs 12 58 and cc 0 42 anodic biofilms but lower than ppy hs 25 09 anodic biofilm the better accumulation ability of geobacter in ppy hs anodic biofilm might be attributed to its more positive potential which is conducive to enriching the eab with a negative charge zhao et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 the corresponding anodic biomass of geobacter for gr hs cnt hs ppy hs and cc was calculated as 166 18 1 17 μg 281 55 0 95 μg 271 93 1 96 μg and 2 59 0 02 μg respectively accumulating more geobacter might be the main reason for improving the process of eet and induced gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems better bio electrochemical performance than cc anode system a certain number of aquamicrobium 2 80 chryseobacterium 1 66 petrimonas 0 88 and azoarcus 0 13 genus were also found in cnt hs anodic biofilm many strains in these genera can degrade complex organic matters xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b zhao and zhang 2021 which is why the cnt hs anode system can efficiently degrade cod in actual wastewater bacteria related to geobacter species through oxidizing acetate via the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle to generate electricity play a significant role in system bio electrochemical performance mahadevan et al 2006 to further comprehend the enhanced performance of the hs based anode system functional gene abundances related to the tca cycle were predicted with picrust2 based on 16 s rrna gene abundance combined with the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database fig 5b the abundance of tca cycle related genes in the cnt hs sample was the highest in all samples which was increased by 1 13 1 27 times than that in the cc sample this indicated carbon nanotube might help enhance microbial metabolic activity the higher genes expression abundance in anodic biofilm leads to the better performance of the cnt hs anode system according to the results mentioned above hs material can be used as supporting material to prepare mes anodes the excellent characteristics of gr cnt and ppy could be well maintained and exploited on hs supporting material taking cnt hs anode as an example the performance enhancement mechanism of the cnt hs system is shown in fig 5c after spaying cnt based paint on hs supporting material the surface characteristics and conductivity were improved simultaneously cnt accelerated the tca cycle the reactions of the redox species in microorganisms det process and promoted flavin secretion iet process as different om c cyts during the det process omcz is responsible for electron transfer between biofilm and substrate in the medium and omcb for that between microbe anode interface hu et al 2019 therefore both the substrate metabolism process and the det process were enhanced simultaneously increased electrochemically active surface area of cnt hs anode could accept more extracellular electrons and flavin generated by eab with these contributions the cnt hs anode system exhibited excellent bio electrochemical performance 3 5 long term stability of cnt hs anode the long term stability of the cnt hs anode was evaluated for more than six months with periodic medium exchange fig 6 a after operation for more than six months the maximal output voltage of the system dropped only 3 2 from 594 mv to 575 mv after removing the surface biofilm the morphology of the cnt hs anode was observed via sem fig 6b the complete cnt coating layer was observed without shedding this indicated the coating layer had good stability on hs supporting material the mechanical strength and elemental composition of the cnt hs anode after long term operation were also detected fig 6c and d it could also withstand the maximum force of 670 5 n until the stretching distance was 20 00 mm and the corresponding tensile strength was 14 90 mpa the kinds of elements on the cnt hs anode after a long term operation was also composed of c o and n and the content had no obvious difference compared to the original cnt hs anode table s6 the above results illustrated the long term stability of cnt hs as an mes bioanode 3 6 cost analysis and application strategy in addition to excellent bio electrochemical performance and good long term stability cnt hs material also demonstrated its cost advantage and potential for large scale preparation as an mes electrode the cost analysis of the cnt hs material and other commonly used carbon based materials in mes were summarized in table s7 ignoring the weak electricity used in spraying paint the preparation of cnt hs electrodes mainly included original hs supporting material and cnt based paint the cost of commercially available hs material and cnt based paints is 0 4 m2 and 0 014 g hence the cost of preparing one square meter of cnt hs material is about 1 8 compared to other traditional carbon based electrodes the cost of cnt hs material is reduced by 8 2 m2 548 2 m2 hu et al 2019 wang et al 2009 considering that the cost of electrodes accounts for 50 60 of the total cost for pilot scale mess he et al 2019 hs based conductive material demonstrates its price advantage as an mes anode furthermore the hs based conductive material preparation only needs hs supporting material conductive paint and an electric spray gun therefore this study provides a simple strategy for preparing large scale mes electrodes fig s7 although hs based conductive material exhibits the potential of large scale preparation as mes electrodes effectively arranging electrodes in scaled up systems and ensuring the working efficiency of the mes during the water treatment process is of vital importance during electrode amplification in a single mes the system power loss will increase exponentially with the increase of the electrode area due to the increased potential loss cheng et al 2014 in order to avoid excessive energy loss and ensure the output performance of the mes the mes performance can be effectively maintained by introducing metal current collectors and constructing modularized mes units ieropoulos et al 2008 xie et al 2012 however the introduction of metal current collectors will increase the cost of system construction and the construction of stacked mes units requires complex and sophisticated circuit connections between each unit the electrodes developed in this experiment may help to improve the above problems during mes scaled up process first the stackable mes units can be connected by building honeycomb like structure electrodes fig s8a eliminating complicated wiring connections between units simultaneously the inner space of the honeycomb structure can be filled with substrates such as granular activated carbon to increase the ratio of electrode surface area to reactor volume to improve system performance fig s8b jiang and li 2009 the honeycomb structure can be used as the current collector of the stacked mes unit and the pores of the honeycomb structure can ensure the flow of sewage and the mass transfer of the substrate furthermore the excellent mechanical properties of this material demonstrate its advantages as mes electrodes for the bioremediation of polluted river sediment fig s8c li et al 2017a the honeycomb structure electrodes can be buried in the river sediment without worrying about its structural deformation its unique honeycomb stabilizing structure can effectively fix the sediment to prevent the water transparency from being reduced due to the scouring of the sediment by the water flow in future research the performance of cnt hs electrodes in large scale mes needs to be further verified through practical applications furthermore the external resistance used in this experiment 1000 ω is commonly reported to investigate the electrochemical performance of cubic mes systems based on the previous literature li et al 2020c liu and logan 2004 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2009 yuan et al 2013 considering that the best equipped external resistance in this experiment was 510 ω according to the power density curve test it is expected to obtain better performance when the system operates under this load simultaneously low cost hs material can be selected as supporting material for preparing mes modified anode hs based material has promising practical application prospects in soil or sediment remediation compared to traditional carbon materials considering its good mechanical strength developing hs supporting materials with excellent electrical conductivity itself may be another meaningful research it saves the step of surface modification reduces the risk of environmental pollution by modified materials and may further reduce preparation costs 4 conclusion three kinds of conductive hs based anodes gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs with good mechanical properties were prepared enhanced hydrophilicity surface roughness and content of o and n elements improved the biocompatibility of these three kinds of anodes and more eab enriched on their surface compared to the control cc anode the conductive layer could well maintain on hs supporting material for more than 6 months the enhanced eet process between microbe anode interface and improved tca related gene enabled the higher performance of the cnt hs anode system moreover the hs based anode system also demonstrated good cod removal performance in domestic wastewater treatment these results demonstrated a new strategy for preparing low cost mes anode

15957,electrode materials occupy most of the construction cost of the microbial electrochemical system mes and the low mechanical strength and poor electrochemical performance of the commonly used traditional carbon based materials restrict the promotion and application of this technology in this study polymer based three dimensional 3d honeycomb structure hs materials with good mechanical properties were used as supporting materials graphene gr carbon nanotube cnt and polypyrrole ppy was separately chosen as a surface conductivity coating layer for preparing mes anodes the introduction of gr cnt and ppy on hs increased surface roughness hydrophilicity o and n content electrochemically active surface area and decreased charge transfer internal resistance which promoted the adhesion of microorganisms on their surface and enhanced the extracellular electron transfer process at the electrode microbe interface the cnt hs anode system got the better maximal power density 1700 7 149 0 mw m2 of the three modified anode systems and 3 60 times that of mes using cc 471 8 27 2 mw m2 as the anode the accelerated reactions of the redox species in the outer cell membrane the promoted electron shuttle secretion and the enhanced abundance of the tricarboxylic acid cycle related functional genes in biofilm led to better performance of the cnt hs anode system the cnt hs anode system also exhibited long term operational stability 6 months and a good chemical oxygen demand degradation effect furthermore cnt hs material exhibited its cost advantage and its projected cost is estimated to be about 1 8 m2 much lower than the currently used mes anodes 8 2 548 2 m2 considering the good mechanical properties simple preparation process low manufacturing cost long term stability

keywords microbial electrochemical system honeycomb structure polymer hs based anode graphene carbon nanotube and polypyrrole cost effectiveness extracellular electron transfer 1 introduction the microbial electrochemical system mes is an environmental friendly device utilizing microorganisms as catalysts to remove pollutants for electricity generation and has been explored for more than 40 years suzuki 1976 microorganisms produce carbon dioxide protons and electrons by metabolizing organic matter in an anodic anaerobic environment bennetto et al 1983 stirling et al 1983 due to the rich organics content of wastewater mes was used to perform wastewater treatment 30 years ago habermann and pommer 1991 after long term development mes has been proven to be an effective domestic wastewater treatment technology and the energy consumption was much lower than that of conventional wastewater treatment technology feng et al 2014 he et al 2019 rossi et al 2022 therefore mes technology has been gradually promoted and applied in contaminants remediation and wastewater treatment dong et al 2019 li et al 2017a liang et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 usually in mes the anode provides sites for eab attachment and the acceptor of extracellular electrons significantly influencing system performance li et al 2020a therefore the anode material is essential for the application of mes technology traditional carbon based materials such as carbon cloth carbon brush and carbon mesh have been widely applied as anode material in mes feng et al 2010 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2009 many studies have also been devoted to improving the microbial extracellular electron transfer eet efficiency and system performance such as introducing transmembrane material cao et al 2021 yang et al 2020 electrode surface treatment feng et al 2010 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2009 and material modification li et al 2020c 2021 carbon based nanomaterials graphene gr and carbon nanotube cnt and conductive polymers polypyrrole ppy are considered candidates for anode materials owing to their excellent conductivity high surface area and good biocompatibility sonawane et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xie et al 2011 however their powder like characteristic is not conducive to direct use as mes freestanding electrodes researchers tried to combine these materials with some supporting materials to construct freestanding anodes to pursue better system performance yang et al loaded gr and ppy on glassy carbon by cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition the introduction of gr and ppy increased microbial affinity and eet efficiency and the maximal current density of the system with the modified anode 4 10 0 02 ma cm 2 was 8 times higher than that of the control anode 0 51 0 03 ma cm 2 yang et al 2019 zhao et al prepared anodes by loading cnt and ppy on a carbon brush cb the modified anode system obtained a shorter start up time 200 h and higher power output 1876 62 mw m 2 than the unmodified cb anode system 350 h and 713 26 mw m 2 zhao et al 2019 another study case by li et al used gr modified carbon cloth cc as an mes anode the wrinkled structure and excellent electrochemical activity of the modified anode made increased the maximal power density by about 725 mw m2 li et al 2020c gr cnt and ppy were fully exploited on carbon brush carbon cloth or glassy carbon and super system performance was achieved however the above mentioned modification processes electrodeposition calcine are generally complicated and hard to large scale prepare the supporting material such as glassy carbon carbon brush or carbon cloth is also expensive and fragile considering practical applications kumar et al 2013 wang et al 2009 so focused on system scaling up and application it is necessary to develop a simple and easy to prepare anode modification method with less expensive supporting material polymer based three dimensional 3d honeycomb structure hs materials processed by polyethylene were widely used in geotechnical applications and environmental remediation hegde 2017 vibhoosha et al 2021 the hs material has good mechanical strength and a large surface area with low cost yet the conductivity of this material was low and cannot be applied for mes anodes li et al 2017a li et al 2017b therefore it is significant to develop high performance hs based conductive anode materials based on retaining the excellent characteristics of hs to improve the performance of hs material gr cnt and ppy were loaded on hs supporting material to form a conductive coating layer thus three kinds of conductive layer loaded hs based material were fabricated and applied as mes anode tensile strength sem surface roughness xps contact angle zeta potential and resistivity tests were

characterization of anodic biofilm was observed by sem please refer to supplementary materials for preparation process li et al 2021 before observing the long term stability of hs based anode by sem the biofilm was removed by washing with deionized water and ultrasound for 30 min the biomass of anodic biofilm was quantified with proteins which comprise 50 of biomass by dry weight li et al 2020b

phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states 2 picrust2 was performed to predict tricarboxylic acid tca cycle metabolism genomics functional profiles based on 16s rrna gene data 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of anodes to illustrate the good mechanical strength of hs compared to cc the tensile strength of hs and cc were tested fig 1 a and b when the stretching distance reached 4 99 mm the cc material broke the corresponding maximum force was only 72 3 n however the hs material could withstand the maximum force of 672 0 n without breaking until the stretching distance was 20 00 mm furthermore the tensile strength of hs was calculated as 14 96 mpa which was 1 86 times that of cc 8 03 mpa the excellent mechanical strength of hs material has the potential to be used in various environmental conditions without worrying about the risk of damage compared to cc then the morphologies of different anodes were observed by sem as shown in fig 1f the surface of the original hs supporting material was smooth and clean which showed the minimum surface roughness of 1 59 0 59 μm fig s1a b and table s3 after coating by gr cnt and ppy they were evenly covered on the hs material without agglomeration or shedding and the roughness was increased to 7 19 0 16 μm 8 98 0 16 μm and 5 79 0 03 μm respectively fig s1c h and table s3 in detail the gr hs anode exhibited a wrinkled surface and might be conducive to biofilm growth fig 1g after spraying carbon nanotube based paint on the surface of hs supporting material the cnt was loaded on the hs anode with good dispersion fig 1h a rough silk like film could be observed and this structure might be favorable for enriching bacteria the surface of the ppy hs anode was wrapped by homogeneous particles and formed a porous structure which might be beneficial to the enrichment of microorganisms fig 1i however the surface of cc was extremely smooth and clean with no impurities corresponding to lower surface roughness 2 45 0 37 μm fig 1j s1i j and table s3 mes anode needs to possess good conductivity to accept extracellular electrons and transfer electrons to the cathode the lower resistivity of the anode can reduce the power loss of electrons during the transport process and improve the system performance li et al 2022 hs supporting material was not conductive due to its plastic character however gr cnt and ppy loading hs based anodes exhibited a certain degree of conductivity the resistivity of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes were 2 30 0 97 mω cm 2 18 0 91 mω cm and 5 10 0 10 mω cm which were not much higher than cc anode 0 73 0 13 mω cm the kinds and content of elements on an anode surface significantly influence system performance more contents of o and n on an anode surface can improve hydrophilicity and biocompatibility li et al 2020a 2020b this is helpful to accumulate eab in anodic biofilm and enhance the system performance feng et al 2010 li et al 2020b wang et al 2009 the elemental analysis by xps supplied some information of element content and types of each anode shown in table 1 and fig 1c for cc anode the content of o and n was only 3 52 and 1 24 after spraying by two kinds of carbon nanomaterial paints the content of o and n for gr hs o from 13 06 to 16 99 n from 0 49 to 0 77 and cnt hs o from 13 06 to 15 90 n from 0 49 to 0 78 increased compared to hs for the ppy hs anode the o and n element content increased to 21 30 and 5 75 through the high resolution n1s spectrum pyrrolic n 400 1 ev and graphitic n 401 3 ev were the main nitrogen containing functional groups fig 1d pyrrolic n can effectively promote eab accumulation in anodic biofilm and graphitic n can help reduce surface resistance and improve the electron transfer process li et al 2020a therefore gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes have better biocompatibility than cc and original hs the hydrophilicity of the anode has a crucial influence on system performance because it affects the affinity between the biofilm and the anode li et al 2020b the hydrophilicity of different anodes was tested by contact angle measurement fig 1e the cc anode was hydrophobic due to the contact angle of 127 2 4 2 which is not favorable for bacterial adhesion and growth the o and n content of the original hs material increased after coating by gr cnt and ppy leading the corresponding contact angles were changed from 71 3 4 5 to 44 2 1 0 51 2 5 6 and 26 7 5 0 respectively the results indicated that gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes have better hydrophilicity than original hs and cc which are conducive to bacterial attachment and improve the electrochemical interaction at the anode microbe interface li et al 2020b 2020c the surface zeta potential is another important index to evaluate the mes anode more positive of the zeta potential of the anodic surface is conducive to the rapid enrichment of eab thus improving the system start up time and output performance zhao et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 the zeta potential measurements illustrated the changes in the surface characteristics of the anodes table s4 the zeta potential value of the cc anode was 19 7 2 5 mv which was similar to the hs anode 20 6 2 1 mv after coating by gr and cnt paints the zeta potential values of gr hs 17 4 1 2 mv and cnt hs 17 2 1 1 mv anodes were no apparent change however the ppy hs anode exhibited a more positive value 2 5 0 8 mv due to the formation of nitrogen containing functional groups on the surface wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2019 considering that the surface charge of the eab is usually negative zhong et al 2018 the ppy hs anode might enrich eab faster and shorten the start up time of the system 3 2 electrochemical measurement the electrochemically active of different anodes were estimated by the cv test under a three electrode system due to its non conductivity characteristic the original hs supporting material had almost no electrochemical activity fig s2 however the cv curves of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes exhibited good electrochemical activity after coating gr cnt and ppy on hs supporting material fig 2 a the peak current of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes was 1 56 ma 1 14 ma and 0 56 ma which were 10 4 7 6 and 3 7 times higher than that of cc anode 0 15 ma respectively a higher peak current corresponds to a larger electrochemically active surface area wang et al 2009 this indicated that gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes could provide more electrochemically active sites to complete bio electrochemical reactions which is beneficial to decrease the interfacial charge transfer resistance and enhance the interface electron transfer eis test of different anodes verified the above inference fig 2b according to the fitting results the charge transfer resistance r ct of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes were 2 32 0 05 ω 2 79 0 02 ω and 13 55 0 05 ω which were 86 3 83 5 and 20 0 lower than that of cc anode 16 93 0 06 ω the r ct represents the transport ability of electrons at the material interface logan 2008 the decrease in r ct could be ascribed to the good electrochemical activity of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs and lower r ct was beneficial to enhance electron transport and electronic interactions zhu et al 2020 zou et al 2019 the bio electrochemical performance of different anodes was evaluated in the mes inoculated by mixed culture the output voltage curve of mes equipped with the original hs anode is shown in fig s3 almost no voltage was produced due to its non conductive characteristic in contrast gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems exhibited good bio electrochemical performance fig 2c the produced maximal voltage of the gr hs anode system could reach 520 8 7 5 mv which was 18 3 higher than that of the cc anode system 440 3 23 1 mv this could be attributed to the excellent conductivity and good electrochemical activity of gr li et al 2020b the cnt hs anode system produced a better output voltage 586 0 10 6 mv than the cc anode system the enhanced voltage could be attributed to the excellent conductivity of cnt which was facilitated by the electron transfer process at the electrode microbe interface li et al 2020a furthermore the ppy hs anode system obtained a higher maximal output voltage 469 0 17 3 mv than the cc anode system with a shorter start up time 85 h this could be attributed to biocompatibility nontoxic and positive surface charge of ppy which could be conducive to the growth of eab and thus shorten the start up time of the system zhao et al 2019 power density and polarization curve tests further illustrated the bio electrochemical performances of mes with different anodes fig 2d the maximal power density of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems were 1084 4 81 3 mw m2 1700 7 149 0 mw m2 and 946 8 16 3 mw m2 2 29 3 60 and 2 01 times those of the cc anode system 471 8 27 2 mw m2 more importantly the obtained power density of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems were higher than previously reported systems equipped with gr cnt and ppy modified anodes table s5 this indicated the system performance was not affected by the hs supporting material and the excellent properties of gr cnt and ppy were well exploited on the hs supporting material furthermore the anodic and cathodic polarization curves gave the contribution of each electrode to the system performance fig 2e the polarization behavior of each cathode was almost the same but the polarization behavior of different anodes was significantly different that means the difference in power output of each system was caused by the over potential generated by anode polarization the lower polarization degree of the cnt hs anode led to higher power generation of the system the ce of each system further reflected the difference between each anode gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems demonstrated stronger abilities to convert organic substrate to electricity than the cc anode system fig 2f the ce of gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems were 57 8 1 2 82 4 2 0 and 48 9 0 9 which were almost 20 2 44 8 and 11 3 higher than those of cc anode systems 37 6 2 0 respectively 3 3 performance of pollutants removal efficiency of mes with cnt hs anodes the cnt hs anode system was chosen to evaluate its ability to treat domestic wastewater due to its excellent bio electrochemical performance at the end of the operating cycle fed with sodium acetate the domestic wastewater was injected into the anodic chamber of the cnt hs system the effluent cod of three operating cycles under domestic wastewater feed was detected fig 3 a the calculated effluent cod concentration was 42 5 2 3 mg l which met the grade a standard of cod for municipal wastewater treatment plants in china 50 mg l this indicated that the cnt hs bioanode system could effectively remove cod in actual wastewater the change of n in the anodic chamber was also detected fig 3b interestingly the effluent tn concentration of each operating cycle 5 57 0 87 mg l could meet the grade a standard of tn for municipal wastewater treatment plants in china 15 mg l the initial form of nitrogen in domestic sewage is almost ammonia which means it is difficult to be metabolized in the anaerobic environment of the anodic chamber without an anammox process however the effluent ammonia and nitrate concentrations were only 3 54 0 80 mg l and 1 75 0 15 mg l no nitrite was detected combined with the community structure results section 3 4 this result was presumed to be the diffusion of ammonium ions through the cem into the cathode compartment to maintain ion balance based on previously reported similar phenomenon in two chamber mes systems kim et al 2007 kim et al 2008 therefore the removal mechanism of tn in this experiment mainly resulted from a physical process 3 4 enhancement mechanism analysis the eet process biomass community structure and functional genes prediction of biofilm were investigated to reveal the system enhancement mechanism indirect electron transfer iet mediated by electron shuttle and direct electron transfer det via outer membrane c type cytochromes om c cyts are the two main eet processes zhang et al 2017a the non turnover and turnover cvs tests of different anodic biofilm revealed the eet process of different systems li et al 2020c the non turnover cv curve of the cc anode had two pairs of characteristic redox peaks fig 4 a which are similar in shape to electroactive biofilms in previously reported studies hu et al 2019 liu et al 2008 these two redox pairs are omcz outer membrane c type cytochrome z formal potentials around 0 41 v vs sce and omcb outer membrane c type cytochrome b formal potentials around 0 33 v vs sce which are two major om c cyts essential for det between bacteria and anode in mess inoue et al 2010 richter et al 2009 for gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes similar redox peaks were observed and increased current were obtained the redox peak current intensity is related to the electrocatalytic activity of redox species in anodic biofilms liu et al 2005 this indicated the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the gr cnt and ppy improved the det process at the anode microbe interface in addition gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes exhibited a weak redox peak with formal potential around 0 12 v corresponding to the electrochemical response of the binding of om c cyts and flavins okamoto et al 2014 this indicated that the gr cnt and ppy could manifest the flavins bound om c cyts mediated electron transfer at the microbe anode interface compared to the cc the cvs under turnover condition further supported the above results distinct redox peaks were exhibited in each anode consistent with the catalytic oxidation of sodium acetate li et al 2020c fig 4b the peak current of the gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes was 1 14 ma 1 33 ma and 1 09 ma which were 1 29 1 51 and 1 24 times those of the cc anode 0 88 ma respectively the increased current resulted from the enhanced catalytic activity on the anodic surface the electrochemical dynamic behaviors of each anode were analyzed by the cv at scan rates of 5 25 mv s 1 the anodic and cathodic peak current increased with the scan rate for four anodes fig 4c j a good linear relationship between scan rates and the peak current was obtained for each anode the results indicated that the electrochemical reactions on the four anodes were typical surface controlled processes therefore the electron transfer process for each anode was dominated by det according to the results of pure geobacter species biofilm fed with acetate liang et al 2021 after the end of the experiment the biofilm morphologies were observed by sem fig s4 a large number of microorganisms were observed on gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes the measured biomass for gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anodes was 660 5 4 7 μg cm2 850 6 2 9 μg cm2 and 541 9 4 0 μg cm2 which were 2 14 2 76 and 1 76 times than those of cc anode 308 3 2 6 μg cm2 respectively the greater amount of biomass on three hs based anodes could be due to increased surface hydrophilicity and surface roughness fig s5 providing a suitable interface environment for the attached bacteria the bacterial community of anodic biofilms for different anodes was analyzed by high throughput sequencing the bacterial community structure on the phylum level showed a noticeable difference fig s6 the proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and ignavibacteriae were the significant components in four anodic biofilms on phylum level proteobacteria and firmicutes were considered potential exoelectrogens to produce bioelectricity du et al 2017 li et al 2020b the total abundances of two typical phyla for gr hs cnt hs ppy hs and cc were 83 72 91 37 75 56 and 40 71 corresponding to the performance of the four systems the bacterial community compositions on the genus level are shown in fig 5 a geobacter is a typical eab with strong extracellular electron transfer ability li et al 2020a logan et al 2019 the abundance of geobacter in cnt hs anodic biofilm was 16 55 which was higher than gr hs 12 58 and cc 0 42 anodic biofilms but lower than ppy hs 25 09 anodic biofilm the better accumulation ability of geobacter in ppy hs anodic biofilm might be attributed to its more positive potential which is conducive to enriching the eab with a negative charge zhao et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 the corresponding anodic biomass of geobacter for gr hs cnt hs ppy hs and cc was calculated as 166 18 1 17 μg 281 55 0 95 μg 271 93 1 96 μg and 2 59 0 02 μg respectively accumulating more geobacter might be the main reason for improving the process of eet and induced gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs anode systems better bio electrochemical performance than cc anode system a certain number of aquamicrobium 2 80 chryseobacterium 1 66 petrimonas 0 88 and azoarcus 0 13 genus were also found in cnt hs anodic biofilm many strains in these genera can degrade complex organic matters xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b zhao and zhang 2021 which is why the cnt hs anode system can efficiently degrade cod in actual wastewater bacteria related to geobacter species through oxidizing acetate via the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle to generate electricity play a significant role in system bio electrochemical performance mahadevan et al 2006 to further comprehend the enhanced performance of the hs based anode system functional gene abundances related to the tca cycle were predicted with picrust2 based on 16 s rrna gene abundance combined with the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database fig 5b the abundance of tca cycle related genes in the cnt hs sample was the highest in all samples which was increased by 1 13 1 27 times than that in the cc sample this indicated carbon nanotube might help enhance microbial metabolic activity the higher genes expression abundance in anodic biofilm leads to the better performance of the cnt hs anode system according to the results mentioned above hs material can be used as supporting material to prepare mes anodes the excellent characteristics of gr cnt and ppy could be well maintained and exploited on hs supporting material taking cnt hs anode as an example the performance enhancement mechanism of the cnt hs system is shown in fig 5c after spaying cnt based paint on hs supporting material the surface characteristics and conductivity were improved simultaneously cnt accelerated the tca cycle the reactions of the redox species in microorganisms det process and promoted flavin secretion iet process as different om c cyts during the det process omcz is responsible for electron transfer between biofilm and substrate in the medium and omcb for that between microbe anode interface hu et al 2019 therefore both the substrate metabolism process and the det process were enhanced simultaneously increased electrochemically active surface area of cnt hs anode could accept more extracellular electrons and flavin generated by eab with these contributions the cnt hs anode system exhibited excellent bio electrochemical performance 3 5 long term stability of cnt hs anode the long term stability of the cnt hs anode was evaluated for more than six months with periodic medium exchange fig 6 a after operation for more than six months the maximal output voltage of the system dropped only 3 2 from 594 mv to 575 mv after removing the surface biofilm the morphology of the cnt hs anode was observed via sem fig 6b the complete cnt coating layer was observed without shedding this indicated the coating layer had good stability on hs supporting material the mechanical strength and elemental composition of the cnt hs anode after long term operation were also detected fig 6c and d it could also withstand the maximum force of 670 5 n until the stretching distance was 20 00 mm and the corresponding tensile strength was 14 90 mpa the kinds of elements on the cnt hs anode after a long term operation was also composed of c o and n and the content had no obvious difference compared to the original cnt hs anode table s6 the above results illustrated the long term stability of cnt hs as an mes bioanode 3 6 cost analysis and application strategy in addition to excellent bio electrochemical performance and good long term stability cnt hs material also demonstrated its cost advantage and potential for large scale preparation as an mes electrode the cost analysis of the cnt hs material and other commonly used carbon based materials in mes were summarized in table s7 ignoring the weak electricity used in spraying paint the preparation of cnt hs electrodes mainly included original hs supporting material and cnt based paint the cost of commercially available hs material and cnt based paints is 0 4 m2 and 0 014 g hence the cost of preparing one square meter of cnt hs material is about 1 8 compared to other traditional carbon based electrodes the cost of cnt hs material is reduced by 8 2 m2 548 2 m2 hu et al 2019 wang et al 2009 considering that the cost of electrodes accounts for 50 60 of the total cost for pilot scale mess he et al 2019 hs based conductive material demonstrates its price advantage as an mes anode furthermore the hs based conductive material preparation only needs hs supporting material conductive paint and an electric spray gun therefore this study provides a simple strategy for preparing large scale mes electrodes fig s7 although hs based conductive material exhibits the potential of large scale preparation as mes electrodes effectively arranging electrodes in scaled up systems and ensuring the working efficiency of the mes during the water treatment process is of vital importance during electrode amplification in a single mes the system power loss will increase exponentially with the increase of the electrode area due to the increased potential loss cheng et al 2014 in order to avoid excessive energy loss and ensure the output performance of the mes the mes performance can be effectively maintained by introducing metal current collectors and constructing modularized mes units ieropoulos et al 2008 xie et al 2012 however the introduction of metal current collectors will increase the cost of system construction and the construction of stacked mes units requires complex and sophisticated circuit connections between each unit the electrodes developed in this experiment may help to improve the above problems during mes scaled up process first the stackable mes units can be connected by building honeycomb like structure electrodes fig s8a eliminating complicated wiring connections between units simultaneously the inner space of the honeycomb structure can be filled with substrates such as granular activated carbon to increase the ratio of electrode surface area to reactor volume to improve system performance fig s8b jiang and li 2009 the honeycomb structure can be used as the current collector of the stacked mes unit and the pores of the honeycomb structure can ensure the flow of sewage and the mass transfer of the substrate furthermore the excellent mechanical properties of this material demonstrate its advantages as mes electrodes for the bioremediation of polluted river sediment fig s8c li et al 2017a the honeycomb structure electrodes can be buried in the river sediment without worrying about its structural deformation its unique honeycomb stabilizing structure can effectively fix the sediment to prevent the water transparency from being reduced due to the scouring of the sediment by the water flow in future research the performance of cnt hs electrodes in large scale mes needs to be further verified through practical applications furthermore the external resistance used in this experiment 1000 ω is commonly reported to investigate the electrochemical performance of cubic mes systems based on the previous literature li et al 2020c liu and logan 2004 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2009 yuan et al 2013 considering that the best equipped external resistance in this experiment was 510 ω according to the power density curve test it is expected to obtain better performance when the system operates under this load simultaneously low cost hs material can be selected as supporting material for preparing mes modified anode hs based material has promising practical application prospects in soil or sediment remediation compared to traditional carbon materials considering its good mechanical strength developing hs supporting materials with excellent electrical conductivity itself may be another meaningful research it saves the step of surface modification reduces the risk of environmental pollution by modified materials and may further reduce preparation costs 4 conclusion three kinds of conductive hs based anodes gr hs cnt hs and ppy hs with good mechanical properties were prepared enhanced hydrophilicity surface roughness and content of o and n elements improved the biocompatibility of these three kinds of anodes and more eab enriched on their surface compared to the control cc anode the conductive layer could well maintain on hs supporting material for more than 6 months the enhanced eet process between microbe anode interface and improved tca related gene enabled the higher performance of the cnt hs anode system moreover the hs based anode system also demonstrated good cod removal performance in domestic wastewater treatment these results demonstrated a new strategy for preparing low cost mes anode

15958,silver nanoparticles agnps are nowadays widely utilized in various fields due to their unique antimicrobial properties extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by microorganisms might affect the transformations and antibacterial efficacy of agnps in the present study the effects of eps released by escherichia coli e coli on the dissolution and sulfidation of agnps as well as the associated growth inhibition to e coli were systematically investigated the formation of eps corona caused the reduced exposure of 111 facets of agnps due to the preferential binding with aromatic protein components in eps the eps inhibited agnps dissolution while facilitated reductive transformation of the released ag to ag0 under simulated sunlight additionally eps enhanced the colloidal stability and reduced electrostatic repulsive of agnps which favored the access of sulfide and significantly promoted the sulfidation of agnps under simulated sunlight further reducing the available dissolved ag ions consequently the eps relieved the antibacterial activity of agnps to e coli these findings highlight the importance of microbial eps in the transformations and bactericidal effect of agnps which provide clues for the development of agnps based antibacterial strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticles agnps extracellular polymeric substances eps antimicrobial effect dissolution sulfidation 1 introduction in recent years silver nanoparticles agnps as the most commercialized and used nanomaterials have been prevalently used in biomedical food agricultural and environmental industry due to their remarkable antimicrobial activity hansen et al 2020 hao et al 2021 joshi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 during the production application and disposal agnps would undergo multiple transformation processes which will result in not only the changes in their application efficacy but also the subsequent threaten to the environments gao and keller 2021 hao et al 2021 zhang et al 2018a it is well known that the oxidative dissolution of agnps in the water leads to continuous release of soluble ag ions xiu et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 many studies have demonstrated that the dissolved ag is dominantly responsible for the antibacterial activity of agnps because of its strong affinity to proteins and nucleic acids wu et al 2020 xiu et al 2011 xiu et al 2012 the bactericidal efficacy of agnps is generally correlated with their characteristics e g size morphology and surface coating as well as speciation influenced by ph ionic strength and natural organic matters nom gao and keller 2021 gunsolus et al 2015 thalmann et al 2016 wirth et al 2012 zhang et al 2016b zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020b notably the presence of common ligands e g sulfide and chloride which were liable to react with ag and induce precipitation could considerably reduce the ag bioavailability and antibacterial activity of agnps gunsolus et al 2015 xiu et al 2011 xu et al 2020 when agnps experience sulfidation and transform into ag2s with extremely low solubility the release of ag is greatly depressed and the microbial growth inhibition could be mitigated he et al 2019 metreveli et al 2020 reinsch et al 2012 the phototoxicities of agnps are strongly dependent on their transformations which may be mediated by ligands and nom in the environment li et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 the antimicrobial action of agnps was mostly emphasized on the nanoparticle cell interaction however the interactions between agnps and biofilms on the bacterial surface should not be overlooked fulaz et al 2019 koo et al 2017 bacterial biofilms were reported to be more resistant to antimicrobial agents than planktonic bacteria and the extracellular polymeric substances eps plays an important role in this better tolerance choi et al 2010 wirth et al 2012 microorganisms produce eps by secretion adsorption or cell lysis in response to exogenously environmental stress such as exposure to agnps desmau et al 2020 fulaz et al 2019 seviour et al 2019 eps comprises mostly of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and a few lipids and accounts for approximately 90 of biofilms which makes microorganisms embedded in a heterogenous matrix of macromolecules for self protection huangfu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 agnps are often applied to target the eps matrix as an effective strategy to remove biofilms and disrupt the pathogenic environments joshi et al 2020 koo et al 2017 seviour et al 2019 in addition autochthonous eps is commonly recognized as a reservoir of nanoparticles nps and biofilms might be secondary sources of nps release into the environments desmau et al 2020 natarajan et al 2021 in this regard the interactions between eps and agnps should be taken consideration into the antibacterial effects and subsequent ecological risks many studies have shown that biogenic eps played a crucial role in the biogeochemical transformations of heavy metals and organic pollutants because of the abundant functional groups and diverse properties shou et al 2018 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a the interactions between eps and nps not only mediate the surface charge colloidal properties and fate of nps but also govern the entry of nps into the cells fu et al 2021 jain et al 2015 junaid and wang 2021 noteworthily the chemical compositions and functional properties of eps vary largely with the microbial species and growth conditions junaid and wang 2021 zhou et al 2020 eps with higher hydrophobic components could stabilize agnps and prevent their agglomeration more effectively chen et al 2021 jimenez lamana and slaveykova 2016 besides some eps could reduce aquatic ag to agnps due to their special photochemical properties kang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a our previous study demonstrated that the algal eps facilitated the dissolution and sulfidation of agnps due to the abundant functional groups and photogeneration of reactive oxygen species yang et al 2021b although several results highlighted the importance of eps in regulating the transformations of agnps fu et al 2021 li et al 2016 the impacts and mechanisms of microbial eps on the antimicrobial effect of agnps are still unclear the aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of microbial eps on the chemical transformations especially dissolution and sulfidation and related antibacterial efficacy of agnps eps was extracted from escherichia coli e coli which is one prevalent type of pathogenic microorganisms gao and keller 2021 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the antibacterial activity of agnps was assessed using e coli growth inhibition tests in addition the kinetics of chemical transformations were monitored by the concentrations of dissolved silver and soluble sulfide at selected reaction times respectively the transformed solid products were well characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and transmission electronic microscopy tem several kinds of spectral analyses including ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps were applied to probe the interactions between eps and agnps as well as the underneath mechanisms uncovering the potential roles of microbial eps in the chemical transformations of agnps has important implications for the evaluation of antimicrobial effect and subsequent environmental risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

from e coli was mainly composed of proteins 753 49 mg g 1 and polysaccharides 63 10 mg g 1 elemental analysis indicated that c h o n and s accounted for 30 4 5 0 41 6 12 2 and 3 3 respectively the high resolution xps spectra of eps and the results of peak integration are provided in fig s1 and table s1 respectively the peak at 399 9 ev in n 1s region originated from amide nitrogen c nh and the peak at 163 6 ev in s 2p region indicated the existence of c s c or c s h wang et al 2021a xu et al 2021 the abundant nitrogen and sulfur containing functional groups in microbial eps might provide sufficient complexation sites for agnps gunsolus et al 2015 wang et al 2018 in addition carbonyl carboxylate and aromatic groups were also observed in c 1s and o 1s xps spectra as shown in the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps in fig s2 two fluorescence peaks at the excitation emission wavelengths of 220 0 340 0 nm peak a and 275 0 341 0 nm peak b were assigned to the tryptophan like structures with at least one aromatic ring chen and yu 2021 compared with the algal eps used in our previous study yang et al 2021b the higher intensity of the fluorescence peaks verified the higher protein contents and aromaticity of the microbial eps obtained in this study 3 2 effect of eps on the antibacterial activity of agnps the effect of eps on the antibacterial activity of agnps was assessed by e coli growth inhibition tests compared with the control experiment the notable ag release from agnps 189 0 8 9 μg l 1 led to the obvious bacterial growth inhibition and antimicrobial effect after 24 h incubation fig 1 a sulfidation distinctly reduced the inhibition effect of agnps to e coli p 0 05 which may be attributed to the decrease of available dissolved ag 74 4 5 1 μg l 1 after sulfidation he et al 2019 reinsch et al 2012 the addition of eps further lowered the antibacterial activity induced by agnps either alone or in the presence of na2s the antimicrobial effect of agnps at a higher concentration 1 mm was also relieved by eps to some extent fig s3a fig 1b illustrates that the growth of e coli was negatively correlated with the dissolved ag concentration in the culture medium verifying that ag was the key species causing toxicities of agnps li et al 2018 xiu et al 2012 moreover the transformations of agnps were sensitive to the light exposure and the simulated sunlight irradiation also led to mitigated antimicrobial effect of agnps by eps fig s3b the results indicated that the eps released by e coli significantly influenced the chemical transformations of agnps and in turn relieved the inhibition effect of agnps to e coli growth previous studies demonstrated that biological macromolecules e g proteins humic acids and surfactants etc could mediate the ecotoxicological effects of engineered nanomaterials by altering their environmental behaviors fulaz et al 2019 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a continuous excretion of eps was recognized as a feedback response and a defense mechanism of microorganisms for xenobiotic stresses huangfu et al 2019 natarajan et al 2021 therefore the interactions between eps and agnps should be further investigated to underly its prominent role in the transformations and antimicrobial effect of agnps 3 3 effect of eps on the dissolution of agnps to further unveil the intrinsic mechanisms accounting for the prominent role of eps in the transformations of agnps under simulated sunlight the interactions between eps and agnps were systematically investigated uv vis absorption spectra was monitored at different reaction durations to investigate the effect of eps on the dissolution of agnps as shown in fig s4a the intensity of the characteristic agnps surface plasmon resonance spr peak maximum 408 415 nm decreased over time which was due to the oxidative dissolution of agnps in water in the presence of the microbial eps the intensity of this peak decreased more slowly than that in water fig s4b e suggesting that the eps depressed the dissolution of agnps at higher eps concentration the peak became broader implying that the particle size increased which might be due to the formation of eps agnps complex jimenez lamana and slaveykova 2016 nayak et al 2019 the concentration of the dissolved ag ions was further monitored by icp ms as a function of time fig s5 shows the dissolution kinetics of agnps under simulated sunlight irradiation in the presence of eps at different concentrations the concentration of the released ag increased rapidly within the first 12 h and then gradually leveled off as the eps concentration increased from 0 to 0 1 1 0 and 10 mg c l 1 the 72 h agnps dissolution percentage decreased from 10 2 to 5 8 4 3 and 3 3 respectively the experimental data were well fitted by the first order reaction kinetics d ag dt k d ag where ag μg l 1 is the dissolved ag concentration at the reaction time t h and k d h 1 is the observed dissolution rate constant as shown in fig 1c the k d values were 0 0053 0 0002 0 0026 0 0002 0 0023 0 0001 and 0 0020 0 0001 h 1 when the concentration of eps was 0 0 1 1 0 and 10 mg c l 1 respectively these results indicated that the eps significantly inhibited the dissolution of agnps to release ag to further investigate the changes in the agnps morphology during dissolution the transformed products were collected and analyzed by tem as shown in fig 2 a the size of the dissolution products became uneven after dissolution for 1 5 h and some particles appeared with a shell like corona the tem edx element mapping images in fig s6a c demonstrate that some s and n elements appeared on the surface of agnps in the presence of eps which confirmed the adsorption and complexation of eps on the agnps after 10 h dissolution the morphology maintained the spherical structure with the size decreasing from 33 8 0 4 nm to 32 2 0 5 nm p 0 05 fig s6d and e due to the continuous release of ag from the surface of agnps le ouay and stellacci 2015 zhou et al 2016 it is worth noting that some tiny nps appeared in the solution fig s6f which might be attributed to the formation of new ag0 nps as a result of reduction of dissolved ag by eps kang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a the lattice fringe spacing of these tiny nps was 0 236 nm fig s6f consistent with the 111 lattice planes of the metallic silver 3 4 effect of eps on the sulfidation of agnps in order to quantitatively determine the sulfidation rates of agnps the residual sulfide concentration was determined by time resolved measurement of free sulfide depletion as shown in fig s7a the sulfide concentration was very constant in the agnps free solution suggesting that there was marginal interaction between na2s and eps fig s7b shows the sulfidation kinetics of agnps in the presence of eps at different concentrations it is apparent that the microbial eps promoted the consumption of sulfide remarkably and agnps continuously transformed into ag2s via facilitated sulfidation the sulfidation rate constant k s h 1 of agnps could be estimated by pseudo first order kinetic rate equation ln sulfide t sulfide 0 k s t where sulfide t and sulfide 0 μm represent the concentration of sulfide at reaction time t h and before the reaction respectively as shown in fig 1c agnps underwent sulfidation at a rate of 0 339 0 013 0 370 0 019 0 386 0 020 h 1 in the presence of 0 1 1 0 10 mg c l 1 eps respectively which were significantly higher than that in water 0 102 0 003 h 1 indicating that eps promoted the sulfidation of agnps in addition the extremely faster sulfidation rate than dissolution of agnps suggested that sulfidation was primarily a direct particle fluid oxysulfidation process zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020b xrd and tem were performed to characterize the sulfidized products of agnps as shown in fig s8 an additional phase after sulfidation appeared distinctly which was identified as acanthite ag2s jcpds no 14 0072 the higher intensities of xrd peaks of this new phase indicated that more ag2s were formed due to the promoted sulfidation in the presence of eps during sulfidation in the presence of eps some larger heterogeneous nanostructures were observed in the fig 2b tem image as shown in the hrtem image in fig 2b and tem edx element mapping image in fig s9 ag and s elements overlap completely in the sulfidized areas while the metallic ag0 remained on the side of one particle indicating that polycrystalline agnps experienced asymmetrical sulfidation additionally the occurrence of an amorphous thin layer on the surface of agnps in fig 2b could correspond to the coating of eps 3 5 eps agnps interactions and underlying mechanisms the possible interactions between eps and agnps were explored by several spectral analyses agnps show a distinct absorption peak at around 408 nm in the uv vis absorption spectra fig s10 due to the strong localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect a red shift of lspr peak δλ 2 nm of agnps was observed in the presence of eps suggesting that the increased local refractive index was induced by the eps adsorption on the surface of agnps nayak et al 2019 yang et al 2021a this was clearly evidenced by the occurrence of a thin amorphous eps layer on the surface of agnps in fig 2 fig s11a presents the atr ftir spectra of the eps in the presence of agnps at different concentrations and 2d cos analyses were applied to determine the conformational changes of eps the synchronous and asynchronous maps generated from the 1750 1000 cm 1 region are shown in fig s11b and c and the detailed results are provided in table s2 according to noda s rule noda 2012 the structural changes of eps in the process of binding with agnps followed the order aryl groups 1616 cm 1 carboxylic acid c o 1691 cm 1 aromatic c c 1502 cm 1 n h stretching amide ii 1564 cm 1 coc co and cc 1063 cm 1 c o stretching amide i 1653 cm 1 overall consistent with previous observations the abundant carboxyl aromatic and amide groups were the main sites for complexation of eps and agnps wang et al 2021a yang et al 2021b the results suggested that the binding affinities of hydrophobic sites were higher than those of hydrophilic fractions therefore the aromatic protein components in eps released by e coli favored its binding with agnps the fluorescence quenching results in the presence of agnps are shown in fig 3 a e the fluorescence peak a of eps red shifted slightly fig s12a verifying that the aromatic proteins in eps were responsible for its binding with agnps shou et al 2018 yan et al 2019 the quenching mechanism was further analyzed to clarify the interactions between eps and agnps and the detailed procedures are provided in the si the calculated quenching rate constant k q was 3 93 1012 l mol 1 s at 298 k which was larger than that of maximum scattering collision 2 0 1010 l mol 1 s revealing a static quenching due to the formation of eps agnps complex nayak et al 2019 shou et al 2018 as shown in fig s10 the differential optical absorption spectra between eps agnps solution and pure eps solution did not overlap which confirmed the static quenching mechanism and the formation of eps agnps complex wang et al 2021b yang et al 2021a furthermore the binding constants and thermodynamic parameters were calculated to explore the interactions between eps and agnps as shown in fig 3f and table s3 the binding constants kb between eps and agnps were higher than 104 l mol 1 and increased with the increasing temperatures confirming that eps exhibited a superior binding ability with agnps and the stability of the complex might be enhanced as the temperatures increased nan et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the negative value of gibbs free energy g suggested that eps bound with agnps spontaneously the positive values of both enthalpy change h and entropy change s indicated that hydrophobic interaction might play a crucial role in the binding process which was similar to the binding behaviors of lysozyme with agnps wang et al 2017 synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to provide information on the conformational changes of eps induced by the interactions and the interval between the excitation and emission wavelengths was stabilized at 60 nm to characterize tryptophan residues nan et al 2019 wang et al 2017 as shown in fig s12b the red shift of the fluorescence peak indicated the hydrophobicity of microenvironment around the tryptophan residues decreased because of the addition of agnps nan et al 2019 the strong interactions between eps and agnps may contribute to the formation of eps corona on the surface of agnps which is similar to the adsorption of microbial eps to tio2 nps and ceo2 nps natarajan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the formation of biocorona might manipulate the physicochemical properties and nanostructures of agnps which would impact their subsequent behaviors and biological effects liu et al 2018a xu et al 2020 crystalline agnps were reported to exhibit facet dependent chemical reactivity and ligand adsorption capacity owing to the differences in surface energy and atom density liu et al 2018a sun and xia 2002 as shown in fig s8 the synthesized agnps in this study were polycrystalline and enriched with 111 facets because pvp could selectively bind to ag 100 facets metreveli et al 2020 sun and xia 2002 as previously described ag 111 facets were easier to dissolve and the lowest free energy of 111 facets made it adsorb nom more strongly than other facets le ouay and stellacci 2015 nyangiwe and ouma 2020 as shown in fig s8 after dispersed in eps suspension the relative intensity ratios of 200 111 and 220 111 diffraction peaks of agnps increased from the original 0 29 and 0 21 to 0 47 and 0 25 respectively this suggested that the aromatic components of eps preferentially adsorbed on ag 111 facets forming a corona of eps on the surface of agnps and depressed their dissolution to release ag ions more importantly previous studies have demonstrated that ag 111 facets played a primary role in the antibacterial activity of agnps due to the high atoms density le ouay and stellacci 2015 nyangiwe and ouma 2020 the reduced exposure of 111 facets might be also one of the reasons accounting for the fact that eps depressed e coli growth inhibition of agnps the reduction of ag 10 μm by eps was further explored as shown in fig 4 a the presence of eps slightly affected the chemical transformation of ag in the dark notably the characteristic spr peak approximately at 403 nm confirmed the formation of ag0 nps under simulated sunlight irradiation the absorbance increased with irradiation time suggesting that ag could be readily reduced by eps the reductive functional groups of polysaccharides and proteins in microbial eps may act as electron donors and light irradiation could accelerate the electron transfer from eps to ag kang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2015 this is one of the reasons accounting for the rapid transformation of ag to ag0 nps by eps from e coli under simulated sunlight besides the formation of xtt formazan in the presence of eps under irradiation confirmed the generation of o2 fig 4b which has also been observed to readily reduce ag li et al 2018 liu et al 2018b the reduction rate constants k r h 1 could be estimated using the pseudo first order equation ln ag t ag 0 k r t where ag t and ag 0 μm represent the concentrations of ag at time t h and initially respectively as shown in fig 4c the calculated k r values increased with the increasing concentrations of eps fortifying that eps could facilitate the reductive transformation of the released ag to ag0 nps and contribute to the lower observed dissolution rates li et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 the interactions between eps and agnps might govern the surface charge of the nanoparticles and further affect the transformations of agnps jain et al 2015 zhang et al 2020b as shown in fig s13 the zeta potential changed gradually from 29 8 to 22 8 mv in the presence of eps 0 10 mg c l 1 the increased zeta potential reduced the electrostatic repulsive interaction which would favor the access of sulfide to the surface of agnps besides the hydrodynamic diameter decreased from 56 nm to 40 nm with the addition of eps and remained almost constant over 50 min noteworthily the decrease of polydispersity index from 0 20 to 0 15 confirmed the stabilization effect on agnps by eps which also favored the sulfidation rate of agnps chen et al 2021 he et al 2019 thalmann et al 2016 hence the easier access of sulfide to the active sites of agnps in the presence of eps promoted the sulfidation of agnps in a direct oxysulfidation route 4 conclusions the results of the present study showed that the presence of eps inhibited agnps dissolution but promoted sulfidation under simulated sunlight and thus reduced the antibacterial efficacy to e coli the abundant aromatic components in eps preferentially adsorbed onto ag 111 crystal facets and resulted in the formation of eps corona to depress the dissolution of agnps moreover the superior reductive capability of the microbial eps facilitated the reductive transformation of the released ag ions by altering the transformations of agnps in the environment eps displayed distinct effect in mediating their biological effect to microorganisms these findings provide first line of evidences that microorganisms might evolve to resist the antimicrobial effects of agnps by continuous release of eps as a self defense mechanism additionally there are abundant eps in the environment and their interaction with agnps may greatly change the species of agnps and alter their final biological effects the physicochemical properties of agnps including the coating layer shape and size are also essential factors affecting the interactions with eps and warrant further investigation therefore sufficient consideration of the role of eps is of great importance to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of agnps and develop viable solutions for antimicrobial resistance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15958,silver nanoparticles agnps are nowadays widely utilized in various fields due to their unique antimicrobial properties extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by microorganisms might affect the transformations and antibacterial efficacy of agnps in the present study the effects of eps released by escherichia coli e coli on the dissolution and sulfidation of agnps as well as the associated growth inhibition to e coli were systematically investigated the formation of eps corona caused the reduced exposure of 111 facets of agnps due to the preferential binding with aromatic protein components in eps the eps inhibited agnps dissolution while facilitated reductive transformation of the released ag to ag0 under simulated sunlight additionally eps enhanced the colloidal stability and reduced electrostatic repulsive of agnps which favored the access of sulfide and significantly promoted the sulfidation of agnps under simulated sunlight further reducing the available dissolved ag ions consequently the eps relieved the antibacterial activity of agnps to e coli these findings highlight the importance of microbial eps in the transformations and bactericidal effect of agnps which provide clues for the development of agnps based antibacterial strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticles agnps extracellular polymeric substances eps antimicrobial effect dissolution sulfidation 1 introduction in recent years silver nanoparticles agnps as the most commercialized and used nanomaterials have been prevalently used in biomedical food agricultural and environmental industry due to their remarkable antimicrobial activity hansen et al 2020 hao et al 2021 joshi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 during the production application and disposal agnps would undergo multiple transformation processes which will result in not only the changes in their application efficacy but also the subsequent threaten to the environments gao and keller 2021 hao et al 2021 zhang et al 2018a it is well known that the oxidative dissolution of agnps in the water leads to continuous release of soluble ag ions xiu et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 many studies have demonstrated that the dissolved ag is dominantly responsible for the antibacterial activity of agnps because of its strong affinity to proteins and nucleic acids wu et al 2020 xiu et al 2011 xiu et al 2012 the bactericidal efficacy of agnps is generally correlated with their characteristics e g size morphology and surface coating as well as speciation influenced by ph ionic strength and natural organic matters nom gao and keller 2021 gunsolus et al 2015 thalmann et al 2016 wirth et al 2012 zhang et al 2016b zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020b notably the presence of common ligands e g sulfide and chloride which were liable to react with ag and induce precipitation could considerably reduce the ag bioavailability and antibacterial activity of agnps gunsolus et al 2015 xiu et al 2011 xu et al 2020 when agnps experience sulfidation and transform into ag2s with extremely low solubility the release of ag is greatly depressed and the microbial growth inhibition could be mitigated he et al 2019 metreveli et al 2020 reinsch et al 2012 the phototoxicities of agnps are strongly dependent on their transformations which may be mediated by ligands and nom in the environment li et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 the antimicrobial action of agnps was mostly emphasized on the nanoparticle cell interaction however the interactions between agnps and biofilms on the bacterial surface should not be overlooked fulaz et al 2019 koo et al 2017 bacterial biofilms were reported to be more resistant to antimicrobial agents than planktonic bacteria and the extracellular polymeric substances eps plays an important role in this better tolerance choi et al 2010 wirth et al 2012 microorganisms produce eps by secretion adsorption or cell lysis in response to exogenously environmental stress such as exposure to agnps desmau et al 2020 fulaz et al 2019 seviour et al 2019 eps comprises mostly of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and a few lipids and accounts for approximately 90 of biofilms which makes microorganisms embedded in a heterogenous matrix of macromolecules for self protection huangfu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 agnps are often applied to target the eps matrix as an effective strategy to remove biofilms and disrupt the pathogenic environments joshi et al 2020 koo et al 2017 seviour et al 2019 in addition autochthonous eps is commonly recognized as a reservoir of nanoparticles nps and biofilms might be secondary sources of nps release into the environments desmau et al 2020 natarajan et al 2021 in this regard the interactions between eps and agnps should be taken consideration into the antibacterial effects and subsequent ecological risks many studies have shown that biogenic eps played a crucial role in the biogeochemical transformations of heavy metals and organic pollutants because of the abundant functional groups and diverse properties shou et al 2018 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a the interactions between eps and nps not only mediate the surface charge colloidal properties and fate of nps but also govern the entry of nps into the cells fu et al 2021 jain et al 2015 junaid and wang 2021 noteworthily the chemical compositions and functional properties of eps vary largely with the microbial species and growth conditions junaid and wang 2021 zhou et al 2020 eps with higher hydrophobic components could stabilize agnps and prevent their agglomeration more effectively chen et al 2021 jimenez lamana and slaveykova 2016 besides some eps could reduce aquatic ag to agnps due to their special photochemical properties kang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a our previous study demonstrated that the algal eps facilitated the dissolution and sulfidation of agnps due to the abundant functional groups and photogeneration of reactive oxygen species yang et al 2021b although several results highlighted the importance of eps in regulating the transformations of agnps fu et al 2021 li et al 2016 the impacts and mechanisms of microbial eps on the antimicrobial effect of agnps are still unclear the aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of microbial eps on the chemical transformations especially dissolution and sulfidation and related antibacterial efficacy of agnps eps was extracted from escherichia coli e coli which is one prevalent type of pathogenic microorganisms gao and keller 2021 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the antibacterial activity of agnps was assessed using e coli growth inhibition tests in addition the kinetics of chemical

peak at 163 6 ev in s 2p region indicated the existence of c s c or c s h wang et al 2021a xu et al 2021 the abundant nitrogen and sulfur containing functional groups in microbial eps might provide sufficient complexation sites for agnps gunsolus et al 2015 wang et al 2018 in addition carbonyl carboxylate and aromatic groups were also observed in c 1s and o 1s xps spectra as shown in the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps in fig s2 two fluorescence peaks at the excitation emission wavelengths of 220 0 340 0 nm peak a and 275 0 341 0 nm peak b were assigned to the tryptophan like structures with at least one aromatic ring chen and yu 2021 compared with the algal eps used in our previous study yang et al 2021b the higher intensity of the fluorescence peaks verified the higher protein contents and aromaticity of the microbial eps obtained in this study 3 2 effect of eps on the antibacterial activity of agnps the effect of eps on the antibacterial activity of agnps was assessed by e coli growth inhibition tests compared with the control experiment the notable ag release from agnps 189 0 8 9 μg l 1 led to the obvious bacterial growth inhibition and antimicrobial effect after 24 h incubation fig 1 a sulfidation distinctly reduced the inhibition effect of agnps to e coli p 0 05 which may be attributed to the decrease of available dissolved ag 74 4 5 1 μg l 1 after sulfidation he et al 2019 reinsch et al 2012 the addition of eps further lowered the antibacterial activity induced by agnps either alone or in the presence of na2s the antimicrobial effect of agnps at a higher concentration 1 mm was also relieved by eps to some extent fig s3a fig 1b illustrates that the growth of e coli was negatively correlated with the dissolved ag concentration in the culture medium verifying that ag was the key species causing toxicities of agnps li et al 2018 xiu et al 2012 moreover the transformations of agnps were sensitive to the light exposure and the simulated sunlight irradiation also led to mitigated antimicrobial effect of agnps by eps fig s3b the results indicated that the eps released by e coli significantly influenced the chemical transformations of agnps and in turn relieved the inhibition effect of agnps to e coli growth previous studies demonstrated that biological macromolecules e g proteins humic acids and surfactants etc could mediate the ecotoxicological effects of engineered nanomaterials by altering their environmental behaviors fulaz et al 2019 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a continuous excretion of eps was recognized as a feedback response and a defense mechanism of microorganisms for xenobiotic stresses huangfu et al 2019 natarajan et al 2021 therefore the interactions between eps and agnps should be further investigated to underly its prominent role in the transformations and antimicrobial effect of agnps 3 3 effect of eps on the dissolution of agnps to further unveil the intrinsic mechanisms accounting for the prominent role of eps in the transformations of agnps under simulated sunlight the interactions between eps and agnps were systematically investigated uv vis absorption spectra was monitored at different reaction durations to investigate the effect of eps on the dissolution of agnps as shown in fig s4a the intensity of the characteristic agnps surface plasmon resonance spr peak maximum 408 415 nm decreased over time which was due to the oxidative dissolution of agnps in water in the presence of the microbial eps the intensity of this peak decreased more slowly than that in water fig s4b e suggesting that the eps depressed the dissolution of agnps at higher eps concentration the peak became broader implying that the particle size increased which might be due to the formation of eps agnps complex jimenez lamana and slaveykova 2016 nayak et al 2019 the concentration of the dissolved ag ions was further monitored by icp ms as a function of time fig s5 shows the dissolution kinetics of agnps under simulated sunlight irradiation in the presence of eps at different concentrations the concentration of the released ag increased rapidly within the first 12 h and then gradually leveled off as the eps concentration increased from 0 to 0 1 1 0 and 10 mg c l 1 the 72 h agnps dissolution percentage decreased from 10 2 to 5 8 4 3 and 3 3 respectively the experimental data were well fitted by the first order reaction kinetics d ag dt k d ag where ag μg l 1 is the dissolved ag concentration at the reaction time t h and k d h 1 is the observed dissolution rate constant as shown in fig 1c the k d values were 0 0053 0 0002 0 0026 0 0002 0 0023 0 0001 and 0 0020 0 0001 h 1 when the concentration of eps was 0 0 1 1 0 and 10 mg c l 1 respectively these results indicated that the eps significantly inhibited the dissolution of agnps to release ag to further investigate the changes in the agnps morphology during dissolution the transformed products were collected and analyzed by tem as shown in fig 2 a the size of the dissolution products became uneven after dissolution for 1 5 h and some particles appeared with a shell like corona the tem edx element mapping images in fig s6a c demonstrate that some s and n elements appeared on the surface of agnps in the presence of eps which confirmed the adsorption and complexation of eps on the agnps after 10 h dissolution the morphology maintained the spherical structure with the size decreasing from 33 8 0 4 nm to 32 2 0 5 nm p 0 05 fig s6d and e due to the continuous release of ag from the surface of agnps le ouay and stellacci 2015 zhou et al 2016 it is worth noting that some tiny nps appeared in the solution fig s6f which might be attributed to the formation of new ag0 nps as a result of reduction of dissolved ag by eps kang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a the lattice fringe spacing of these tiny nps was 0 236 nm fig s6f consistent with the 111 lattice planes of the metallic silver 3 4 effect of eps on the sulfidation of agnps in order to quantitatively determine the sulfidation rates of agnps the residual sulfide concentration was determined by time resolved measurement of free sulfide depletion as shown in fig s7a the sulfide concentration was very constant in the agnps free solution suggesting that there was marginal interaction between na2s and eps fig s7b shows the sulfidation kinetics of agnps in the presence of eps at different concentrations it is apparent that the microbial eps promoted the consumption of sulfide remarkably and agnps continuously transformed into ag2s via facilitated sulfidation the sulfidation rate constant k s h 1 of agnps could be estimated by pseudo first order kinetic rate equation ln sulfide t sulfide 0 k s t where sulfide t and sulfide 0 μm represent the concentration of sulfide at reaction time t h and before the reaction respectively as shown in fig 1c agnps underwent sulfidation at a rate of 0 339 0 013 0 370 0 019 0 386 0 020 h 1 in the presence of 0 1 1 0 10 mg c l 1 eps respectively which were significantly higher than that in water 0 102 0 003 h 1 indicating that eps promoted the sulfidation of agnps in addition the extremely faster sulfidation rate than dissolution of agnps suggested that sulfidation was primarily a direct particle fluid oxysulfidation process zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020b xrd and tem were performed to characterize the sulfidized products of agnps as shown in fig s8 an additional phase after sulfidation appeared distinctly which was identified as acanthite ag2s jcpds no 14 0072 the higher intensities of xrd peaks of this new phase indicated that more ag2s were formed due to the promoted sulfidation in the presence of eps during sulfidation in the presence of eps some larger heterogeneous nanostructures were observed in the fig 2b tem image as shown in the hrtem image in fig 2b and tem edx element mapping image in fig s9 ag and s elements overlap completely in the sulfidized areas while the metallic ag0 remained on the side of one particle indicating that polycrystalline agnps experienced asymmetrical sulfidation additionally the occurrence of an amorphous thin layer on the surface of agnps in fig 2b could correspond to the coating of eps 3 5 eps agnps interactions and underlying mechanisms the possible interactions between eps and agnps were explored by several spectral analyses agnps show a distinct absorption peak at around 408 nm in the uv vis absorption spectra fig s10 due to the strong localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect a red shift of lspr peak δλ 2 nm of agnps was observed in the presence of eps suggesting that the increased local refractive index was induced by the eps adsorption on the surface of agnps nayak et al 2019 yang et al 2021a this was clearly evidenced by the occurrence of a thin amorphous eps layer on the surface of agnps in fig 2 fig s11a presents the atr ftir spectra of the eps in the presence of agnps at different concentrations and 2d cos analyses were applied to determine the conformational changes of eps the synchronous and asynchronous maps generated from the 1750 1000 cm 1 region are shown in fig s11b and c and the detailed results are provided in table s2 according to noda s rule noda 2012 the structural changes of eps in the process of binding with agnps followed the order aryl groups 1616 cm 1 carboxylic acid c o 1691 cm 1 aromatic c c 1502 cm 1 n h stretching amide ii 1564 cm 1 coc co and cc 1063 cm 1 c o stretching amide i 1653 cm 1 overall consistent with previous observations the abundant carboxyl aromatic and amide groups were the main sites for complexation of eps and agnps wang et al 2021a yang et al 2021b the results suggested that the binding affinities of hydrophobic sites were higher than those of hydrophilic fractions therefore the aromatic protein components in eps released by e coli favored its binding with agnps the fluorescence quenching results in the presence of agnps are shown in fig 3 a e the fluorescence peak a of eps red shifted slightly fig s12a verifying that the aromatic proteins in eps were responsible for its binding with agnps shou et al 2018 yan et al 2019 the quenching mechanism was further analyzed to clarify the interactions between eps and agnps and the detailed procedures are provided in the si the calculated quenching rate constant k q was 3 93 1012 l mol 1 s at 298 k which was larger than that of maximum scattering collision 2 0 1010 l mol 1 s revealing a static quenching due to the formation of eps agnps complex nayak et al 2019 shou et al 2018 as shown in fig s10 the differential optical absorption spectra between eps agnps solution and pure eps solution did not overlap which confirmed the static quenching mechanism and the formation of eps agnps complex wang et al 2021b yang et al 2021a furthermore the binding constants and thermodynamic parameters were calculated to explore the interactions between eps and agnps as shown in fig 3f and table s3 the binding constants kb between eps and agnps were higher than 104 l mol 1 and increased with the increasing temperatures confirming that eps exhibited a superior binding ability with agnps and the stability of the complex might be enhanced as the temperatures increased nan et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the negative value of gibbs free energy g suggested that eps bound with agnps spontaneously the positive values of both enthalpy change h and entropy change s indicated that hydrophobic interaction might play a crucial role in the binding process which was similar to the binding behaviors of lysozyme with agnps wang et al 2017 synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to provide information on the conformational changes of eps induced by the interactions and the interval between the excitation and emission wavelengths was stabilized at 60 nm to characterize tryptophan residues nan et al 2019 wang et al 2017 as shown in fig s12b the red shift of the fluorescence peak indicated the hydrophobicity of microenvironment around the tryptophan residues decreased because of the addition of agnps nan et al 2019 the strong interactions between eps and agnps may contribute to the formation of eps corona on the surface of agnps which is similar to the adsorption of microbial eps to tio2 nps and ceo2 nps natarajan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the formation of biocorona might manipulate the physicochemical properties and nanostructures of agnps which would impact their subsequent behaviors and biological effects liu et al 2018a xu et al 2020 crystalline agnps were reported to exhibit facet dependent chemical reactivity and ligand adsorption capacity owing to the differences in surface energy and atom density liu et al 2018a sun and xia 2002 as shown in fig s8 the synthesized agnps in this study were polycrystalline and enriched with 111 facets because pvp could selectively bind to ag 100 facets metreveli et al 2020 sun and xia 2002 as previously described ag 111 facets were easier to dissolve and the lowest free energy of 111 facets made it adsorb nom more strongly than other facets le ouay and stellacci 2015 nyangiwe and ouma 2020 as shown in fig s8 after dispersed in eps suspension the relative intensity ratios of 200 111 and 220 111 diffraction peaks of agnps increased from the original 0 29 and 0 21 to 0 47 and 0 25 respectively this suggested that the aromatic components of eps preferentially adsorbed on ag 111 facets forming a corona of eps on the surface of agnps and depressed their dissolution to release ag ions more importantly previous studies have demonstrated that ag 111 facets played a primary role in the antibacterial activity of agnps due to the high atoms density le ouay and stellacci 2015 nyangiwe and ouma 2020 the reduced exposure of 111 facets might be also one of the reasons accounting for the fact that eps depressed e coli growth inhibition of agnps the reduction of ag 10 μm by eps was further explored as shown in fig 4 a the presence of eps slightly affected the chemical transformation of ag in the dark notably the characteristic spr peak approximately at 403 nm confirmed the formation of ag0 nps under simulated sunlight irradiation the absorbance increased with irradiation time suggesting that ag could be readily reduced by eps the reductive functional groups of polysaccharides and proteins in microbial eps may act as electron donors and light irradiation could accelerate the electron transfer from eps to ag kang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2015 this is one of the reasons accounting for the rapid transformation of ag to ag0 nps by eps from e coli under simulated sunlight besides the formation of xtt formazan in the presence of eps under irradiation confirmed the generation of o2 fig 4b which has also been observed to readily reduce ag li et al 2018 liu et al 2018b the reduction rate constants k r h 1 could be estimated using the pseudo first order equation ln ag t ag 0 k r t where ag t and ag 0 μm represent the concentrations of ag at time t h and initially respectively as shown in fig 4c the calculated k r values increased with the increasing concentrations of eps fortifying that eps could facilitate the reductive transformation of the released ag to ag0 nps and contribute to the lower observed dissolution rates li et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 the interactions between eps and agnps might govern the surface charge of the nanoparticles and further affect the transformations of agnps jain et al 2015 zhang et al 2020b as shown in fig s13 the zeta potential changed gradually from 29 8 to 22 8 mv in the presence of eps 0 10 mg c l 1 the increased zeta potential reduced the electrostatic repulsive interaction which would favor the access of sulfide to the surface of agnps besides the hydrodynamic diameter decreased from 56 nm to 40 nm with the addition of eps and remained almost constant over 50 min noteworthily the decrease of polydispersity index from 0 20 to 0 15 confirmed the stabilization effect on agnps by eps which also favored the sulfidation rate of agnps chen et al 2021 he et al 2019 thalmann et al 2016 hence the easier access of sulfide to the active sites of agnps in the presence of eps promoted the sulfidation of agnps in a direct oxysulfidation route 4 conclusions the results of the present study showed that the presence of eps inhibited agnps dissolution but promoted sulfidation under simulated sunlight and thus reduced the antibacterial efficacy to e coli the abundant aromatic components in eps preferentially adsorbed onto ag 111 crystal facets and resulted in the formation of eps corona to depress the dissolution of agnps moreover the superior reductive capability of the microbial eps facilitated the reductive transformation of the released ag ions by altering the transformations of agnps in the environment eps displayed distinct effect in mediating their biological effect to microorganisms these findings provide first line of evidences that microorganisms might evolve to resist the antimicrobial effects of agnps by continuous release of eps as a self defense mechanism additionally there are abundant eps in the environment and their interaction with agnps may greatly change the species of agnps and alter their final biological effects the physicochemical properties of agnps including the coating layer shape and size are also essential factors affecting the interactions with eps and warrant further investigation therefore sufficient consideration of the role of eps is of great importance to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of agnps and develop viable solutions for antimicrobial resistance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15959,glaciers in the himalayan region have been receding rapidly in recent decades drawing increasing concerns about the release of legacy pollutants e g mercury hg to investigate the distribution transport and controlling factors of hg in glacier fed runoff from june 2019 to july 2020 a continuous monitoring and an intensive sampling campaign were conducted in the rongbuk glacier fed basin rgb on the north slope of mt everest in the middle himalayas the total hg thg and methyl hg mehg concentrations were 1 56 0 85 and 0 057 0 025 ng l respectively which were comparable to the global background levels and were mainly affected by the total suspended particulate matter tsp in addition thg and mehg showed significant diurnal variations with peak values appearing at approximately 17 00 upstream and 19 00 downstream based on the annual runoff and average hg concentration the annual export fluxes of thg and mehg were estimated to be 441 g and 16 g respectively the yields of thg and mehg in the rgb were 1 6 and 0 06 μg m2 year respectively currently the annual hg export of meltwater runoff in the himalayan region is approximately 337 kg year when flowing through the proglacial lake the thg concentrations decreased by 32 and 15 in the proglacial lake water and in the outlet respectively indicating that proglacial lakes had a sedimentation effect on the hg transport the hg export from meltwater runoff in the himalayas will likely increase considering the meltwater runoff has been projected to increase in the future nonetheless emerging proglacial lakes may exert ambiguous effects on the glacier exported hg under changing climate proglacial lakes could lower the levels and amounts of hg in the glacier runoff whereas the outburst of proglacial lakes could lead to an instantaneous release of hg stored in lake waters and sediments our analysis shed light on the environmental impact of glacier retreat in the himalayas and highlighted the need for integrated monitoring and study of hg in glacier runoff and glacial lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords himalayas rongbuk glacier glacier runoff proglacial lake hg export 1 introduction mercury hg is a global pollutant that can be transported over long distances in gaseous form and it has drawn attention from many countries and organizations because of its persistence high toxicity and bioaccumulation potential jiang et al 2006 krabbenhoft and sunderland 2013 after atmospheric long distance transmission hg eventually sinks into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in aquatic ecosystems inorganic hg can be transformed into organic forms e g methyl hg mehg which accumulate and amplify in the food chain and may eventually cause fatal toxicity to organisms and potentially humans douglas et al 2012 fisher et al 2012 the 2018 global hg assessment identified asia as the world s largest anthropogenic hg emissions region unep 2019 studies have found that the hg export from asian rivers is increasing indicating that the environmental geochemistry of hg still needs more attention worldwide especially in asia amos et al 2014 liu et al 2021 the global cryosphere is shrinking at an accelerating rate ipcc 2021 glacial ablation and retreat are important processes affected by cryosphere change and have attracted increasing attention huss et al 2017 the tibetan plateau and its surrounding areas are the regions with the widest distribution of glaciers and the most severe glacier retreat in middle and low latitudes yao et al 2012 glacial retreat affects downstream ecosystems through a series of physical and chemical processes slemmons et al 2013 specifically the rapid melting of glaciers can release historically deposited hg paudyal et al 2017 sun et al 2017 and persistent organic pollutants chen et al 2019 into meltwater that can be transported downstream glaciers in the himalayan region are widely distributed and constitute an important part of the asian water tower immerzeel et al 2020 kang et al 2022 the retreat of glaciers potentially threatens the water sources and environments of many major rivers in asia a few studies have reported the level and control factors of ions and trace elements in snow ice and river water in the himalayas lee et al 2008 paudyal et al 2015 as well as the amount of hg transport from a trans himalayan river sun et al 2018 currently there have been few studies on the hg concentrations in glacial meltwater runoff and hg export in the himalayas in the context of climate change more research on the hg transport process in glacier meltwater runoff in the himalayas would be helpful for exploring the role of glacier ablation in regional and even global hg cycles in this study a systematic and continuous sampling campaign was carried out in the rongbuk glacier fed basin rgb on the north slope of mt everest in the middle himalayas to explore the distribution characteristics and transport process of hg in meltwater runoff this study was the first to systematically observe and analyze hg transport in glacial meltwater runoff in the himalayan region based on long term observations and estimated runoff this study estimated hg export from glacial meltwater runoff in the rgb and the whole himalayas in addition potential changes in hg transport in glacier fed runoff in the himalayan region under a changing climate were assessed the results could reveal the role of glacier melt on the regional hg cycle and serve as a valuable reference for assessing the environmental impact of rapid cryosphere change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area rongbuk glacier is a typical subcontinental glacier located on the north slope of mt everest and its meltwater flows into the rgb fig 1 the rgb covers an area of approximately 280 km2 it has an annual precipitation of approximately 300 500 mm and 6 9 of the glaciers in the basin are covered by surface moraines ye et al 2015 some studies have indicated that the glacier area decreased from 144 km2 in 1974 to 129 km2 in 2008 shrinking by nearly 15 km2 approximately 10 4 in just a few decades with a retreat rate of 5 5 8 7 m per year ren et al 2004 with the retreat of glaciers the area of proglacial lakes increased from 0 05 km2 n 16 in 1974 to 0 71 km2 n 87 in 2008 ye et al 2015 the rapid warming of the mt everest region has caused a continuous retreat of glaciers which directly affects meltwater runoff a study comparing the runoff in the rgb in 1959 and 2005 found that the runoff of the rongbuk river increased by 5 107 m3 in 2005 mainly due to the increase in glacier melting caused by temperature increases liu et al 2006 rongbuk glacier meltwater runoff flows through the rongbuk valley in the upstream the valley floor is flat with small fluctuations and the section width is usually about 700 800 m the downstream of the valley becomes slightly narrow and the width values are mostly about 400 550 m with large topographic fluctuations 2 2 sample collection and in situ observation from june 2019 to may 2020 continuous sampling and observation were carried out in the rgb of mt everest in the middle himalayas and a systematic intensive sampling campaign with in situ observations was carried out in the intense ablation period august of 2020 the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 and table s1 the continuous sampling method included a collection of 4 6 water samples per month at a fixed site site 5 from june 2019 to may 2020 an intensive sampling campaign was conducted on one day at the end of july 2020 the upstream and downstream intensive observation points were at sampling sites 3 and 4 respectively the hydrological observation point was located at sampling site 5 water samples from the inlet site 1 and outlet site 3 of the proglacial lake and meltwater runoff were collected sampling of both the upstream and the downstream runoff was conducted simultaneously with a sampling frequency of once every 2 h within one day from 9 00 to 21 00 water samples were collected with 250 ml fluorinated high density polyethylene plastic bottles flpe the blank levels and absorbability of the flpe plastic bottles were laboratory tested and met our field sampling needs blank hg concentration 0 1 ng l during sampling only surface water was collected without disturbing the bottom sediment prior to sampling the sampling bottle was washed out three times with the water to be collected after collection the samples were stored in a refrigerator and transported to the laboratory for pretreatment all dissolved hg dhg and dissolved methyl hg dmehg samples were processed in the key laboratory of tibetan environment changes and land surface processes at the chinese academy of sciences through a filtration system using a hydrophilic pvdf filter membrane pore size 0 45 μm diameter 47 mm durapore millipore no less than 10 of the filter bank was inserted during filtering the thg and mehg samples were acidified by 0 5 volume ratio hydrochloric acid bv iii grade mos in the field to prevent the transformation of hg during transportation and adsorption to the bottles the runoff observation site in this study was located at sampling site 5 fig 1 where a hydrological monitoring section was set up runoff observation and sample collection were carried out simultaneously the flow velocity was monitored by an ls1206b rotor current meter and the mean section method was used to estimate the runoff streamflow the streamflow was obtained by multiplying the cross section area of the runoff by the flow velocity 2 3 sample analysis both the thg and the dhg were quantified by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs as recommended by the united states environmental protection agency usepa epa 2002 using a tekran 2600 hg analyzer at the state key laboratory of cryospheric sciences in lanzhou china specifically 50 μl of brcl reagent solution was added to each of the samples to oxidize all hg species to hg2 and the excess brcl was removed by nh2oh hcl after which the hg2 was reduced to hg0 by a sncl2 solution for quantification by fluorescence spectrophotometry sun et al 2018 2020 then the particulate hg phg was calculated as the difference between thg and dhg phg thg dhg to control for data quality a standard solution with a thg concentration of 5 ng l was added accounting for 10 of the total quantity and the results showed that the recovery rate was between 95 and 103 15 of the total number of samples was added as the instrument blank and the resulting value was 0 1 ng l the field blank sample levels were also tested at the same time and their values were also 0 1 ng l the tmehg and dmehg values were determined using usepa method 1630 which involves distillation water ethylation purging trapping and cvafs epa 1998 the tekran model 2750 distillation system was used to distill the samples after distillation appropriate amounts of glacial acetic acid with acetate buffer were added to adjust the ph to a range of 4 5 4 9 and then an ethyl reagent was added sodium tetraethyl borate nabet4 after half an hour of reaction time the test was carried out using a tekran 2700 automatic mehg analyzer at the state key laboratory of tibetan plateau earth system resources and environment the recoveries in the distillation process were 83 112 in line with the range of 67 133 provided in usepa method 1630 epa 1998 in addition the test results of the method and the instrument blank were both 0 005 ng l indicating the reliability of the pretreatment method and the instrument test results 2 4 data analysis data analysis was completed using spss 20 0 and origin 9 0 software pearson s and spearman s correlation analyses were conducted a nonparametric test kruskal wallis test was used to compare differences between different data groups correlation analyses and difference tests were considered to be significant at p 0 05 redundancy analysis rda was used to determine factors suitable for revealing the hg variation in all samples 2 4 1 distribution coefficient studies have proposed the use of a hg distribution coefficient k d to study the transport of hg between dissolved and particulate phases brigham et al 2009 grigal 2002 zheng et al 2010 the specific calculation method of k d is as follows 1 k d p h g t s p d h g where k d is the distribution coefficient phg is the particulate hg tsp is the total suspended particles and dhg is the dissolved hg the k d values for mehg were calculated similarly 2 4 2 hg export flux from rgb the export fluxes of thg were estimated using the product of the average thg concentrations site 5 and the annual runoff the flux was calculated by eq 2 2 f t h g r c t h g where f t h g is the thg export flux of meltwater runoff g r is the annual runoff m3 c t h g is the average value of thg ng l the mehg flux was estimated using the same method runoff were only observed for a few months in 2020 and is insufficient for calculation of total yearly hg export the most recent available yearly runoff of rgb was reported as approximately 2 72 108 m3 for 2010 zhang 2018 which can be used as reference to make the estimation assuming the increasing rate of runoff is steady and same to the reported data of 1959 2005 1 08 106 m3 year the 2020 runoff can be estimated as 2 83 108 m3 2 4 3 extrapolated hg export flux from the himalayas in this study the average thg concentration of the rongbuk glacier runoff was used to represent the hg level of meltwater runoff in the himalayan region the average hg concentration was multiplied by the annual flow of meltwater runoff estimated by bliss et al 2014 to roughly calculate the hg export flux from meltwater runoff in the himalayas bliss et al 2014 used a temperature index mass balance model to project monthly glacier runoff from all mountain glaciers and ice caps in the world and their results showed that the annual average glacier meltwater runoff in the himalayan region was currently 216 km3 3 results 3 1 characteristics of water quality parameters table 1 shows the characteristics of the water quality parameters of the meltwater runoff from sites 3 4 and 5 during the observation period the ph ranged from 8 2 9 2 showing weak alkalinity the conductivity varied greatly from 76 to 174 μs cm indicating that water ions vary concomitantly with glacier ablation and runoff transport the dissolved organic carbon concentration was relatively low with an average concentration of 0 301 mg l and a variation range of 0 189 0 633 mg l both the tsp 136 2 907 0 mg l and turbidity 80 6 637 7 ntu showed a large variation range indicating that the meltwater runoff has been changing significantly during the sampling period 3 2 hg concentrations and speciation distribution as shown in table 2 the thg concentration in the rgb ranged from 0 41 to 6 23 ng l with an average of 1 56 0 85 ng l n 88 the tmehg concentration ranged from 0 020 to 0 129 ng l with an average of 0 057 0 025 ng l n 61 both the thg and the tmehg concentrations in the rgb were comparable with those in other basins of the tibetan plateau paudyal et al 2017 sun et al 2017 and those of arctic rivers ovsepyan 2018 additionally the thg concentration was lower than the global average of 5 0 ng l in natural rivers mason et al 1994 and significantly lower than that in rivers affected by human activities liu et al 2012 table s2 the thg and mehg in the runoff water of the rgb were mainly found in the particulate form in which the ratio of phg to thg was 50 while the ratio of pmehg to tmehg was generally more than 70 fig s1 in this study the log transformed distribution coefficient log k d ranges of thg and tmehg were 3 3 5 4 and 3 3 5 8 respectively which were close to or slightly lower than those of the yarlung zangbo river basin on the tibetan plateau 4 5 5 6 and 3 1 5 1 zheng et al 2010 and the unpolluted patuxent river in the united states 4 8 5 7 and 3 8 4 0 benoit et al 1998 the seasonal variations in thg and phg were significant reaching a summer peak in july and then decreasing gradually fig 2 table s3 the concentrations of both thg and phg were lowest in winter and then increased in spring there was no significant seasonal variation in the dhg concentration the dhg was only slightly higher in the initial ablation period and the overall seasonal variation was not significant the thg concentration in the meltwater runoff showed a diurnal variation at both upstream and downstream observation sites but the peak time of thg differed fig 3 table s4 upstream thg reached its peak at approximately 17 00 while it peaked at the downstream observation site at approximately 19 00 the thg concentration in the rgb decreased from upstream to downstream fig 4 in addition the thg concentrations in the inlet runoff 2 49 0 51 ng l were higher than those in the proglacial lake 1 69 0 02 ng l water and the outlet runoff 2 10 0 27 ng l decreased by 32 and 16 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 temporal variation in hg concentration both the thg and the phg concentrations in meltwater runoff were generally affected by glacier melting reaching a peak in the summer melting period and reaching the lowest level in winter when the temperature was low the severe ablation of glaciers in summer leads to high ratio of meltwater replenishment liu et al 2010 intensive glacier ablation has a strengthened effect on hg transport in meltwater runoff sun et al 2017 due to the low temperature in winter the glacier meltwater supply was reduced or even absent the water supply in the basin was mainly precipitation and groundwater with limited runoff and weak water chemical processes resulting in low hg concentrations in the runoff the concentrations of the speciated hg increased during the initial ablation period which may have been affected by the ion pulse effect during the initial stage of snowmelt dommergue 2003 the diurnal variation characteristics of thg and mehg were obtained by simultaneous sampling observations from the upstream and downstream reaches of the rgb the times of the peak thg concentration in the upstream and downstream runoff were presented in section 3 2 in general the diurnal variation in hg transport by meltwater runoff was closely related to the variation in streamflow affected by the intensity of glacier melting sun et al 2017 similarly the diurnal variation in the mehg concentration and its ratio to thg in meltwater runoff was significant in the upstream region but not in the downstream region the upstream observation site was close to the glacier which was where the mehg concentration was likely greatly affected by glacier ablation and proglacial lakes a study revealed that a hg methylation gene hgca may exist in bacteria in glacial cryoconite and polluted layers of snow and ice on glacier surfaces and would be an important source of mehg in glacier meltwater zhang et al 2020 significant microbial activity on the surface and bottom of the glacier may affect the methylation of hg in glacier snow and ice zhang et al 2020 hence the glacier covered area in the rgb may elevate the mehg concentration in the meltwater runoff in the upstream region in addition there was a good correlation between mehg and tsp at the upstream point site 3 but no significant correlation at the downstream point site 4 fig s2 this result possibly because the amount of mehg bound to tsp decrease as the runoff moves downstream 4 2 factors controlling the hg concentrations in meltwater runoff correlation analysis of the thg speciated hg and water chemical parameters was performed there was no significant correlation between the thg and dhg or the dissolved organic carbon doc regarding the seasonal variation fig 5 a indicating that the thg in meltwater runoff was not controlled by dissolved matter the thg was significantly correlated with the phg tsp turbidity and streamflow of the water samples fig 5a which suggested that the phg was the dominant factor affecting the distribution of runoff hg in the rgb the diurnal variation in thg was also positively correlated with the phg and tsp fig 5b generally the phg concentration is mainly controlled by the amount of tsp in runoff nagorski et al 2014 rigét et al 2011 while the tsp concentration is closely related to streamflow wulf et al 2012 these results were consistent with those of the koshi river basin in the trans himalayan region sun et al 2020 and the zhadang glacier basin and dongkemadi glacier basin on the tibetan plateau paudyal et al 2017 sun et al 2018 the rda results showed that tsp and streamflow were important factors affecting the thg and phg concentrations fig 6 in conclusion the hg concentration in the rgb was mainly affected by the tsp in the runoff the log k d of the thg was affected by the tsp and decreased gradually with increasing tsp concentration fig s3 a trend of increasing solids concentration with the decreasing k d of heavy metals has been observed in laboratory experiments and in natural waters brigham et al 2009 o connor and connolly 1980 yu et al 2022 compared with some non glacier basins although the tsp was higher the log k d of the thg was slightly lower in the rgb runoff this phenomenon attributed to increasing concentrations of particulates causing increasing amounts of filter passing colloidally bound constituents brigham et al 2009 additionally the sizes and surface areas of particles could affect the equilibrium state of hg between the solid and liquid phases yu et al 2022 the direct erosion of meltwater runoff in the rgb could cause larger particle sizes even if the particle concentration reached a higher value the particle phase still had difficulty adsorbing part of the dhg additionally there was no significant correlation between log k d and doc fig s3 the doc concentration of meltwater runoff in the zrb was generally low and the seasonal variation was not obvious thus doc had little influence on the distribution of hg speciation differences in suspended sediment export have an impact on hg concentration and speciation the seasonal variations in the streamflow of the himalaya rivers caused a seasonal trend for sediment transport bharati et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 the terminal of the rgb mainly has bare land with a high elevation gradient and frequent freeze thaw processes the erosion effect of meltwater runoff in the basin facilitated variable tsp export the terminal area of glaciers was a typical hg transport and erosion zone for meltwater runoff and this area had high speed of the streamflow and the high tsp concentrations in hg transport sun et al 2018 generally with decreasing altitude the terrain gradient in the glacier fed watershed of the tibetan plateau gradually stabilizes and the vegetation coverage gradually increases slope change coupled with an increase in vegetation cover may eventually affect the erosion of bedrock and riverbeds by runoff reducing tsp concentrations and leading to a decline in thg concentrations from upstream to downstream sun et al 2017 moreover turbidity in meltwater runoff had a significant positive correlation with tsp and both had a significant correlation with thg fig 5 a and b nasrabadi et al 2016 found that water turbidity could serve as a proxy of suspended solids and both turbidity and tsp were good indicators of pollutants hence water turbidity can be used for predicting the export of tsp and hg in meltwater runoff in the future 4 3 hg transport affected by proglacial lakes after glacial meltwater runoff flows through the proglacial lake the tsp settles with the decrease in water velocity which may reduce the thg concentration in the runoff water from the lake for example sun et al 2016 sampled and analyzed glacier runoff and proglacial lakes in the qiangyong glacier basin on the southern tibetan plateau and found that the thg in the runoff entering the proglacial lake 2 5 ng l was higher than that in the outlet flow 2 0 ng l decreased by 20 our study also found a decrease in the hg concentration in runoff flowing through proglacial lakes indicating that the lake may play the role of a sink in the process of hg transport in glacier runoff proglacial lakes act as natural reservoirs for meltwater runoff in general reservoirs have a significant effect on hg transport and transformation in runoff liu et al 2019 in recent decades the number of proglacial lakes has increased several folds while the area has increased by approximately 140 times ye et al 2015 the expansion of proglacial lakes would likely lower the levels and amounts of hg from runoff hence proglacial lakes have a sedimentation effect on the transport of hg and reduce the export of hg 4 4 estimation of hg export flux from glacial meltwater runoff based on the average hg concentration and annual runoff the fluxes of thg and mehg in rongbuk glacier meltwater runoff were estimated the total export flux of thg in the whole ablation period was approximately 441 g the watershed area of the observation area was approximately 280 km2 thus the estimated hg yield of the watershed was estimated as 1 6 μg m2 year in addition the total export of mehg from glacier meltwater downstream was approximately 16 g in the whole ablation period and the mehg yield was calculated to be 0 06 μg m2 year the hg export flux and yield of meltwater runoff in the rgb were lower than those of other glacierized basins on the tibetan plateau 2 74 μg m2 year for zhadang and 19 12 μg m2 year for dongkemadi paudyal et al 2017 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 and those of some rivers in the arctic region emmerton et al 2013 shakun et al 2012 sondergaard et al 2015 first this difference could be because of low hg levels in both the glaciers and the runoff which was evidenced by zhang et al 2012 who found that the hg concentrations in glacier snow and ice were decreasing from the north to south on the tibetan plateau the rongbuk glacier is in the southern tibetan plateau far from human pollution and the low hg concentration of its snow and ice may lead to the low hg levels released into the glacier runoff during glacier melting moreover many proglacial lakes are developed in glacier terminals and have a sedimentation effect on hg transport in runoff resulting in reduced quantity of hg being exported to glaciers downstream in addition the area of the rgb is more than 20 times greater than that of other glacier fed basins that have been reported on the tibetan plateau the combination of the larger basin area and the lower hg export flux was one of the important reasons for the low hg yield 4 5 hg export from meltwater runoff in the himalayas under a changing climate the annual export of hg from himalayan glacier runoff was estimated to be 337 kg year this result was simply extrapolated by multiplying the average hg concentration 1 56 ng l in the rongbuk glacier runoff and the annual flow of meltwater 216 km3 in the himalayas as explained in section 2 in the future the hg export from meltwater runoff will likely increase considering the meltwater runoff has been projected to increase in the next two or three decades immerzeel et al 2013 nonetheless it is worth noting that proglacial lakes have been continually developing and expanding across the himalayan glaciered terrain in response to climate change zheng et al 2021 the emerging proglacial lakes may exert ambiguous effects on the glacier exported hg under changing climate on one hand the sedimentation effect of proglacial lakes as revealed and discussed earlier could lower the levels and amounts of hg in the glacier runoff on the other hand proglacial lakes are inherently unstable and prone to outburst which can lead to an instantaneous release of hg stored in lake waters and sediments this has been revealed by an earlier study in zackenberg river in northeastern greenland demonstrating that the glacial lake outbursts contributed to more than 31 of the total annual hg transported in 4 out of 5 years during 2013 2019 sondergaard et al 2015 to sum up in the context of simultaneous increasing of glacier runoff and proglacial lakes the transport and fate of glacier exported hg are complicated and undetermined 5 conclusion this study quantifies thg and mehg transport and export from a typical glacier runoff in the himalayas and reveals the control factors and potential changes of glacier exported hg overall the thg and mehg concentrations in the meltwater runoff from the rgb were comparable to the global background levels and were mainly affected by the tsp the significant seasonal and diurnal variations in hg were linked to glacier ablation the calculated export yields of thg 1 6 μg m2 year and mehg 0 06 μg m2 year from rgb downstream were lower than those of other glacier fed basins on the tibetan plateau and lower than those of some rivers in the arctic region when flowing through the proglacial lake the thg concentrations decreased by 32 and 15 in the proglacial lake water and in the outlet respectively indicating that the proglacial lakes had a sedimentation effect on the hg transport in the future the transport and fate of glacier exported hg are complicated and undetermined under the context of simultaneous increase in glacier runoff and proglacial lakes we suggested that integrated monitoring and study of hg in glacier runoff and glacial lake are needed for a better assessment on the variation of glacier exported hg and potential environmental risks on downstream ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors

15959,glaciers in the himalayan region have been receding rapidly in recent decades drawing increasing concerns about the release of legacy pollutants e g mercury hg to investigate the distribution transport and controlling factors of hg in glacier fed runoff from june 2019 to july 2020 a continuous monitoring and an intensive sampling campaign were conducted in the rongbuk glacier fed basin rgb on the north slope of mt everest in the middle himalayas the total hg thg and methyl hg mehg concentrations were 1 56 0 85 and 0 057 0 025 ng l respectively which were comparable to the global background levels and were mainly affected by the total suspended particulate matter tsp in addition thg and mehg showed significant diurnal variations with peak values appearing at approximately 17 00 upstream and 19 00 downstream based on the annual runoff and average hg concentration the annual export fluxes of thg and mehg were estimated to be 441 g and 16 g respectively the yields of thg and mehg in the rgb were 1 6 and 0 06 μg m2 year respectively currently the annual hg export of meltwater runoff in the himalayan region is approximately 337 kg year when flowing through the proglacial lake the thg concentrations decreased by 32 and 15 in the proglacial lake water and in the outlet respectively indicating that proglacial lakes had a sedimentation effect on the hg transport the hg export from meltwater runoff in the himalayas will likely increase considering the meltwater runoff has been projected to increase in the future nonetheless emerging proglacial lakes may exert ambiguous effects on the glacier exported hg under changing climate proglacial lakes could lower the levels and amounts of hg in the glacier runoff whereas the outburst of proglacial lakes could lead to an instantaneous release of hg stored in lake waters and sediments our analysis shed light on the environmental impact of glacier retreat in the himalayas and highlighted the need for integrated monitoring and study of hg in glacier runoff and glacial lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords himalayas rongbuk glacier glacier runoff proglacial lake hg export 1 introduction mercury hg is a global pollutant that can be transported over long distances in gaseous form and it has drawn attention from many countries and organizations because of its persistence high toxicity and bioaccumulation potential jiang et al 2006 krabbenhoft and sunderland 2013 after atmospheric long distance transmission hg eventually sinks into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in aquatic ecosystems inorganic hg can be transformed into organic forms e g methyl hg mehg which accumulate and amplify in the food chain and may eventually cause fatal toxicity to organisms and potentially humans douglas et al 2012 fisher et al 2012 the 2018 global hg assessment identified asia as the world s largest anthropogenic hg emissions region unep 2019 studies have found that the hg export from asian rivers is increasing indicating that the environmental geochemistry of hg still needs more attention worldwide especially in asia amos et al 2014 liu et al 2021 the global cryosphere is shrinking at an accelerating rate ipcc 2021 glacial ablation and retreat are important processes affected by cryosphere change and have attracted increasing attention huss et al 2017 the tibetan plateau and its surrounding areas are the regions with the widest distribution of glaciers and the most severe glacier retreat in middle and low latitudes yao et al 2012 glacial retreat affects downstream ecosystems through a series of physical and chemical processes slemmons et al 2013 specifically the rapid melting of glaciers can release historically deposited hg paudyal et al 2017 sun et al 2017 and persistent organic pollutants chen et al 2019 into meltwater that can be transported downstream glaciers in the himalayan region are widely distributed and constitute an important part of the asian water tower immerzeel et al 2020 kang et al 2022 the retreat of glaciers potentially threatens the water sources and environments of many major rivers in asia a few studies have reported the level and control factors of ions and trace elements in snow ice and river water in the himalayas lee et al 2008 paudyal et al 2015 as well as the amount of hg transport from a trans himalayan river sun et al 2018 currently there have been few studies on the hg concentrations in glacial meltwater runoff and hg export in the himalayas in the context of climate change more research on the hg transport process in glacier meltwater runoff in the himalayas would be helpful for exploring the role of glacier ablation in regional and even global hg cycles in this study a systematic and continuous sampling campaign was carried out in the rongbuk glacier fed basin rgb on the north slope of mt everest in the middle himalayas to explore the distribution characteristics and transport process of hg in meltwater runoff this study was the first to systematically observe and analyze hg transport in glacial meltwater runoff in the himalayan region based on long term observations and estimated runoff this study estimated hg export from glacial meltwater runoff in the rgb and the whole himalayas in addition potential changes in hg transport in glacier fed runoff in the himalayan region under a changing climate were assessed the results could reveal the role of glacier melt on the regional hg cycle and serve as a valuable reference for assessing the environmental impact of rapid cryosphere change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area rongbuk glacier is a typical subcontinental glacier located on the north slope of mt everest and its meltwater flows into the rgb fig 1 the rgb covers an area of approximately 280 km2 it has an annual precipitation of approximately 300 500 mm and 6 9 of the glaciers in the basin are covered by surface moraines ye et al 2015 some studies have indicated that the glacier area decreased from 144 km2 in 1974 to 129 km2 in 2008 shrinking by nearly 15 km2 approximately 10 4 in just a few decades with a retreat rate of 5 5 8 7 m per year ren et al 2004 with the retreat of glaciers the area of proglacial lakes increased from 0 05 km2 n 16 in 1974 to 0 71 km2 n 87 in 2008 ye et al 2015 the rapid warming of the mt everest region has caused a continuous retreat of glaciers which directly affects meltwater runoff a study comparing the runoff in the rgb in 1959 and 2005 found that the runoff of the rongbuk river increased by 5 107 m3 in 2005 mainly due to the increase in glacier melting caused by temperature increases liu et al 2006 rongbuk glacier meltwater runoff flows through the rongbuk valley in the upstream the valley floor is flat with small fluctuations and the section width is usually about 700 800 m the downstream of the valley becomes slightly narrow and the width values are mostly about 400 550 m with large topographic fluctuations 2 2 sample collection and in situ observation from june 2019 to may 2020 continuous sampling and observation were carried out in the rgb of mt everest in the middle himalayas and a systematic intensive sampling campaign with in situ observations was carried out in the intense ablation period august of 2020 the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 and table s1 the continuous sampling method included a collection of 4 6 water samples per month at a fixed site site 5 from june 2019 to may 2020 an intensive sampling campaign was conducted on one day at the end of july 2020 the upstream and downstream intensive observation points were at sampling sites 3 and 4 respectively the hydrological observation point was located at sampling site 5 water samples from the inlet site 1 and outlet site 3 of the proglacial lake and meltwater runoff were collected sampling of both the upstream and the downstream runoff was conducted simultaneously with a sampling frequency of once every 2 h within one day from 9 00 to 21 00 water samples were collected with 250 ml fluorinated high density polyethylene plastic bottles flpe the blank levels and absorbability of the flpe plastic bottles were laboratory tested and met our field sampling needs blank hg concentration 0 1 ng l during sampling only surface water was collected without disturbing the bottom sediment prior to sampling the sampling bottle was washed out three times with the water to be collected after collection the samples were stored in a refrigerator and transported to the laboratory for pretreatment all dissolved hg dhg and dissolved methyl hg dmehg samples were processed in the key laboratory of tibetan environment changes and land surface processes at the chinese academy of sciences through a filtration system using a hydrophilic pvdf filter membrane pore size 0 45 μm diameter 47 mm durapore millipore no less than 10 of the filter bank was inserted during filtering the thg and mehg samples were acidified by 0 5 volume ratio hydrochloric acid bv iii grade mos in the field to prevent the transformation of hg during transportation and adsorption to the bottles the runoff observation site in this study was located at sampling site 5 fig 1 where a hydrological monitoring section was set up runoff observation and sample collection were carried out simultaneously the flow velocity was monitored by an ls1206b rotor current meter and the mean section method was used to estimate the runoff streamflow the streamflow was obtained by multiplying the cross section area of the runoff by the flow velocity 2 3 sample analysis both the thg and the dhg were quantified by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs as recommended by the united states environmental protection agency usepa epa 2002 using a tekran 2600 hg analyzer at the state key laboratory of cryospheric sciences in lanzhou china specifically 50 μl of brcl reagent solution was added to each of the samples to oxidize all hg species to hg2 and the excess brcl was removed by nh2oh hcl after which the hg2 was reduced to hg0 by a sncl2 solution for quantification by fluorescence spectrophotometry sun et al 2018 2020 then the particulate hg phg was calculated as the difference between thg and dhg phg thg dhg to control for data quality a standard solution with a thg concentration of 5 ng l was added accounting for 10 of the total quantity and the results showed that the recovery rate was between 95 and 103 15 of the total number of samples was added as the instrument blank and the resulting value was 0 1 ng l the field blank sample levels were also tested at the same time and their values were also 0 1 ng l the tmehg and dmehg values were determined using usepa method 1630 which involves distillation water ethylation purging trapping and cvafs epa 1998 the tekran model 2750 distillation system was used to distill the samples after distillation appropriate amounts of glacial acetic acid with acetate buffer were added to adjust the ph to a range of 4 5 4 9 and then an ethyl reagent was added sodium tetraethyl borate nabet4 after half an hour of reaction time the test was carried out using a tekran 2700 automatic mehg analyzer at the state key laboratory of tibetan plateau earth system resources and environment the recoveries in the distillation process were 83 112 in line with the range of 67 133 provided in usepa method 1630 epa 1998 in addition the test results of the method and the instrument blank were both 0 005 ng l indicating the reliability of the pretreatment method and the instrument test results 2 4 data analysis data analysis was completed using spss 20 0 and origin 9 0 software pearson s and spearman s correlation analyses were conducted a nonparametric test kruskal wallis test was used to compare differences between different data groups correlation analyses and difference tests were considered to be significant at p 0 05 redundancy analysis rda was used to determine factors suitable for revealing the hg variation in all samples 2 4 1 distribution coefficient studies have proposed the use of a hg distribution coefficient k d to study the transport of hg between dissolved and particulate phases brigham et al 2009 grigal 2002 zheng et al 2010 the specific calculation method of k d is as follows 1 k d p h g t s p d h g where k d is the distribution coefficient phg is the particulate hg tsp is the total suspended particles and dhg is the dissolved hg the k d values for mehg were calculated similarly 2 4 2 hg export flux from rgb the export fluxes of thg were estimated using the product of the average thg concentrations site 5 and the annual runoff the flux was calculated by eq 2 2 f t h g r c t h g where f t h g is the thg export flux of meltwater runoff g r is the annual runoff m3 c t h g is the average value of thg ng l the mehg flux was estimated using the same method runoff were only observed for a few months in 2020 and is insufficient for calculation of total yearly hg export the most recent available yearly runoff of rgb was reported as approximately 2 72 108 m3 for 2010 zhang 2018 which can be used as reference to make the estimation assuming the increasing rate of runoff is steady and same to the reported data of 1959 2005 1 08 106 m3 year the 2020 runoff can be estimated as 2 83 108 m3 2 4 3 extrapolated hg export flux from the himalayas in this study the average thg concentration of the rongbuk glacier runoff was used to represent the hg level of meltwater runoff in the himalayan region the average hg concentration was multiplied by the annual flow of meltwater runoff estimated by bliss et al 2014 to roughly calculate the hg export flux from meltwater runoff in the himalayas bliss et al 2014 used a temperature index mass balance model to project monthly glacier runoff from all mountain glaciers and ice caps in the world and their results showed that the annual average glacier meltwater runoff in the himalayan region was currently 216 km3 3 results 3 1 characteristics of water quality parameters table 1 shows the characteristics of the water quality parameters of the meltwater runoff from sites 3 4 and 5 during the observation period the ph ranged from 8 2 9 2 showing weak alkalinity the conductivity varied greatly from 76 to 174 μs cm indicating that water ions vary concomitantly with glacier ablation and runoff transport the dissolved organic carbon concentration was relatively low with an average concentration of 0 301 mg l and a variation range of 0 189 0 633 mg l both the tsp 136 2 907 0 mg l and turbidity 80 6 637 7 ntu showed a large variation range indicating that the meltwater runoff has been changing significantly during the sampling period 3 2 hg concentrations and speciation distribution as shown in table 2 the thg concentration in the rgb ranged from 0 41 to 6 23 ng l with an average of 1 56 0 85 ng l n 88 the tmehg concentration ranged from 0 020 to 0 129 ng l with an average of 0 057 0 025 ng l n 61 both the thg and the tmehg concentrations in the rgb were comparable with those in other basins of the tibetan plateau paudyal et al 2017 sun et al 2017 and those of arctic rivers ovsepyan 2018 additionally the thg concentration was lower than the global average of 5 0 ng l in natural rivers mason et al 1994 and significantly lower than that in rivers affected by human activities liu et al 2012 table s2 the thg and mehg in the runoff water of the rgb were mainly found in the particulate form in which the ratio of phg to thg was 50 while the ratio of pmehg to tmehg was generally more than 70 fig s1 in this study the log transformed distribution coefficient log k d ranges of thg and tmehg were 3 3 5 4 and 3 3 5 8 respectively which were close to or slightly lower than those of the yarlung zangbo river basin on the tibetan plateau 4 5 5 6 and 3 1 5 1 zheng et al 2010 and the unpolluted patuxent river in the united states 4 8 5 7 and 3 8 4 0 benoit et al 1998 the seasonal variations in thg and phg were significant reaching a summer peak in july and then decreasing gradually fig 2 table s3 the concentrations of both thg and phg were lowest in winter and then increased in spring there was no significant seasonal variation in the dhg concentration the dhg was only slightly higher in the initial ablation period and the overall seasonal variation was not significant the thg concentration in the meltwater runoff showed a diurnal variation at both upstream and downstream observation sites but the peak time of thg differed fig 3 table s4 upstream thg reached its peak at approximately 17 00 while it peaked at the downstream observation site at approximately 19 00 the thg concentration in the rgb decreased from upstream to downstream fig 4 in addition the thg concentrations in the inlet runoff 2 49 0 51 ng l were higher than those in the proglacial lake 1 69 0 02 ng l water and the outlet runoff 2 10 0 27 ng l decreased by 32 and 16 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 temporal variation in hg concentration both the thg and the phg concentrations in meltwater runoff were generally affected by glacier melting reaching a peak in the summer melting period and reaching the lowest level in winter when the temperature was low the severe ablation of glaciers in summer leads to high ratio of meltwater replenishment liu et al 2010 intensive glacier ablation has a strengthened effect on hg transport in meltwater runoff sun et al 2017 due to the low temperature in winter the glacier meltwater supply was reduced or even absent the water supply in the basin was mainly precipitation and groundwater with limited runoff and weak water chemical processes resulting in low hg concentrations in the runoff the concentrations of the speciated hg increased during the initial ablation period which may have been affected by the ion pulse effect during the initial stage of snowmelt dommergue 2003 the diurnal variation characteristics of thg and mehg were obtained by simultaneous sampling observations from the upstream and downstream reaches of the rgb the times of the peak thg concentration in the upstream and downstream runoff were presented in section 3 2 in general the diurnal variation in hg transport by meltwater runoff was closely related to the variation in streamflow affected by the intensity of glacier melting sun et al 2017 similarly the diurnal variation in the mehg concentration and its ratio to thg in meltwater runoff was significant in the upstream region but not in the downstream region the upstream observation site was close to the glacier which was where the mehg concentration was likely greatly affected by glacier ablation and proglacial lakes a study revealed that a hg methylation gene hgca may exist in bacteria in glacial cryoconite and polluted layers of snow and ice on glacier surfaces and would be an important source of mehg in glacier meltwater zhang et al 2020 significant microbial activity on the surface and bottom of the glacier may affect the methylation of hg in glacier snow and ice zhang et al 2020 hence the glacier covered area in the rgb may elevate the mehg concentration in the meltwater runoff in the upstream region in addition there was a good correlation between mehg and tsp at the upstream point site 3 but no significant correlation at the downstream point site 4 fig s2 this result possibly because the amount of mehg bound to tsp decrease as the runoff moves downstream 4 2 factors controlling the hg concentrations in meltwater runoff correlation analysis of the thg speciated hg and water chemical parameters was performed there was no significant correlation between the thg and dhg or the dissolved organic carbon doc regarding the seasonal variation fig 5 a indicating that the thg in meltwater runoff was not controlled by dissolved matter the thg was significantly correlated with the phg tsp turbidity and streamflow of the water samples fig 5a which suggested that the phg was the dominant factor affecting the distribution of runoff hg in the rgb the diurnal variation in thg was also positively correlated with the phg and tsp fig 5b generally the phg concentration is mainly controlled by the amount of tsp in runoff nagorski et al 2014 rigét et al 2011 while the tsp concentration is closely related to streamflow wulf et al 2012 these results were consistent with those of the koshi river basin in the trans himalayan region sun et al 2020 and the zhadang glacier basin and dongkemadi glacier basin on the tibetan plateau paudyal et al 2017 sun et al 2018 the rda results showed that tsp and streamflow were important factors affecting the thg and phg concentrations fig 6 in conclusion the hg concentration in the rgb was mainly affected by the tsp in the runoff the log k d of the thg was affected by the tsp and decreased gradually with increasing tsp concentration fig s3 a trend of increasing solids concentration with the decreasing k d of heavy metals has been observed in laboratory experiments and in natural waters brigham et al 2009 o connor and connolly 1980 yu et al 2022 compared with some non glacier basins although the tsp was higher the log k d of the thg was slightly lower in the rgb runoff this phenomenon attributed to increasing concentrations of particulates causing increasing amounts of filter passing colloidally bound constituents brigham et al 2009 additionally the sizes and surface areas of particles could affect the equilibrium state of hg between the solid and liquid phases yu et al 2022 the direct erosion of meltwater runoff in the rgb could cause larger particle sizes even if the particle concentration reached a higher value the particle phase still had difficulty adsorbing part of the dhg additionally there was no significant correlation between log k d and doc fig s3 the doc concentration of meltwater runoff in the zrb was generally low and the seasonal variation was not obvious thus doc had little influence on the distribution of hg speciation differences in suspended sediment export have an impact on hg concentration and speciation the seasonal variations in the streamflow of the himalaya rivers caused a seasonal trend for sediment transport bharati et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 the terminal of the rgb mainly has bare land with a high elevation gradient and frequent freeze thaw processes the erosion effect of meltwater runoff in the basin facilitated variable tsp export the terminal area of glaciers was a typical hg transport and erosion zone for meltwater runoff and this area had high speed of the streamflow and the high tsp concentrations in hg transport sun et al 2018 generally with decreasing altitude the terrain gradient in the glacier fed watershed of the tibetan plateau gradually stabilizes and the vegetation coverage gradually increases slope change coupled with an increase in vegetation cover may eventually affect the erosion of bedrock and riverbeds by runoff reducing tsp concentrations and leading to a decline in thg concentrations from upstream to downstream sun et al 2017 moreover turbidity in meltwater runoff had a significant positive correlation with tsp and both had a significant correlation with thg fig 5 a and b nasrabadi et al 2016 found that water turbidity could serve as a proxy of suspended solids and both turbidity and tsp were good indicators of pollutants hence water turbidity can be used for predicting the export of tsp and hg in meltwater runoff in the future 4 3 hg transport affected by proglacial lakes after glacial meltwater runoff flows through the proglacial lake the tsp settles with the decrease in water velocity which may reduce the thg concentration in the runoff water from the lake for example sun et al 2016 sampled and analyzed glacier runoff and proglacial lakes in the qiangyong glacier basin on the southern tibetan plateau and found that the thg in the runoff entering the proglacial lake 2 5 ng l was higher than that in the outlet flow 2 0 ng l decreased by 20 our study also found a decrease in the hg concentration in runoff flowing through proglacial lakes indicating that the lake may play the role of a sink in the process of hg transport in glacier runoff proglacial lakes act as natural reservoirs for meltwater runoff in general reservoirs have a significant effect on hg transport and transformation in runoff liu et al 2019 in recent decades the number of proglacial lakes has increased several folds while the area has increased by approximately 140 times ye et al 2015 the expansion of proglacial lakes would likely lower the levels and amounts of hg from runoff hence proglacial lakes have a sedimentation effect on the transport of hg and reduce the export of hg 4 4 estimation of hg export flux from glacial meltwater runoff based on the average hg concentration and annual runoff the fluxes of thg and mehg in rongbuk glacier meltwater runoff were estimated the total export flux of thg in the whole ablation period was approximately 441 g the watershed area of the observation area was approximately 280 km2 thus the estimated hg yield of the watershed was estimated as 1 6 μg m2 year in addition the total export of mehg from glacier meltwater downstream was approximately 16 g in the whole ablation period and the mehg yield was calculated to be 0 06 μg m2 year the hg export flux and yield of meltwater runoff in the rgb were lower than those of other glacierized basins on the tibetan plateau 2 74 μg m2 year for zhadang and 19 12 μg m2 year for dongkemadi paudyal et al 2017 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 and those of some rivers in the arctic region emmerton et al 2013 shakun et al 2012 sondergaard et al 2015 first this difference could be because of low hg levels in both the glaciers and the runoff which was evidenced by zhang et al 2012 who found that the hg concentrations in glacier snow and ice were decreasing from the north to south on the tibetan plateau the rongbuk glacier is in the southern tibetan plateau far from human pollution and the low hg concentration of its snow and ice may lead to the low hg levels released into the glacier runoff during glacier melting moreover many proglacial lakes are developed in glacier terminals and have a sedimentation effect on hg transport in runoff resulting in reduced quantity of hg being exported to glaciers downstream in addition the area of the rgb is more than 20 times greater than that of other glacier fed basins that have been reported on the tibetan plateau the combination of the larger basin area and the lower hg export flux was one of the important reasons for the low hg yield 4 5 hg export from meltwater runoff in the himalayas under a changing climate the annual export of hg from himalayan glacier runoff was estimated to be 337 kg year this result was simply extrapolated by multiplying the average hg concentration 1 56 ng l in the rongbuk glacier runoff and the annual flow of meltwater 216 km3 in the himalayas as explained in section 2 in the future the hg export from meltwater runoff will likely increase considering the meltwater runoff has been projected to increase in the next two or three decades immerzeel et al 2013 nonetheless it is worth noting that proglacial lakes have been continually developing and expanding across the himalayan glaciered terrain in response to climate change zheng et al 2021 the emerging proglacial lakes may exert ambiguous effects on the glacier exported hg under changing climate on one hand the sedimentation effect of proglacial lakes as revealed and discussed earlier could lower the levels and amounts of hg in the glacier runoff on the other hand proglacial lakes are inherently unstable and prone to outburst which can lead to an instantaneous release of hg stored in lake waters and sediments this has been revealed by an earlier study in zackenberg river in northeastern greenland demonstrating that the glacial lake outbursts contributed to more than 31 of the total annual hg transported in 4 out of 5 years during 2013 2019 sondergaard et al 2015 to sum up in the context of simultaneous increasing of glacier runoff and proglacial lakes the transport and fate of glacier exported hg are complicated and undetermined 5 conclusion this study quantifies thg and mehg transport and export from a typical glacier runoff in the himalayas and reveals the control factors and potential changes of glacier exported hg overall the thg and mehg concentrations in the meltwater runoff from the rgb were comparable to the global background levels and were mainly affected by the tsp the significant seasonal and diurnal variations in hg were linked to glacier ablation the calculated export yields of thg 1 6 μg m2 year and mehg 0 06 μg m2 year from rgb downstream were lower than those of other glacier fed basins on the tibetan plateau and lower than those of some rivers in the arctic region when flowing through the proglacial lake the thg concentrations decreased by 32 and 15 in the proglacial lake water and in the outlet respectively indicating that the proglacial lakes had a sedimentation effect on the hg transport in the future the transport and fate of glacier exported hg are complicated and undetermined under the context of simultaneous increase in glacier runoff and proglacial lakes we suggested that integrated monitoring and study of hg in glacier runoff and glacial lake are needed for a better assessment on the variation of glacier exported hg and potential environmental risks on downstream ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors
