availability 1 introduction the global challenges of increasing population and food demand inflicts stress on limited land and water resources on which food production relies goddek et al 2019 moreover excessive demographic pressure and unsustainable practices result in the progressive breakdown in the productive capacity of land and water resources fao 2011 fish is the vital source of food and the long term trend since the late 1980 s in the global capture fisheries suggests that the marine resources have already approached the exploitation level and are beyond the bounds of resuscitation fao 2020 the impotence of the current aquaculture production to meet the ever increasing fish demand emphasizes adopting sustainable intensive farming interventions like aquaponics recirculating aquaculture system ras biofloc technology etc jena et al 2017 the aquaponics integration of aquaculture and hydroponics provides the dual benefit of wastewater recycling and food production and serves as an excellent solution to the problem which replaces infinite growth with sustainable development goddek et al 2019 the ongoing research in aquaponics mainly focused on optimization of component ratio and stocking density hussain et al 2014 nuwansi et al 2021 shete et al 2013 hydraulic loading rate in the aquaponic system endut et al 2010 nuwansi et al 2020 shete et al 2016 evaluation of different hydroponic media in aquaponics lennard and leonard 2006 shete et al 2017 utilization of inland saline groundwater in aquaponics thomas et al 2021 2019 etc the aquaponic system is found to yield comparable growth as conventional hydroponics delaide et al 2016 graber and junge 2009 despite the lower concentration of most of the nutrients like potassium k calcium ca iron fe etc in the system rakocy et al 2006 seawright et al 1998 the fish requires a minimal amount of metal ions like fe mn mg cu etc and a lower k 1 of the composition hence these nutrients are lower in fish diet and therefore in aquaculture effluent seawright et al 1998 yep and zheng 2019 for attaining the full potential of the system the nutrient dearth should be rectified via supplementation through the foliar application roosta 2014 or fertigation rakocy et al 2006 in accordance with the specific requirements during each physiological stage of the plant of the nutrient deficiencies in the aquaponic system potassium has been reported to be the most significant and a 45 times lower potassium level in the aquaponic system than hydroponics is the main reason for poor crop quality graber and junge 2009 yep and zheng 2019 potassium is an essential nutrient involved in functions like nutrition enzyme activation osmotic regulation growth and development of plants çalişkan and çalişkan 2019 hence its deficiency in the aquaponic system was reported by many researchers such as rakocy et al 2006 graber and junge 2009 seawright et al 1998 etc most of the research works on nutrient management in aquaponics was endeavored in fruit crops and medicinal herbs nozzi et al 2018 peter et al 2021 roosta 2014 roosta and hamidpour 2011 roosta and mohsenian 2012 yep and zheng 2020 zahan et al 2018 with only a few studies undertaken in leafy vegetables except for pak choi ru et al 2017 and lettuce nozzi et al 2018 green leafy vegetables are the most preferred crop in the aquaponic system owing to faster growth short growing period and better profitability bailey and ferrarezi 2017 yep and zheng 2019 spinacia oleracea l spinach belongs to the family chenopodiaceae which is rich in vitamin a c k and minerals like iron magnesium manganese calcium etc and also possess several biological properties such as anti cancer anti inflammatory and anti oxidant beneficial mechanism ramaiyan et al 2020 pangasianodon hypophthalmus commonly known as thai pangas iridescent shark sutchi catfish a facultative air breather is an exotic catfish species belonging to the family pangasidae introduced to india in 1997 to the state of west bengal singh 2020 singh and lakra 2012 among all the cultured catfishes p hypophthalmus culture boomed among the farmers for its robust growth high economic return export market demand tolerance to low dissolved oxygen omnivorous feeding habits etc ali et al 2005 chowdhury et al 2020 the present study employs potassium sulfate k2so4 fertilizer containing 43 potassium as elemental k and 17 sulfur as the sole source of fertilization to the system the potassium sulfate was chosen rather than potassium chloride kcl a typical fertilizer employed in agriculture as excess chlorine results in plant shrinkage while nutrients like sulfur and magnesium do not present any damage to plants if present in abundance in hydroponic nutrient solution maucieri et al 2019 the prolonged exposure of 0 04 0 2 mg l 1 of chlorine in water is toxic to fish svobodová et al 1993 while 5 100 mg l 1 of dissolved sulfate concentration is desirable in freshwater aquaculture system boyd 1998 roosta 2014 recommended the foliar application of potassium to alleviate nutrient deficiency in leafy and root vegetables in aquaponics since the absorption of nutrients by plants is dependent on root absorption rather than through pore and water stoma of leaf the addition of nutrients directly into water fertigation might be more efficient and impact of the nutrient addition into the culture water on the fish and microbes is a complex phenomenon yet to be addressed in aquaponics ru et al 2017 hence potassium supplementation via fertigation was adopted in the present study this study was outlined to determine the effect of potassium supplementation on the yield nutrient composition of spinach and growth performance of p hypophthalmus to determine the best dosage for the aquaponic system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in an aquaponic unit of the division of aquaculture icar central

treatment groups however the plasma glucose value was significantly p 0 05 affected by potassium supplementation showing the highest value in t4 4 discussion the water quality parameters are primary environmental consideration for optimization of aquaponics production as they influence the fish physiology growth feed efficiency and nutritional needs of the plant yildiz et al 2017 during the entire experimental period the ph varied within a narrow range of 7 37 7 82 and were found to be within the optimum range of 7 9 for nitrifying bacteria and 6 5 9 0 for fish rakocy et al 2006 wurts and durborow 1992 however lower ph of 5 8 6 5 ensures nutrient availability to plants and a ph close to 7 ensures the best compromise between nitrification and nutrient availability rakocy et al 2006 zou et al 2016 recommended that the aquaponic systems tolerate a wide range of ph from 6 0 to 9 0 whilst the neutral or slightly alkaline ph of 7 5 produced the highest biomass in common carp the ph of water in the present study varied within the tolerable limit for all the components in the aquaponic system the water temperature significantly influences the optimum growth of fish and plants and the performance of nitrifying bacteria in a biofilter shete et al 2016 the mean water temperature throughout the experimental period fluctuated between 25 29 and 25 95 c the temperature tolerance of warm water fishes lies between 22 and 32 c and an optimum temperature of 28 and 32 c exhibited increased metabolic rate and faster growth in p hypophthalmus islam et al 2019 a greater fresh and dry weight of spinach was reported in nutrient solution temperature ranging from 18 to 26 c lee and takakura 1995 and a temperature of 17 34 c encourage the growth and productivity of nitrifying bacteria in biofilter somerville et al 2014 the temperature during the present study varied within the tolerable limit for fish plants and nitrifiers in the aquaponic system maintaining an optimum level of dissolved oxygen do is vital for fish plant roots and microflora in the system lennard and goddek 2019 recommended that the lower oxygen requirement of plant root and microbes 3 mg l 1 than fish 5 mg l 1 demands that the do in an aquaponic system is to be set as per the specific requirement of fish being cultured in the present study the mean value of do 5 87 6 11 mg l 1 was within a favorable range of 5 8 mg l 1 reported as optimum in the aquaponic system by somerville et al 2014 the continuous aeration provided in the rearing tank ensured the maintenance of do at the desired level throughout the experimental period the alkalinity of water in the present study varied between 199 60 and 208 00 mg l 1 which was within the permissible limit i e 5 500 mg l 1 lawson 1995 the hardness level varied between 138 80 and 148 53 mg l 1 and was within the permissible limit of 20 300 mg l 1 as reported by santhosh and singh 2007 the hardness level was found to be almost at the same level throughout the experiment the nitrogenous compounds like total ammonia nitrogen tan nitrite and nitrate were found within the safe limits for fish culture during the experimental period the mean ammonia level of the present study varied between 0 10 and 0 11 mg l 1 van rijn and rivera 1990 recommended that the ambient ammonia concentration below 1 mg l 1 prevent nitrite accumulation in the recirculatory aquaculture system graber and junge 2009 reported the tolerable limit of ammonia in the aquaponic system as 1 mg l 1 hence the ammonia level was found to be within the permissible limit and was observed to decrease as the experimental period progressed hussain et al 2014 concluded that a significant decrease in ammonia in treatment with plants in koi carp spinach aquaponic system compared to control without plants manifests the efficiency of spinach plants for uptake of nutrients from the culture system the decrease in ammonia concentration in the system was observed with increased plant growth as the experimental period proceeded due to increased nitrification and nutrient uptake by spinach nitrite the intermediate product of nitrification process is potentially toxic to fish at higher levels the nitrite of the present study ranged between 0 06 and 0 07 mg l 1 which was found to be within the tolerable limit of 0 2 mg l 1 as recommended by graber and junge 2009 the nitrite level decreases as the experiment proceeds due to the increased activity of nitrifying bacteria in the biofilter nitrate the end product of the nitrification process is the least toxic and most preferred form of nitrogen for plants somerville et al 2014 stone and thomforde 2004 reported that the nitrate is relatively non toxic which causes health hazards if it exceeds 90 mg l 1 graber and junge 2009 recommended a tolerance limit of 150 mg l 1 for nitrate in the aquaponic system the nitrate level of the present study was found to be between 0 08 and 0 11 mg l 1 nuwansi et al 2017 reported that the lower level of nitrate nitrogen in the culture water of aquaponics was due to the utilization of nitrate by plants phosphorus is an essential element absorbed as ionic orthophosphate by plants eck et al 2019 the phosphate of the present study varied between 0 30 and 0 36 mg l 1 cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016a reported that orthophosphate concentration never exceeds 2 mg l 1 and mostly remains lower than 1 mg l 1 in an untreated aquaponic system potassium is a major macronutrient for plants and a prominent limiting nutrient in the aquaponic system seawright et al 1998 in the present study the potassium concentration was found to vary significantly among the control and treatment groups due to supplementation in the system with mean values varying between 13 72 and 79 23 mg l 1 cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016b reported that the characteristic aquaponic nutrient solution has a potassium concentration of 12 mg l 1 the nutrients like calcium and iron were reported to be deficient in an aquaponic system seawright et al 1998 the calcium level in the present study ranged between 32 55 70 to 35 39 mg l 1 and was within the permissible limit of 25 100 mg l 1 for fish culture wurts and durborow 1992 the micronutrient iron is vital for the growth and development of fish and plants in an aquaponic system the iron concentration in the present study varied between 0 08 and 0 09 mg l 1 during the experimental period randall et al 1999 suggested a dissolved iron concentration of 1 69 mg l 1 as safe for aquatic organisms kasozi et al 2019 recommended that an iron concentration below 1 7 mg l 1 be considered non toxic in the aquaponic system no external supplementation of iron was provided in the present study and was found in a lower concentration the economic feasibility of the aquaponic system requires higher production of both fish and plants the growth of spinach accounted by analyzing the plant height leaf length and width showed no significant difference the yield at the first harvest day 30 was found to vary insignificantly however the second harvest after potassium supplementation had a significant difference manifesting the positive impact of potassium fertilization on spinach growth in the aquaponic system potassium is a major plant nutrient essential for growth and yield development in the crop and the absence of an adequate amount of potassium can result in poorly developed roots that slow down growth and hence yield will be lower pettigrew 2008 sindhu et al 2014 in the present study yield followed the order t4 280 07 2 26 g t3 277 57 3 02 g t2 265 07 4 61 g t1 256 80 4 79 g c 217 83 4 20 g with no marked variation observed in the yield of treatments t4 and t3 and between the treatments t2 and t1 inthichack et al 2012 concluded that increased potassium concentration 164 8 321 8 482 7 and 643 7 mg l 1 in hydroponic nutrient solution positively impacted the growth and yield of cabbage celery and lettuce with a potassium concentration up to 482 7 mg l 1 providing an improved yield while further increase does not provide any additional benefits a similar result was witnessed in the present study where the yield of spinach improved with the increased level of potassium concentration in the aquaponic system roosta 2014 also reported that the foliar application of potassium resulted in a higher fresh and dry mass of shoot in mint radish parsley and coriander plants in the aquaponic system a higher fresh shoot mass of mint radish parsley and coriander of 1754 54 3186 123 1247 75 and 1754 26 g m 2 was observed in potassium sprayed plants compared to control which showed a yield of 1477 97 2183 113 757 6 and 1385 77 g m 2 respectively roosta and hamidpour 2011 suggested that the vegetative growth of the plant was found to increase with foliar application of macro and micro nutrients and plant growth follows the order k fe mn zn mg b in the present study only single nutrient management was considered particularly potassium via fertigation into the system as the nutrient absorption occurred mainly via root than through leaf pore or stoma and was found to positively impact the growth and yield of spinach the potassium nutrient supplementation was an effective way of enriching the nutrient content in the spinach leaves the biofortification or increasing nutrient content in plant tissue to enhance the overall nutritional quality of the vegetable is substantial in providing additional health benefits rivera et al 2009 d imperio et al 2019 maucieri et al 2019 stated that in a soil less system the nutrient availability to plants depends on the phenomenon of nutrient antagonism and synergism among the ions the potassium sulfate fertilizer provides both potassium and sulfate resulting in a higher content of the elements in spinach leaves in the treatment groups than in the control the potassium and sulfur content in leaf tissue was found to vary between 1 99 and 3 34 and 0 10 0 33 respectively a higher level of potassium and sulfur was observed with the increased level of supplementation in the aquaponic system yep and zheng 2020 observed a positive linear relationship of leaf potassium content in cannabis sativa in the aquaponic system provided with potassium fertilizers via fertigation they reported a potassium content of 2 69 3 00 in treatment supplied with potassium and micronutrient compared to control 1 69 and micronutrient alone 1 95 the iron content in the present study varied between 164 37 and 336 32 mg l 1 with higher iron content in the treatment groups provided with potassium than in the control roosta 2014 recorded an increased iron accumulation in aerial parts of mint parsley radish and coriander sprayed with potassium 113 37 4 67 109 53 0 35 94

hydroponic system the nitrogen content in spinach leaves was found to vary between 0 16 and 0 35 aulakh and malhi 2005 reported that increased potassium fertilizer application could increase crop nitrogen use efficiency and uptake the synergic effect of ion absorption of nitrogen and iron in spinach leaves with potassium fertilization was recorded in the present study on the other hand a nutrient antagonism was observed with calcium and magnesium content in the treatment groups provided with potassium the calcium content in the present study ranged between 0 21 and 0 31 and the magnesium content varied between 0 15 and 0 18 with a higher level observed in control than in the treatment groups rakocy et al 2006 emphasized the essentiality of nutrient balance for optimum growth in plants and nutrient antagonism of potassium calcium and magnesium interfere with the nutrient bioavailability where the excess amount of any of these nutrients will interfere with the uptake of the other two in plants in this experiment the supplementation of potassium was only uptaken resulting in a significant difference in the level of mg and ca in the control and treatment groups yep and zheng 2020 found that the divalent cation like mg and ca have a negative linear relationship in leaf tissue of cannabis sativa provided with increased potassium fertilization in the aquaponic system they reported a lower calcium and magnesium content of 8 55 9 11 and 1 24 1 41 in the treatments provided with increased potassium fertilization than control ca 9 80 and mg 1 78 borowski and michałek 2009 also observed a decrease in calcium content 1 43 1 53 in spinach leaves in hydroponics with increased foliar feeding of potassium compared to control 1 67 vandam et al 2017 perceived the macro

891 mg l 1 and no3 n 135 1 165 7 mg l 1 facilitating greater absorption of nutrients by spinach in the present study the highest dosage was 180 mg l 1 for potassium and other nutrients were present at lower concentrations in the solution however a significant influence was observed in the nutrient absorption by spinach with a higher level of nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfur and iron observed in the treatments provided with potassium than in control the difference in the nutrient content in leaf tissue in response to antagonism and synergism at the different dosages of potassium in the treatment groups and control was recognized in the study the weight gain in p hypophthalmus did not show any significant difference at the end of the experiment however a numerically higher growth was observed in control c and the lowest in t4 k dosage 180 mg l 1 though not significantly different lower growth in treatments supplemented with potassium t1 to t4 compared to control was attributed to the disruption in the feeding behavior of the fish in the treatment groups t1 to t4 for three days upon potassium supplementation the potassium was added in three split dosages and the feeding disruption was observed upon initial supplementation due to the sudden change in the culture environment causing stress in fish the fish requires a lower level of potassium and hence it is lower in fish feed seawright et al 1998 harper and wolf 2009 reported that malnutrition either from insufficient or overabundance of nutrient or nutrient related imbalance can cause stress in fish in the present study a nutrient related imbalance arose in the system due to a sudden change in potassium concentration in culture water upon supplementation resulting in stress in fish in the treatment groups the disruption of feeding behavior or reduced feed intake occurs due to stress and consequently a lesser amount of feed is assimilated and built into biomass hussain et al 2014 diem et al 2017 the consecutive dosage did not show any disruption in the feeding behavior of fish indicating the gradual adaptation of the fish to the increased potassium level in the system no feeding disruption was observed in control resulting in a slightly higher growth compared to the other treatments wenzel et al 2021 reported that a potassium concentration of about 600 mg l 1 in the process water of african catfish clarias gariepinus in recirculating aquaculture system had no negative impact on the growth performance and proximate composition of the fish with apparent animal welfare observed at 200 400 mg l 1 ru et al 2017 reported that micro and macronutrient addition in tilapia pak choi aquaponic system facilitates plant growth directly and fish physiology indirectly with no enrichment of metal ions in fish biomass indicating food safety the nutrient addition facilitates better plant growth in treatment resulting in higher water replenishment and better water quality consequently provide an additional advantage for fish growth by providing significant growth with less feed consumption hence similar growth was obtained in the present study in the treatments provided with potassium despite lower feed consumption by fish than in the control group suggesting that the potassium supplementation had no negative impact on fish growth whilst the feeding disruption encountered during the culture period during the present study the various growth parameters like fcr sgr per fer etc varied significantly on account of varying levels of feed intake in the control and treatments supplemented with potassium the fcr ranged between 2 35 and 2 52 and was higher in both the control and treatment groups angkha et al 2020 have reported higher fcr due to accumulative stress of temperature photoperiod and space islam et al 2019 reported that the optimum temperature for p hypophthalmus was 28 and 32 c and the lower temperature was associated with a higher fcr value as more feed was required for unit gain in the bodyweight contrasted to optimum temperature level the temperature recorded in the present study 25 29 25 95 c was lower than the reported optimum level 28 and 32 c resulting in higher fcr meilisza et al 2010 reported an fcr of 1 82 5 60 in p hypophthalmus juveniles in a recirculating system the sgr of the present study was found to be lower than 1 per day maucieri et al 2017 reported sgr of less than 1 in a vegetable intercropping aquaponic system the stress parameters were analyzed to determine the effect of potassium supplementation in p hypophthalmus the serum biomarkers like glucose and cortisol are general indicators to monitor stress response health and physiological status of fish and elevated level of these biomarkers indicates the primary response to stress in fish adikesavalu et al 2020 nuwansi et al 2021 the plasma cortisol value showed no significant difference between the control and treatment groups and varied between 75 19 and 90 29 ng ml 1 however the plasma glucose was found to vary significantly and ranged between 67 93 and 110 50 mg dl 1 a significant difference was observed among the control and treatments supplemented with potassium with the highest value observed in t4 k dosage 180 mg l 1 an elevation in glucose level was observed with higher potassium supplementation while cortisol levels remained unaltered thus the increase in glucose may be due to a different mechanism other than cortisol induced gluconeogenesis this alternate pathway may be induced by catecholamines trenzado et al 2003 thus a slight physiological disturbance in the 180 mg l 1 supplemented group may reflect a higher degree in long term rearing hence the potassium supplementation level up to 150 mg l 1 was found to be the most adequate to be applied in the aquaponic system without impacting the health and welfare of p hypophthalmus 5 conclusions the experiment demonstrated that the potassium nutrient management increased the spinach yield and nutrient content ensuring an effective alleviation of nutrient deficiency whilst maintaining optimal fish growth thereby increasing the efficiency and production of the aquaponic system based on the experimental findings it may be concluded that 150 mg l 1 k dosage showed the best compromise of the overall efficiency of p hypophthalmus spinacia oleracea l aquaponic system the study accounts for single nutrient management mainly potassium while several other nutrients like phosphorus calcium iron etc were present in lower concentrations in aquaponic water hence further studies in nutrient management in aquaponics should address total nutrient management in accordance with the physiological stage of the plant and develop plant and fish species specific

9760,a 60 day experimental trial was conducted to investigate the effect of different dosages of potassium supplementation on spinacia oleracea l and pangasianodon hypophthalmus in an aquaponic system the system consisted of 168 l rectangular fish tanks 0 78 0 54 0 40 m with 100 l water volume stocked with p hypophthalmus at 2 8 kg m 3 and nutrient film technique nft hydroponics with spinach at 28 plants m 2 four dosages of potassium viz 90 120 150 and 180 mg l 1 were assigned as t1 t2 t3 and t4 and compared with control c 0 mg l 1 to determine the most efficient potassium dosage for the aquaponic system the physico chemical parameters and nutrient dynamics were within the permissible range with no marked variation between the control and treatments the spinach was harvested twice the

availability 1 introduction the global challenges of increasing population and food demand inflicts stress on limited land and water resources on which food production relies goddek et al 2019 moreover excessive demographic pressure and unsustainable practices result in the progressive breakdown in the productive capacity of land and water resources fao 2011 fish is the vital source of food and the long term trend since the late 1980 s in the global capture fisheries suggests that the marine resources have already approached the exploitation level and are beyond the bounds of resuscitation fao 2020 the impotence of the current aquaculture production to meet the ever increasing fish demand emphasizes adopting sustainable intensive farming interventions like aquaponics recirculating aquaculture system ras biofloc technology etc jena et al 2017 the aquaponics integration of aquaculture and hydroponics provides the dual benefit of wastewater recycling and food production and serves as an excellent solution to the problem which replaces infinite growth with sustainable development goddek et al 2019 the ongoing research in aquaponics mainly focused on optimization of component ratio and stocking density hussain et al 2014 nuwansi et al 2021 shete et al 2013 hydraulic loading rate in the aquaponic system endut et al 2010 nuwansi et al 2020 shete et

system is found to yield comparable growth as conventional hydroponics delaide et al 2016 graber and junge 2009 despite the lower concentration of most of the nutrients like potassium k calcium ca iron fe etc in the system rakocy et al 2006 seawright et al 1998 the fish requires a minimal amount of metal ions like fe mn mg cu etc and a lower k 1 of the composition hence these nutrients are lower in fish diet and therefore in aquaculture effluent seawright et al 1998 yep and zheng 2019 for attaining the full potential of the system the nutrient dearth should be rectified via supplementation through the foliar application roosta 2014 or fertigation rakocy et al 2006 in accordance with the specific requirements during each physiological stage of the plant of the nutrient deficiencies in the aquaponic system potassium has been reported to be the most significant and a 45 times lower potassium level in the aquaponic system than hydroponics is the main reason for poor crop quality graber and junge 2009 yep and zheng 2019 potassium is an essential nutrient involved in functions like nutrition enzyme activation osmotic regulation growth and development of plants çalişkan and çalişkan 2019 hence its deficiency in the aquaponic system was reported by many researchers such as rakocy et al 2006 graber and junge 2009 seawright et al 1998 etc most of the research works on nutrient management in aquaponics was endeavored in fruit crops and medicinal herbs nozzi et al 2018 peter et al 2021 roosta 2014 roosta and hamidpour 2011 roosta and mohsenian 2012 yep and zheng 2020 zahan et al 2018 with only a few studies undertaken in leafy vegetables except for pak choi ru et al 2017 and lettuce nozzi et al 2018 green leafy vegetables are the most preferred crop in the aquaponic system owing to faster growth short growing period and better profitability bailey and ferrarezi 2017 yep and zheng 2019 spinacia oleracea l spinach belongs to the family chenopodiaceae which is rich in vitamin a c k and minerals like iron magnesium manganese calcium etc and also possess several biological properties such as anti cancer anti inflammatory and anti oxidant beneficial

fertilizer containing 43 potassium as elemental k and 17 sulfur as the sole source of fertilization to the system the potassium sulfate was chosen rather than potassium chloride kcl a typical fertilizer employed in agriculture as excess chlorine results in plant shrinkage while nutrients like sulfur and magnesium do not present any damage to plants if present in abundance in hydroponic nutrient solution maucieri et al 2019 the prolonged exposure of 0 04 0 2 mg l 1 of chlorine in water is toxic to fish svobodová et al 1993 while 5 100 mg l 1 of dissolved sulfate concentration is desirable in freshwater aquaculture system boyd 1998 roosta 2014 recommended the foliar application of potassium to alleviate nutrient deficiency in leafy and root vegetables in aquaponics since the absorption of nutrients by plants is dependent on root absorption rather than through pore and water stoma of leaf the addition of nutrients directly into water fertigation might be more efficient and impact of the nutrient addition into the culture water on the fish and microbes is a complex phenomenon yet to be addressed in aquaponics ru et al 2017 hence potassium supplementation via fertigation was adopted in the present study this study was outlined to determine the effect of potassium supplementation on the yield nutrient composition of spinach and growth performance of p hypophthalmus to determine the best dosage for the aquaponic system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in an aquaponic unit of the division of aquaculture icar central

spinacia oleracea l in an aquaponic system two target potassium concentration of 150 and 120 mg l 1 was used for leafy vegetables in aquaponic system by nozzi et al 2018 for lettuce and nicoletto et al 2018 for mizuna and rocket salad respectively based on the above studies the range of graded levels of potassium supplementation was selected in the present study 2 3 experimental procedure the experimental trial commenced with the starting up or cycling with fish of the aquaponic system for colonization of the beneficial nitrifying bacteria to establish the nitrogen cycle the p hypophthalmus were stocked in the rectangular plastic fish tank at 2 8 kg m 3 putra et al 2020 the fish were not fed for the first 24 h of stocking and feed was provided from the next day simultaneously the spinach seeds were sown in a nursery tray with coco peat medium in the adjacent area after 15 days when a considerable bacterial population developed in the system the spinach plantlets 15 days old were transplanted to the nutrient film technique nft hydroponic trough at 28 plants m 2 the plant stocking density was chosen based on the study of hussain et al 2014 who reported a stocking density of 28 plants m 2 for spinach in an aquaponic system the fish were fed with commercial feed of 1 8 mm size growfin starter feed growel feeds private ltd india containing 30 crude protein at the rate of 1 5 body weight initially for 15 days henceforth a gradual increase to 2 of body weight for the rest of the culture period with feed dispensed in equal amounts in the morning 7 30 hrs and evening 18 00 hrs this enhanced feeding rate at later stages was due to increase in water temperature the feed intake was observed daily in the morning and evening no feed wastage was observed and the fish consumed the feed within 20 min after administering the feed the physico chemical parameters fish and plant growth were determined fortnightly the spinach harvest was done twice i e day 30 and day 60 after the transplant the potassium was supplemented in the system via fertigation in three split dosages starting from the 30th day of the experiment providing one fourth

treatment groups however the plasma glucose value was significantly p 0 05 affected by potassium supplementation showing the highest value in t4 4 discussion the water quality parameters are primary environmental consideration for optimization of aquaponics production as they influence the fish physiology growth feed efficiency and nutritional needs of the plant yildiz et al 2017 during the entire experimental period the ph varied within a narrow range of 7 37 7 82 and were found to be within the optimum range of 7 9 for nitrifying bacteria and 6 5 9 0 for fish rakocy et al 2006 wurts and durborow 1992 however lower ph of 5 8 6 5 ensures nutrient availability to plants and a ph close to 7 ensures the best compromise between nitrification and nutrient availability rakocy et al 2006 zou et al 2016 recommended that the aquaponic systems tolerate a wide range of ph from 6 0 to 9 0 whilst the neutral or slightly alkaline ph of 7 5 produced the highest biomass in common carp the ph of water in the present study varied within the tolerable limit for all the components in the aquaponic system the water temperature significantly influences the optimum growth of fish and plants and the performance of nitrifying bacteria in a biofilter shete et al 2016 the mean water temperature throughout the experimental period fluctuated between 25 29 and 25 95 c the temperature tolerance of warm water fishes lies between 22 and 32 c and an optimum temperature of 28 and 32 c exhibited increased metabolic rate and faster growth in p hypophthalmus islam et al 2019 a greater fresh and dry weight of spinach was reported in nutrient solution temperature ranging from 18 to 26 c lee and takakura 1995 and a temperature of 17 34 c encourage the growth and productivity of nitrifying bacteria in biofilter somerville et al 2014 the temperature during the present study varied within the tolerable limit for fish plants and nitrifiers in the aquaponic system maintaining an optimum level of dissolved oxygen do is vital for fish plant roots and microflora in the system lennard and goddek 2019 recommended that the lower oxygen requirement of plant root and microbes 3 mg l 1 than fish 5 mg l 1 demands that the do in an aquaponic system is to be set as per the specific requirement of fish being cultured in the present study the mean value of do 5 87 6 11 mg l 1 was within a favorable range of 5 8 mg l 1 reported as optimum in the aquaponic system by somerville et al 2014 the continuous aeration provided in the rearing tank ensured the maintenance of do at the desired level throughout the experimental period the alkalinity of water in the present study varied between 199 60 and 208 00 mg l 1 which was within the permissible limit i e 5 500 mg l 1 lawson 1995 the hardness level varied between 138 80 and 148 53 mg l 1 and was within the permissible limit of 20 300 mg l 1 as reported by santhosh and singh 2007 the hardness level was found to be almost at the same level throughout the experiment the nitrogenous compounds like total ammonia nitrogen tan nitrite and nitrate were found within the safe limits for fish culture during the experimental period the mean ammonia level of the present study varied between 0 10 and 0 11 mg l 1 van rijn and rivera 1990 recommended that the ambient ammonia concentration below 1 mg l 1 prevent nitrite accumulation in the recirculatory aquaculture system graber and junge 2009 reported the tolerable limit of ammonia in the aquaponic system as 1 mg l 1 hence the ammonia level was found to be within the permissible limit and was observed to decrease as the experimental period progressed hussain et al 2014 concluded that a significant decrease in ammonia in treatment with plants in koi carp spinach aquaponic system compared to control without plants manifests the efficiency of spinach plants for uptake of nutrients from the culture system the decrease in ammonia concentration in the system was observed with increased plant growth as the experimental period proceeded due to increased nitrification and nutrient uptake by spinach nitrite the intermediate product of nitrification process is potentially toxic to fish at higher levels the nitrite of the present study ranged between 0 06 and 0 07 mg l 1 which was found to be within the tolerable limit of 0 2 mg l 1 as recommended by graber and junge 2009 the nitrite level decreases as the experiment proceeds due to the increased activity of nitrifying bacteria in the biofilter nitrate the end product of the nitrification process is the least toxic and most preferred form of nitrogen for plants somerville et al 2014 stone and thomforde 2004 reported that the nitrate is relatively non toxic which causes health hazards if it exceeds 90 mg l 1 graber and junge 2009 recommended a tolerance limit of 150 mg l 1 for nitrate in the aquaponic system the nitrate level of the present study was found to be between 0 08 and 0 11 mg l 1 nuwansi et al 2017 reported that the lower level of nitrate nitrogen in the culture water of aquaponics was due to the utilization of nitrate by plants phosphorus is an essential element absorbed as ionic orthophosphate by plants eck et al 2019 the phosphate of the present study varied between 0 30 and 0 36 mg l 1 cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016a reported that orthophosphate concentration never exceeds 2 mg l 1 and mostly remains lower than 1 mg l 1 in an untreated aquaponic system potassium is a major macronutrient for plants and a prominent limiting nutrient in the aquaponic system seawright et al 1998 in the present study the potassium concentration was found to vary significantly among the control and treatment groups due to supplementation in the system with mean values varying between 13 72 and 79 23 mg l 1 cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016b reported that the characteristic aquaponic nutrient solution has a potassium concentration of 12 mg l 1 the nutrients like calcium and iron were reported to be deficient in an aquaponic system seawright et al 1998 the calcium level in the present study ranged between 32 55 70 to 35 39 mg l 1 and was within the permissible limit of 25 100 mg l 1 for fish culture wurts and durborow 1992 the micronutrient iron is vital for the growth and development of fish and plants in an aquaponic system the iron concentration in the present study varied between 0 08 and 0 09 mg l 1 during the experimental period randall et al 1999 suggested a dissolved iron concentration of 1 69 mg l 1 as safe for aquatic organisms kasozi et al 2019 recommended that an iron concentration below 1 7 mg l 1 be considered non toxic in the aquaponic system no external supplementation of iron was provided in the present study and was found in a lower concentration the economic feasibility of the aquaponic system requires higher production of both fish and plants the growth of spinach accounted by analyzing the plant height leaf length and width showed no significant difference the yield at the first harvest day 30 was found to vary insignificantly however the second harvest after potassium supplementation had a significant difference manifesting the positive impact of potassium fertilization on spinach growth in the aquaponic system potassium is a major plant nutrient essential for growth and yield development in the crop and the absence of an adequate amount of potassium can result in poorly developed roots that slow down growth and hence yield will be lower pettigrew 2008 sindhu et al 2014 in the present study yield followed the order t4 280 07 2 26 g t3 277 57 3 02 g t2 265 07 4 61 g t1 256 80 4 79 g c 217 83 4 20 g with no marked variation observed in the yield of treatments t4 and t3 and between the treatments t2 and t1 inthichack et al 2012 concluded that increased potassium concentration 164 8 321 8 482 7 and 643 7 mg l 1 in hydroponic nutrient solution positively impacted the growth and yield of cabbage celery and lettuce with a potassium concentration up to 482 7 mg l 1 providing an improved yield while further increase does not provide any additional benefits a similar result was witnessed in the present study where the yield of spinach improved with the increased level of potassium concentration in the aquaponic system roosta 2014 also reported that the foliar application of potassium resulted in a higher fresh and dry mass of shoot in mint radish parsley and coriander plants in the aquaponic system a higher fresh shoot mass of mint radish parsley and coriander of 1754 54 3186 123 1247 75 and 1754 26 g m 2 was observed in potassium sprayed plants compared to control which showed a yield of 1477 97 2183 113 757 6 and 1385 77 g m 2 respectively roosta and hamidpour 2011 suggested that the vegetative growth of the plant was found to increase with foliar application of macro and micro nutrients and plant growth follows the order k fe mn zn mg b in the present study only single nutrient management was considered particularly potassium via fertigation into the system as the nutrient absorption occurred mainly via root than through leaf pore or stoma and was found to positively impact the growth and yield of spinach the potassium nutrient supplementation was an effective way of enriching the nutrient content in the spinach leaves the biofortification or increasing nutrient content in plant tissue to enhance the overall nutritional quality of the vegetable is substantial in providing additional health benefits rivera et al 2009 d imperio et al 2019 maucieri et al 2019 stated that in a soil less system the nutrient availability to plants depends on the phenomenon of nutrient antagonism and synergism among the ions the potassium sulfate fertilizer provides both potassium and sulfate resulting in a higher content of the elements in spinach leaves in the treatment groups than in the control the potassium and sulfur content in leaf tissue was found to vary between 1 99 and 3 34 and 0 10 0 33 respectively a higher level of potassium and sulfur was observed with the increased level of supplementation in the aquaponic system yep and zheng 2020 observed a positive linear relationship of leaf potassium content in cannabis sativa in the aquaponic system provided with potassium fertilizers via fertigation they reported a potassium content of 2 69 3 00 in treatment supplied with potassium and micronutrient compared to control 1 69 and micronutrient alone 1 95 the iron content in the present study varied between 164 37 and 336 32 mg l 1 with higher iron content in the treatment groups provided with potassium than in the control roosta 2014 recorded an increased iron accumulation in aerial parts of mint parsley radish and coriander sprayed with potassium 113 37 4 67 109 53 0 35 94 83 3 27 and 129 43 3 18 mg l 1 than control 103 17 0 84 95 37 1 28 75 50 7 92 and 128 43 4 05 mg l 1 maucieri et al 2019 reported that nutrient synergism existed between potassium and iron in the hydroponic system the nitrogen content in spinach leaves was found to vary between 0 16 and 0 35 aulakh and malhi 2005 reported that increased potassium fertilizer application could increase crop nitrogen use efficiency and uptake the synergic effect of ion absorption of nitrogen and iron in spinach leaves with potassium fertilization was recorded in the present study on the other hand a nutrient antagonism was observed with calcium and magnesium content in the treatment groups provided with potassium the calcium content in the present study ranged between 0 21 and 0 31 and the magnesium content varied between 0 15 and 0 18 with a higher level observed in control than in the treatment groups rakocy et al 2006 emphasized the essentiality of nutrient balance for optimum growth in plants and nutrient antagonism of potassium calcium and magnesium interfere with the nutrient bioavailability where the excess amount of any of these nutrients will interfere with the uptake of the other two in plants in this experiment the supplementation of potassium was only uptaken resulting in a significant difference in the level of mg and ca in the control and treatment groups yep and zheng 2020 found that the divalent cation like mg and ca have a negative linear relationship in leaf tissue of cannabis sativa provided with increased potassium fertilization in the aquaponic system they reported a lower calcium and magnesium content of 8 55 9 11 and 1 24 1 41 in the treatments provided with increased potassium fertilization than control ca 9 80 and mg 1 78 borowski and michałek 2009 also observed a decrease in calcium content 1 43 1 53 in spinach leaves in hydroponics with increased foliar feeding of potassium compared to control 1 67 vandam et al 2017 perceived the macro and micronutrient content in spinach as n 5 72 p 1 01 k 4 16 mg 1 22 ca 0 54 s 0 35 and fe 89 mg l 1 in an aquaponic system provided with 1 m k2co3 and chelated form of iron the higher nutrient content observed can be attributed to higher concentration of elements in the nutrient solution k 214 255 mg l 1 ca 87 6 94 5 mg l 1 mg 22 6 23 7 mg l 1 s 21 23 7 mg l 1 p 12 4 16 9 mg l 1 fe 1 882 2 891 mg l 1 and no3 n 135 1 165 7 mg l 1 facilitating greater absorption of nutrients by spinach in the present study the highest dosage was 180 mg l 1 for potassium and other nutrients were present at lower concentrations in the solution however a significant influence was observed in the nutrient absorption by spinach with a higher level of nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfur and iron observed in the treatments provided with potassium than in control the difference in the nutrient content in leaf tissue in response to antagonism and synergism at the different dosages of potassium in the treatment groups and control was recognized in the study the weight gain in p hypophthalmus did not show any significant difference at the end of the experiment however a numerically higher growth was observed in control c and the lowest in t4 k dosage 180 mg l 1 though not significantly different lower growth in treatments supplemented with potassium t1 to t4 compared to control was attributed to the disruption in the feeding behavior of the fish in the treatment groups t1 to t4 for three days upon potassium supplementation the potassium was added in three split dosages and the feeding disruption was observed upon initial supplementation due to the sudden change in the culture environment causing stress in fish the fish requires a lower level of potassium and hence it is lower in fish feed seawright et al 1998 harper and wolf 2009 reported that malnutrition either from insufficient or overabundance of nutrient or nutrient related imbalance can cause stress in fish in the present study a nutrient related imbalance arose in the system due to a sudden change in potassium concentration in culture water upon supplementation resulting in stress in fish in the treatment groups the disruption of feeding behavior or reduced feed intake occurs due to stress and consequently a lesser amount of feed is assimilated and built into biomass hussain et al 2014 diem et al 2017 the consecutive dosage did not show any disruption in the feeding behavior of fish indicating the gradual adaptation of the fish to the increased potassium level in the system no feeding disruption was observed in control resulting in a slightly higher growth compared to the other treatments wenzel et al 2021 reported that a potassium concentration of about 600 mg l 1 in the process water of african catfish clarias gariepinus in recirculating aquaculture system had no negative impact on the growth performance and proximate composition of the fish with apparent animal welfare observed at 200 400 mg l 1 ru et al 2017 reported that micro and macronutrient addition in tilapia pak choi aquaponic system facilitates plant growth directly and fish physiology indirectly with no enrichment of metal ions in fish biomass indicating food safety the nutrient addition facilitates better plant growth in treatment resulting in higher water replenishment and better water quality consequently provide an additional advantage for fish growth by providing significant growth with less feed consumption hence similar growth was obtained in the present study in the treatments provided with potassium despite lower feed consumption by fish than in the control group suggesting that the potassium supplementation had no negative impact on fish growth whilst the feeding disruption encountered during the culture period during the present study the various growth parameters like fcr sgr per fer etc varied significantly on account of varying levels of feed intake in the control and treatments supplemented with potassium the fcr ranged between 2 35 and 2 52 and was higher in both the control and treatment groups angkha et al 2020 have reported higher fcr due to accumulative stress of temperature photoperiod and space islam et al 2019 reported that the optimum temperature for p hypophthalmus was 28 and 32 c and the lower temperature was associated with a higher fcr value as more feed was required for unit gain in the bodyweight contrasted to optimum temperature level the temperature recorded in the present study 25 29 25 95 c was lower than the reported optimum level 28 and 32 c resulting in higher fcr meilisza et al 2010 reported an fcr of 1 82 5 60 in p hypophthalmus juveniles in a recirculating system the sgr of the present study was found to be lower than 1 per day maucieri et al 2017 reported sgr of less than 1 in a vegetable intercropping aquaponic system the stress parameters were analyzed to determine the effect of potassium supplementation in p hypophthalmus the serum biomarkers like glucose and cortisol are general indicators to monitor stress response health and physiological status of fish and elevated level of these biomarkers indicates the primary response to stress in fish adikesavalu et al 2020 nuwansi et al 2021 the plasma cortisol value showed no significant difference between the control and treatment groups and varied between 75 19 and 90 29 ng ml 1 however the plasma glucose was found to vary significantly and ranged between 67 93 and 110 50 mg dl 1 a significant difference was observed among the control and treatments supplemented with potassium with the highest value observed in t4 k dosage 180 mg l 1 an elevation in glucose level was observed with higher potassium supplementation while cortisol levels remained unaltered thus the increase in glucose may be due to a different mechanism other than cortisol induced gluconeogenesis this alternate pathway may be induced by catecholamines trenzado et al 2003 thus a slight physiological disturbance in the 180 mg l 1 supplemented group may reflect a higher degree in long term rearing hence the potassium supplementation level up to 150 mg l 1 was found to be the most adequate to be applied in the aquaponic system without impacting the health and welfare of p hypophthalmus 5 conclusions the experiment demonstrated that the potassium nutrient management increased the spinach yield and nutrient content ensuring an effective alleviation of nutrient deficiency whilst maintaining optimal fish growth thereby increasing the efficiency and production of the aquaponic system based on the experimental findings it may be concluded that 150 mg l 1 k dosage showed the best compromise of the overall efficiency of p hypophthalmus spinacia oleracea l aquaponic system the study accounts for single nutrient management mainly potassium while several other nutrients like phosphorus calcium iron etc were present in lower concentrations in aquaponic water hence further studies in nutrient management in aquaponics should address total nutrient management in accordance with the physiological stage of the plant and develop plant and fish species specific

9761,ridge furrow plastic film mulching rfpm is an efficient planting technique for rainwater harvesting in rainfed regions of the loess plateau china however relevant data on root water use patterns under rfpm remain sparse to clarify the water use pattern of roots under this planting technique and determine the root characteristic parameters related to water absorption this study conducted a two year field experiment using spring maize with three treatments flat planting fp and rfpm with two different ridge furrow ratios 40 cm 70 cm and 70 cm 40 cm hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes δd and δ18o of different water sources were measured and the mixsiar model was used to quantify the contributions of different water sources to spring maize root water uptake the results showed that the root characteristic parameters of spring maize under the three treatments decreased with increasing soil depth and were mainly distributed in the shallow 0 20 cm and middle 20 60 cm soil layers compared to fp under rfpm the distribution proportions of the root characteristic parameters in shallow soil were higher which may be related to the increase in shallow soil water content the main water absorbing soil layers of spring maize under the three treatments were the same 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 40 60 cm and 0 20 cm in the v6 v12 r1 r3 and r6 growth stages respectively however compared to fp under rfpm the water use proportion of spring maize of shallow soil increased especially under the larger ridge to furrow ratio and correlation analysis showed that this phenomenon might be related to the rfpm increasing the proportion of the spring maize root characteristic parameters in shallow soil correlation analysis further showed that the root length density and root surface area density might be the key characteristic parameters for determining root water uptake graphical abstract ga1 keywords ridge furrow plastic film mulch planting root distribution water absorption pattern spring maize δ18o and δd 1 introduction rainfed agriculture plays a vital role in ensuring food security and is an important part of global agriculture wani et al 2009 liu et al 2014a in china rainfed farmland accounts for 50 of the total farmland liu et al 2014b with the loess plateau being the largest rainfed agricultural region mo et al 2020 comprising an area of 640 000 km2 zhang and liu 2010 the vast majority of the region is located in a semi arid monsoon climate zone eldoma et al 2016 with annual rainfall between 300 and 500 mm mo et al 2013 and precipitation is the only source of water for agricultural production because of the lack of other irrigation water resources li et al 2001 the shortage of water resources severely limits crop productivity therefore improving the collection and utilization of precipitation is the key to solving this problem after decades of research it has been found that in situ rainwater harvesting technologies can effectively improve the collection and utilization of rainwater thereby increasing soil water content precipitation use efficiency and crop productivity compared with flat planting fp gan et al 2013 mo et al 2013 2016 zhang et al 2020 and ridge furrow plastic film mulching rfpm is considered one of the most effective in situ rainwater harvesting techniques in the loess plateau han et al 2004 gan et al 2013 this planting pattern consists of two parts ridges covered with plastic film act as precipitation collecting areas and bare furrows are planting areas that receive water gan et al 2013 this planting pattern increases soil water content by effectively collecting precipitation including ineffective precipitation 5 mm mo et al 2016 and the plastic film covering the ridges can reduce soil water evaporation and regulate soil temperature amplitude zhang et al 2017 2021 qin et al 2019 these improvements in the soil micro environment improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue zhang et al 2019 2020 thidar et al 2020 today the mechanism by which rfpm increases crop yield and wue has been fully explored and researchers attribute the increase to the optimization of the canopy structure liu et al 2018 the promotion of root growth and nutrient uptake jia et al 2018 hu et al 2020 thidar et al 2020 and stimulating the alternation of soil wetting drying to promote crop growth and dry matter accumulation zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 however some problems such as quantifying crops water use from different soil layers and zones under rfpm have not been systematically investigated crop water absorption is the key link of spac soil plant atmosphere continuum in farmland which not only determines the water use capacity of crops but also determines the response mechanism of crops to changes in soil water environment wang et al 2010 therefore quantifying crop water use can reflect the response of crops to rfpm changes in soil water environment which is helpful for us to further deepen our understanding of rfpm improving crop yield and wue the root system is the key bridge between plant internal water and soil water and its state directly affects the water absorption of plants chen et al 2014a many characteristic parameters of root systems including root dry weight density rdd root length density rld root volume density rvd and root surface area density rsd wang et al 2014 determine the function of a root system therefore a number of previous studies analyzed excavated roots to determine the water absorption pattern of plant roots dahlman and kucera 1965 jackson et al 1996 however differences in the distribution proportions of different root characteristic parameters in different soil layers makes it impossible to accurately determine which root characteristic parameter represents the root water use pattern and the existence of the root itself does not represent the root activity williams and ehleringer 2000 wu et al 2016 recently stable isotope tracing techniques δd and δ18o have been applied to the hydrological cycle and have been proven to be an effective tool to study the water use patterns of plant roots kerhoulas et al 2013 penna et al 2020 owing to the absence of isotopic fractionation during root water absorption and significant differences in the isotopic composition of different water sources due to physical processes such as evaporation and permeation schwendenmann et al 2015 sprenger et al 2019 therefore by comparing the isotopic composition of plant xylems and the potential water source the main water absorption depth of plants and the contribution of potential water sources to water absorped by the plant roots can be determined wu et al 2018a owing to the high sensitivity and accuracy of water stable isotope tracer techniques they have been gradually applied to the study of root water use patterns of various crops in recent years for example wang et al 2010 used the isosource model to estimate the water absorption pattern of summer maize roots in the shallow groundwater area of shanxi province china and ma and song 2016 determined the seasonal changes in water absorption of maize under different fertilization conditions in irrigation areas by using stable water isotopes zhao et al 2018 determined the crop water absorption pattern under the typical wheat maize rotation system of the north china plain although stable water isotope tracing technology is widely used in crop root water use pattern studies to the best of our knowledge no study has investigated the crop root water use patterns of crops under rfpm using this technique spring maize is an important representative crop in the loess plateau and is widely cultivated by rfpm therefore is was chosen as the research object in this study a combination of root excavation and water stable isotope tracing was used to determine the distribution of root characteristic parameters and root water use pattern this study aimed to 1 quantitative analysis of the proportion of spring maize root characteristic parameters and root water absorption in different soil layers under rfpm and fp in different growth periods 2 clarify the response of root characteristic parameters and root water use patterns of spring maize to the change of soil water content caused by rfpm and 3 clarify the relationship between soil water root characteristic parameters and root water use patterns of spring maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted at the changwu agro ecological experimental station in the gully region of the loess plateau shaanxi province china fig 1 a the mean annual sunshine forest free period temperature and precipitation of the experimental site were 2230 h 171 days 9 7 c and 548 mm respectively the monthly precipitation and air temperature during the experimental period are shown in fig 1 b the soil type of the experimental field was dark loess soil chinese soil taxonomy table 1 shows the physical and chemical properties of the soil layers between 0 and 100 cm 2 2 experimental design and field management the experiment of this study was conducted twice on the same experimental field once in 2019 and once in 2020 the experimental design adopted was completely random and included three treatments fig 1 a p1 flat planting without mulching fp p2 rfpm with a ridge furrow ratio of 40 cm 70 cm and p3 rfpm with a ridge furrow ratio of 70 cm 40 cm each treatment consisted of three repetitions and the plot size was 48 m2 6 m 8 m the ridge furrow ratio affects the collection of precipitation in theory a larger ridge furrow ratio will result in a better water collection effect mo et al 2013 ren et al 2016 li et al 2019 under rfpm the ridge was covered with a plastic film of 0 015 mm thickness whereas the furrow was not covered before the ridges and furrows were formed the basal fertilizer was applied to the soil surface with application rates of 180 kg n ha 1 and 40 kg p2o5 ha 1 no fertilizer was applied during the spring maize growing period after the ridges and furrows were formed spring maize seeds were sown at the junction of ridge and furrow the spring maize variety planted in this study was xianyu 335 which is widely used locally the sowing date for the 2019 and 2020 experiments were may 10 2019 and may 15 2020 respectively and the planting density was 75 000 plants ha 1 the experiments followed local agronomic recommended management practices for maize production and all weeds in the field were removed manually 2 3 sampling and sample measurement 2 3 1 root characteristic parameters in both 2019 and 2020 spring maize roots were collected from each plot at stages v12 12th leaf r1 silking stage and r6 physiological maturity soil root columns were collected at three different sampling points under fp including at planting spots intra plant spots in the same row and intra row spots because of differences in the microtopography between rfpm and fp four different sampling points of soil root columns were collected under rfpm including at planting spots r1 intra plant spots in the rows r2 spots in the middle of the ridges r3 and spots in the furrows r4 as shown in supplementary material fig s1 at each sampling a root drill with an inner diameter of 10 cm was used to collect the soil root columns at sampling layer widths of 20 cm down to a depth of 100 cm during the sampling process it was found that there was almost no spring maize root system at soil depths exceeding 100 cm supplementary material fig s2 each soil root column was placed into a 0 25 mm sieve and slowly rinsed with running water until the root system was completely separated from the soil the living roots white color were carefully picked out and the dead roots dark color removed with tweezers gregory 1994 then images of the roots of each soil column were taken using a scanner epson v700 indonesia winrhizo software version 5 0 canada was used to analyze the scanned images to determine root length and root surface area the scanned roots were collected and dried to a constant weight and their weights were recorded the root characteristic parameters root dry weight density rdd mg cm 3 root length density rld cm cm 3 and root surface area density rsd cm2 cm 3 were calculated according to the method of li et al 2010 the formula for calculating the distribution

method of li et al 2019 two sampling points intra plant spots within rows and intra row spots and three sampling points intra plant spots within rows the middle of ridges and the middle of furrows were chosen under fp and rfpm respectively as shown in supplementary material fig s1 a screw drill 5 cm in diameter was used to collect the soil columns in the 0 100 cm soil layer which was divided into 20 cm soil layer intervals then the soil water content of each sample was calculated using the drying method jin et al 2010 the final soil water content of each plot was the average of several sampling points the soil water storage at a certain soil depth was calculated as follows wang et al 2020 sws i 1 n wi bd hi 10 100 where wi is the i th gravimetric soil water layer and bd g cm 3 is

rainwater were obtained according to the method of ma and song 2016 soil and xylem water samples were taken on the same day at a position close to the planting spot of spring maize the soil was collected at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 100 cm using a screw drill to obtain soil water and the first stem node after removing the epidermis of spring maize near the soil was used to obtain xylem water soil and stem samples were collected in each plot placed in glass bottles and sealed with a sealing film a rainwater collecting device consisting of a glass bottle and funnel was used to collect rainwater a ping pong ball was placed in the funnel to prevent evaporation of the rainwater the device was placed outdoors without shelter after each rainfall event the rainwater was immediately transferred to a small glass bottle and sealed a total of 28 rainwater samples were collected during the 2020 growing season a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2000 lica china was used to extract water from the soil and stems west et al 2006 to ensure that the percentage of water extracted from the samples exceeded 98 the soil samples were extracted for 1 0 1 5 h and the stem samples for 2 0 2 5 h all water samples were kept frozen 15 c to 20 c before isotope analysis hydrogen and oxygen isotopic measurements δd and δ18o were carried out using a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime 100 isoprime limited england the measurement accuracy was consistently 2 0 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o soil water xylem water and rainwater samples were calibrated and normalized to internal laboratory water standards that were previously calibrated relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 0 the stable isotopic ratios can be expressed as δd or δ18o rsample rstandard rstandard 1000 2 3 4 the method for determining water uptake depth the theory of determining the water absorption depth of plant roots is based on the fact that no stable isotope fractionation occurs during water absorption and soil layers with isotopic values similar to those of plant xylem can thus be identified as the main water absorption layers of plant roots rossatto et al 2012 link et al 2015 2 3 5 soil layer classification and statistical methods because the average depth of groundwater in the study area exceeds 50 m groundwater was not considered as a potential water source for the spring maize instead the water source was considered to be soil water at different soil depths based on the changes in maize root distribution soil water content and water stable isotopes in different soil layers reported in previous studies ma and song 2016 wu et al 2018a zhao et al 2018 the 0 100 cm soil layer was divided into a shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layer a bayesian mixing model mixsiar was used to estimate the contribution of different soil water sources to the root water absorption of spring maize stock and semmens 2013 wang et al 2019b the mixsiar model required the input of three different data the xylem and soil water isotope compositions δd and δ18o were used as the mixture data and source data respectively and the fractionation values of δd and δ18o were the discrimination data and set to zero in this study spss version 16 0 software was used for statistical analysis and graphpad prism version 8 0 1 to draw diagrams 3 results 3 1 soil water content and storage under different planting models the differences in soil water content and storage between the different planting patterns are shown in fig 2 in most cases during both 2019 and 2020 compared with fp rfpm increased the soil water content of each soil layer between 0 and 100 cm especially under the larger ridge furrow ratio and the difference was most obvious in the 0 20 cm soil layer the water storage capacity of the shallow middle and deep soil layers was also increased under rfpm which led to a significant increase in the water storage capacity of the 0 100 cm soil layer and the larger ridge furrow ratio showed the best water storage effect fig 2b 3 2 root characteristic parameters of spring maize under different planting patterns at the v12 r1 and r6 stages the root characteristic parameters rdd rsd and rld of spring maize decreased with increasing soil depth in the 0 100 cm soil layer in both 2019 and 2020 figs 3 5 in the three growth stages the characteristic parameters of the roots in the r1 stage were larger than those in the v12 and r6 stages the root growth and distribution of spring maize were significantly affected by the planting model figs 3 6 compared with p1 p2 and p3 significantly increased the rdd rsd and rld of the 0 40 cm soil layer in the two growing seasons compared with p1 p2 increased the rdd rsd and rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer by 32 27 21 91 and 39 37 respectively and p3 increased the rdd rsd and rld by 48 33 46 80 and 66 79 respectively when averaged over the different growth stages and years however p2 and p3 did not significantly improve these root characteristic parameters in the deep 60 100 cm soil layer instead they were decreased slightly compared with p1 although the distribution trend of the three root characteristic parameters of spring maize was consistent among the different soil layers the distribution proportions of these parameters were obviously different between the shallow middle and deep soil layers fig 6 compared with rsd and rld rdd showed a higher distribution proportion in the shallow soil layer under the three planting modes under the three planting modes the distribution proportions of rdd rld and rsd of the spring maize in the shallow and middle soil layers were 92 86 97 49 79 13 92 15 and 82 17 95 25 respectively the planting model also affected the distribution of the root characteristic parameters in the different soil layers fig 6 taking shallow soil as an example compared with p1 p2 and p3 increased the distribution proportion of the root characteristic parameters especially rld and rsd specifically p2 increased the proportion of rld and rsd in shallow soil by 5 14 and 5 24 respectively and p3 increased the proportion of these parameters in shallow soil by 7 01 and 9 92 respectively 3 3 isotopic composition of xylem water soil water and rainwater table s1 shows the general characteristics of the isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water and xylem water the δd and δ18o values of precipitation ranged from 95 46 to 24 07 and from 13 53 to 4 17 respectively the local meteoric water line lmwl was established as δd 7 65 δ18o 6 64 r2 0 97 p 0 001 the slope and intercept of the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 were higher than those of the lmwl indicating that the precipitation was affected by evaporative enrichment during the spring maize growth period the δd and δ18o values of soil water displayed great temporal and spatial variations table s1 and fig s3 the δd and δ18o values in soil water ranged from 95 91 to 41 86 and from 12 97 to 4 77 respectively most isotopic composition values of soil water fell below the lmwl fig 7 moreover fig 7 shows that most of the isotopic composition values of soil water fall below the lmwl and the slope and intercept of the δd δ18o relationship of soil water are lower than those of the lmwl indicating that soil water has experienced strong evaporation and enrichment in addition the δd and δ18o values of xylem water ranged from 84 59 to 54 20 and from 10 70 to 6 11 table s1 respectively and these values fell around the fitted line of soil water fig 7 indicating that soil water was the dominant water source for the spring maize 3 4 seasonal variation in the water use pattern of spring maize under different planting modes fig s3 shows that there were obvious differences in the root water absorption depth of the spring maize in different periods however no difference in root water absorption depth among the different planting modes was apparent at the v3 v6 v12 r3 and r6 growth stages of spring maize the dominant water absorption soil layers of the roots under the three planting modes were 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 40 60 cm and 0 10 cm respectively the contributions of three potential soil water sources 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm to the root water use of spring maize were obviously different during the different growth stages of the spring maize and under different planting patterns fig 8 the contribution of the three soil layers to the root water absorption of spring maize was also significantly different among the three planting modes taking the shallow soil layer as an example the contribution of the shallow soil layer to the root water absorption under the p2 and p3 planting modes was greater than that of p1 in the five growth stages in other words rfpm improved the utilization of shallow soil water of the spring maize this phenomenon was more obvious under the larger ridge furrow ratio than under the lower one 3 5 correlation analysis fig 9 shows the relationship between the distribution proportions of the root characteristic parameters in the shallow soil and the shallow soil water content there was no significant relationship between the proportion of rdd and soil water content p 0 05 but there was a significant positive correlation between the proportions of rld and rsd and soil water content in the v12 and r6 growth stages p 0 05 fig 10 shows the relationship between the root characteristic parameter and root water absorption proportions the proportion of rdd had no significant relationship with the root water absorption proportion p 0 05 but the proportions of rld and rsd were positively correlated with the root water absorption proportion p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 rationalization of sampling depth and soil stratification the depth of soil sampling depends on the type of ecosystem huo et al 2018 for studying the water absorption depth of plant roots the sampling depth in forest ecosystems is generally greater than 200 cm huo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 in desert systems greater than 300 cm wu et al 2014 dai et al 2015 and in farmland systems generally between 50 and 200 cm wu et al 2018b liu et al 2021 which is mainly due to the difference in root distribution depth of the different plant types in different ecosystems zhao et al 2018 consistent with the results of previous studies wang et al 2019a this study measured the rooting depth in the critical period of spring maize and found that the rooting depth of spring maize in the two growth seasons was up to 100 cm supplementary material fig s2 indicating that the soil layer in which the roots directly absorb water was also in the range of 0 100 cm to reduce the errors associated with the analytical procedure of plant water use patterns it is often necessary to stratify the soil reasonably huo et al 2018 in this study the 0 100 cm soil layer was divided into three layers a shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm layer based on the following reasons generally the soil water content and stable isotope values of shallow soil are the most unstable and change significantly with time and depth chen et al 2020 similar results were observed in this study fig 2 and table s1 compared with the shallow layer 0 20 cm changes in soil water content and isotope values in the middle layer 20 60 cm were relatively limited ling et al 2017 and the distribution of the root characteristic parameters decreased significantly figs 3 4 5 in the deep layer 60 100 cm the root system distribution was relatively sparse and the isotope value was relatively stable therefore the sampling depth and stratification of soil water in this study are reasonable 4 2 rfpm increased soil water storage efficient collection and utilization of precipitation is the key to improving crop productivity in rainfed agricultural areas han et al 2004 gan et al 2013 and the superiority of the rfpm configuration provides the possibility for efficient utilization of rainwater mo et al 2013 consistent with previous research results mo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 in this study rfpm significantly increased the soil water storage capacity especially in deep soil fig 2 which is of great significance for crops that use deep soil water to avoid extreme drought wang et al 2008 and ren et al 2016 proposed that an appropriate increase in the proportion of ridges and furrows could improve the rainwater harvesting effect and soil moisture content and similar conclusions were obtained in this study fig 2 zhang et al 2019 found that rfpm promoted the growth of spring maize and thus increased the consumption of soil water the soil water under rfpm showed a dynamic alternate between dry and wet compared to fp no similar phenomenon was observed in this study we believed that this is caused by the difference in precipitation between the two studies in the study of zhang et al 2019 the precipitation during the growth period was only 356 9 mm and 382 0 mm while in our study the precipitation in both growth periods exceeded 500 mm more precipitation in time compensated for the excessive consumption of soil water under rfpm so the soil water did not appear to alternate between dry and wet 4 3 temporal and spatial variations of root distribution and water absorption patterns of spring maize under different planting patterns the root system is the most important part for crop growth and development directly affecting the absorption of water and nutrients and indirectly affecting crop productivity gong et al 2020 in this study under both analyzed planting modes the root characteristic parameters of spring maize decreased with increasing soil depth however compared with fp under rfpm the root characteristic parameters rdd rld and rsd increased in the shallow and middle soil layers especially at depths between 0 and 40 cm fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 which is consistent with the results reported by hu et al 2020 temporal and spatial distribution changes of roots determine the temporal and spatial differences in the uptake of soil nutrients and water by the crop to a certain extent yang et al 2004 xu et al 2010 steinemann et al 2015 ali et al 2018 fig 6 shows that the root characteristic parameters of spring maize were mainly distributed in the shallow and middle soil layers the distribution proportions of rdd rld and rsd were 92 86 97 49 79 13 92 15 and 82 17 95 25 respectively however compared to fp rfpm increased the distribution proportions of the root characteristic parameters in the shallow soil layer and decreased the proportions in the deep soil this phenomenon was more obvious at the larger ridge furrow ratio 70 cm 40 cm we believe that this may be related to the increase in soil moisture by rfpm which was further confirmed by correlation analysis that is the distribution proportions of the root characteristic parameters in shallow soil increased with the increase in soil water content fig 9 through direct comparison it was found that the main water absorption layers of the spring maize roots showed dynamic changes at different growth stages fig s3 specifically manifested as shallow middle shallow which is consistent with previous research results zhang et al 2011 ma and song 2016 zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2021 this phenomenon can be explained by the spatial distribution of the roots zhao et al 2018 spring maize is a fibrous root crop li et al 2006 and the vast majority of roots are distributed at soil depths between 0 and 60 cm fig 6 which leads to dynamic changes in the main water absorption layer in the shallow and middle soil layers according to crop demand and soil water supply capacity the soil water supply capacity can lead to changes in the main water absorption layers of crops especially under drought conditions and soil water availability is a major determinant of root water absorption sprenger et al 2016 2019 in this study although rfpm significantly increased the soil water content the main water absorbing soil layers of the spring maize roots at different stages were consistent among the different planting methods indicating that the increase in soil water by rfpm cannot reach the level required for changing the main water absorbing layer of spring maize roots the water absorption proportion of the spring maize roots in the different soil layers varied with the growth period and showed the same trend for the two planting modes fig 8 in the v6 stage the spring maize roots mainly absorbed shallow soil water the absorption proportion of deep soil water increased and that of shallow soil water decreased slightly in the v12 r1 and r3 stages then shallow soil became the main water source again in the r6 stage in many previous studies this phenomenon was attributed to the combined effects of the growth and development of crop roots soil water content and crop demand while the crop type wu et al 2018a zhao et al 2018 planting method liu et al 2021 and fertilizer application ma and song 2016 were thought to not affect it although this trend is consistent the absorption proportions of the spring maize roots to water in the different soil layers were found to differ under the two planting modes fig 8 compared to fp under rfpm the absorption proportion of shallow soil water increased and the absorption proportion of deep soil water decreased and this phenomenon was more obvious at the larger ridge furrow ratio we believe that this may be related to the increase in the distribution proportion of the spring maize root characteristic parameters in shallow soil under rfpm the correlation analysis further proved that the distribution ratios of rld and rsd in shallow soil were significantly positively correlated with the water absorption ratio p 0 05 however rdd did not show a similar relationship fig 10 however the distribution proportions of rld and rsd can only be used as a reference for the root water absorption pattern of spring maize ehleringer and dawson 1992 because it may not reflect the actual temporal and spatial changes in water uptake which depend on root activity wu et al 2014 4 4 implications of this study in recent years the pressure of water resources in agricultural production is increasing sun et al 2007 due to the efficient water saving and water collecting effects of rfpm some researchers began to explore the applicability of rfpm in irrigation areas wu et al 2015 wei et al 2018 ali et al 2019 a recent study found that compared with fp rfpm increased crop yield and wue even though irrigation volume decreased by 40 liu et al 2020 which indicated that rfpm could significantly save irrigation water and improve irrigation water efficiency in irrigation area appropriate irrigation depth can ensure that more irrigation water is distributed in the main water using area of roots yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 and should be consistent with the main water absorbing soil layer of crops penna et al 2020 wu et al 2018 our results provide a reference for irrigation depth of spring maize under rfpm in irrigation area specifically the irrigation depth of spring maize is 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 60 cm and 20 cm in stages v6 v12 r1 r3 and r6 respectively therefore this study provides a key strategy for rfpm to optimize water management and improve irrigation system rfpm has been applied to the cultivation of many crops and the differences in root morphology and water requirement between different crops may also lead to significant differences in water absorption patterns which needs to be further clarified in future studies 5 conclusions in this study we used root excavation and water stable isotope tracing to clarify the response of spring maize root system characteristic parameter distribution and water use pattern to rfpm we found that rfpm did not change the main water use layer of the spring maize roots compared to fp in different growth stages however under rfpm the distribution proportion of the spring maize root characteristic parameters and the proportion of water use of shallow soil increased more obviously under a larger ridge furrow ratio which was related to the increase in shallow soil water content in addition we determined that rld and rsd of spring maize may be the key characteristic parameters affecting root water absorption this study provides key strategies for optimizing water use management and improving irrigation system of spring

9761,ridge furrow plastic film mulching rfpm is an efficient planting technique for rainwater harvesting in rainfed regions of the loess plateau china however relevant data on root water use patterns under rfpm remain sparse to clarify the water use pattern of roots under this planting technique and determine the root characteristic parameters related to water absorption this study conducted a two year field experiment using spring maize with three treatments flat planting fp and rfpm with two different ridge furrow ratios 40 cm 70 cm and 70 cm 40 cm hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes δd and δ18o of different water sources were measured and the mixsiar model was used to quantify the contributions of different water sources to spring maize root water uptake the results showed that the root characteristic parameters of spring maize under the three treatments decreased with increasing soil depth and were mainly distributed in the shallow 0 20 cm and middle 20 60 cm soil layers compared to fp under rfpm the distribution proportions of the root characteristic parameters in shallow soil were higher which may be related to the increase in shallow soil water content the main water absorbing soil layers of spring maize under the three treatments were the same 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 40 60 cm and 0 20 cm in the v6 v12 r1 r3 and r6 growth stages respectively however compared to fp under rfpm the water use proportion of spring maize of shallow soil increased especially under the larger ridge to furrow ratio and correlation analysis showed that this phenomenon might be related to the rfpm increasing the proportion of the spring maize root characteristic parameters in shallow soil correlation analysis further showed that the root length density and root surface area density might be the key characteristic parameters for determining root water uptake graphical abstract ga1 keywords ridge furrow plastic film mulch planting root distribution water absorption pattern spring maize δ18o and δd 1 introduction rainfed agriculture plays a vital role in ensuring food security and is an important part of global agriculture wani et al 2009 liu et al 2014a in china rainfed farmland accounts for 50 of the total farmland liu et al 2014b with the loess plateau being the largest rainfed agricultural region mo et al 2020 comprising an area of 640 000 km2 zhang and liu 2010 the vast majority of the region is located in a semi arid monsoon climate zone eldoma et al 2016 with annual rainfall between 300 and 500 mm mo et al 2013 and precipitation is the only source of water for agricultural production because of the lack of other irrigation water resources li et al 2001 the shortage of water resources severely limits crop productivity therefore improving the collection and utilization of precipitation is the key to solving this problem after decades of research it has been found that in situ rainwater harvesting technologies can effectively improve the collection and utilization of rainwater thereby increasing soil water content precipitation use efficiency and crop productivity compared with flat planting fp gan et al 2013 mo et al 2013 2016 zhang et al 2020 and ridge furrow plastic film mulching rfpm is considered one of the most effective in situ rainwater harvesting techniques in the loess plateau han et al 2004 gan et al 2013 this planting pattern consists of two parts ridges covered with plastic film act as precipitation collecting areas and bare furrows are planting areas that receive water gan et al 2013 this planting pattern increases soil water content by effectively collecting precipitation including ineffective precipitation 5 mm mo et al 2016 and the plastic film covering the ridges can reduce soil water evaporation and regulate soil temperature amplitude zhang et al 2017 2021 qin et al 2019 these improvements in the soil micro environment improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue zhang et al 2019 2020 thidar et al 2020 today the mechanism by which rfpm increases crop yield and wue has been fully explored and researchers attribute the increase to the optimization of the canopy structure liu et al 2018 the promotion of root growth and nutrient uptake jia et al 2018 hu et al 2020 thidar et al 2020 and stimulating the alternation of soil wetting drying to promote crop growth and dry matter accumulation zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 however some problems such as quantifying crops water use from different soil layers and zones under rfpm have not been systematically investigated crop water absorption is the key link of spac soil plant atmosphere continuum in farmland which not only determines the water use capacity of crops but also determines the response mechanism of crops to changes in soil water environment wang et al 2010 therefore quantifying crop water use can reflect the response of crops to rfpm changes in soil water environment which is helpful for us to further deepen our understanding of rfpm improving crop yield and wue the root system is the key bridge between plant internal water and soil water and its state directly affects the water absorption of plants chen et al 2014a many characteristic parameters of root systems including root dry weight density rdd root length density rld root volume density rvd and root surface area density rsd wang et al 2014 determine the function of a root system therefore a number of previous studies analyzed excavated roots to determine the water absorption pattern of plant roots dahlman and kucera 1965 jackson et al 1996 however differences in the distribution proportions of different root characteristic parameters in different soil layers makes it impossible to accurately determine which root characteristic parameter represents the root water use pattern and the existence of the root itself does not represent the root activity williams and ehleringer 2000 wu et al 2016 recently stable isotope tracing techniques δd and δ18o have been applied to the hydrological cycle and have been proven to be an effective tool to study the water use patterns of plant roots kerhoulas et al 2013 penna et al 2020 owing to the absence of isotopic fractionation during root water absorption and significant differences in the isotopic composition of different water sources due to physical processes such as evaporation and permeation schwendenmann et al 2015 sprenger et al 2019 therefore by comparing the isotopic composition of plant xylems and the potential water source the main water absorption depth of plants and the contribution of potential water sources to water absorped by the plant roots can be determined wu et al 2018a owing to the high sensitivity and accuracy of water stable isotope tracer techniques they have been gradually applied to the study of root water use patterns of various crops in recent years for example wang et al 2010 used the isosource model to estimate the water absorption pattern of summer maize roots in the shallow groundwater area of shanxi province china and ma and song 2016 determined the seasonal changes in water absorption of maize under different fertilization conditions in irrigation areas by using stable water isotopes zhao et al 2018 determined the crop water absorption pattern under the typical wheat maize rotation system of the north china plain although stable water isotope tracing technology is widely used in crop root water use pattern studies to the best of our knowledge no study has investigated the crop root water use patterns of crops under rfpm using this technique spring maize is an important representative crop in the loess plateau and is widely cultivated by rfpm therefore is was chosen as the research object in this study a combination of root excavation and water stable isotope tracing was used to determine the distribution of root characteristic parameters and root water use pattern this study aimed to 1 quantitative analysis of the proportion of spring maize root characteristic parameters and root water absorption in different soil layers under rfpm and fp in different growth periods 2 clarify the response of root characteristic parameters and root water use patterns of spring maize to the change of soil water content caused by rfpm and 3 clarify the relationship between soil water root characteristic parameters and root water use patterns of spring maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted at the changwu agro ecological experimental station in the gully region of the loess plateau shaanxi province china fig 1 a the mean annual sunshine forest free period temperature and precipitation of the experimental site were 2230 h 171 days 9 7 c and 548 mm respectively the monthly precipitation and air temperature during the experimental period are shown in fig 1 b the soil type of the experimental field was dark loess soil chinese soil taxonomy table 1 shows the physical and chemical properties of the soil layers between 0 and 100 cm 2 2 experimental design and field management the experiment of this study was conducted twice on the same experimental field once in 2019 and once in 2020 the experimental design adopted was completely random and included three treatments fig 1 a p1 flat planting without mulching fp p2 rfpm with a ridge furrow ratio of 40 cm 70 cm and p3 rfpm with a ridge furrow ratio of 70 cm 40 cm each treatment consisted of three repetitions and the plot size was 48 m2 6 m 8 m the ridge furrow ratio affects the collection of precipitation in theory a larger ridge furrow ratio will result in a better water collection effect mo et al 2013 ren et al 2016 li et al 2019 under rfpm the ridge was covered with a plastic film of 0 015 mm thickness whereas the furrow was not covered before the ridges and furrows were formed the basal fertilizer was applied to the soil surface with application rates of 180 kg n ha 1 and 40 kg p2o5 ha 1 no fertilizer was applied during the spring maize growing period after the ridges and furrows were formed spring maize seeds were sown at the junction of ridge and furrow the spring maize variety planted in this study was xianyu 335 which is widely used locally the sowing date for the 2019 and 2020 experiments were may 10 2019 and may 15 2020 respectively and the planting density was 75 000 plants ha 1 the experiments followed local agronomic recommended management practices for maize production and all weeds in the field were removed manually 2 3 sampling and sample measurement 2 3 1 root characteristic parameters in both 2019 and 2020 spring maize roots were collected from each plot at stages v12 12th leaf r1 silking stage and r6 physiological maturity soil root columns were collected at three different sampling points under fp including at planting spots intra plant spots in the same row and intra row spots because of differences in the microtopography between rfpm and fp four different sampling points of soil root columns were collected under rfpm including at planting spots r1 intra plant spots in the rows r2 spots in the middle of the ridges r3 and spots in the furrows r4 as shown in supplementary material fig s1 at each sampling a root drill with an inner diameter of 10 cm was used to collect the soil root columns at sampling layer widths of 20 cm down to a depth of 100 cm during the sampling process it was found that there was almost no spring maize root system at soil depths exceeding 100 cm supplementary material fig s2 each soil root column was placed into a 0 25 mm sieve and slowly rinsed with running water until the root system was completely separated from the soil the living roots white color were carefully picked out and the dead roots dark color removed with tweezers gregory 1994 then images of the roots of each soil column were taken using a scanner epson v700 indonesia winrhizo software version 5 0 canada was used to analyze the scanned images to determine root length and root surface area the scanned roots were collected and dried to a constant weight and their weights were recorded the root characteristic parameters root dry weight density rdd mg cm 3 root length density rld cm cm 3 and root surface area density rsd cm2 cm 3 were calculated according to the method of li et al 2010 the formula for calculating the distribution proportion of the root characteristic parameters in different soil layers is as follows proportion of rdd rld rsd in a particular soil layer rdd rld rsd of each soil layer rdd rld rsd of the 0 100 cm soil layer 100 2 3 2 soil water content and storage in both 2019 and 2020 the soil water content was measured in each plot before sowing and at stages v6 6th leaf v12 r3 and r6 based on the sampling method of li et al 2019 two sampling points intra plant spots within rows and intra row spots and three sampling points intra plant spots within rows the middle of ridges and the middle of furrows were chosen under fp and rfpm respectively as shown in supplementary material fig s1 a screw drill 5 cm in diameter was used to collect the soil columns in the 0 100 cm soil layer which was divided into 20 cm soil layer intervals then the soil water content of each sample was calculated using the drying method jin et al 2010 the final soil water content of each plot was the average of several sampling points the soil water storage at a certain soil depth was calculated as follows wang et al 2020 sws i 1 n wi bd hi 10 100 where wi is the i th gravimetric soil water layer and bd g cm 3 is the i th soil bulk density layer g cm 3 2 3 3 water sampling and isotope analyses at different growth stages v3 v6 v12 r3 r6 of spring maize during the 2020 growing season soil water xylem water and rainwater were obtained according to the method of ma and song 2016 soil and xylem water samples were taken on the same day at a position close to the planting spot of spring maize the soil was collected at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 100 cm using a screw drill to obtain soil water and the first stem node after removing the epidermis of spring maize near the soil was used to obtain xylem water soil and stem samples were collected in each plot placed in glass bottles and sealed with a sealing film a rainwater collecting device consisting of a glass bottle and funnel was used to collect rainwater a ping pong ball was placed in the funnel to prevent evaporation of the rainwater the device was placed outdoors without shelter after each rainfall event the rainwater was immediately transferred to a small glass bottle and sealed a total of 28 rainwater samples were collected during the 2020 growing season a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2000 lica china was used to extract water from the soil and stems west et al 2006 to ensure that the percentage of water extracted from the samples exceeded 98 the soil samples were extracted for 1 0 1 5 h and the stem samples for 2 0 2 5 h all water samples were kept frozen 15 c to 20 c before isotope analysis hydrogen and oxygen isotopic measurements δd and δ18o were carried out using a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime 100 isoprime limited england the measurement accuracy was consistently 2 0 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o soil water xylem water and rainwater samples were calibrated and normalized to internal laboratory water standards that were previously calibrated relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 0 the stable isotopic ratios can be expressed as δd or δ18o rsample rstandard rstandard 1000 2 3 4 the method for determining water uptake depth the theory of determining the water absorption depth of plant roots is based on the fact that no stable isotope fractionation occurs during water absorption and soil layers with isotopic values similar to those of plant xylem can thus be identified as the main water absorption layers of plant roots rossatto et al 2012 link et al 2015 2 3 5 soil layer classification and statistical methods because the average depth of groundwater in the study area exceeds 50 m groundwater was not considered as a potential water source for the spring maize instead the water source was considered to be soil water at different soil depths based on the changes in maize root distribution soil water content and water stable isotopes in different soil layers reported in previous studies ma and song 2016 wu et al 2018a zhao et al 2018 the 0 100 cm soil layer was divided into a shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layer a bayesian mixing model mixsiar was used to estimate the contribution of different soil water sources to the root water absorption of spring maize stock and semmens 2013 wang et al 2019b the mixsiar model required the input of three different data the xylem and soil water isotope compositions δd and δ18o were used as the mixture data and source data respectively and the fractionation values of δd and δ18o were the discrimination data and set to zero in this study spss version 16 0 software was used for statistical analysis and graphpad prism version 8 0 1 to draw diagrams 3 results 3 1 soil water content and storage under different planting models the differences in soil water content and storage between the different planting patterns are shown in fig 2 in most cases during both 2019 and 2020 compared with fp rfpm increased the soil water content of each soil layer between 0 and 100 cm especially under the larger ridge furrow ratio and the difference was most obvious in the 0 20 cm soil layer the water storage capacity of the shallow middle and deep soil layers was also increased under rfpm which led to a significant increase in the water storage capacity of the 0 100 cm soil layer and the larger ridge furrow ratio showed the best water storage effect fig 2b 3 2 root characteristic parameters of spring maize under different planting patterns at the v12 r1 and r6 stages the root characteristic parameters rdd rsd and rld of spring maize decreased with increasing soil depth in the 0 100 cm soil layer in both 2019 and 2020 figs 3 5 in the three growth stages the characteristic parameters of the roots in the r1 stage were larger than those in the v12 and r6 stages the root growth and distribution of spring maize were significantly affected by the planting model figs 3 6 compared with p1 p2 and p3 significantly increased the rdd rsd and rld of the 0 40 cm soil layer in the two growing seasons compared with p1 p2 increased the rdd rsd and rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer by 32 27 21 91 and 39 37 respectively and p3 increased the rdd rsd and rld by 48 33 46 80 and 66 79 respectively when averaged over the different growth stages and years however p2 and p3 did not significantly improve these root characteristic parameters in the deep 60 100 cm soil layer instead they were decreased slightly compared with p1 although the distribution trend of the three root characteristic parameters of spring maize was consistent among the different soil layers the distribution proportions of these parameters were obviously different between the shallow middle and deep soil layers fig 6 compared with rsd and rld rdd showed a higher distribution proportion in the shallow soil layer under the three planting modes under the three planting modes the distribution proportions of rdd rld and rsd of the spring maize in the shallow and middle soil layers were 92 86 97 49 79 13 92 15 and 82 17 95 25 respectively the planting model also affected the distribution of the root characteristic parameters in the different soil layers fig 6 taking shallow soil as an example compared with p1 p2 and p3 increased the distribution proportion of the root characteristic parameters especially rld and rsd specifically p2 increased the proportion of rld and rsd in shallow soil by 5 14 and 5 24 respectively and p3 increased the proportion of these parameters in shallow soil by 7 01 and 9 92 respectively 3 3 isotopic composition of xylem water soil water and rainwater table s1 shows the general characteristics of the isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water and xylem water the δd and δ18o values of precipitation ranged from 95 46 to 24 07 and from 13 53 to 4 17 respectively the local meteoric water line lmwl was established as δd 7 65 δ18o 6 64 r2 0 97 p 0 001 the slope and intercept of the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 were higher than those of the lmwl indicating that the precipitation was affected by evaporative enrichment during the spring maize growth period the δd and δ18o values of soil water displayed great temporal and spatial variations table s1 and fig s3 the δd and δ18o values in soil water ranged from 95 91 to 41 86 and from 12 97 to 4 77 respectively most isotopic composition values of soil water fell below the lmwl fig 7 moreover fig 7 shows that most of the isotopic composition values of soil water fall below the lmwl and the slope and intercept of the δd δ18o relationship of soil water are lower than those of the lmwl indicating that soil water has experienced strong evaporation and enrichment in addition the δd and δ18o values of xylem water ranged from 84 59 to 54 20 and from 10 70 to 6 11 table s1 respectively and these values fell around the fitted line of soil water fig 7 indicating that soil water was the dominant water source for the spring maize 3 4 seasonal variation in the water use pattern of spring maize under different planting modes fig s3 shows that there were obvious differences in the root water absorption depth of the spring maize in different periods however no difference in root water absorption depth among the different planting modes was apparent at the v3 v6 v12 r3 and r6 growth stages of spring maize the dominant water absorption soil layers of the roots under the three planting modes were 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 40 60 cm and 0 10 cm respectively the contributions of three potential soil water sources 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm to the root water use of spring maize were obviously different during the different growth stages of the spring maize and under different planting patterns fig 8 the contribution of the three soil layers to the root water absorption of spring maize was also significantly different among the three planting modes taking the shallow soil layer as an example the contribution of the shallow soil layer to the root water absorption under the p2 and p3 planting modes was greater than that of p1 in the five growth stages in other words rfpm improved the utilization of shallow soil water of the spring maize this phenomenon was more obvious under the larger ridge furrow ratio than under the lower one 3 5 correlation analysis fig 9 shows the relationship between the distribution proportions of the root characteristic parameters in the shallow soil and the shallow soil water content there was no significant relationship between the proportion of rdd and soil water content p 0 05 but there was a significant positive correlation between the proportions of rld and rsd and soil water content in the v12 and r6 growth stages p 0 05 fig 10 shows the relationship between the root characteristic parameter and root water absorption proportions the proportion of rdd had no significant relationship with the root water absorption proportion p 0 05 but the proportions of rld and rsd were positively correlated with the root water absorption proportion p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 rationalization of sampling depth and soil stratification the depth of soil sampling depends on the type of ecosystem huo et al 2018 for studying the water absorption depth of plant roots the sampling depth in forest ecosystems is generally greater than 200 cm huo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 in desert systems greater than 300 cm wu et al 2014 dai et al 2015 and in farmland systems generally between 50 and 200 cm wu et al 2018b liu et al 2021 which is mainly due to the difference in root distribution depth of the different plant types in different ecosystems zhao et al 2018 consistent with the results of previous studies wang et al 2019a this study measured the rooting depth in the critical period of spring maize and found that the rooting depth of spring maize in the two growth seasons was up to 100 cm supplementary material fig s2 indicating that the soil layer in which the roots directly absorb water was also in the range of 0 100 cm to reduce the errors associated with the analytical procedure of plant water use patterns it is often necessary to stratify the soil reasonably huo et al 2018 in this study the 0 100 cm soil layer was divided into three layers a shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm layer based on the following reasons generally the soil water content and stable isotope values of shallow soil are the most unstable and change significantly with time and depth chen et al 2020 similar results were observed in this study fig 2 and table s1 compared with the shallow layer 0 20 cm changes in soil water content and isotope values in the middle layer 20 60 cm were relatively limited ling et al 2017 and the distribution of the root characteristic parameters decreased significantly figs 3 4 5 in the deep layer 60 100 cm the root system distribution was relatively sparse and the isotope value was relatively stable therefore the sampling depth and stratification of soil water in this study are reasonable 4 2 rfpm increased soil water storage efficient collection and utilization of precipitation is the key to improving crop productivity in rainfed agricultural areas han et al 2004 gan et al 2013 and the superiority of the rfpm configuration provides the possibility for efficient utilization of rainwater mo et al 2013 consistent with previous research results mo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 in this study rfpm significantly increased the soil water storage capacity especially in deep soil fig 2 which is of great significance for crops that use deep soil water to avoid extreme drought wang et al 2008 and ren et al 2016 proposed that an appropriate increase in the proportion of ridges and furrows could improve the rainwater harvesting effect and soil moisture content and similar conclusions were obtained in this study fig 2 zhang et al 2019 found that rfpm promoted the growth of spring maize and thus increased the consumption of soil water the soil water under rfpm showed a dynamic alternate between dry and wet compared to fp no similar phenomenon was observed in this study we believed that this is caused by the difference in precipitation between the two studies in the study of zhang et al 2019 the precipitation during the growth period was only 356 9 mm and 382 0 mm while in our study the precipitation in both growth periods exceeded 500 mm more precipitation in time compensated for the excessive consumption of soil water under rfpm so the soil water did not appear to alternate between dry and wet 4 3 temporal and spatial variations of root distribution and water absorption patterns of spring maize under different planting patterns the root system is the most important part for crop growth and development directly affecting the absorption of water and nutrients and indirectly affecting crop productivity gong et al 2020 in this study under both analyzed planting modes the root characteristic parameters of spring maize decreased with increasing soil depth however compared with fp under rfpm the root characteristic parameters rdd rld and rsd increased in the shallow and middle soil layers especially at depths between 0 and 40 cm fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 which is consistent with the results reported by hu et al 2020 temporal and spatial distribution changes of roots determine the temporal and spatial differences in the uptake of soil nutrients and water by the crop to a certain extent yang et al 2004 xu et al 2010 steinemann et al 2015 ali et al 2018 fig 6 shows that the root characteristic parameters of spring maize were mainly distributed in the shallow and middle soil layers the distribution proportions of rdd rld and rsd were 92 86 97 49 79 13 92 15 and 82 17 95 25 respectively however compared to fp rfpm increased the distribution proportions of the root characteristic parameters in the shallow soil layer and decreased the proportions in the deep soil this phenomenon was more obvious at the larger ridge furrow ratio 70 cm 40 cm we believe that this may be related to the increase in soil moisture by rfpm which was further confirmed by correlation analysis that is the distribution proportions of the root characteristic parameters in shallow soil increased with the increase in soil water content fig 9 through direct comparison it was found that the main water absorption layers of the spring maize roots showed dynamic changes at different growth stages fig s3 specifically manifested as shallow middle shallow which is consistent with previous research results zhang et al 2011 ma and song 2016 zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2021 this phenomenon can be explained by the spatial distribution of the roots zhao et al 2018 spring maize is a fibrous root crop li et al 2006 and the vast majority of roots are distributed at soil depths between 0 and 60 cm fig 6 which leads to dynamic changes in the main water absorption layer in the shallow and middle soil layers according to crop demand and soil water supply capacity the soil water supply capacity can lead to changes in the main water absorption layers of crops especially under drought conditions and soil water availability is a major determinant of root water absorption sprenger et al 2016 2019 in this study although rfpm significantly increased the soil water content the main water absorbing soil layers of the spring maize roots at different stages were consistent among the different planting methods indicating that the increase in soil water by rfpm cannot reach the level required for changing the main water absorbing layer of spring maize roots the water absorption proportion of the spring maize roots in the different soil layers varied with the growth period and showed the same trend for the two planting modes fig 8 in the v6 stage the spring maize roots mainly absorbed shallow soil water the absorption proportion of deep soil water increased and that of shallow soil water decreased slightly in the v12 r1 and r3 stages then shallow soil became the main water source again in the r6 stage in many previous studies this phenomenon was attributed to the combined effects of the growth and development of crop roots soil water content and crop demand while the crop type wu et al 2018a zhao et al 2018 planting method liu et al 2021 and fertilizer application ma and song 2016 were thought to not affect it although this trend is consistent the absorption proportions of the spring maize roots to water in the different soil layers were found to differ under the two planting modes fig 8 compared to fp under rfpm the absorption proportion of shallow soil water increased and the absorption proportion of deep soil water decreased and this phenomenon was more obvious at the larger ridge furrow ratio we believe that this may be related to the increase in the distribution proportion of the spring maize root characteristic parameters in shallow soil under rfpm the correlation analysis further proved that the distribution ratios of rld and rsd in shallow soil were significantly positively correlated with the water absorption ratio p 0 05 however rdd did not show a similar relationship fig 10 however the distribution proportions of rld and rsd can only be used as a reference for the root water absorption pattern of spring maize ehleringer and dawson 1992 because it may not reflect the actual temporal and spatial changes in water uptake which depend on root activity wu et al 2014 4 4 implications of this study in recent years the pressure of water resources in agricultural production is increasing sun et al 2007 due to the efficient water saving and water collecting effects of rfpm some researchers began to explore the applicability of rfpm in irrigation areas wu et al 2015 wei et al 2018 ali et al 2019 a recent study found that compared with fp rfpm increased crop yield and wue even though irrigation volume decreased by 40 liu et al 2020 which indicated that rfpm could significantly save irrigation water and improve irrigation water efficiency in irrigation area appropriate irrigation depth can ensure that more irrigation water is distributed in the main water using area of roots yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 and should be consistent with the main water absorbing soil layer of crops penna et al 2020 wu et al 2018 our results provide a reference for irrigation depth of spring maize under rfpm in irrigation area specifically the irrigation depth of spring maize is 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 60 cm and 20 cm in stages v6 v12 r1 r3 and r6 respectively therefore this study provides a key strategy for rfpm to optimize water management and improve irrigation system rfpm has been applied to the cultivation of many crops and the differences in root morphology and water requirement between different crops may also lead to significant differences in water absorption patterns which needs to be further clarified in future studies 5 conclusions in this study we used root excavation and water stable isotope tracing to clarify the response of spring maize root system characteristic parameter distribution and water use pattern to rfpm we found that rfpm did not change the main water use layer of the spring maize roots compared to fp in different growth stages however under rfpm the distribution proportion of the spring maize root characteristic parameters and the proportion of water use of shallow soil increased more obviously under a larger ridge furrow ratio which was related to the increase in shallow soil water content in addition we determined that rld and rsd of spring maize may be the key characteristic parameters affecting root water absorption this study provides key strategies for optimizing water use management and improving irrigation system of spring

9762,water and soil in agricultural areas are usually enriched with nutrients from excessive fertilizations riparian zones the interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic systems play crucial roles in delivery of the nutrients to groundwater and surface water we evaluated spatiotemporal variations of water flow and nutrients in a mesoscale agricultural catchment along the riparian zones of the main stream for dry and rainy season by hydrologic monitoring and measurements of hydrochemical parameters and water stable isotopes gaining stream conditions were dominant in the mountainous upper reaches with steep topographic gradient while groundwater level in the lower basin considerably varied seasonally due to intense groundwater pumping to aid in heating greenhouses in winter season which resulted in losing stream conditions during the dry season compared to shallow groundwater deep groundwater had higher nitrate concentration derived from dry farmland in hilly terrains and induced recharge due to the groundwater pumping nitrate concentration was significantly higher in groundwater than that in stream water indicating that groundwater is a major source of nitrate in stream water considering mainly gaining stream conditions compared to stream water dissolved phosphorus concentration was higher in shallow groundwater recharged from paddy fields and floodplain areas with reducing conditions evaporation signature of water stable isotopes and lower nitrate concentration nutrient flux estimates for the catchment revealed that nitrate in stream water is considerably contributed by groundwater discharge and shallow groundwater in reducing conditions is a significant source of dissolved phosphorus in stream water which was more pronounced in the rainy season this study demonstrated that intense agricultural activities in riparian zones strongly affect stream aquifer interactions and nutrient delivery to the stream as well as groundwater these findings can contribute to understanding hydrological and biogeochemical processes of nutrients in agricultural catchments and establishing an effective management of water use and nutrient application graphical

1 introduction agriculturally derived nutrients that exceed plant uptake degrade the quality of water resources and contribute to the eutrophication of fresh water and coastal water smith et al 1999 vitousek et al 2009 since the early 1960s the concentration of nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus in groundwater has increased worldwide in agricultural areas due to the increased use of chemical fertilizers and manure appelo and postma 1996 howarth et al 2002 the dominant factors controlling nutrient leaching to groundwater and surface water are hydrological conditions involved in nutrient transport and surpluses of agricultural contaminants takatert et al 1999 oenema et al 2005 nitrate is the predominant species among agricultural nitrogen compounds and its high mobility results in considerable contamination of groundwater ritter et al 2007 menció et al 2016 elevated nitrate in groundwater discharges to adjacent surface water through baseflow and this is a major contributor of nitrate in agricultural catchments martin et al 2004 koh et al 2010 phosphorus in the subsurface has been considered mostly immobile due to adsorption to soil and sediments in the vadose and saturated zones robertson et al 1998 carlyle and hill 2001 the increase in phosphorus concentration in surface water has been mostly attributed to direct runoff or interflow over agricultural landscapes rather than groundwater discharge sharpley 1995 however recent studies showed that a significant portion of phosphorus in surface water is derived from groundwater through baseflow tesoriero et al 2009 yu et al 2018 compared to surface runoff phosphorus leaching to surface water from groundwater occurs continuously with high fractions of soluble phosphorus hansen et al 2002 temporal and spatial patterns of phosphorus concentration in surface water also depend on the types and spatial distribution of crops growing in the area edwards and withers 2007 phosphorus leaching can occur from heavily fertilized agricultural landscapes and agricultural land use has a significant effect on the concentration of groundwater phosphorus mcdowell and sharpley 2004 the enrichment processes of phosphorus in groundwater are dissolution from the soil and sediment matrix either in the vadose or the saturated zone in reducing conditions moore jr and reddy 1994 dissolved phosphorus in groundwater has received less attention than nitrate except a few early studies that reported significant levels of phosphorus in groundwater along with nitrate and other hydrochemical parameters banaszuk et al 2005 rajmohan and elango 2005 recently some studies have examined the correlation of fe dissolved oxygen do and redox potentials with a focus on phosphorus enrichment in groundwater dupas et al 2015 schilling et al 2018 riparian zones have been commonly recognized as buffer zones for nutrients and found to play a role in reducing nutrient discharge to surface water hill 1996 dosskey et al 2010 riparian zones have however also been recognized as a source of nutrients due to their continuous supply of nutrients in recent years over the retention capacities of soil vidon et al 2010 dwivedi et al 2018 most previous studies on the change in phosphorus concentration in surface water due to groundwater contributions have been conducted in lakes shaw et al 1990 vanek 1991 enriched phosphorus in groundwater can also significantly contribute to stream water in agricultural watersheds domagalski and johnson 2011 roy and bickerton 2014 and more recently several studies have been conducted to determine the factors of phosphorus occurrence in groundwater and its effect on surface water vidon et al 2010 gu et al 2017 a better understanding of water flow systems and nutrient enrichment in agricultural riparian zones is needed so that management plans for preventing the degradation of water quality for both groundwater and surface water at the catchment scale can be developed we tested a hypothesis that intensive agricultural activities involving heavy seasonal pumping and diverse agricultural land uses strongly affect nutrient dynamics in the riparian aquifers and the stream at the catchment scale along the main channel for this purpose we investigated seasonal and spatial variation in direction and rate of water flow between the stream and aquifer and evaluated the controlling factors of nutrients in groundwater using hydrochemical parameter δd and δ18o of water and spatial analysis of land uses in this study we highlighted the impact of groundwater on nutrient concentrations in stream water through baseflow integrating stream aquifer interactions and nutrient dynamics in the riparian aquifers 2 study area 2 1 site description noseongcheon stream is located in the mid western region of south korea and has a catchment area of 202 3 km2 it is a sixth order stream that flows from north to southwest and a tributary of the geum river one of the four major rivers in korea fig 1 the main lithology of the study area is jurassic granitic rock precambrian gneiss and schist are found only in the mountainous northwestern area and cretaceous acidic dikes are distributed in the north south direction to the eastern part of the catchment chang and hwang 1980 there are two reservoirs at the headwater of the stream and the water level of the stream is regulated by the reservoirs and several weirs in the stream channels the riparian zones of the stream are flat with widths of up to 1 5 km and elevations of 60 m upstream and 20 m downstream graduating to hilly regions with gentle slopes to the catchment boundary and reaching a maximum elevation of 830 m in the northeastern portion the 30 year average total annual precipitation between 1998 and 2017 was 1244 mm and the average groundwater recharge rate was 15 9 of precipitation k water 2015 sixty seven percent of the total precipitation is concentrated in hot and humid rainy season summer conditions from july to september the cold and dry winter dry season extends from november to january meteorological data were acquired from the nonsan automatic weather station operated by the korea meteorological administration kma the total number of wells in noseongcheon catchment is 6054 and groundwater withdrawal is 6 5 million m3 yr 1 corresponding to 16 of total precipitation k water 2015 the amount of groundwater withdrawal for agriculture was estimated to be 4 7 million m3 year 1 and accounted for 73 5 of the total groundwater use domestic and industrial groundwater use were estimated to be 1 5 million m3 yr 1 and 0 17 million m3 yr 1 accounting for 23 9 and 2 6 respectively 2 2 agricultural activities the agricultural area comprises 45 of the total catchment area and the natural land cover comprises 43 the paddy fields and dry farmlands ratio in the agricultural area is 2 1 paddy fields are distributed along the riparian zones of the stream and dry farmland is distributed on the hilly slopes the artificial levees divide the riparian areas into stream side and plain side areas most of the plain side areas are used as paddy fields or greenhouses and the stream side areas were previously used as cultivated land but are now restored to natural areas the average annual nitrogen and phosphorus chemical fertilizer usage were 113 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 36 kg ha 1 yr 1 for the period between 2013 and 2017 respectively nonsan si 2007 the consumption of chemical fertilizers in the study area is slightly less than the average annual use of nitrogen and phosphorus chemical fertilizers in south korea being 117 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 38 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively for the same period mafra 2018 in the study area rice is a representative crop that is harvested from paddy fields since 2003 strawberry cultivation has become widespread and considerable portions of paddy fields have been converted to dry farmland for vegetable cultivation including strawberry cucumber and lettuce water curtain cultivation wcc is conducted using groundwater as a heat source to grow strawberries in the greenhouse during winter according to previous studies the groundwater level in the study area has decreased by up to 8 m lee et al 2015 a detailed description of the wcc and its impact on groundwater flow and contamination in the riparian zones is provided by kwon et al 2020 3 methods 3 1 hydrometric measurements to determine direction and rate of water flow between the stream and the adjacent aquifers we measured stream discharge and stream water level in april and october 2018 corresponding to dry and rainy season respectively at upstream and downstream sites of three zones of upper reach zone a middle reach zone b and lower reach zone c we also measured groundwater level in domestic wells at the time of stream discharge measurements in each zone the water level difference was obtained in each zone by subtracting the stream water level swl from the adjacent groundwater level gwl fig 1 except for event water due to rainfall most of perennial stream discharge is derived from baseflow and the increase in stream discharge with flow distance downstream can be regarded as baseflow contribution if there is no tributary water flux between groundwater and stream was estimated by the difference of stream discharge between upstream and downstream sites without water inflow from tributaries the groundwater level was measured manually using a water level recorder kl 010 ott kempten germany and the stream level was measured using a relative height difference from a point on the stationary structure to compare the groundwater and stream levels a global navigation satellite system gnss survey was performed using a tsc3 controller and a r8 gnss receiver trimble sunnyvale ca usa to measure absolute altitude for water level comparison the groundwater level measurement points were selected as close as possible to the stream level measurement points the flow rate measurement was performed at the same time as the water level measurement stream discharge was measured using the velocity area method and the flow rate was measured using a wading rode measurements current meter c2 ott kempten germany groundwater level monitoring data from 2014 to 2018 were obtained for two monitoring wells of national groundwater observation network ngon located in the riparian zones of the middle and lower basin of the catchment respectively to assess long term changes in groundwater level and flow and rate of water flow between stream and groundwater fig 1 the gaining and losing conditions of the stream were defined by comparing stream discharges at the upstream and downstream sites of each zone and surface water level with adjacent groundwater level at each well 3 2 sampling and laboratory analysis groundwater and surface water samples were obtained over two sampling periods from april 10 to may 10 and from september 1 to september 30 in 2018 corresponding to dry and rainy season respectively wells were classified as shallow and deep based on the depth of 50 m corresponding to the boundary between the alluvial and weathered zones and fractured bedrock aquifers 15 shallow groundwater 25 deep groundwater samples were taken from domestic wells using dedicated pumps and 60 surface water samples were collected from

analysis principal component analysis pca one of multivariate statistical analysis methods allows a reduction in the number of variables that are obtained from field and laboratory measurements this method is usually applied to identification of the processes controlling hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater and surface water woocay et al 2008 in this study nitrate and dissolved phosphorus concentrations were incorporated into pca to reveal their relations with other variables and the processes controlling contamination of nutrients in groundwater and surface water menció et al 2016 o toole et al 2018 spatial variables for land uses were obtained using geographic information system gis which are commonly used in assessment of contaminants derived from the surface environment gemitzi et al 2009 a circular buffer was created centered on the groundwater well and areal proportions of land uses were calculated within the circular buffer the buffer radii of 50 m and 300 m were used for shallow and deep wells respectively considering the different effective radius depending on the well depth benson et al 2006 the land uses were classified into three major categories of

zhao et al 2012 groundwater level in the ngon monitoring well near the middle reach was readily responded to precipitation events and considerably higher than stream water level indicating gaining stream conditions are persistent fig 2a by contrast groundwater level in the ngon monitoring well near the lower reach showed negligible responses to precipitation and was much lower than stream water level by 4 9 m which clearly shows losing stream conditions are prevalent fig 2b it is also notable that groundwater level of the well had a strong sinusoidal seasonal variation with annual minimums in april when intensive pumping ends and a long term decreasing trend for the whole monitoring period suggesting impacts of pumping on the riparian aquifers are extensive the seasonal measurements of stream discharge in the selected reaches and the differences in water levels between the stream and the aquifers were shown in fig 3 the stream discharge in the upper reach of zone a had the smallest seasonal variation which was 10 of the variation at the downstream site fig 3 the groundwater levels in the riparian area near the upper reach were higher than the stream level regardless of season with the largest head differences the middle and lower reaches under intense agricultural activities in their riparian zones showed higher seasonal variations in stream discharge and water levels fig 3 the wccs which consume large amounts of groundwater in winter were concentrated in the lower reach and paddy fields using surface water for irrigation water were concentrated in the middle reach fig 1 at the downstream site of the middle reach of zone b stream discharge showed a considerable change of 40 103 m3 day 1 in april and 113 103 m3 day 1 in october and was supplied from both the main stream and another two major tributaries the groundwater level was consistently higher than the stream water level in the middle reach but with smaller head differences compared to the upper reach in the lower reach of zone c stream discharge between the upstream and downstream sites decreased by 4 103 m3 day 1 in april and increased by 20 103 m3 day 1 in october fig 3 compared to the stream water level the groundwater level was up to 2 m higher in october and was 2 5 m lower in april this was a clear indication that losing stream conditions were significant in the lower reach in the dry winter season in the lower region of the catchment wcc activity pumps 420 m3 day 1 ha 1 of groundwater during the winter season which usually ends in april lee et al 2015 it was reported that groundwater decline in the riparian zones with wcc activity in south korea is considerable reducing groundwater discharge to the stream and inducing stream water infiltration to the adjacent aquifers during the winter season chang and chung 2015 lee et al 2017 4 2 hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of groundwater and stream water the groundwater in the study area was mainly the ca hco3 type with significantly higher levels of mg2 no3 and so4 2 than the natural alluvial groundwater around the study area fig s1 generally concentrations of agricultural contaminants such as ca2 mg2 and no3 are higher in shallow groundwater than in deep groundwater because they are derived from the surface environment böhlke 2002 interactions between water and granitic rocks also contribute to solutes such as sio2 aq and f to groundwater whose concentrations are usually elevated in deep groundwater with an increase in the degree of mineralization chae et al 2009 in this study the shallow groundwater had higher sio2 aq concentrations than the deep groundwater fig 4 but the concentration of f showed no clear relationship with well depth fig 5 the concentration of do in groundwater generally decreases with increasing depth puckett et al 2002 in the current study this trend was reversed in the riparian aquifers shallow groundwater had a lower dissolved oxygen concentration than deep groundwater fig 5 the groundwater samples in this study were compared with those of koh et al 2009 which were taken from various topographic settings including the present study area and showed that do concentration decreased with depth overall in noseongcheon catchment shallow groundwater had lower do and higher fe mn and doc concentrations than deep groundwater and was more pronounced in the rainy season fig 5 some groundwater in oxic conditions had detectable fe and mn which is indicative of the mixing of groundwater with diverse flow paths koh et al 2006 puig et al 2013 the groundwater in the study area had little seasonal variation but had a wider range of isotopic compositions which can be attributed to diverse topographic settings and land use patterns fig 6 this indicates that groundwater had seasonally averaged recharge which is spatially diverse in water sources and flow paths depending on the location in the catchment furthermore stream water had a more enriched isotopic composition with the increase in flow distance downstream regardless of the season indicating that stream water variably contributed by seasonally different water sources controlled by precipitation and agricultural water use fig s2 4 3 occurrence of nutrients in groundwater and stream water the average nitrate concentration in deep groundwater 35 4 mg l 1 was higher than that in shallow groundwater 24 4 mg l 1 with a positive correlation between well depth and the upper limit of nitrate concentration table 1 fig 5 the degree of nitrate contamination in groundwater was classified by low contaminated and high contaminated threshold concentrations of 16 6 mg l 1 37 1 mg l 1 respectively which were established by kim et al 2015 for south korea sixty percent of shallow groundwater and 64 of deep groundwater had a nitrate concentration higher than 16 6 mg l 1 and 33 of shallow groundwater and 42 of deep groundwater had a nitrate concentration higher than 37 1 mg l 1 nitrate in groundwater showed a positive relationship with ca2 mg2 which also increased with depth figs 5 and 7 this is because ca2 and mg2 can be derived from liming materials used to prevent soil acidification pierson wickmann et al 2009 the low nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater could be attributed to lower nitrogen loading and favorable conditions for denitrification hill 1996 in contrast groundwater in a previous study for the area koh et al 2009 which is more evenly distributed over the catchment had elevated concentrations mostly in shallow groundwater with a decreasing trend with well depth elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater are associated with higher do concentrations near 8 mg l 1 and lower concentrations of fluoride the concentration of tdp was higher in shallow groundwater than deep groundwater with average concentrations of 0 08 mg l 1 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively table 1 fig 5 to assess the degree of tdp contamination we designated a high contamination threshold of 0 1 mg l 1 and a low contamination threshold of 0 05 mg l 1 in consideration of the median of good moderate thresholds of european countries and the environmental quality standards of korea for lakes me 2018 poikane et al 2019 fifty percent of shallow groundwater and 38 of deep groundwater had tdp concentrations higher than 0 05 mg l 1 which showed phosphorus enrichment in shallow groundwater fig 5 in particular 30 of shallow groundwater and 4 of deep groundwater were classified by high contaminated group the median tdp concentration of stream water was 0 05 mg l 1 which was lower than that of more than half of the groundwater compared to nitrate tdp in groundwater showed a different occurrence with a negative relationship between nitrate and tdp concentrations fig 7 it is well known that dissolved phosphorus is released from sediments by the reductive dissolution of iron hydroxides resulting in a positive relationship between tdp and fe concentrations in pore water and groundwater carlyle and hill 2001 dupas et al 2015 in this study tdp concentration showed a positive correlation in shallow groundwater with higher concentrations of fe and mn fig 7 although the majority of groundwater had a lower fe concentration tdp and sulfate concentrations showed a negative correlation and groundwater with concentrations of tdp higher than the high contaminated threshold had sulfate concentrations lower than 20 mg l 1 fig 7 nutrient concentrations in stream water increased towards the downstream reaches which is readily attributed to the increase in agricultural activities from the upper zone dominated by natural areas to the middle zone with extensive farmlands fig s2 nitrate concentration in stream water increased rapidly in the upper zone compared to low nitrate concentration in the headwater zone in the reaches with more than 10 km of flow distance nitrate concentration in stream water gradually increased downstream reaching up to about 10 mg l 1 tdp concentration in groundwater was much lower in the headwater zone than those in the lower zones in the dry season tdp concentration in stream water increased with the increase of flow distance starting from the reservoir and then decreased sharply near the downstream site at 20 km on the other hand tdp concentration increased sharply downstream to the middle zone and remained at the level further downstream to the lower zone in the rainy season seasonally tdp concentration in stream water was higher in the rainy season when both surface runoff and baseflow discharges were higher than those in the dry season 4 4 effects of land uses on nutrients in groundwater and stream water the relationship between land use and nutrient concentrations in groundwater was examined using cl concentration and δ18o as indicators for the effects of the major land uses on groundwater martin et al 2004 the three end members which were defined by natural paddy fields and residential dry farmland has been suggested by koh et al 2010 for the study area three groups of groundwater samples based on the nitrate contamination thresholds in south korea were clearly distinguished from the highly contaminated group aligned between the natural area and residential dry farmland and the low contaminated group on the line between the natural area and paddy fields fig 8 in contrast the groundwater in the paddy fields had an elevated tdp concentration and groundwater in the residential dry farmland had the lowest level of tdp fig 8 all of the shallow groundwater samples with tdp concentrations higher than the high contamination threshold were located in or near paddy fields except for ng 32 indicating that reducing conditions were a major controlling factor for the occurrence of elevated tdp in groundwater pca of chemical and isotopic parameters of groundwater and areal proportion of dry farmland produced pcs representing major hydrological and geochemical processes controlling nutrient concentration in the aquifers of the riparian zones dry season groundwater showed that pc1 had strong positive relationships with ec ca2 mg2 and cl fig 9 indicating that contamination sources from agricultural activities dominate major solute chemistry of groundwater böhlke 2002 koh et al 2009 pc2 had positive loadings on δ18o δ2h doc hco3 tdp and negative loadings on nitrate eh and areal proportion of dry farmland this indicates that pc2 represents anoxic groundwater with enriched isotopic compositions which is less affected by dry farmland rainy season groundwater had pc1 with strong positive loadings on ec ca2 mg2 sr2 and cl showing similar to dry season groundwater also representing agricultural contamination fig 9 pc2 was negatively related to nitrate and highly positively related to δ18o and δ2h fe and sio2 aq which is indicative of anoxic groundwater with evaporation signatures unlike the pc2 from the results of dry season this component was not related to enriched tdp pc3 which explains the process of nitrate contamination had strong positive relationship with areal proportion of dry farmland and negative relationship with f ph and hco3 representing the increase in nitrate concentrations in groundwater due to recharge through dry farmland fig 9 pc5 which showed a strong positive relationship with tdp showed positive relationship with doc and k and negative relationship with f and eh table s2 unlike the pca results of groundwater stream water had smaller number of pcs and higher total variance explained by pc1 with less differences in pc loadings between seasons in both seasons pc1 was positively related to both nitrate and tdp and also to most of cations and anions except fe and f fig 10 this indicated that intensive agricultural activities dominate concentrations of major solutes including nutrients in stream water the simultaneous positive loadings of nitrate and tdp on pc1 in stream water indicates that nitrate and tdp undergo similar transport processes while they are affected by more complicated processes of transport and attenuation in groundwater pc2 had negative relationships with eh and sio2 aq and a positive relationship with doc in both seasons while it had different relationships with δ18o and δ2h according to the seasons fig 10 representing contribution of shallow subsurface flow to the stream with the evaporation signature of stable isotopes in the dry season 4 5 nutrient discharge to the stream through baseflow we evaluated the potential impact of nutrients in groundwater to stream using baseflow discharge to the stream reach and nutrient concentration in adjacent groundwater baseflow discharge was estimated by the difference in stream discharge measured at the upstream and downstream sites in each zone nutrient fluxes from groundwater to the stream through baseflow was calculated by multiplying the baseflow discharge by the average of nutrient concentrations in adjacent groundwater table 2 nitrate flux to the stream was highest in the zone a 24 5 kg n ha 1 day 1 the upper reach in the rainy season and lowest in the zone b 14 7 kg n ha 1 day 1 the middle reach in the dry season the low nitrate flux in the zone b is attributed to low nitrate concentration in groundwater driven by denitrification in paddy fields in the riparian zones nitrate concentration in groundwater near the zone c was highest due to higher proportion of dry farmland in the riparian zones however nitrate flux to the stream in the zone c was 22 1 kg n ha 1 day 1 which was lower than that in the zone a because baseflow discharge was lowest due to wcc activities tdp flux to the stream through baseflow was highest in the zone b during the rainy season 0 9 kg p ha 1 day 1 and lowest in the zone c during the rainy season 0 1 kg p ha 1 day 1 table 2 the average tdp concentration in groundwater for each zone was in the increasing order of zone a zone c and zone b in the zone c the concentration of tdp in the groundwater was not high and baseflow discharge is low which led to the lowest tdp flux on the other hand both tdp concentration in groundwater and baseflow discharge were high in the zone b during the rainy season resulting in the highest tdp flux to the stream 5 discussion 5 1 diverse groundwater flow systems in riparian zones of the agricultural catchment along the reach in the study area groundwater and stream water interactions variably affected water flow and hydrochemical parameters including nutrient concentrations in the riparian zones depending on agricultural activities topographic indices and the seasonal effects of a monsoonal climate takatert et al 1999 martin et al 2004 the upper zone of the study area catchment has narrow floodplain of riparian zones and steep slopes resulting in significant groundwater discharge to the stream regardless of the season fig 3 in the middle zone of the study area catchment flat topography and paddy fields containing low permeable layer are dominant in the riparian zones maintaining gaining conditions but with less groundwater discharge to the stream this hydrologic condition may increase the vulnerability of stream water to groundwater derived contaminants such as nitrate ritter et al 2007 musolff et al 2016 the lower zone of the study area catchment with hydrologic and land use patterns similar to the middle zone is strongly affected by seasonal pumping during the wcc period which induces losing stream conditions kwon et al 2020 in addition to the induced stream water intense groundwater abstraction facilitated the rapid delivery of contaminants in shallow groundwater to deeper parts of the aquifers and inverted hydrochemical profile along the aquifer depth zhu et al 2014 lapworth et al 2015 in the study area these vertically disturbed solute profiles could be attributed to highly fractured hard rock aquifers under intensive groundwater pumping such as wcc activities during the winter season the oxic groundwater observed at the deep groundwater and anoxic groundwater observed at the shallow groundwater are commonly observed in agricultural areas hill et al 2014 and can also be accounted for by the pumping effect rapid recharge to depth has also been reported in other studies in agricultural riparian aquifers with intensive pumping kim et al 2005 lapworth et al 2015 5 2 processes controlling nutrients in riparian groundwater and their impacts on stream water quality in the study area deep groundwater with high nitrate concentration was likely to originate in hilly areas with highly permeable unsaturated zones where dry farmland is dominant puig et al 2013 menció et al 2016 conversely shallow groundwater with low nitrate concentrations in riparian zones was shown to be affected by recharge under reducing conditions in paddy fields yoon et al 2006 cho et al 2008 this is consistent with the results of the emma and the pca that enrichment and attenuation of nitrate in groundwater are related to dry farmland and paddy fields in riparian zones respectively when considering the results of nutrient flux estimation nitrate in stream water was shown to be controlled by agricultural contamination from dry farmland with higher fertilizer use and less denitrification potential in this context it is necessary to focus on the management of contaminant loadings in dry farmland composing the riparian zones with highly permeable soil for the reduction of nitrate concentration in both the groundwater and stream water of the study area catchment the enrichment of phosphorus in groundwater has not been seriously considered because of its low mobility in the subsurface environment compared to in the surface environment vought et al 1994 kilroy and coxon 2005 however recent studies have revealed high phosphorus concentrations in the shallow groundwater of agricultural catchments smolders et al 2009 neidhardt et al 2018 long term accumulated p in soils and aquifers under low permeable and organic rich riparian wetlands have been promoted as transform it to a mobile dissolved p species leaching to the stream though the baseflow dupas et al 2015 gu et al 2017 fu et al 2019 investigated surface and subsurface fluxes of phosphorus from paddy fields in china and found that subsurface p flux is 1 6 times higher than p flux by surface runoff this emphasizes the role of subsurface flow in nutrient leaching from paddy fields in this study 15 of groundwater samples had tdp concentrations greater than 0 1 mg l 1 and elevated tdp was mainly observed in shallow groundwater 50 m depth having negative relationship with dry farmland phosphates are readily adsorbed to iron hydroxides in the soil and aquifer sediments and released to water by desorption from the reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in a positive correlation between dissolved phosphorus and reduced species such as fe and mn carlyle and hill 2001 neidhardt et al 2018 high tdp concentrations in groundwater are restricted by oxic quick recharge through dry farmland the tdp concentrations in groundwater showed overall negative correlations with nitrate and sulfate fig 7 indicating that reducing conditions are favorable for phosphorus enrichment however this feature was not clear in the direct comparison of tdp and fe except for some shallow groundwater fig 7 this can be accounted for by the overlapping effects of diverse land uses and higher loadings of phosphorus from fertilization meinikmann et al 2015 phosphorus influx from intensive agricultural activities can also exceed the sorption capacity of iron hydroxides leading to higher concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in groundwater with lower levels of dissolved fe roy and bickerton 2014 neidhardt et al 2018 5 3 contribution of groundwater to nutrients in stream water in the mesoscale agricultural catchment average nutrient fluxes with standard deviations of the five estimates for the catchment were 20 6 4 2 kg ha 1 year 1 and 0 3 0 3 kg ha 1 year 1 for no3 n and tdp respectively table 2 these results are indicative of significant variability between stream reaches and seasons particularly for tdp in terms of relative variation representing spatial differences in nutrient concentrations in the riparian aquifers and seasonal and spatial variation of baseflow discharge gu et al 2017 yu et al 2018 nutrient concentrations in riparian aquifers were spatially distinct with less seasonal variations which is mainly affected by density and types of agricultural land uses by contrast the seasonal changes in baseflow were large due to strong seasonality of groundwater recharge and intense groundwater pumping in riparian zones of the study area resulting in highly variable nutrient flux estimates some previous studies on nutrient fluxes in agricultural catchments were in the range from 0 1 kg n ha 1 year 1 to 32 kg n ha 1 year 1 with an average of 13 6 kg n ha 1 year 1 for nitrate and from 0 05 kg p ha 1 year 1 to 5 4 kg p ha 1 year 1 with an average of 0 8 kg p ha 1 year 1 for total phosphorus owens et al 1991 domagalski et al 2008 lerch et al 2015 which were determined for total discharge compared to these estimates nutrient fluxes in this study were within the ranges with higher n flux and lower p flux than the average values the higher n flux in this study can be attributed to considerable dry farmland with highly permeable soil steep topographic gradients and narrow riparian zones in the upstream area fig 1 on the other hand the lower p flux in this study is likely due to exclusion of contribution from surface runoff which is regarded to play a major role in phosphorus delivery to streams sharpley 1995 fu et al 2019 actually the tdp flux in this study is similar to that for baseflow in an agricultural catchment determined by schilling et al 2018 which is 0 1 kg ha 1 year 1 this study showed that estimation of nutrient fluxes from groundwater to surface water using nutrient concentration in riparian groundwater and water flux between stream and aquifers is useful to assess nutrient leaching to the stream and may contribute to establishment of proper management measures for water quality in agricultural catchments we constructed a conceptual model integrating water flow and nutrient transport in the agricultural catchment with a focus on riparian zones fig 11 this model clearly shows contrasting behaviors of nitrate and phosphorus in groundwater associated with the two representative agricultural land uses of dry farmland and paddy fields in the riparian zones which control redox conditions in the aquifers in addition seasonal heavy pumping in the riparian aquifers induces rapid recharge resulting in higher nitrate but lower phosphorus concentration in deeper groundwater it has long been considered that phosphorus in stream water is mainly derived from surface runoff in agricultural areas sharpley 1995 however this study revealed the possibility that the phosphorus concentration in surface water could be attributed to groundwater discharge during gaining conditions tesoriero et al 2009 schilling et al 2018 to prevent eutrophication in agricultural areas by effectively reducing the phosphorus concentration in surface water it is necessary to manage groundwater in riparian aquifers under reducing conditions and to use conventional measures to control phosphorus input to the stream by overland flow in the rainy season 6 conclusions in a mesoscale agricultural catchment the main factors controlling water flow between aquifer located in riparian zones and the stream were identified as topography seasonal precipitation and agricultural practices involving intensive groundwater pumping during the dry winter season groundwater flows from the riparian aquifers to the stream in the upper and middle zones while the intensive pumping in the lower zone considerably affected stream aquifer interactions inducing infiltration of stream water into the aquifers the spatiotemporal variations of nutrient concentration in stream water were affected by the monsoonal climate topographic differences along the stream and soil permeability that varied with land use of the riparian zones nitrate was mainly derived from dry farmland in hilly areas with highly permeable unsaturated zones while it was attenuated by reducing conditions in paddy fields with organic rich low permeability layers deep groundwater had a higher nitrate concentration than shallow groundwater and this can be attributed to recharge from dry farmland and fast recharge by intensive pumping nitrate in stream water was found to be controlled by agricultural contamination from dry farmland by surface runoff and shallow groundwater but less likely to be controlled by deep groundwater estimated n flux to the stream through baseflow was significantly higher which is likely due to considerable dry farmland with less potential for nitrate attenuation in the catchment compared to nitrate phosphorus in groundwater has drawn significantly less attention in the management of nutrients in agricultural catchments in this study phosphorus was enriched in shallow groundwater particularly under reducing conditions near paddy fields with organic rich and low permeability layers while nitrate in shallow groundwater was significantly attenuated groundwater with a higher phosphorus concentration reached iron reducing conditions with a positive correlation between dissolved phosphorus and iron concentration phosphorus in stream water largely originated from surface runoff during the rainy season however groundwater can be a significant source of phosphorus in stream water from the discharge of shallow groundwater of riparian aquifers under reducing conditions estimated p flux to the stream through baseflow also indicated that phosphorus in stream water can be significantly contributed from groundwater discharge in addition to surface runoff this study has revealed that the management of nutrients in agricultural catchments can be more effective by controlling nitrate derived from groundwater in dry farmland and phosphorus enriched groundwater in paddy fields and by considering stream aquifer interactions as well as conventional measures for non point source

9762,water and soil in agricultural areas are usually enriched with nutrients from excessive fertilizations riparian zones the interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic systems play crucial roles in delivery of the nutrients to groundwater and surface water we evaluated spatiotemporal variations of water flow and nutrients in a mesoscale agricultural catchment along the riparian zones of the main stream for dry and rainy season by hydrologic monitoring and measurements of hydrochemical parameters and water stable isotopes gaining stream conditions were dominant in the mountainous upper reaches with steep topographic gradient while groundwater level in the lower basin considerably varied seasonally due to intense groundwater pumping to aid in heating greenhouses in winter season which resulted in losing stream conditions during the dry season compared to shallow groundwater deep groundwater had higher nitrate concentration derived from dry farmland in hilly terrains and induced recharge due to the groundwater pumping nitrate concentration was significantly higher in groundwater than that in stream water indicating that groundwater is a major source of nitrate in stream water considering mainly gaining stream conditions compared to stream water dissolved phosphorus concentration was higher in shallow groundwater recharged from paddy fields and floodplain areas with reducing conditions evaporation signature of water stable isotopes and lower nitrate concentration nutrient flux estimates for the catchment revealed that nitrate in stream water is considerably contributed by groundwater discharge and shallow groundwater in reducing conditions is a significant source of dissolved phosphorus in stream water which was more pronounced in the rainy season this study demonstrated that intense agricultural activities in riparian zones strongly affect stream aquifer interactions and nutrient delivery to the stream as well as groundwater these findings can contribute to understanding hydrological and biogeochemical processes of nutrients in agricultural catchments and establishing an effective management of water use and nutrient application graphical

1 introduction agriculturally derived nutrients that exceed plant uptake degrade the quality of water resources and contribute to the eutrophication of fresh water and coastal water smith et al 1999 vitousek et al 2009 since the early 1960s the concentration of nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus in groundwater has increased worldwide in agricultural areas due to the increased use of chemical fertilizers and manure appelo and postma 1996 howarth et al 2002 the dominant factors controlling nutrient leaching to groundwater and surface water are hydrological conditions involved in nutrient transport and surpluses of agricultural contaminants takatert et al 1999 oenema et al 2005 nitrate is the predominant species among agricultural nitrogen compounds and its high mobility results in considerable contamination of groundwater ritter et al 2007 menció et al 2016 elevated nitrate in groundwater discharges to adjacent surface water through baseflow and this is a major contributor of nitrate in agricultural catchments martin et al 2004 koh et al 2010 phosphorus in the subsurface has been considered mostly immobile due to adsorption to soil and sediments in the vadose and saturated zones robertson et al 1998 carlyle and hill 2001 the increase in phosphorus concentration in surface water has been mostly attributed to direct runoff or interflow over agricultural landscapes rather than groundwater discharge sharpley 1995 however recent studies showed that a significant portion of phosphorus in surface water is derived from groundwater through baseflow tesoriero et al 2009 yu et al 2018 compared to surface runoff phosphorus leaching to surface water from groundwater occurs continuously with high fractions of soluble phosphorus hansen et al 2002 temporal and spatial patterns of phosphorus concentration in surface water also depend on the types and spatial distribution of crops growing in the area edwards and withers 2007 phosphorus leaching can occur from heavily fertilized agricultural landscapes and agricultural land use has a significant effect on the concentration of groundwater phosphorus mcdowell and sharpley 2004 the enrichment processes of phosphorus in groundwater are dissolution from the soil and sediment matrix either in the vadose or the saturated zone in reducing conditions moore jr and reddy 1994 dissolved phosphorus in groundwater has received less attention than nitrate except a few early studies that reported significant levels of phosphorus in groundwater along with nitrate and other hydrochemical parameters banaszuk et al 2005 rajmohan and elango 2005 recently some studies have examined the correlation of fe dissolved oxygen do and redox potentials with a focus on phosphorus enrichment in groundwater dupas et al 2015 schilling et al 2018 riparian zones have been commonly recognized as buffer zones for nutrients and found to play a role in reducing nutrient discharge to surface water hill 1996 dosskey et al 2010 riparian zones have however also been recognized as a source of nutrients due to their continuous supply of nutrients in recent years over the retention capacities of soil vidon et al 2010 dwivedi et al 2018 most previous studies on the change in phosphorus concentration in surface water due to groundwater contributions have been conducted in lakes shaw et al 1990 vanek 1991 enriched phosphorus in groundwater can also significantly contribute to stream water in agricultural watersheds domagalski and johnson 2011 roy and bickerton 2014 and more recently several studies have been conducted to determine the factors of phosphorus occurrence in groundwater and its effect on surface water vidon et al 2010 gu et al 2017 a better understanding of water flow systems and nutrient enrichment in agricultural riparian zones is needed so that management plans for preventing the degradation of water quality for both groundwater and surface water at the catchment scale can be developed we tested a hypothesis that intensive agricultural activities involving heavy seasonal pumping and diverse agricultural land uses strongly affect nutrient dynamics in the riparian aquifers and the stream at the catchment scale along the main channel for this purpose we investigated seasonal and spatial variation in direction and rate of water flow between the stream and aquifer and evaluated the controlling factors of nutrients in groundwater using hydrochemical parameter δd and δ18o of water and spatial analysis of land uses in this study we highlighted the impact of groundwater on nutrient concentrations in stream water through baseflow integrating stream aquifer interactions and nutrient dynamics in the riparian aquifers 2 study area 2 1 site description noseongcheon stream is located in the mid western region of south korea and has a catchment area of 202 3 km2 it is a sixth order stream that flows from north to southwest and a tributary of the geum river one of the four major rivers in korea fig 1 the main lithology of the study area is jurassic granitic rock precambrian gneiss and schist are found only in the mountainous northwestern area and cretaceous acidic dikes are distributed in the north south direction to the eastern part of the catchment chang and hwang 1980 there are two reservoirs at the headwater of the stream and the water level of the stream is regulated by the reservoirs and several weirs in the stream channels the riparian zones of the stream are flat with widths of up to 1 5 km and elevations of 60 m upstream and 20 m downstream graduating to hilly regions with gentle slopes to the catchment boundary and reaching a maximum elevation of 830 m in the northeastern portion the 30 year average total annual precipitation between 1998 and 2017 was 1244 mm and the average groundwater recharge rate was 15 9 of precipitation k water 2015 sixty seven percent of the total precipitation is concentrated in hot and humid rainy season summer conditions from july to september the cold and dry winter dry season extends from november to january meteorological data were acquired from the nonsan automatic weather station operated by the korea meteorological administration kma the total number of wells in noseongcheon catchment is 6054 and groundwater withdrawal is 6 5 million m3 yr 1 corresponding to 16 of total precipitation k water 2015 the amount of groundwater withdrawal for agriculture was estimated to be 4 7 million m3 year 1 and accounted for 73 5 of the total groundwater use domestic and industrial groundwater use were estimated to be 1 5 million m3 yr 1 and 0 17 million m3 yr 1 accounting for 23 9 and 2 6 respectively 2 2 agricultural activities the agricultural area comprises 45 of the total catchment area and the natural land cover comprises 43 the paddy fields and dry farmlands ratio in the agricultural area is 2 1 paddy fields are distributed along the riparian zones of the stream and dry farmland is distributed on the hilly slopes the artificial levees divide the riparian areas into stream side and plain side areas most of the plain side areas are used as paddy fields or greenhouses and the stream side areas were previously used as cultivated land but are now restored to natural areas the average annual nitrogen and phosphorus chemical fertilizer usage were 113 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 36 kg ha 1 yr 1 for the period between 2013 and 2017 respectively nonsan si 2007 the consumption of chemical fertilizers in the study area is slightly less than the average annual use of nitrogen and phosphorus chemical fertilizers in south korea being 117 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 38 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively for the same period mafra 2018 in the study area rice is a representative crop that is harvested from paddy fields since 2003 strawberry cultivation has become widespread and considerable portions of paddy fields have been converted to dry farmland for vegetable cultivation including strawberry cucumber and lettuce water curtain cultivation wcc is conducted using groundwater as a heat source to grow strawberries in the greenhouse during winter according to previous studies the groundwater level in the study area has decreased by up to 8 m lee et al 2015 a detailed description of the wcc and its impact on groundwater flow and contamination in the riparian zones is provided by kwon et al 2020 3 methods 3 1 hydrometric measurements to determine direction and rate of water flow between the stream and the adjacent aquifers we measured stream discharge and stream water level in april and october 2018 corresponding to dry and rainy season respectively at upstream and downstream sites of three zones of upper reach zone a middle reach zone b and lower reach zone c we also measured groundwater level in domestic wells at the time of stream discharge measurements in each zone the water level difference was obtained in each zone by subtracting the stream water level swl from the adjacent groundwater level gwl fig 1 except for event water due to rainfall most of perennial stream discharge is derived from baseflow and the increase in stream discharge with flow distance downstream can be regarded as baseflow contribution if there is no tributary water flux between groundwater and stream was estimated by the difference of stream discharge between upstream and downstream sites without water inflow from tributaries the groundwater level was measured manually using a water level recorder kl 010 ott kempten germany and the stream level was measured using a relative height difference from a point on the stationary structure to compare the groundwater and stream levels a global navigation satellite system gnss survey was performed using a tsc3 controller and a r8 gnss receiver trimble sunnyvale ca usa to measure absolute altitude for water level comparison the groundwater level measurement points were selected as close as possible to the stream level measurement points the flow rate measurement was performed at the same time as the water level measurement stream discharge was measured using the velocity area method and the flow rate was measured using a wading rode measurements current meter c2 ott kempten germany groundwater level monitoring data from 2014 to 2018 were obtained for two monitoring wells of national groundwater observation network ngon located in the riparian zones of the middle and lower basin of the catchment respectively to assess long term changes in groundwater level and flow and rate of water flow between stream and groundwater fig 1 the gaining and losing conditions of the stream were defined by comparing stream discharges at the upstream and downstream sites of each zone and surface water level with adjacent groundwater level at each well 3 2 sampling and laboratory analysis groundwater and surface water samples were obtained over two sampling periods from april 10 to may 10 and from september 1 to september 30 in 2018 corresponding to dry and rainy season respectively wells were classified as shallow and deep based on the depth of 50 m corresponding to the boundary between the alluvial and weathered zones and fractured bedrock aquifers 15 shallow groundwater 25 deep groundwater samples were taken from domestic wells using dedicated pumps and 60 surface water samples were collected from

phosphorus tdp was analyzed using a continuous flow analyzer autoanalyzer 3 seal analytical ltd usa to evaluate dissolved phosphorus in both groundwater and surface water tdp was used in this study in europe including the uk tp or tdp are used for surface water quality standards and tdp in groundwater is mostly composed of orthophosphate worsfold et al 2016 poikane et al 2019 various forms of dissolved phosphorus species were converted to soluble reactive phosphorus srp using alkaline persulfate digestion patton and kryskalla 2003 and ascorbic acid methods were applied to quantify the srp murphy and riley 1962 the detection limit of tdp was 0 01 mg l 1 water stable isotopes were analyzed by wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy l1102 i picarro sunnyvale ca usa the stable isotopic ratios were reported using δ notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water 2 vsmow2 with typical precision of 0 1 and 0 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively 3 3 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca one of multivariate statistical analysis methods allows a reduction in the number of variables that are obtained from field and laboratory measurements this method is usually applied to identification of the processes controlling hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater and surface water woocay et al 2008 in this study nitrate and dissolved phosphorus concentrations were incorporated into pca to reveal their relations with other variables and the processes controlling contamination of nutrients in groundwater and surface water menció et al 2016 o toole et al 2018 spatial variables for land uses were obtained using geographic information system gis which are commonly used in assessment of contaminants derived from the surface environment gemitzi et al 2009 a circular buffer was created centered on the groundwater well and areal proportions of land uses were calculated within the circular buffer the buffer radii of 50 m and 300 m were used for shallow and deep wells respectively considering the different effective radius depending on the well depth benson et al 2006 the land uses were classified into three major categories of natural areas dry farmland and paddy fields principal components pcs were extracted from a correlation matrix for 22 variables of water temperature ph ec do eh ca2 mg2 na k fe sr2 hco3 f cl no3 so4 2 sio2 aq doc tdp δ18o and δd areal proportion of dry farmland for groundwater of two seasons separately for stream water pcs were extracted similarly excluding the land use variable concentrations below the detection limit were assumed to be half of the detection limit except for ph do eh sio2 δ18o and δd the variables were logarithmically transformed due to their log normal distributions pcs with eigenvalues larger than 1 were selected and rotated iteratively using the varimax method 4 results 4 1 variation of stream aquifer interactions along the stream changes in stream discharge along the reach and differences in water levels of the stream and adjacent aquifers have been used as indicators for identifying directions and quantifying water flux between groundwater and surface water zhao et al 2012 groundwater level in the ngon monitoring well near the middle reach was readily responded to precipitation events and considerably higher than stream water level indicating gaining stream conditions are persistent fig 2a by contrast groundwater level in the ngon monitoring well near the lower reach showed negligible responses to precipitation and was much lower than stream water level by 4 9 m which clearly shows losing stream conditions are prevalent fig 2b it is also notable that groundwater level of the well had a strong sinusoidal seasonal variation with annual minimums in april when intensive pumping ends and a long term decreasing trend for the whole monitoring period suggesting impacts of pumping on the riparian aquifers are extensive the seasonal measurements of stream discharge in the selected reaches and the differences in water levels between the stream and the aquifers were shown in fig 3 the stream discharge in the upper reach of zone a had the smallest seasonal variation which was 10 of the variation at the downstream site fig 3 the groundwater levels in the riparian area near the upper reach were higher than the stream level regardless of season with the largest head differences the middle and lower reaches under intense agricultural activities in their riparian zones showed higher seasonal variations in stream discharge and water levels fig 3 the wccs which consume large amounts of groundwater in winter were concentrated in the lower reach and paddy fields using surface water for irrigation water were concentrated in the middle reach fig 1 at the downstream site of the middle reach of zone b stream discharge showed a considerable change of 40 103 m3 day 1 in april and 113 103 m3 day 1 in october and was supplied from both the main stream and another two major tributaries the groundwater level was consistently higher than the stream water level in the middle reach but with smaller head differences compared to the upper reach in the lower reach of zone c stream discharge between the upstream and downstream sites decreased by 4 103 m3 day 1 in april and increased by 20 103 m3 day 1 in october fig 3 compared to the stream water level the groundwater level was up to 2 m higher in october and was 2 5 m lower in april this was a clear indication that losing stream conditions were significant in the lower reach in the dry winter season in the lower region of the catchment wcc activity pumps 420 m3 day 1 ha 1 of groundwater during the winter season which usually ends in april lee et al 2015 it was reported that groundwater decline in the riparian zones with wcc activity in south korea is considerable reducing groundwater discharge to the stream and inducing stream water infiltration to the adjacent aquifers during the winter season chang and chung 2015 lee et al 2017 4 2 hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of groundwater and stream water the groundwater in the study area was mainly the ca hco3 type with significantly higher levels of mg2 no3 and so4 2 than the natural alluvial groundwater around the study area fig s1 generally concentrations of agricultural contaminants such as ca2 mg2 and no3 are higher in shallow groundwater than in deep groundwater because they are derived from the surface environment böhlke 2002 interactions between water and granitic rocks also contribute to solutes such as sio2 aq and f to groundwater whose concentrations are usually elevated in deep groundwater with an increase in the degree of mineralization chae et al 2009 in this study the shallow groundwater had higher sio2 aq concentrations than the deep groundwater fig 4 but the concentration of f showed no clear relationship with well depth fig 5 the concentration of do in groundwater generally decreases with increasing depth puckett et al 2002 in the current study this trend was reversed in the riparian aquifers shallow groundwater had a lower dissolved oxygen concentration than deep groundwater fig 5 the groundwater samples in this study were compared with those of koh et al 2009 which were taken from various topographic settings including the present study area and showed that do concentration decreased with depth overall in noseongcheon catchment shallow groundwater had lower do and higher fe mn and doc concentrations than deep groundwater and was more pronounced in the rainy season fig 5 some groundwater in oxic conditions had detectable fe and mn which is indicative of the mixing of groundwater with diverse flow paths koh et al 2006 puig et al 2013 the groundwater in the study area had little seasonal variation but had a wider range of isotopic compositions which can be attributed to diverse topographic settings and land use patterns fig 6 this indicates that groundwater had seasonally averaged recharge which is spatially diverse in water sources and flow paths depending on the location in the catchment furthermore stream water had a more enriched isotopic composition with the increase in flow distance downstream regardless of the season indicating that stream water variably contributed by seasonally different water sources controlled by precipitation and agricultural water use fig s2 4 3 occurrence of nutrients in groundwater and stream water the average nitrate concentration in deep groundwater 35 4 mg l 1 was higher than that in shallow groundwater 24 4 mg l 1 with a positive correlation between well depth and the upper limit of nitrate concentration table 1 fig 5 the degree of nitrate contamination in groundwater was classified by low contaminated and high contaminated threshold concentrations of 16 6 mg l 1 37 1 mg l 1 respectively which were established by kim et al 2015 for south korea sixty percent of shallow groundwater and 64 of deep groundwater had a nitrate concentration higher than 16 6 mg l 1 and 33 of shallow groundwater and 42 of deep groundwater had a nitrate concentration higher than 37 1 mg l 1 nitrate in groundwater showed a positive relationship with ca2 mg2 which also increased with depth figs 5 and 7 this is because ca2 and mg2 can be derived from liming materials used to prevent soil acidification pierson wickmann et al 2009 the low nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater could be attributed to lower nitrogen loading and favorable conditions for denitrification hill 1996 in contrast groundwater in a previous study for the area koh et al 2009 which is more evenly distributed over the catchment had elevated concentrations mostly in shallow groundwater with a decreasing trend with well depth elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater are associated with higher do concentrations near 8 mg l 1 and lower concentrations of fluoride the concentration of tdp was higher in shallow groundwater than deep groundwater with average concentrations of 0 08 mg l 1 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively table 1 fig 5 to assess the degree of tdp contamination we designated a high contamination threshold of 0 1 mg l 1 and a low contamination threshold of 0 05 mg l 1 in consideration of the median of good moderate thresholds of european countries and the environmental quality standards of korea for lakes me 2018 poikane et al 2019 fifty percent of shallow groundwater and 38 of deep groundwater had tdp concentrations higher than 0 05 mg l 1 which showed phosphorus enrichment in shallow groundwater fig 5 in particular 30 of shallow groundwater and 4 of deep groundwater were classified by high contaminated group the median tdp concentration of stream water was 0 05 mg l 1 which was lower than that of more than half of the groundwater compared to nitrate tdp in groundwater showed a different occurrence with a negative relationship between nitrate and tdp concentrations fig 7 it is well known that dissolved phosphorus is released from sediments by the reductive dissolution of iron hydroxides resulting in a positive relationship between tdp and fe concentrations in pore water and groundwater carlyle and hill 2001 dupas et al 2015 in this study tdp concentration showed a positive correlation in shallow groundwater with higher concentrations of fe and mn fig 7 although the majority of groundwater had a lower fe concentration tdp and sulfate concentrations showed a negative correlation and groundwater with concentrations of tdp higher than the high contaminated threshold had sulfate concentrations lower than 20 mg l 1 fig 7 nutrient concentrations in stream water increased towards the downstream reaches which is readily attributed to the increase in agricultural activities from the upper zone dominated by natural areas to the middle zone with extensive farmlands fig s2 nitrate concentration in stream water increased rapidly in the upper zone compared to low nitrate concentration in the headwater zone in the reaches with more than 10 km of flow distance nitrate concentration in stream water gradually increased downstream reaching up to about 10 mg l 1 tdp concentration in groundwater was much lower in the headwater zone than those in the lower zones in the dry season tdp concentration in stream water increased with the increase of flow distance starting from the reservoir and then decreased sharply near the downstream site at 20 km on the other hand tdp concentration increased sharply downstream to the middle zone and remained at the level further downstream to the lower zone in the rainy season seasonally tdp concentration in stream water was higher in the rainy season when both surface runoff and baseflow discharges were higher than those in the dry season 4 4 effects of land uses on nutrients in groundwater and stream water the relationship between land use and nutrient concentrations in groundwater was examined using cl concentration and δ18o as indicators for the effects of the major land uses on groundwater martin et al 2004 the three end members which were defined by natural paddy fields and residential dry farmland has been suggested by koh et al 2010 for the study area three groups of groundwater samples based on the nitrate contamination thresholds in south korea were clearly distinguished from the highly contaminated group aligned between the natural area and residential dry farmland and the low contaminated group on the line between the natural area and paddy fields fig 8 in contrast the groundwater in the paddy fields had an elevated tdp concentration and groundwater in the residential dry farmland had the lowest level of tdp fig 8 all of the shallow groundwater samples with tdp concentrations higher than the high contamination threshold were located in or near paddy fields except for ng 32 indicating that reducing conditions were a major controlling factor for the occurrence of elevated tdp in groundwater pca of chemical and isotopic parameters of groundwater and areal proportion of dry farmland produced pcs representing major hydrological and geochemical processes controlling nutrient concentration in the aquifers of the riparian zones dry season groundwater showed that pc1 had strong positive relationships with ec ca2 mg2 and cl fig 9 indicating that contamination sources from agricultural activities dominate major solute chemistry of groundwater böhlke 2002 koh et al 2009 pc2 had positive loadings on δ18o δ2h doc hco3 tdp and negative loadings on nitrate eh and areal proportion of dry farmland this indicates that pc2 represents anoxic groundwater with enriched isotopic compositions which is less affected by dry farmland rainy season groundwater had pc1 with strong positive loadings on ec ca2 mg2 sr2 and cl showing similar to dry season groundwater also representing agricultural contamination fig 9 pc2 was negatively related to nitrate and highly positively related to δ18o and δ2h fe and sio2 aq which is indicative of anoxic groundwater with evaporation signatures unlike the pc2 from the results of dry season this component was not related to enriched tdp pc3 which explains the process of nitrate contamination had strong positive relationship with areal proportion of dry farmland and negative relationship with f ph and hco3 representing the increase in nitrate concentrations in groundwater due to recharge through dry farmland fig 9 pc5 which showed a strong positive relationship with tdp showed positive relationship with doc and k and negative relationship with f and eh table s2 unlike the pca results of groundwater stream water had smaller number of pcs and higher total variance explained by pc1 with less differences in pc loadings between seasons in both seasons pc1 was positively related to both nitrate and tdp and also to most of cations and anions except fe and f fig 10 this indicated that intensive agricultural activities dominate concentrations of major solutes including nutrients in stream water the simultaneous positive loadings of nitrate and tdp on pc1 in stream water indicates that nitrate and tdp undergo similar transport processes while they are affected by more complicated processes of transport and attenuation in groundwater pc2 had negative relationships with eh and sio2 aq and a positive relationship with doc in both seasons while it had different relationships with δ18o and δ2h according to the seasons fig 10 representing contribution of shallow subsurface flow to the stream with the evaporation signature of stable isotopes in the dry season 4 5 nutrient discharge to the stream through baseflow we evaluated the potential impact of nutrients in groundwater to stream using baseflow discharge to the stream reach and nutrient concentration in adjacent groundwater baseflow discharge was estimated by the difference in stream discharge measured at the upstream and downstream sites in each zone nutrient fluxes from groundwater to the stream through baseflow was calculated by multiplying the baseflow discharge by the average of nutrient concentrations in adjacent groundwater table 2 nitrate flux to the stream was highest in the zone a 24 5 kg n ha 1 day 1 the upper reach in the rainy season and lowest in the zone b 14 7 kg n ha 1 day 1 the middle reach in the dry season the low nitrate flux in the zone b is attributed to low nitrate concentration in groundwater driven by denitrification in paddy fields in the riparian zones nitrate concentration in groundwater near the zone c was highest due to higher proportion of dry farmland in the riparian zones however nitrate flux to the stream in the zone c was 22 1 kg n ha 1 day 1 which was lower than that in the zone a because baseflow discharge was lowest due to wcc activities tdp flux to the stream through baseflow was highest in the zone b during the rainy season 0 9 kg p ha 1 day 1 and lowest in the zone c during the rainy season 0 1 kg p ha 1 day 1 table 2 the average tdp concentration in groundwater for each zone was in the increasing order of zone a zone c and zone b in the zone c the concentration of tdp in the groundwater was not high and baseflow discharge is low which led to the lowest tdp flux on the other hand both tdp concentration in groundwater and baseflow discharge were high in the zone b during the rainy season resulting in the highest tdp flux to the stream 5 discussion 5 1 diverse groundwater flow systems in riparian zones of the agricultural catchment along the reach in the study area groundwater and stream water interactions variably affected water flow and hydrochemical parameters including nutrient concentrations in the riparian zones depending on agricultural activities topographic indices and the seasonal effects of a monsoonal climate takatert et al 1999 martin et al 2004 the upper zone of the study area catchment has narrow floodplain of riparian zones and steep slopes resulting in significant groundwater discharge to the stream regardless of the season fig 3 in the middle zone of the study area catchment flat topography and paddy fields containing low permeable layer are dominant in the riparian zones maintaining gaining conditions but with less groundwater discharge to the stream this hydrologic condition may increase the vulnerability of stream water to groundwater derived contaminants such as nitrate ritter et al 2007 musolff et al 2016 the lower zone of the study area catchment with hydrologic and land use patterns similar to the middle zone is strongly affected by seasonal pumping during the wcc period which induces losing stream conditions kwon et al 2020 in addition to the induced stream water intense groundwater abstraction facilitated the rapid delivery of contaminants in shallow groundwater to deeper parts of the aquifers and inverted hydrochemical profile along the aquifer depth zhu et al 2014 lapworth et al 2015 in the study area these vertically disturbed solute profiles could be attributed to highly fractured hard rock aquifers under intensive groundwater pumping such as wcc activities during the winter season the oxic groundwater observed at the deep groundwater and anoxic groundwater observed at the shallow groundwater are commonly observed in agricultural areas hill et al 2014 and can also be accounted for by the pumping effect rapid recharge to depth has also been reported in other studies in agricultural riparian aquifers with intensive pumping kim et al 2005 lapworth et al 2015 5 2 processes controlling nutrients in riparian groundwater and their impacts on stream water quality in the study area deep groundwater with high nitrate concentration was likely to originate in hilly areas with highly permeable unsaturated zones where dry farmland is dominant puig et al 2013 menció et al 2016 conversely shallow groundwater with low nitrate concentrations in riparian zones was shown to be affected by recharge under reducing conditions in paddy fields yoon et al 2006 cho et al 2008 this is consistent with the results of the emma and the pca that enrichment and attenuation of nitrate in groundwater are related to dry farmland and paddy fields in riparian zones respectively when considering the results of nutrient flux estimation nitrate in stream water was shown to be controlled by agricultural contamination from dry farmland with higher fertilizer use and less denitrification potential in this context it is necessary to focus on the management of contaminant loadings in dry farmland composing the riparian zones with highly permeable soil for the reduction of nitrate concentration in both the groundwater and stream water of the study area catchment the enrichment of phosphorus in groundwater has not been seriously considered because of its low mobility in the subsurface environment compared to in the surface environment vought et al 1994 kilroy and coxon 2005 however recent studies have revealed high phosphorus concentrations in the shallow groundwater of agricultural catchments smolders et al 2009 neidhardt et al 2018 long term accumulated p in soils and aquifers under low permeable and organic rich riparian wetlands have been promoted as transform it to a mobile dissolved p species leaching to the stream though the baseflow dupas et al 2015 gu et al 2017 fu et al 2019 investigated surface and subsurface fluxes of phosphorus from paddy fields in china and found that subsurface p flux is 1 6 times higher than p flux by surface runoff this emphasizes the role of subsurface flow in nutrient leaching from paddy fields in this study 15 of groundwater samples had tdp concentrations greater than 0 1 mg l 1 and elevated tdp was mainly observed in shallow groundwater 50 m depth having negative relationship with dry farmland phosphates are readily adsorbed to iron hydroxides in the soil and aquifer sediments and released to water by desorption from the reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in a positive correlation between dissolved phosphorus and reduced species such as fe and mn carlyle and hill 2001 neidhardt et al 2018 high tdp concentrations in groundwater are restricted by oxic quick recharge through dry farmland the tdp concentrations in groundwater showed overall negative correlations with nitrate and sulfate fig 7 indicating that reducing conditions are favorable for phosphorus enrichment however this feature was not clear in the direct comparison of tdp and fe except for some shallow groundwater fig 7 this can be accounted for by the overlapping effects of diverse land uses and higher loadings of phosphorus from fertilization meinikmann et al 2015 phosphorus influx from intensive agricultural activities can also exceed the sorption capacity of iron hydroxides leading to higher concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in groundwater with lower levels of dissolved fe roy and bickerton 2014 neidhardt et al 2018 5 3 contribution of groundwater to nutrients in stream water in the mesoscale agricultural catchment average nutrient fluxes with standard deviations of the five estimates for the catchment were 20 6 4 2 kg ha 1 year 1 and 0 3 0 3 kg ha 1 year 1 for no3 n and tdp respectively table 2 these results are indicative of significant variability between stream reaches and seasons particularly for tdp in terms of relative variation representing spatial differences in nutrient concentrations in the riparian aquifers and seasonal and spatial variation of baseflow discharge gu et al 2017 yu et al 2018 nutrient concentrations in riparian aquifers were spatially distinct with less seasonal variations which is mainly affected by density and types of agricultural land uses by contrast the seasonal changes in baseflow were large due to strong seasonality of groundwater recharge and intense groundwater pumping in riparian zones of the study area resulting in highly variable nutrient flux estimates some previous studies on nutrient fluxes in agricultural catchments were in the range from 0 1 kg n ha 1 year 1 to 32 kg n ha 1 year 1 with an average of 13 6 kg n ha 1 year 1 for nitrate and from 0 05 kg p ha 1 year 1 to 5 4 kg p ha 1 year 1 with an average of 0 8 kg p ha 1 year 1 for total phosphorus owens et al 1991 domagalski et al 2008 lerch et al 2015 which were determined for total discharge compared to these estimates nutrient fluxes in this study were within the ranges with higher n flux and lower p flux than the average values the higher n flux in this study can be attributed to considerable dry farmland with highly permeable soil steep topographic gradients and narrow riparian zones in the upstream area fig 1 on the other hand the lower p flux in this study is likely due to exclusion of contribution from surface runoff which is regarded to play a major role in phosphorus delivery to streams sharpley 1995 fu et al 2019 actually the tdp flux in this study is similar to that for baseflow in an agricultural catchment determined by schilling et al 2018 which is 0 1 kg ha 1 year 1 this study showed that estimation of nutrient fluxes from groundwater to surface water using nutrient concentration in riparian groundwater and water flux between stream and aquifers is useful to assess nutrient leaching to the stream and may contribute to establishment of proper management measures for water quality in agricultural catchments we constructed a conceptual model integrating water flow and nutrient transport in the agricultural catchment with a focus on riparian zones fig 11 this model clearly shows contrasting behaviors of nitrate and phosphorus in groundwater associated with the two representative agricultural land uses of dry farmland and paddy fields in the riparian zones which control redox conditions in the aquifers in addition seasonal heavy pumping in the riparian aquifers induces rapid recharge resulting in higher nitrate but lower phosphorus concentration in deeper groundwater it has long been considered that phosphorus in stream water is mainly derived from surface runoff in agricultural areas sharpley 1995 however this study revealed the possibility that the phosphorus concentration in surface water could be attributed to groundwater discharge during gaining conditions tesoriero et al 2009 schilling et al 2018 to prevent eutrophication in agricultural areas by effectively reducing the phosphorus concentration in surface water it is necessary to manage groundwater in riparian aquifers under reducing conditions and to use conventional measures to control phosphorus input to the stream by overland flow in the rainy season 6 conclusions in a mesoscale agricultural catchment the main factors controlling water flow between aquifer located in riparian zones and the stream were identified as topography seasonal precipitation and agricultural practices involving intensive groundwater pumping during the dry winter season groundwater flows from the riparian aquifers to the stream in the upper and middle zones while the intensive pumping in the lower zone considerably affected stream aquifer interactions inducing infiltration of stream water into the aquifers the spatiotemporal variations of nutrient concentration in stream water were affected by the monsoonal climate topographic differences along the stream and soil permeability that varied with land use of the riparian zones nitrate was mainly derived from dry farmland in hilly areas with highly permeable unsaturated zones while it was attenuated by reducing conditions in paddy fields with organic rich low permeability layers deep groundwater had a higher nitrate concentration than shallow groundwater and this can be attributed to recharge from dry farmland and fast recharge by intensive pumping nitrate in stream water was found to be controlled by agricultural contamination from dry farmland by surface runoff and shallow groundwater but less likely to be controlled by deep groundwater estimated n flux to the stream through baseflow was significantly higher which is likely due to considerable dry farmland with less potential for nitrate attenuation in the catchment compared to nitrate phosphorus in groundwater has drawn significantly less attention in the management of nutrients in agricultural catchments in this study phosphorus was enriched in shallow groundwater particularly under reducing conditions near paddy fields with organic rich and low permeability layers while nitrate in shallow groundwater was significantly attenuated groundwater with a higher phosphorus concentration reached iron reducing conditions with a positive correlation between dissolved phosphorus and iron concentration phosphorus in stream water largely originated from surface runoff during the rainy season however groundwater can be a significant source of phosphorus in stream water from the discharge of shallow groundwater of riparian aquifers under reducing conditions estimated p flux to the stream through baseflow also indicated that phosphorus in stream water can be significantly contributed from groundwater discharge in addition to surface runoff this study has revealed that the management of nutrients in agricultural catchments can be more effective by controlling nitrate derived from groundwater in dry farmland and phosphorus enriched groundwater in paddy fields and by considering stream aquifer interactions as well as conventional measures for non point source

9763,in the texas high plains thp groundwater resources for irrigation are declining because of aquifer depletion and reduced well yield inability to meet peak water demands of maize under constrained irrigation capacities decreases yield and profitability the mopeco crop model calibrated for the thp was adapted to simulate maize water use and yield under center pivot irrigation to evaluate water allocation strategies under limited irrigation simulations were carried out over a range of irrigation capacities 3 12 mm d 1 for a 50 9 ha area initial soil water contents and application depths with irrigation allocated to a fraction 0 5 1 0 of the pivot area fractional water allocations were achieved by withholding irrigation from circular sectors or from outer spans with unirrigated fractions in fallow or planted to dryland cotton these strategies were evaluated for growing seasons characterized by typical meteorological years with average tmy1 average to above average tmy2 and below average tmy3 precipitation preseason irrigation had little to no influence on grain yield at irrigation capacities 5 mm d 1 at irrigation capacities 6 mm d 1 under tmy1 marginally greater yields 50 9 ha 1 were simulated when a fraction was irrigated for irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 under tmy1 reducing the irrigated area was the most prudent option to optimize net returns as irrigation capacities increased from 4 to 8 mm d 1 the irrigated fraction that maximized net returns increased from 0 5 to 0 9 concentrating water generated greater net returns because of greater irrigation water productivities and lower seed and fertilizer costs compared with fallow planting cotton in the unirrigated portion increased net returns except in years with a seasonal drought tmy3 because greater irrigation volume did not always increase net returns there is an opportunity to both increase profitability and conserve water by irrigating a fraction of the area keywords limited irrigation mopeco sprinkler irrigation typical meteorological year water productivity zea mays l 1 introduction the high plains aquifer is a major source of water for irrigation industrial uses and drinking water throughout the u s great plains and extends from the texas high plains thp to nebraska and south dakota approximately 24 billion m3 was pumped from the aquifer in 2005 of which 97 was used for irrigation on roughly 6 3 million ha of farmland mcguire 2009 in the southern portion of the high plains aquifer pumping has greatly exceeded recharge rates resulting in declines in saturated thickness exceeding 46 m in extensive areas of southern kansas and the thp since predevelopment mcguire 2017 decreases in saturated thickness increase the pumping cost but more importantly reduce the well yield declining well flow capacities reduces both crop yield and profitability because peak water use usually coincides with crop reproductive stages when water stress results in the greatest yield reductions scanlon et al 2012 foster et al 2015 schwartz et al 2020a because of the severity aquifer depletion water management strategies such as changing crop type irrigation scheduling and conversion to dryland are being evaluated for economic feasibility and effectiveness in prolonging the life of irrigated agriculture in the thp crouch et al 2020 maize zea mays l accounts for approximately 50 of pumping for irrigation colaizzi et al 2009 schlegel et al 2012 xue et al 2017 and has seasonal water requirements ranging from 670 to 970 mm in the thp howell et al 1995b 1996 schneider and howell 1998 schwartz et al 2020a because of maize sensitivity to water deficits marginal well capacities that reduce irrigation allocations during critical growth stages can result in considerable reductions in grain yield howell et al 1996 schwartz et al 2020a in 2000 for approximately 72 of the irrigated area in the thp water was delivered to crops using center pivot irrigation systems colaizzi et al 2009 from 1958 2000 the number of wells in the thp doubled however during this same time period the seasonal volume of water pumped per well and the area irrigated per well was cut in half colaizzi et al 2009 with an average irrigated area per well of 18 ha in 2000 typically three wells are required to irrigate a quarter section 51 ha when adding more wells is not an option or cost prohibitive the operator runs the system at reduced flow rates which oftentimes requires changing nozzles to lower flow rates or turning off a certain number of nozzles to maintain system pressure flow rates of 1 68 m 3 h 1 ha 1 3 gal min 1 ac 1 are common in the region because a flow rate of 1 68 m 3 h 1 ha 1 can only deliver 4 0 mm d 1 operators slow down the pivot speed to increase the application volume resulting in a period of over 6 days to apply 25 mm irrigation given daily reference evapotranspiration et o values of 8 mm and often exceeding 10 mm a day combined with unreliable precipitation it is obvious that these flow rates are insufficient to meet water requirements of maize throughout much of the growing season scheduling irrigation to maintain soil water above a certain stress threshold is usually not attainable under these conditions except during periods of above average precipitation mahan and lascano 2016 preseason irrigation schlegel et al 2012 and irrigating above crop requirements during the early vegetative stage are common strategies that producers use to build plant available water in the deep soils characteristic of the region stored soil water is used later in the growing season during peak water use periods to partially offset insufficient irrigation capacity an evaluation of maize yield and profit as influenced by limited irrigation capacities should consider the wide inter annual variabilities in growing season precipitation and et o considering these constraints the principal management option producers have available to them is how to distribute water spatially within a field managing a portion under deficit or full irrigation with the remaining area planted to a dryland crop or left fallow secondary management considerations include i varying the pivot speed to adjust the depth of application and consequently the time between irrigations and ii choosing how to reduce the irrigated acreage by either supplying water only to a sector of the pivot circle baumhardt et al 2007 or by shutting off nozzles on the outer spans of the pivot and thereby reducing radius of the irrigated area crops suitable for dryland production may also be planted on acreage that is not irrigated the objective of this study is to utilize a calibrated crop water use and yield model to optimize planted acreage and management practices that would maximize long term total maize yield and profitability for a center pivot irrigated 50 9 ha field over a range of irrigation capacities a secondary objective is to determine optimal management interventions to mitigate losses in years with extended seasonal drought 2 methodology 2 1 climate data and analysis climatic data extending from 1993 to 2018 at the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory bushland tx 1170 m asl 35 11 n 102 6 w were used in these evaluations the weather station is centered within an irrigated cool season grass surface described by howell et al 1995a solar irradiance wind speed air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and barometric pressure were monitored at this weather station throughout the year and precipitation were measured with tipping bucket rain gages over the grass surface in these analyses the years 2012 2013 and 2015 were omitted because of uncertainties in the quality of data during the growing season using this weather data et o was calculated using the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for a short reference crop at a 24 h time step asce 2005 in the thp maize is typically planted from late april to mid may and the initiation of the dough stage r4 for a crop planted in mid may will typically occur on 28 august based on mean growing degree days for the period of record consequently climatic data for a growing season extending from 1 may to 28 august is the most crucial for determining irrigation requirements and maize yield potential precipitation and weather conditions extending from r4 to physiological maturity 17 sept has a comparatively minor influence on the yield potential schwartz et al 2020a from 1939 2018 mean precipitation at the bushland research station for the period 1 may to 28 august was 264 mm s d 95 6 mm and the data exhibits a strong normal distribution shapiro wilk p 0 661 fig 1a from 1993 2018 mean precipitation and et o was 231 and 874 mm respectively during this critical time period because the u s southern great plains is prone to extreme droughts it is important to differentiate years that exhibit lower than normal precipitation from years with normal to above average precipitation combined with reliable drought forecasts the assessment of irrigation requirements in these years could provide actionable information for producers and also crop insurance providers to adjust the planted acreage reduce crop failures reduce unproductive water consumption and increase profit the oceanic niño index temperature anomaly associated with la niña is not a good predictor of summer droughts in the southern u s great plains pu et al 2016 and this observation is supported by the climatic data at the bushland station with only 2 of 5 la niña years exhibiting cumulative precipitation for the period 1 may to 28 aug that could be considered to be a seasonal drought fig 1b more importantly for the climatic data at bushland 1993 2018 the oceanic niño index temperature anomaly for may july is uncorrelated r 0 002 slope 0 0005 to the precipitation et o ratio not shown an indicator of seasonal irrigation requirements we consider drought within the growing season as those years with precipitation falling within the 0 8 1 0 exceedance probabilities as evaluated using the long term precipitation record in bushland fig 1b this threshold also corresponds to a standardized precipitation index x x σ of 0 84 utilized by agnew 2000 to identify years with at least a moderate to severe level of drought more importantly this threshold segregates years that exhibit elevated temperatures and evaporative demands that in addition to below normal precipitation are associated with droughts in the region in normal to wet years with exceedance probabilities 0 80 et o varied little with respect to seasonal precipitation averaging 820 mm and increasing 0 3 mm for every 1 mm decline in precipitation p 0 08 fig 1c above this threshold et o increased 2 6 mm for every 1 mm decline in precipitation p 0 001 fig 1c the relationship between increasing et o with decreasing precipitation is characteristic of droughts in the southern u s great plains and is a product of the coupling of land surface soil moisture and precipitation soil moisture deficits in the spring increase sensible heating and surface temperatures thereby increasing evaporative demands and oftentimes leading to convective inhibition and a reduction in precipitation fernando et al 2019 use of a typical meteorological year tmy is useful for planning and assessing irrigation requirements because of the great degree of uncertainty in year to year forecasted precipitation during the growing season domínguez et al 2013 a tmy consists of one year of climatic data chosen from a long time series typically spanning more than 10 years hall et al 1978 using the 1993 2018 climatic data in bushland tx tmy s were constructed using i all years to evaluate the mean response tmy1 ii years with precipitation exceedance probabilities less than 0 8 and regarded as growing seasons with normal to above average precipitation tmy2 and years with precipitation exceedance probabilities greater than 0 8 and regarded as growing seasons with a pronounced drought tmy3 each of these three scenarios were developed using climatic data extending from 1 may to 31 october with each of the typical months chosen by finkelstein schafer statistical comparisons of candidate monthly periods with long term cumulative distribution frequencies of maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and et o domínguez et al 2013 2 2 crop water use and yield model the crop water use and yield model mopeco model for the economic optimization of irrigation water ortega et al 2004 with the modifications introduced by schwartz et al 2020a was used to simulate maize water use and yield in response to center pivot irrigation scenarios in the thp mopeco uses the fao 56 crop coefficient reference et approach fao 1998 in conjunction with an empirical crop water production function to predict grain yield the yield function is based on the work of stewart et al 1977 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 that considers water deficits at different crop growth stages in a multiplicative relationship rao et al 1988 domínguez et al 2012a 2012b the crop model was calibrated and validated using 18 site years that consisted of detailed water use monitored throughout each growing season determined with a soil water balance approach and a neutron gage to evaluate changes is stored soil water schwartz et al 2020a maize yields of the calibration data set ranged from 0 to 19 3 mg ha 1 with crop water use that ranged from 310 mm dryland to 770 mm crop phenological growth stages associated with crop coefficients schwartz et al 2020a fig 1c were estimated using growing degree days gdd for each tmy growing degree days were evaluated using daily maximum and minimum temperatures with a 10 c base temperature and an upper temperature threshold of 30 c using method 2 of mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 in this study we used the fixed and fitted parameters for the nonlinear crop water stress function schwartz et al 2020a optimization 3 to simulate maize water use and yield soil water retention and other parameters used in these simulations are for a pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll schwartz et al 2020a and along with two other soils series with nearly identical properties represent the prinicpal soil groups used for maize production in the thp crop water use and yield simulations of mopeco were implemented in an excel spreadsheet with a fixed planting date of 16 may redistribution of water from infiltrated precipitation p and irrigation i within the rooting zone occurs instantaneously and drainage out of the rooting zone occurs when the soil water content exceeds field capacity the maximum rooting depth of the maize attained at inflorescence was set equivalent to 1 4 m the initial water content was set equivalent to 0 278 m3 m 3 for the entire profile which was based on the mean of initial water contents in the data sets evaluated by schwartz et al 2020a runoff depth r from daily precipitation depth p was estimated using the original curve number approach rallison 1980 1 r p i a 2 p i a s i p i a 0 p i a where s i is the potential retention due to soil water storage or infiltration whichever is the least and the depth of initial abstraction i a is set to 15 mm because near surface soil water content could not be approximated using the excel spreadsheet redistribution algorithm of mopeco as in schwartz et al 2020a s i was set to a constant value of 23 1 mm this assumes that the upper 0 2 m of the profile had an initial water content equivalent to 75 plant available water which was similar to observed values for irrigated maize schwartz et al 2020a net irrigation i n was estimated as in schwartz et al 2020a by multiplying the gross application depth i g by an application efficiency ae i of 0 90 howell 2003 if the gross application depth was less than a threshold d 0 25 mm then net irrigation was estimated as i g d 0 1 ae i to account for diminishing application efficiencies associated with evaporative losses with shallow application depths schwartz et al 2020a the crop water use and yield simulations use the weather data of the tmy s that reflect growing seasons with average normal to above average and below average drought growing season precipitation as such these simulations reflect the expected mean response over the long term a limited number of crop model simulations were also carried out for all climatic data 1993 2018 to validate the tmy approach in the southern u s great plains environment and also to provide an assessment of the variability of the predicted yield response and net returns in each year of these simulations crop developmental stages were based on growing degree days calculated from daily minimum and maximum temperatures in each of the growing seasons in addition yield response was scaled based on the accumulated solar radiation after pollination in each year with a scalar of unity for the average solar radiation accumulation for all years as with the simulations using the tmy s we completed these simulations using a planting date of 16 may 2 3 adaptation of the crop water use and yield model for selected scenarios crop water use yield response and net returns were evaluated using the crop water use and yield model and four center pivot irrigation scenarios or strategies for a quarter mile 402 m long pivot or approximately 50 9 ha table 1 these evaluations were carried out using the three tmy s reflecting growing seasons with average normal to above average and below average drought growing season precipitation for the typical management strategy 1 s1 we considered 10 irrigation capacities 3 4 5 12 mm d 1 generated by a single well or a group of wells for the irrigation of the entire area of a standard center pivot system these irrigation capacities were evaluated in conjunction with three initial profile water contents 0 278 0 0278 m3 m 3 representing the mean and 1 standard deviation respectively of 18 site years of studies presented by schwartz et al 2020a an incremental increase in initial profile water content from 0 278 to 0 306 m3 m 3 was considered representative of sufficient pre irrigation to increase stored soil water at planting by 38 9 mm and achieved through three irrigations of 25 mm several weeks before planting a net increase of 25 mm stored soil water with 50 mm of irrigation applied is characteristic of the fine textured soils in the region tolk et al 2015 the standard management strategy s1 was compared with the other strategies to determine if yield and profitability could be improved table 1 a second strategy considered s2 varies the irrigation application depth from 15 to 35 mm at the 10 irrigation capacities with application depth constant throughout the entire growing season table 1 this strategy permits an evaluation of how different application depths influence crop yield smaller application depths permit the crop to receive irrigation over smaller time intervals but this comes with the disadvantage of reduced application efficiency besides irrigating the entire circle producers have the option of leaving a fraction of the circle unirrigated when irrigation capacities become limiting baumhardt et al 2007 2009 the unirrigated area can be left fallow or planted to a dryland crop strategy 3 s3 reduces the area irrigated by the pivot by supplying water to all nozzles but withholding irrigation to one or more sectors of the circle table 1 this strategy permits an increase in the irrigation frequency however irrigation is delayed by the time it takes for the pivot to travel through the unirrigated sectors at its maximum speed 100 assumed here as one full rotation per day 0 083 rad h 1 or 1 76 m min 1 at the outermost nozzle in scenario 3 irrigating in different directions is avoided and the irrigation system must travel across the non irrigated area to commence irrigation on the first sector a fourth strategy s4 reduces the irrigated area by turning off nozzles on the outer spans of the pivot table 1 in this case the nozzle flow rates travel speed and irrigation frequency are increased in order to maintain a selected application depth all strategies are evaluated with regard to seasonal irrigation requirements grain yield and irrigation water productivity with respect to the maize crop evaluation of net returns requires inclusion of how the unirrigated fraction is cropped and managed under strategies 3 and 4 2 4 irrigation scheduling simulations for a center pivot decisions to irrigate must reflect the available irrigation capacity the speed of the center pivot drive the irrigated area and if there is sufficient water holding capacity near the surface to store the water applied to simplify the simulation process the irrigated area is divided into 10 sectors for all strategies table 1 a daily water balance and likewise a crop water stress level are maintained throughout the entire growing season in each of the 10 sectors irrigation is first applied to the first sector and then to the remaining sectors and always in the same order however if precipitation and or et o are favorable and the irrigation capacity is more than sufficient to meet crop water requirements irrigation is applied only when stored crop available water is 70 of available water at field capacity associated with the maximum rooting depth of the crop although at times the system may be applying more than is required by the crop producers use this strategy to store water that could be used later in the growing season when et o is greater irrigation is also not applied within one week prior to black layer because a mean water balance is maintained in each of the sectors crop yield is also simulated for each of these sectors during the growing season groundwater levels in observation wells will typically decline by two to four meters north plains groundwater conservation district 2020 stout 2018 reaching a minimum in august and rebounding to near initial levels later in the growing season these declines in groundwater levels are principally driven by irrigation decisions of producers with nearby actively pumped wells such seasonal perturbations can be considered as a temporary decline in the saturated thickness of the aquifer in the immediate vicinity and is largely responsible for reduced pumping capacities during the growing season as experienced by producers in the region within the model we assume a linear reduction in irrigation capacity by 15 from emergence to the beginning of august and a constant reduction of 15 thereafter extending to maturity to account for these seasonal changes in groundwater levels this magnitude of decline during the growing season is representative of many wells in the north thp that draw water from the aquifer personal communication dale hallmark north plains groundwater conservation district to our knowledge these types of limits on well yield have never been incorporated into a crop model during the growing season irrigation at the prescribed depth is triggered when plant available water is less than or equal to 70 of plant available water and when the center pivot is positioned at the beginning of the first sector this can be written as 2 i r r i g a t e t r u e i f s p a 0 7 s f c a n d θ 0 f a l s e o t h e r w i s e where s pa is the plant available soil water within the profile mm associated with the maximum rooting depth and s fc is the plant available soil water at field capacity mm the angular position of the pivot is described by θ rad with the area of sector 1 circumscribed between 0 and 2π 10 based on the fraction of the pivot that is irrigated under strategy 3 table 1 a contiguous circular sector of the pivot area beginning with sector 1 is designated as a subset of irrigated sectors with the remaining area designated as a subset of unirrigated sectors the gross irrigation depth i g is fixed throughout the growing season however irrigation capacity restricts the volume of irrigation applied in a single day the volume of irrigation m3 v i applied to sector i s i is calculated as 3 v i 0 i f θ 2 π s i 1 n s a n d θ 2 π s i n s

a 50 9 ha and f r is the fraction of the area that is irrigated when the reduction of irrigated area is achieved by turning off nozzles in the outer spans strategy 4 table 1 in this case the area associated with decreased radius increases the effective irrigation capacity to q f r in addition t i 1 and θ i 1 are the time d and angular position rad respectively prior to initiation of irrigation in sector s i assuming that irrigation has been triggered and there is time remaining within the day the pivot applies irrigation to the subsequent sector and so on until t 1 upon which t is reset to

unirrigated sectors we note that the irrigation capacity q is constant for a given day but can decline on subsequent days because of the simulated reduced pumping capacities later in the growing

cotton was assumed to yield 2 5 kg ha 1 lint per mm total precipitation received from 1 may to 30 sep which corresponds to 575 788 and 305 kg ha 1 for tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 respectively the net returns for this analysis represent net returns above variable costs and include only variable costs of production table 2 such as fertilizer seed herbicide and insecticide applications crop consulting and custom harvest fixed costs e g depreciation and interest on equipment investment are not considered in this analysis irrigation costs are calculated based on the fuel or energy costs to pump the applied water volume of gross irrigation irrigation repair and labor costs are also considered crop prices production costs and other production enterprise assumptions used in this study reflect three year averages 2019 2021 benavidez et al 2019 2020 jones et al 2018 nitrogen fertilizer applications for maize were based on grain yields predicted using the 50 upper confidence interval of yield y 50

irrigation of the area planted to maize mm ha 1 and p ave is mean seasonal 1 may to 28 aug precipitation 264 mm a 50 upper confidence interval for yield is used to estimate n applications to avoid

at the beginning of the growing season to guarantee establishment table 2 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the typical meteorological years the effective growing season precipitation precipitation less runoff from planting to physiological maturity for the typical meteorological years were 158 268 and 100 mm for tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 respectively crop water requirements during this same period et m did not differ substantially among the tmy s 781 727 and 795 mm for tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 respectively and fell within the observed range for the thp for maize 670 970 mm predicted maize grain yield as a function of seasonal crop evapotranspiration et a from 1993 to 2018 exhibited a wide swath of points for each tmy fig 2 with years segregated as either tmy2 or tmy3 fig 1c and noting that all years corresponds to tmy1 these data were generated using simulations in each year 1993 2018 with an initial profile water content of 0 278 m3 m 3 reductions of seasonal irrigation capacities by 0 and 15 and by varying irrigation capacities from 3 to 12 mm d 1 grain yields and approximate seasonal et are also shown for producer fields in the north thp north plains groundwater conservation district 2012 in 2012 a drought year with an average of 137 mm precipitation during the growing season these independent data show a similar pattern and fall within the range delineated by tmy3 simulations representing years with a seasonal drought predicted grain yield response to et a was obtained by fitting a regression line for simulated results obtain for each tmy under s1 table 1 yield response was nonlinear with a significant quadratic response p 0 001 for all tmy s fig 2 the predicted trend of yield with seasonal crop et for tmy2 and tmy3 falls near the mid range of the respective model results for all years 1993 2018 segregated by tmy grouping fig 2 the tmy associated with above average precipitation tmy2 had a similar yield response slope but greater yields under the same et a compared with tmy1 and tmy3 this outcome is largely explained by the fact that tmy2 had greater precipitation during july 82 mm compared with tmy1 48 mm and tmy3 25 mm and et a as a fraction of maximum et without stress et m could be maintained at higher levels under tmy2 even with limiting irrigation capacities during the month of july the crop is at the early reproductive stage and grain yield is more sensitive to water deficits management that applies irrigation to achieve a constant fractional et a et m among all growth stages for a tmy1 growing season resulted in greater predicted yields compared with management restricted by irrigation capacity fig 2 consequently past research that maintains a constant et fraction et a et m typically characteristic of irrigation studies in the u s great plains may not be particularly relevant to understanding the yield response of maize when irrigation capacities are limited 3 2 calculated seasonal irrigation applied to the pivot seasonal crop water requirements et m were calculated as 780 727 and 795 mm ha 1 under the typical meteorological years tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 respectively in contrast calculated net irrigation applications plus effective precipitation under s1 with initial profile water contents of 0 274 m3 m 3 ranged from 451 to 743 561 763 and 393 730 mm ha 1 for tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 consequently there was considerable water deficit stress at the low irrigation capacities under all tmy s although irrigation at the high capacities could hypothetically meet seasonal irrigation requirements during the early reproductive phases when et o was high 9 mm d 1 the calculated stress response function predicted water stress above plant available water fractions s pa s fc 0 7 schwartz et al 2020a however irrigation is not triggered until s pa s fc 0 7 eq 2 thereby resulting in crop water requirements not fully met during this period even at high capacities delaying irrigation is necessary to avoid difficulties with deep wheel tracks and runoff associated with applying irrigation too frequently in the fine textured soils of the region seasonal gross irrigation application rates under s1 varied from 275 to 750 mm depending on the irrigation capacity tmy and the initial profile water content fig 3 at irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 a 15 decline in capacity during the growing season reduced the number of irrigations by one to three applications 25 75 mm compared to strategies with no decline increasing application depths from 15 to 35 mm under tmy1 increased seasonal gross irrigation by an average of 37 mm fig 3 s2 differences in seasonal gross applications among higher application depths 25 35 mm were on average negligible 6 mm with application depths of 25 and 30 mm sometimes receiving greater total irrigation fig 3 simply as a result of fortuitous timing that permitted an additional one or two revolutions under strategies 3 and 4 only a fraction of the pivot area is irrigated to permit greater application depths on a smaller area and with the remaining pivot area under dryland cotton or fallow gross irrigation applications under these two strategies are presented in fig 3 as average volumes of the entire area of the pivot and not just the irrigated area consequently maximum seasonal gross irrigation at high capacities obtained when only a fraction is irrigated is less than when the entire area is irrigated nonetheless maximum or near maximum application depths on a fraction of the pivot area could be achieved at lower capacities under s4 and for irrigated fractions fr less than 0 8 an additional one to two irrigation applications 25 50 mm could be scheduled compared with s3 this result is due to the delay in irrigation associated with moving the pivot through the unirrigated sectors under s3 3 3 yield response to irrigation strategies grain yield for irrigated maize was simulated for each of the 10 sectors of the pivot under all strategies yield consistently declined with increasing angular distance from pivot sector 1 table 1 which was irrigated first and resulted in a mean yield difference of 0 93 mg ha 1 between sector 1 and 10 fig 4 this yield decline is simply a result of irrigation delays with increasing sector number and associated lower stored soil water throughout most of the growing season that increased water stress and reduced crop et this demonstrates that yields at the field scale will be considerably overestimated without considering the temporal spatial dynamics associated with irrigating in the remaining discussion all yield results reported reflect the average of all irrigated sectors a 15 simulated decline in the irrigation capacity reduced simulated grain yields by an average of 1 6 mg ha 1 for irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 fig 5 at greater flow rates declines in irrigation capacity did not reduce the number of applications and consequently had an insignificant effect on yield we caution that these yield declines resulting from reduced pumping could be underestimated because they do not consider reduced application uniformity resulting from a degradation of system performance at lower pressures martin et al 2019 because declines in irrigation capacity throughout the growing season is typical for the thp all subsequent results presented assume a 15 decline as detailed in the methods section the gross irrigation fig 3 and precipitation received by the crop in combination with the tmy and other factors analyzed in this study table 2 determined the overall simulated grain yield of maize per unit of area of the center pivot fig 6 as expected yield declined with reduced irrigation capacity because of the increase in the revolution time of the pivot thereby causing water deficits between irrigation events during some or all of the growth stages these yield declines are somewhat modified by variable et demands and rainfall throughout the growing season in combination with the timing of irrigation applications to each sector climatic conditions represented by the tmy s affected the range of yields exhibited by differing flow capacities thus under strategy s1 with an initial water profile water content of 0 278 m3 m 3 and for growing seasons with normal to above average precipitation tmy2 the yield ranged from 9 5 to 18 0 mg ha 1 depending on the irrigation capacity fig 6 the interval increased from 2 2 to 17 2 mg ha 1 under drought conditions tmy3 decreasing potential yield by 4 3 at the greatest irrigation capacity fig 6 in contrast when using the whole climatic data base for developing the tmy tmy1 the minimum yield associated with the lowest capacity was intermediate 4 2 mg ha 1 while maximum simulated yield was slightly lower than for tmy3 16 9 mg ha 1 fig 6 similar effects can be observed in the other strategies preseason irrigation of 75 mm reflected in an increase in profile water content from 0 278 to 0 306 m3 m 3 had little to no influence on grain yield at irrigation capacities greater than or equal to 5 mm d 1 fig 6 s1 irrigation capacities greater than 5 mm d 1 were sufficient to overcome soil water deficits at the beginning of the growing season when crop water requirements were low simulated grain yield increased an average of 10 1 0 mg ha 1 as irrigation application depth increased from 15 to 35 mm under tmy1 fig 6 principally because this facilitated greater seasonal gross and net irrigation for example compared with a 15 mm application depth a 35 mm application depth resulted in an additional 37 and 33 mm average gross and net irrigation respectively during the growing season yield differences among application depths of 35 30 and 25 mm were negligible averaging less than 0 1 mg ha 1 under tmy1 similar results were obtained for tmy2 and tmy3 for grain yield differences between 15 and 35 mm application depths averaging 0 8 and 1 1 mg ha 1 respectively likewise yield differences among application depths of 35 30 and 25 mm were negligible for tmy2 and tmy3 0 15 mg ha 1 these simulated results assume equivalent irrigation application efficiencies for application depths 25 35 mm for fine textured soils slow infiltration rates and poor distribution uniformity nascimento et al 2019 likely compromise these small yield advantages attributed to greater application depths irrigating a fraction of the center pivot area to increase crop water availability in selected sectors s3 increased average yield of the entire pivot area at the lowest irrigation capacity 3 mm d 1 for a year with average precipitation fig 6 s3 tmy1 this slight yield advantage x 0 6 mg ha 1 at 3 mm d 1 occurred for all fractions 0 5 0 9 compared to when the entire pivot was irrigated and peaked at 1 0 mg ha 1 at an irrigated fraction of 0 7 at irrigation capacities from 4 to 6 mm d 1 and irrigated fractions of 0 7 0 9 there were only slight yield differences 0 4 0 6 mg ha 1 compared to when the irrigation volume was spread out over the entire pivot area fig 6 s3 tmy1 under normal to above average precipitation tmy2 average yield of the pivot area increased with increasing irrigated fraction for all capacities fig 6 s3 tmy2 nevertheless under a seasonal drought tmy3 and low irrigation capacities 6 mm day 1 127 m3 h 1 irrigating the entire pivot area resulted in yield reductions 0 2 1 8 mg ha 1 compared to irrigating a fraction 0 6 0 9 fig 6 s3 tmy3 at greater irrigation capacities 7 mm day 1 greater yields could largely be attained by irrigating the total pivot area fig 6 s3 tmy3 decreasing the irrigated area by reducing the radius shutting off nozzles within the final three spans s4 had a similar effect on yield response across a range of irrigation capacities fig 6 s4 as did irrigating a fraction of the sectors s3 at all tmy s yields associated with turning nozzles off s4 were greater compared with yields obtained by irrigating the same fraction by omitting sectors s3 at low irrigation capacities 6 mm day 1 fig 7 this is primarily due to the irrigation delay associated with moving the pivot through the unirrigated sectors although not simulated improved yields for s4 may also result due to better distribution from maintaining nozzle pressure in response to declines in well yields later in the season martin et al 2019 3 4 irrigation water productivity response to irrigation strategies irrigation water productivity iwp in terms of maize yield increased with flow capacity under all scenarios and all tmy s fig 8 climatic conditions significantly affected to the range of iwp which was wider for drought years tmy3 0 6 2 5 kg m 3 compared with years with normal tmy1 1 1 2 7 kg m 3 to above average precipitation tm2 2 7 3 3 kg m 3 under scenarios s3 and s4 and under a given tmy the lowest iwp was obtained with the lowest irrigation capacity when irrigating the entire pivot area likewise the greatest iwp was obtained with the greatest capacity when irrigating half the pivot area 3 5 net revenue under irrigation scenarios under long term average climatic conditions tmy1 irrigating the entire pivot area resulted in negative net returns at irrigation capacities 5 mm d 1 fig 9 tmy1 s1 s2 as expected net returns are less under tmy3 with positive net returns obtained only for irrigation capacities 6 mm d 1 fig 9 tmy3 s1 s2 however under tmy2 conditions all the strategies generated positive net returns regardless of the irrigation capacity fig 9 tmy2 s1 s2 irrigating a fraction of the pivot area resulted in greater net returns at capacities 8 mm d 1 for tmy1 and tmy3 under strategy s4 fig 9 response of net returns to irrigated fraction under strategy s3 not shown were similar to s4 but with slightly lower returns at the lowest irrigation capacity with diminishing differences as irrigation capacity increased these differences are largely a result of slightly greater maize yields under strategy s4 fig 7 for tmy2 under strategy s4 greater net returns were also attained by irrigating a fraction of the pivot area at irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 but only when the unirrigated fraction was planted to dryland cotton planting the unirrigated area to cotton resulted in greater net returns under tmy1 and tmy2 in years with a drought during the growing season tmy3 lint yields were insufficient to offset variable costs associated with cotton production at or below the threshold irrigation capacity of 8 mm d 1 under tmy1 there existed an optimal fraction that maximized net returns which declined with decreasing irrigation capacity fig 10 for example at an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 an irrigation fraction of 0 75 optimized net returns under strategy s4 when the unirrigated fraction was managed as fallow corresponding fractions that optimized net returns for s4 with dryland cotton fig 10b and s3 with fallow figs 10c and 10d were 0 7 and 0 74 respectively achievement of greater net returns by concentrating the water is a consequence of lower yields and lower irrigation water productivities fig 8 combined with the high costs of seed and fertilizer 535 to 721 ha 1 and greater variable costs for irrigated 992 versus fallow areas 88 that are incurred when the entire area is irrigated the fraction at which the net returns were optimized depended primarily on the growing season precipitation associated with each tmy and was relatively insensitive to commodity prices and input costs for example increasing the maize price by 50 and fertilizer costs by 100 for strategy s4 with fallow at an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 caused the fraction of the maximum of net returns to shift from 0 74 to 0 84 and 0 67 respectively production risks associated with the irrigated fraction can be visualized by simulating net returns for the 1993 2018 climatic data utilized to develop tmy1 fig 10d the 50 quantile quadratic regression line for this data closely approximates the tmy1 trend quantile levels of 30 and 70 as well as the simulated net returns for the 1993 2018 data unambiguously demonstrate that production risk increases with increasing irrigated fraction maximum irrigation water productivity in terms of net return iwp ha 1 was attained under tmy1 and tmy2 across all irrigation capacities for strategies where half of the pivot area was irrigated for maize production with the other half planted to dryland cotton fig 11 for tmy3 iwp was greater when the unirrigated area was left in fallow in this case irrigating only a fraction of the pivot area resulted in the greatest iwp s for all but the greatest irrigation capacity 12 mm d 1 applying more seasonal irrigation water did not always generate greater economic benefits for example at an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 irrigation of 70 of the pivot area with the remaining area in fallow resulted in the application of 455 mm 50 9 ha 1 seasonal irrigation and generated a net return of 644 ha 1 tmy1 s4 in contrast irrigation of the entire pivot area with an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 resulted in the application of 600 mm 50 9 ha 1 seasonal irrigation and generated a net return of 458 ha 1 greater net revenues with less water volume resulted in considerably greater irrigation water productivities m 3 especially when the unirrigated area was planted to cotton in years with average tmy1 and average to above average tmy2 precipitation fig 11 4 discussion delineating the minimum irrigation capacity for irrigated maize depends on the weather conditions during the growing season yield potential and economic considerations lamm et al 2007 results obtained from our analysis s1 and s2 suggest that with a yield expectation of 13 mg ha 1 200 bu ac 1 an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 would be required for growing season with an average amount of precipitation tmy1 with lower irrigation capacities simulated yield declines rapidly along with irrigation water productivities likewise a return on investment of greater than 7 in an average growing season requires an irrigation capacity 7 mm d 1 this threshold irrigation capacity is similar to that suggested by lamm et al 2007 for northwest kansas maize production they simulated yield and net return for irrigated maize and recommended gross irrigation capacities of at least 6 7 mm d 1 50 exceedance level to achieve positive net returns preseason irrigation of 75 mm that increased profile water content at planting by 37 mm resulted in a modest yield increase of 1 0 mg ha 1 at a capacity of 3 mm d 1 but had little to no influence on grain yield at irrigation capacities greater than or equal to 5 mm d 1 irrigation capacities greater than 5 mm d 1 were sufficient to overcome soil water deficits at the beginning of the growing season when crop water requirements were low and application efficiencies greater these results are similar to those of the study by schlegel et al 2012 in west central kansas that showed increased grain yields of 1 3 mg ha 1 with preseason irrigation at capacities of 2 5 and 3 8 mm d 1 they concluded that preseason irrigation was unnecessary with irrigation capacities of 5 0 mm d 1 or greater with irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 in a year with average growing season precipitation tmy1 reducing the irrigated area is the most prudent option for optimizing net returns under maize production reducing the area of the irrigated circle by turning off nozzles in the outer spans s4 resulted in greater yields compared with omitting irrigation in sectors of the pivot area s3 this also has the advantage of maintaining system pressure and reducing problems with application uniformity associated with supplying water to all spans under reduced flows martin et al 2019 planting dryland cotton in the unirrigated fraction improved net returns under tmy1 and tmy2 but not for a growing season with a drought tmy3 because greater applications of seasonal irrigation water did not always generate greater economic benefits there is the opportunity for producers to both increase net returns and save water under reduced irrigation capacities by irrigating a fraction of the pivot area evaluations of yield and net revenue response to irrigating a fraction of the land area compared to the entire pivot area at fixed flow capacities are limited in the southern u s great plains klocke et al 2006 introduced a water allocation model for limited irrigation to a range of crops but a detailed analysis of results for irrigated maize was not presented using aquacrop raes et al 2009 to estimate yields over a range of irrigation capacities in southwestern kansas araya et al 2017 inferred that maize yields could be optimized for a sandy clay loam by plating 75 of the area of a typical center pivot system compared to 50 and 100 of the area for irrigation capacities of 3 3 mm d 1 during a dry growing season 182 mm precipitation for a silt loam soil yield optimization at 3 3 mm d 1 was obtained by planting the entire pivot area assuming no seasonal decline in irrigation capacity as did araya et al 2017 our results indicate that yield advantages of planting 50 of the pivot extended to 4 mm d 1 for a growing season with a drought tmy3 100 mm precipitation in an environment with greater et demand for tmy2 growing precipitation 158 yield was maximized at 0 7 0 8 of the area irrigated at a capacity of 3 mm d 1 in this case our yield optimizations that occur at smaller fractions of the pivot area at low capacities compared to that of araya et al 2017 for the silt loam soil reflect the greater seasonal et o in the thp compared to southwestern kansas simulated yield declines in the thp are steeper thereby penalizing the spreading of water we also note that dryland maize production is common in western kansas yet considered unfeasible in the thp foster et al 2015 also modeled effects of maize yield and profitability using aquacrop for the texas high plains amarillo to predict the optimum fraction of an irrigated area over a range of irrigation capacities for irrigation capacities of 3 8 5 7 and 7 6 mm d 1 net returns were optimized at irrigated fractions of 0 32 0 51 and 0 72 in contrast our results indicated net returns are optimized at similar irrigation capacities with greater irrigated fractions e g at 4 and 6 mm d 1 net returns were optimized with irrigated fractions of 0 5 and 0 6 respectively our results show that the transitional point where irrigating the entire pivot area became most profitable occurred at 9 mm d 1 whereas this threshold was determined to occur at 11 4 mm d 1 by foster et al 2015 noting the relative insensitivity of the optimum fraction to maize prices and costs discussed earlier this apparent inconsistency with regards to our study is likely explained by the fact that foster et al 2015 did not consider the timing of irrigation applications to the entire pivot area for example 700 mm of seasonal irrigation to maize was achieved with an irrigation capacity of 5 mm d 1 foster et al 2015 whereas considering the logistics of applying irrigation at this rate our seasonal irrigation was limited to 525 mm we also note that the crop model used by foster et al 2015 was not calibrated for the region clearly the inability of previous modelling assessments at low irrigation capacities to explicitly account for constraints associated with timing of irrigations and moving the pivot through unirrigated sectors under restricted irrigation capacities may result in unreliable predictions of yield and profitability the foregoing analyses assumes that well pumping capacities are limited as a result of aquifer characteristics however in many areas of the high plains aquifer annual well production limits are established by groundwater districts or producer organizations for instance the texas high plains water district high plains water district 2020b limits the total amount of production to 457 mm 18 in per contiguous land area per year this level of production equates to an irrigation capacity of approximately 7 8 mm d 1 in a normal tmy1 year for a pivot contained with a quarter section 65 ha newly permitted wells in the thp for which well production observations are available high plains water district 2020a indicate that 83 had pumping flow rates less than 60 m3 h 1 which is equivalent to an irrigation capacity of approximately 2 8 mm d 1 if water was spread out over 50 9 ha obviously within this groundwater district irrigation capacities greater than 7 mm d 1 are not common because of limited well production relative to the land area available for irrigated cultivation in such cases well production restrictions established by the groundwater district would not influence how water allocation decisions are made to optimize net return using our analysis in cases where the producer has irrigation capacities that exceed limits on pumping set by established rules optimization of maize yield and net returns will need to consider the approach presented by domínguez et al 2012a 2017 or bell et al 2018 in which the volume of water pumped is limited yet proportionately greater volumes of irrigation are applied during the early reproductive phases that are most sensitive to water stress because producers do not have the necessary knowledge of weather conditions and accurate forecasts during the growing season in advance of planting decisions will unavoidably involve risks associated with the fraction of the area that is irrigated irrigating a smaller fraction can result in significant opportunity costs if the year is wetter than average planting a larger area with the expectation for a wetter season can result in significant economic losses when precipitation is below normal our simulated results suggest that under limiting capacities opportunity costs can be minimized and net returns optimized for an average year tmy1 by planting dryland cotton in unirrigated areas in years with seasonal droughts forecasting well before planting time march is necessary for producers to respond with appropriate irrigation practices to mitigate potential losses the proposed method using tmy3 to assess irrigation strategies in conjunction with drought forecasts being implemented by the texas water development board fernando et al 2019 would provide actionable information for producers and also crop insurance provider s to adjust the planted acreage reduce crop failures and stabilize profit the combination of optimizing spatial allocation of water to crops lópez mata et al 2016 with weather forecasting politi et al 2018 is being promoted in other areas of the world as is the case of the supromed project www supromed eu within the mediterranean basin 5 conclusions the mopeco crop model adapted to simulate maize water use and yield under center pivot irrigation in conjunction with the typical meteorological year approach was useful in delineating the optimal irrigation strategies that maximized net return under limited irrigation capacities inclusion of algorithms to schedule irrigation that considered actual constraints associated with moving the pivot through a field resulted in lower but more realistic yields compared with simulations without such restrictions although maize yields for the entire pivot area in an average rainfall year were predicted to be greater than or marginally less 1 mg ha 1 when the entire pivot area was cropped compared to a fraction reducing the irrigated area was the most prudent option for optimizing net returns under maize production when irrigation capacity was limiting 8 mm d 1 greater net returns achieved with concentrating the water was a consequence of greater irrigation water productivities combined with the lower seed and fertilizer costs resulting from reduced maize cropped land area greater applications of seasonal irrigation water did not always generate greater net returns and therefore there is an opportunity to both increase net returns and save water by irrigating a fraction of the pivot area with the crop production revenue and variable costs used in this study at an irrigation capacity of 3 mm d 1 net returns were on average negative even when only half the pivot area was planted to maize at irrigation capacities from 4 to 5 mm d 1 net returns were optimized when approximately half the pivot area was irrigated for an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 typical of the thp net returns were optimized when approximately 75 of the pivot area was irrigated planting cotton in the unirrigated portion increased net returns except in years with a seasonal drought tmy3 the optimal irrigated fraction that maximized net returns depended principally on growing season precipitation and was relatively insensitive to maize prices and input costs because of the potentially large economic losses under maize production that occur in years with seasonal drought accurate climatic forecasting would be indispensable in

9763,in the texas high plains thp groundwater resources for irrigation are declining because of aquifer depletion and reduced well yield inability to meet peak water demands of maize under constrained irrigation capacities decreases yield and profitability the mopeco crop model calibrated for the thp was adapted to simulate maize water use and yield under center pivot irrigation to evaluate water allocation strategies under limited irrigation simulations were carried out over a range of irrigation capacities 3 12 mm d 1 for a 50 9 ha area initial soil water contents and application depths with irrigation allocated to a fraction 0 5 1 0 of the pivot area fractional water allocations were achieved by withholding irrigation from circular sectors or from outer spans with unirrigated fractions in fallow or planted to dryland cotton these strategies were evaluated for growing seasons characterized by typical meteorological years with average tmy1 average to above average tmy2 and below average tmy3 precipitation preseason irrigation had little to no influence on grain yield at irrigation capacities 5 mm d 1 at irrigation capacities 6 mm d 1 under tmy1 marginally greater yields 50 9 ha 1 were simulated when a fraction was irrigated for irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 under tmy1 reducing the irrigated area was the most prudent option to optimize net returns as irrigation capacities increased from 4 to 8 mm d 1 the irrigated fraction that maximized net returns increased from 0 5 to 0 9 concentrating water generated greater net returns because of greater irrigation water productivities and lower seed and fertilizer costs compared with fallow planting cotton in the unirrigated portion increased net returns except in years with a seasonal drought tmy3 because greater irrigation volume did not always increase net returns there is an opportunity to both increase profitability and conserve water by irrigating a fraction of the area keywords limited irrigation mopeco sprinkler irrigation typical meteorological year water productivity zea mays l 1 introduction the high plains aquifer is a major source of water for irrigation industrial uses and drinking water throughout the u s great plains and extends from the texas high plains thp to nebraska and south dakota approximately 24 billion m3 was pumped from the aquifer in 2005 of which 97 was used for irrigation on roughly 6 3 million ha of farmland mcguire 2009 in the southern portion of the high plains aquifer pumping has greatly exceeded recharge rates resulting in declines in saturated thickness exceeding 46 m in extensive areas of southern kansas and the thp since predevelopment mcguire 2017 decreases in saturated thickness increase the pumping cost but more importantly reduce the well yield declining well flow capacities reduces both crop yield and profitability because peak water use usually coincides with crop reproductive stages when water stress results in the greatest yield reductions scanlon et al 2012 foster et al 2015 schwartz et al 2020a because of the severity aquifer depletion water management strategies such as changing crop type irrigation scheduling and conversion to dryland are being evaluated for economic feasibility and effectiveness in prolonging the life of irrigated agriculture in the thp crouch et al 2020 maize zea mays l accounts for approximately 50 of pumping for irrigation colaizzi et al 2009 schlegel et al 2012 xue et al 2017 and has seasonal water requirements ranging from 670 to 970 mm in the thp howell et al 1995b 1996 schneider and howell 1998 schwartz et al 2020a because of maize sensitivity to water deficits marginal well capacities that reduce irrigation allocations during critical growth stages can result in considerable reductions in grain yield howell et al 1996 schwartz et al 2020a in 2000 for approximately 72 of the irrigated area in the thp water was delivered to crops using center pivot irrigation systems colaizzi et al 2009 from 1958 2000 the number of wells in the thp doubled however during this same time period the seasonal volume of water pumped per well and the area irrigated per well was cut in half colaizzi et al 2009 with an average irrigated area per well of 18 ha in 2000 typically three wells are required to irrigate a quarter section 51 ha when adding more wells is not an option or cost prohibitive the operator runs the system at reduced flow rates which oftentimes requires changing nozzles to lower flow rates or turning off a certain number of nozzles to maintain system pressure flow rates of 1 68 m 3 h 1 ha 1 3 gal min 1 ac 1 are common in the region because a flow rate of 1 68 m 3 h 1 ha 1 can only deliver 4 0 mm d 1 operators slow down the pivot speed to increase the application volume resulting in a period of over 6 days to apply 25 mm irrigation given daily reference evapotranspiration et o values of 8 mm and often exceeding 10 mm a day combined with unreliable precipitation it is obvious that these flow rates are insufficient to meet water requirements of maize throughout much of the growing season scheduling irrigation to maintain soil water above a certain stress threshold is usually not attainable under these conditions except during periods of above average precipitation mahan and lascano 2016 preseason irrigation schlegel et al 2012 and irrigating above crop requirements during the early vegetative stage are common strategies that producers use to build plant available water in the deep soils characteristic of the region stored soil water is used later in the growing season during peak water use periods to partially offset insufficient irrigation capacity an evaluation of maize yield and profit as influenced by limited irrigation capacities should consider the wide inter annual variabilities in growing season precipitation and et o considering these constraints the principal management option producers have available to them is how to distribute water spatially within a field managing a portion under deficit or full irrigation with the remaining area planted to a dryland crop or left fallow secondary management considerations include i varying the pivot speed to adjust the depth of application and consequently the time between irrigations and ii choosing how to reduce the irrigated acreage by either supplying water only to a sector of the pivot circle baumhardt et al 2007 or by shutting off nozzles on the outer spans of the pivot and thereby reducing radius of the irrigated area crops suitable for dryland production may also be planted on acreage that is not irrigated the objective of this study is to utilize a calibrated crop water use and yield model to optimize planted acreage and management practices that would maximize long term total maize yield and profitability for a center pivot irrigated 50 9 ha field over a range of irrigation capacities a secondary objective is to determine optimal management interventions to mitigate losses in years with extended seasonal drought 2 methodology 2 1 climate data and analysis climatic data extending from 1993 to 2018 at the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory bushland tx 1170 m asl 35 11 n 102 6 w were used in these evaluations the weather station is centered within an irrigated cool season grass surface described by howell et al 1995a solar irradiance wind speed air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and barometric pressure were monitored at this weather station throughout the year and precipitation were measured with tipping bucket rain gages over the grass surface in these analyses the years 2012 2013 and 2015 were omitted because of uncertainties in the quality of data during the growing season using this weather data et o was calculated using the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for a short reference crop at a 24 h time step asce 2005 in the thp maize is typically planted from late april to mid may and the initiation of the dough stage r4 for a crop planted in mid may will typically occur on 28 august based on mean growing degree days for the period of record consequently climatic data for a growing season extending from 1 may to 28 august is the most crucial for determining irrigation requirements and maize yield potential precipitation and weather conditions extending from r4 to physiological maturity 17 sept has a comparatively minor influence on the yield potential schwartz et al 2020a from 1939 2018 mean precipitation at the bushland research station for the period 1 may to 28 august was 264 mm s d 95 6 mm and the data exhibits a strong normal distribution shapiro wilk p 0 661 fig 1a from 1993 2018 mean precipitation and et o was 231 and 874 mm respectively during this critical time period because the u s southern great plains is prone to extreme droughts it is important to differentiate years that exhibit lower than normal precipitation from years with normal to above average precipitation combined with reliable drought forecasts the assessment of irrigation requirements in these years could provide actionable information for producers and also crop insurance providers to adjust the planted acreage reduce crop failures reduce unproductive water consumption and increase profit the oceanic niño index temperature anomaly associated with la niña is not a good predictor of summer droughts in the southern u s great plains pu et al 2016 and this observation is supported by the climatic data at the bushland station with only 2 of 5 la niña years exhibiting cumulative precipitation for the period 1 may to 28 aug that could be considered to be a seasonal drought fig 1b more importantly for the climatic data at bushland 1993 2018 the oceanic niño index temperature anomaly for may july is uncorrelated r 0 002 slope 0 0005 to the precipitation et o ratio not shown an indicator of seasonal irrigation requirements we consider drought within the growing season as those years with precipitation falling within the 0 8 1 0 exceedance probabilities as evaluated using the long term precipitation record in bushland fig 1b this threshold also corresponds to a standardized precipitation index x x σ of 0 84 utilized by agnew 2000 to identify years with at least a moderate to severe level of drought more importantly this threshold segregates years that exhibit elevated temperatures and evaporative demands that in addition to below normal precipitation are associated with droughts in the region in normal to wet years with exceedance probabilities 0 80 et o varied little with respect to seasonal precipitation averaging 820 mm and increasing 0 3 mm for every 1 mm decline in precipitation p 0 08 fig 1c above this threshold et o increased 2 6 mm for every 1 mm decline in precipitation p 0 001 fig 1c the relationship between increasing et o with decreasing precipitation is characteristic of droughts in the southern u s great plains and is a product of the coupling of land surface soil moisture and precipitation soil moisture deficits in the spring increase sensible heating and surface temperatures thereby increasing evaporative demands and oftentimes leading to convective inhibition and a reduction in precipitation fernando et al 2019 use of a typical meteorological year tmy is useful for planning and assessing irrigation requirements because of the great degree of uncertainty in year to year forecasted precipitation during the growing season domínguez et al 2013 a tmy consists of one year of climatic data chosen from a long time series typically spanning more than 10 years hall et al 1978 using the 1993 2018 climatic data in bushland tx tmy s were constructed using i all years to evaluate the mean response tmy1 ii years with precipitation exceedance probabilities less than 0 8 and regarded as growing seasons with normal to above average precipitation tmy2 and years with precipitation exceedance probabilities greater than 0 8 and regarded as growing seasons with a pronounced drought tmy3 each of these three scenarios were developed using climatic data extending from 1 may to 31 october with each of the typical months chosen by finkelstein schafer statistical comparisons of candidate monthly periods with long term cumulative distribution frequencies of maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and et o domínguez et al 2013 2 2 crop water use and yield model the crop water use and yield model mopeco model for the economic optimization of irrigation water ortega et al 2004 with the modifications introduced by schwartz et al 2020a was used to simulate maize water use and yield in response to center pivot irrigation scenarios in the thp mopeco uses the fao 56 crop coefficient reference et approach fao 1998 in conjunction with an empirical crop water production function to predict grain yield the yield function is based on the work of stewart et al 1977 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 that considers water deficits at different crop growth stages in a multiplicative relationship rao et al 1988 domínguez et al 2012a 2012b the crop model was calibrated and validated using 18 site years that consisted of detailed water use monitored throughout each growing season determined with a soil water balance approach and a neutron gage to evaluate changes is stored soil water schwartz et al 2020a maize yields of the calibration data set ranged from 0 to 19 3 mg ha 1 with crop water use that ranged from 310 mm dryland to 770 mm crop phenological growth stages associated with crop coefficients schwartz et al 2020a fig 1c were estimated using growing degree days gdd for each tmy growing degree days were evaluated using daily maximum and minimum temperatures with a 10 c base temperature and an upper temperature threshold of 30 c using method 2 of mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 in this study we used the fixed and fitted parameters for the nonlinear crop water stress function schwartz et al 2020a optimization 3 to simulate maize water use and yield soil water retention and other parameters used in these simulations are for a pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll schwartz et al 2020a and along with two other soils series with nearly identical properties represent the prinicpal soil groups used for maize production in the thp crop water use and yield simulations of mopeco were implemented in an excel spreadsheet with a fixed planting date of 16 may redistribution of water from infiltrated precipitation p and irrigation i within the rooting zone occurs instantaneously and drainage out of the rooting zone occurs when the soil water content exceeds field capacity the maximum rooting depth of the maize attained at inflorescence was set equivalent to 1 4 m the initial water content was set equivalent to 0 278 m3 m 3 for the entire profile which was based on the mean of initial water contents in the data sets evaluated by schwartz et al 2020a runoff depth r from daily precipitation depth p was estimated using the original curve number approach rallison 1980 1 r p i a 2 p i a s i p i a 0 p i a where s i is the potential retention due to soil water storage or infiltration whichever is the least and the depth of initial abstraction i a is set to 15 mm because near surface soil water content could not be approximated using the excel spreadsheet redistribution algorithm of mopeco as in schwartz et al 2020a s i was set to a constant value of 23 1 mm this assumes that the upper 0 2 m of the profile had an initial water content equivalent to 75 plant available water which was similar to observed values for irrigated maize schwartz et al 2020a net irrigation i n was estimated as in schwartz et al 2020a by multiplying the gross application depth i g by an application efficiency ae i of 0 90 howell 2003 if the gross application depth was less than a threshold d 0 25 mm then net irrigation was estimated as i g d 0 1 ae i to account for diminishing application efficiencies associated with evaporative losses with shallow application depths schwartz et al 2020a the crop water use and yield simulations use the weather data of the tmy s that reflect growing seasons with average normal to above average and below average drought growing season precipitation as such these simulations reflect the expected mean response over the long term a limited number of crop model simulations were also carried out for all climatic data 1993 2018 to validate the tmy approach in the southern u s great plains environment and also to provide an assessment of the variability of the predicted yield response and net returns in each year of these simulations crop developmental stages were based on growing degree days calculated from daily minimum and maximum temperatures in each of the growing seasons in addition yield response was scaled based on the accumulated solar radiation after pollination in each year with a scalar of unity for the average solar radiation accumulation for all years as with the simulations using the tmy s we completed these simulations using a planting date of 16 may 2 3 adaptation of the crop water use and yield model for selected scenarios crop water use yield response and net returns were evaluated using the crop water use and yield model and four center pivot irrigation scenarios or strategies for a quarter mile 402 m long pivot or approximately 50 9 ha table 1 these evaluations were carried out using the three tmy s reflecting growing seasons with average normal to above average and below average drought growing season precipitation for the typical management strategy 1 s1 we considered 10 irrigation capacities 3 4 5 12 mm d 1 generated by a single well or a group of wells for the irrigation of the entire area of a standard center pivot system these irrigation capacities were evaluated in conjunction with three initial profile water contents 0 278 0 0278 m3 m 3 representing the mean and 1 standard deviation respectively of 18 site years of studies presented by schwartz et al 2020a an incremental increase in initial profile water content from 0 278 to 0 306 m3 m 3 was considered representative of sufficient pre irrigation to increase stored soil water at planting by 38 9 mm and achieved through three irrigations of 25 mm several weeks before planting a net increase of 25 mm stored soil water with 50 mm of irrigation applied is characteristic of the fine textured soils in the region tolk et al 2015 the standard management strategy s1 was compared with the other strategies to determine if yield and profitability could be improved table 1 a second strategy considered s2 varies the irrigation application depth from 15 to 35 mm at the 10 irrigation capacities with application depth constant throughout the entire growing season table 1 this strategy permits an evaluation of how different application depths influence crop yield smaller application depths permit the crop to receive irrigation over smaller time intervals but this comes with the disadvantage of reduced application efficiency besides irrigating the entire circle producers have the option of leaving a fraction of the circle unirrigated when irrigation capacities become limiting baumhardt et al 2007 2009 the unirrigated area can be left fallow or planted to a dryland crop strategy 3 s3 reduces the area irrigated by the pivot by supplying water to all nozzles but withholding irrigation to one or more sectors of the circle table 1 this strategy permits an increase in the irrigation frequency however irrigation is delayed by the time it takes for the pivot to travel through the unirrigated sectors at its maximum speed 100 assumed here as one full rotation per day 0 083 rad h 1 or 1 76 m min 1 at the outermost nozzle in scenario 3 irrigating in different directions is avoided and the irrigation system must travel across the non irrigated area to commence irrigation on the first sector a fourth strategy s4 reduces the irrigated area by turning off nozzles on the outer spans of the pivot table 1 in this case the nozzle flow rates travel speed and irrigation frequency are increased in order to maintain a selected application depth all strategies are evaluated with regard to seasonal irrigation requirements grain yield and irrigation water productivity with respect to the maize crop evaluation of net returns requires inclusion of how the unirrigated fraction is cropped and managed under strategies 3 and 4 2 4 irrigation scheduling simulations for a center pivot decisions to irrigate must reflect the available irrigation capacity the speed of the center pivot drive the irrigated area and if there is sufficient water holding capacity near the surface to store the water applied to simplify the simulation process the irrigated area is divided into 10 sectors for all strategies table 1 a daily water balance and likewise a crop water stress level are maintained throughout the entire growing season in each of the 10 sectors irrigation is first applied to the first sector and then to the remaining sectors and always in the same order however if precipitation and or et o are favorable and the irrigation capacity is more than sufficient to meet crop water requirements irrigation is applied only when stored crop available water is 70 of available water at field capacity associated with the maximum rooting depth of the crop although at times the system may be applying more than is required by the crop producers use this strategy to store water that could be used later in the growing season when et o is greater irrigation is also not applied within one week prior to black layer because a mean water balance is maintained in each of the sectors crop yield is also simulated for each of these sectors during the growing season groundwater levels in observation wells will typically decline by two to four meters north plains groundwater conservation district 2020 stout 2018 reaching a minimum in august and rebounding to near initial levels later in the growing season these declines in groundwater levels are principally driven by irrigation decisions of producers with nearby actively pumped wells such seasonal perturbations can be considered as a temporary decline in the saturated thickness of the aquifer in the immediate vicinity and is largely responsible for reduced pumping capacities during the growing season as experienced by producers in the region within the model we assume a linear reduction in irrigation capacity by 15 from emergence to the beginning of august and a constant reduction of 15 thereafter extending to maturity to account for these seasonal changes in groundwater levels this magnitude of decline during the growing season is representative of many wells in the north thp that draw water from the aquifer personal communication dale hallmark north plains groundwater conservation district to our knowledge these types of limits on well yield have never been incorporated into a crop model during the growing season irrigation at the prescribed depth is triggered when plant available water is less than or equal to 70 of plant available water and when the center pivot is positioned at the beginning of the first sector this can be written as 2 i r r i g a t e t r u e i f s p a 0 7 s f c a n d θ 0 f a l s e o t h e r w i s e where s pa is the plant available soil water within the profile mm associated with the maximum rooting depth and s fc is the plant available soil water at field capacity mm the angular position of the pivot is described by θ rad with the area of sector 1 circumscribed between 0 and 2π 10 based on the fraction of the pivot that is irrigated under strategy 3 table 1 a contiguous circular sector of the pivot area beginning with sector 1 is designated as a subset of irrigated sectors with the remaining area designated as a subset of unirrigated sectors the gross irrigation depth i g is fixed throughout the growing season however irrigation capacity restricts the volume of irrigation applied in a single day the volume of irrigation m3 v i applied to sector i s i is calculated as 3 v i 0 i f θ 2 π s i 1 n s a n d θ 2 π s i n s

unirrigated sectors we note that the irrigation capacity q is constant for a given day but can decline on subsequent days because of the simulated reduced pumping capacities later in the growing

cotton was assumed to yield 2 5 kg ha 1 lint per mm total precipitation received from 1 may to 30 sep which corresponds to 575 788 and 305 kg ha 1 for tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 respectively the net returns

year averages 2019 2021 benavidez et al 2019 2020 jones et al 2018 nitrogen fertilizer applications for maize were based on grain yields predicted using the 50 upper confidence interval of yield y 50

at the beginning of the growing season to guarantee establishment table 2 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the typical meteorological years the effective growing season precipitation precipitation less runoff from planting to physiological maturity for the typical meteorological years were 158 268 and 100 mm for tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 respectively crop water requirements during this same period et m did not differ substantially among the tmy s 781 727 and 795 mm for tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 respectively and fell within the observed range for the thp for maize 670 970 mm predicted maize grain yield as a function of seasonal crop evapotranspiration et a from 1993 to 2018 exhibited a wide swath of points for each tmy fig 2 with years segregated as either tmy2 or tmy3 fig 1c and noting that all years corresponds to tmy1 these data were generated using simulations in each year 1993 2018 with an initial profile water content of 0 278 m3 m 3 reductions of seasonal irrigation capacities by 0 and 15 and by varying irrigation capacities from 3 to 12 mm d 1 grain yields and approximate seasonal et are also shown for producer fields in the north thp north plains groundwater conservation district 2012 in 2012 a drought year with an average of 137 mm precipitation during the growing season these independent data show a similar pattern and fall within the range delineated by tmy3 simulations representing years with a seasonal drought predicted grain yield response to et a was obtained by fitting a regression line for simulated results obtain for each tmy under s1 table 1 yield response was nonlinear with a significant quadratic response p 0 001 for all tmy s fig 2 the predicted trend of yield with seasonal crop et for tmy2 and tmy3 falls near the mid range of the respective model results for all years 1993 2018 segregated by tmy grouping fig 2 the tmy associated with above average precipitation tmy2 had a similar yield response slope but greater yields under the same et a compared with tmy1 and tmy3 this outcome is largely explained by the fact that tmy2 had greater precipitation during july 82 mm compared with tmy1 48 mm and tmy3 25 mm and et a as a fraction of maximum et without stress et m could be maintained at higher levels under tmy2 even with limiting irrigation capacities during the month of july the crop is at the early reproductive stage and grain yield is more sensitive to water deficits management that applies irrigation to achieve a constant fractional et a et m among all growth stages for a tmy1 growing season resulted in greater predicted yields compared with management restricted by irrigation capacity fig 2 consequently past research that maintains a constant et fraction et a et m typically characteristic of irrigation studies in the u s great plains may not be particularly relevant to understanding the yield response of maize when irrigation capacities are limited 3 2 calculated seasonal irrigation applied to the pivot seasonal crop water requirements et m were calculated as 780 727 and 795 mm ha 1 under the typical meteorological years tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 respectively in contrast calculated net irrigation applications plus effective precipitation under s1 with initial profile water contents of 0 274 m3 m 3 ranged from 451 to 743 561 763 and 393 730 mm ha 1 for tmy1 tmy2 and tmy3 consequently there was considerable water deficit stress at the low irrigation capacities under all tmy s although irrigation at the high capacities could hypothetically meet seasonal irrigation requirements during the early reproductive phases when et o was high 9 mm d 1 the calculated stress response function predicted water stress above plant available water fractions s pa s fc 0 7 schwartz et al 2020a however irrigation is not triggered until s pa s fc 0 7 eq 2 thereby resulting in crop water requirements not fully met during this period even at high capacities delaying irrigation is necessary to avoid difficulties with deep wheel tracks and runoff associated with applying irrigation too frequently in the fine textured soils of the region seasonal gross irrigation application rates under s1 varied from 275 to 750 mm depending on the irrigation capacity tmy and the initial profile water content fig 3 at irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 a 15 decline in capacity during the growing season reduced the number of irrigations by one to three applications 25 75 mm compared to strategies with no decline increasing application depths from 15 to 35 mm under tmy1 increased seasonal gross irrigation by an average of 37 mm fig 3 s2 differences in seasonal gross applications among higher application depths 25 35 mm were on average negligible 6 mm with application depths of 25 and 30 mm sometimes receiving greater total irrigation fig 3 simply as a result of fortuitous timing that permitted an additional one or two revolutions under strategies 3 and 4 only a fraction of the pivot area is irrigated to permit greater application depths on a smaller area and with the remaining pivot area under dryland cotton or fallow gross irrigation applications under these two strategies are presented in fig 3 as average volumes of the entire area of the pivot and not just the irrigated area consequently maximum seasonal gross irrigation at high capacities obtained when only a fraction is irrigated is less than when the entire area is irrigated nonetheless maximum or near maximum application depths on a fraction of the pivot area could be achieved at lower capacities under s4 and for irrigated fractions fr less than 0 8 an additional one to two irrigation applications 25 50 mm could be scheduled compared with s3 this result is due to the delay in irrigation associated with moving the pivot through the unirrigated sectors under s3 3 3 yield response to irrigation strategies grain yield for irrigated maize was simulated for each of the 10 sectors of the pivot under all strategies yield consistently declined with increasing angular distance from pivot sector 1 table 1 which was irrigated first and resulted in a mean yield difference of 0 93 mg ha 1 between sector 1 and 10 fig 4 this yield decline is simply a result of irrigation delays with increasing sector number and associated lower stored soil water throughout most of the growing season that increased water stress and reduced crop et this demonstrates that yields at the field scale will be considerably overestimated without considering the temporal spatial dynamics associated with irrigating in the remaining discussion all yield results reported reflect the average of all irrigated sectors a 15 simulated decline in the irrigation capacity reduced simulated grain yields by an average of 1 6 mg ha 1 for irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 fig 5 at greater flow rates declines in irrigation capacity did not reduce the number of applications and consequently had an insignificant effect on yield we caution that these yield declines resulting from reduced pumping could be underestimated because they do not consider reduced application uniformity resulting from a degradation of system performance at lower pressures martin et al 2019 because declines in irrigation capacity throughout the growing season is typical for the thp all subsequent results presented assume a 15 decline as detailed in the methods section the gross irrigation fig 3 and precipitation received by the crop in combination with the tmy and other factors analyzed in this study table 2 determined the overall simulated grain yield of maize per unit of area of the center pivot fig 6 as expected yield declined with reduced irrigation capacity because of the increase in the revolution time of the pivot thereby causing water deficits between irrigation events during some or all of the growth stages these yield declines are somewhat modified by variable et demands and rainfall throughout the growing season in combination with the timing of irrigation applications to each sector climatic conditions represented by the tmy s affected the range of yields exhibited by differing flow capacities thus under strategy s1 with an initial water profile water content of 0 278 m3 m 3 and for growing seasons with normal to above average precipitation tmy2 the yield ranged from 9 5 to 18 0 mg ha 1 depending on the irrigation capacity fig 6 the interval increased from 2 2 to 17 2 mg ha 1 under drought conditions tmy3 decreasing potential yield by 4 3 at the greatest irrigation capacity fig 6 in contrast when using the whole climatic data base for developing the tmy tmy1 the minimum yield associated with the lowest capacity was intermediate 4 2 mg ha 1 while maximum simulated yield was slightly lower than for tmy3 16 9 mg ha 1 fig 6 similar effects can be observed in the other strategies preseason irrigation of 75 mm reflected in an increase in profile water content from 0 278 to 0 306 m3 m 3 had little to no influence on grain yield at irrigation capacities greater than or equal to 5 mm d 1 fig 6 s1 irrigation capacities greater than 5 mm d 1 were sufficient to overcome soil water deficits at the beginning of the growing season when crop water requirements were low simulated grain yield increased an average of 10 1 0 mg ha 1 as irrigation application depth increased from 15 to 35 mm under tmy1 fig 6 principally because this facilitated greater seasonal gross and net irrigation for example compared with a 15 mm application depth a 35 mm application depth resulted in an additional 37 and 33 mm average gross and net irrigation respectively during the growing season yield differences among application depths of 35 30 and 25 mm were negligible averaging less than 0 1 mg ha 1 under tmy1 similar results were obtained for tmy2 and tmy3 for grain yield differences between 15 and 35 mm application depths averaging 0 8 and 1 1 mg ha 1 respectively likewise yield differences among application depths of 35 30 and 25 mm were negligible for tmy2 and tmy3 0 15 mg ha 1 these simulated results assume equivalent irrigation application efficiencies for application depths 25 35 mm for fine textured soils slow infiltration rates and poor distribution uniformity nascimento et al 2019 likely compromise these small yield advantages attributed to greater application depths irrigating a fraction of the center pivot area to increase crop water availability in selected sectors s3 increased average yield of the entire pivot area at the lowest irrigation capacity 3 mm d 1 for a year with average precipitation fig 6 s3 tmy1 this slight yield advantage x 0 6 mg ha 1 at 3 mm d 1 occurred for all fractions 0 5 0 9 compared to when the entire pivot was irrigated and peaked at 1 0 mg ha 1 at an irrigated fraction of 0 7 at irrigation capacities from 4 to 6 mm d 1 and irrigated fractions of 0 7 0 9 there were only slight yield differences 0 4 0 6 mg ha 1 compared to when the irrigation volume was spread out over the entire pivot area fig 6 s3 tmy1 under normal to above average precipitation tmy2 average yield of the pivot area increased with increasing irrigated fraction for all capacities fig 6 s3 tmy2 nevertheless under a seasonal drought tmy3 and low irrigation capacities 6 mm day 1 127 m3 h 1 irrigating the entire pivot area resulted in yield reductions 0 2 1 8 mg ha 1 compared to irrigating a fraction 0 6 0 9 fig 6 s3 tmy3 at greater irrigation capacities 7 mm day 1 greater yields could largely be attained by irrigating the total pivot area fig 6 s3 tmy3 decreasing the irrigated area by reducing the radius shutting off nozzles within the final three spans s4 had a similar effect on yield response across a range of irrigation capacities fig 6 s4 as did irrigating a fraction of the sectors s3 at all tmy s yields associated with turning nozzles off s4 were greater compared with yields obtained by irrigating the same fraction by omitting sectors s3 at low irrigation capacities 6 mm day 1 fig 7 this is primarily due to the irrigation delay associated with moving the pivot through the unirrigated sectors although not simulated improved yields for s4 may also result due to better distribution from maintaining nozzle pressure in response to declines in well yields later in the season martin et al 2019 3 4 irrigation water productivity response to irrigation strategies irrigation water productivity iwp in terms of maize yield increased with flow capacity under all scenarios and all tmy s fig 8 climatic conditions significantly affected to the range of iwp which was wider for drought years tmy3 0 6 2 5 kg m 3 compared with years with normal tmy1 1 1 2 7 kg m 3 to above average precipitation tm2 2 7 3 3 kg m 3 under scenarios s3 and s4 and under a given tmy the lowest iwp was obtained with the lowest irrigation capacity when irrigating the entire pivot area likewise the greatest iwp was obtained with the greatest capacity when irrigating half the pivot area 3 5 net revenue under irrigation scenarios under long term average climatic conditions tmy1 irrigating the entire pivot area resulted in negative net returns at irrigation capacities 5 mm d 1 fig 9 tmy1 s1 s2 as expected net returns are less under tmy3 with positive net returns obtained only for irrigation capacities 6 mm d 1 fig 9 tmy3 s1 s2 however under tmy2 conditions all the strategies generated positive net returns regardless of the irrigation capacity fig 9 tmy2 s1 s2 irrigating a fraction of the pivot area resulted in greater net returns at capacities 8 mm d 1 for tmy1 and tmy3 under strategy s4 fig 9 response of net returns to irrigated fraction under strategy s3 not shown were similar to s4 but with slightly lower returns at the lowest irrigation capacity with diminishing differences as irrigation capacity increased these differences are largely a result of slightly greater maize yields under strategy s4 fig 7 for tmy2 under strategy s4 greater net returns were also attained by irrigating a fraction of the pivot area at irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 but only when the unirrigated fraction was planted to dryland cotton planting the unirrigated area to cotton resulted in greater net returns under tmy1 and tmy2 in years with a drought during the growing season tmy3 lint yields were insufficient to offset variable costs associated with cotton production at or below the threshold irrigation capacity of 8 mm d 1 under tmy1 there existed an optimal fraction that maximized net returns which declined with decreasing irrigation capacity fig 10 for example at an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 an irrigation fraction of 0 75 optimized net returns under strategy s4 when the unirrigated fraction was managed as fallow corresponding fractions that optimized net returns for s4 with dryland cotton fig 10b and s3 with fallow figs 10c and 10d were 0 7 and 0 74 respectively achievement of greater net returns by concentrating the water is a consequence of lower yields and lower irrigation water productivities fig 8 combined with the high costs of seed and fertilizer 535 to 721 ha 1 and greater variable costs for irrigated 992 versus fallow areas 88 that are incurred when the entire area is irrigated the fraction at which the net returns were optimized depended primarily on the growing season precipitation associated with each tmy and was relatively insensitive to commodity prices and input costs for example increasing the maize price by 50 and fertilizer costs by 100 for strategy s4 with fallow at an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 caused the fraction of the maximum of net returns to shift from 0 74 to 0 84 and 0 67 respectively production risks associated with the irrigated fraction can be visualized by simulating net returns for the 1993 2018 climatic data utilized to develop tmy1 fig 10d the 50 quantile quadratic regression line for this data closely approximates the tmy1 trend quantile levels of 30 and 70 as well as the simulated net returns for the 1993 2018 data unambiguously demonstrate that production risk increases with increasing irrigated fraction maximum irrigation water productivity in terms of net return iwp ha 1 was attained under tmy1 and tmy2 across all irrigation capacities for strategies where half of the pivot area was irrigated for maize production with the other half planted to dryland cotton fig 11 for tmy3 iwp was greater when the unirrigated area was left in fallow in this case irrigating only a fraction of the pivot area resulted in the greatest iwp s for all but the greatest irrigation capacity 12 mm d 1 applying more seasonal irrigation water did not always generate greater economic benefits for example at an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 irrigation of 70 of the pivot area with the remaining area in fallow resulted in the application of 455 mm 50 9 ha 1 seasonal irrigation and generated a net return of 644 ha 1 tmy1 s4 in contrast irrigation of the entire pivot area with an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 resulted in the application of 600 mm 50 9 ha 1 seasonal irrigation and generated a net return of 458 ha 1 greater net revenues with less water volume resulted in considerably greater irrigation water productivities m 3 especially when the unirrigated area was planted to cotton in years with average tmy1 and average to above average tmy2 precipitation fig 11 4 discussion delineating the minimum irrigation capacity for irrigated maize depends on the weather conditions during the growing season yield potential and economic considerations lamm et al 2007 results obtained from our analysis s1 and s2 suggest that with a yield expectation of 13 mg ha 1 200 bu ac 1 an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 would be required for growing season with an average amount of precipitation tmy1 with lower irrigation capacities simulated yield declines rapidly along with irrigation water productivities likewise a return on investment of greater than 7 in an average growing season requires an irrigation capacity 7 mm d 1 this threshold irrigation capacity is similar to that suggested by lamm et al 2007 for northwest kansas maize production they simulated yield and net return for irrigated maize and recommended gross irrigation capacities of at least 6 7 mm d 1 50 exceedance level to achieve positive net returns preseason irrigation of 75 mm that increased profile water content at planting by 37 mm resulted in a modest yield increase of 1 0 mg ha 1 at a capacity of 3 mm d 1 but had little to no influence on grain yield at irrigation capacities greater than or equal to 5 mm d 1 irrigation capacities greater than 5 mm d 1 were sufficient to overcome soil water deficits at the beginning of the growing season when crop water requirements were low and application efficiencies greater these results are similar to those of the study by schlegel et al 2012 in west central kansas that showed increased grain yields of 1 3 mg ha 1 with preseason irrigation at capacities of 2 5 and 3 8 mm d 1 they concluded that preseason irrigation was unnecessary with irrigation capacities of 5 0 mm d 1 or greater with irrigation capacities 8 mm d 1 in a year with average growing season precipitation tmy1 reducing the irrigated area is the most prudent option for optimizing net returns under maize production reducing the area of the irrigated circle by turning off nozzles in the outer spans s4 resulted in greater yields compared with omitting irrigation in sectors of the pivot area s3 this also has the advantage of maintaining system pressure and reducing problems with application uniformity associated with supplying water to all spans under reduced flows martin et al 2019 planting dryland cotton in the unirrigated fraction improved net returns under tmy1 and tmy2 but not for a growing season with a drought tmy3 because greater applications of seasonal irrigation water did not always generate greater economic benefits there is the opportunity for producers to both increase net returns and save water under reduced irrigation capacities by irrigating a fraction of the pivot area evaluations of yield and net revenue response to irrigating a fraction of the land area compared to the entire pivot area at fixed flow capacities are limited in the southern u s great plains klocke et al 2006 introduced a water allocation model for limited irrigation to a range of crops but a detailed analysis of results for irrigated maize was not presented using aquacrop raes et al 2009 to estimate yields over a range of irrigation capacities in southwestern kansas araya et al 2017 inferred that maize yields could be optimized for a sandy clay loam by plating 75 of the area of a typical center pivot system compared to 50 and 100 of the area for irrigation capacities of 3 3 mm d 1 during a dry growing season 182 mm precipitation for a silt loam soil yield optimization at 3 3 mm d 1 was obtained by planting the entire pivot area assuming no seasonal decline in irrigation capacity as did araya et al 2017 our results indicate that yield advantages of planting 50 of the pivot extended to 4 mm d 1 for a growing season with a drought tmy3 100 mm precipitation in an environment with greater et demand for tmy2 growing precipitation 158 yield was maximized at 0 7 0 8 of the area irrigated at a capacity of 3 mm d 1 in this case our yield optimizations that occur at smaller fractions of the pivot area at low capacities compared to that of araya et al 2017 for the silt loam soil reflect the greater seasonal et o in the thp compared to southwestern kansas simulated yield declines in the thp are steeper thereby penalizing the spreading of water we also note that dryland maize production is common in western kansas yet considered unfeasible in the thp foster et al 2015 also modeled effects of maize yield and profitability using aquacrop for the texas high plains amarillo to predict the optimum fraction of an irrigated area over a range of irrigation capacities for irrigation capacities of 3 8 5 7 and 7 6 mm d 1 net returns were optimized at irrigated fractions of 0 32 0 51 and 0 72 in contrast our results indicated net returns are optimized at similar irrigation capacities with greater irrigated fractions e g at 4 and 6 mm d 1 net returns were optimized with irrigated fractions of 0 5 and 0 6 respectively our results show that the transitional point where irrigating the entire pivot area became most profitable occurred at 9 mm d 1 whereas this threshold was determined to occur at 11 4 mm d 1 by foster et al 2015 noting the relative insensitivity of the optimum fraction to maize prices and costs discussed earlier this apparent inconsistency with regards to our study is likely explained by the fact that foster et al 2015 did not consider the timing of irrigation applications to the entire pivot area for example 700 mm of seasonal irrigation to maize was achieved with an irrigation capacity of 5 mm d 1 foster et al 2015 whereas considering the logistics of applying irrigation at this rate our seasonal irrigation was limited to 525 mm we also note that the crop model used by foster et al 2015 was not calibrated for the region clearly the inability of previous modelling assessments at low irrigation capacities to explicitly account for constraints associated with timing of irrigations and moving the pivot through unirrigated sectors under restricted irrigation capacities may result in unreliable predictions of yield and profitability the foregoing analyses assumes that well pumping capacities are limited as a result of aquifer characteristics however in many areas of the high plains aquifer annual well production limits are established by groundwater districts or producer organizations for instance the texas high plains water district high plains water district 2020b limits the total amount of production to 457 mm 18 in per contiguous land area per year this level of production equates to an irrigation capacity of approximately 7 8 mm d 1 in a normal tmy1 year for a pivot contained with a quarter section 65 ha newly permitted wells in the thp for which well production observations are available high plains water district 2020a indicate that 83 had pumping flow rates less than 60 m3 h 1 which is equivalent to an irrigation capacity of approximately 2 8 mm d 1 if water was spread out over 50 9 ha obviously within this groundwater district irrigation capacities greater than 7 mm d 1 are not common because of limited well production relative to the land area available for irrigated cultivation in such cases well production restrictions established by the groundwater district would not influence how water allocation decisions are made to optimize net return using our analysis in cases where the producer has irrigation capacities that exceed limits on pumping set by established rules optimization of maize yield and net returns will need to consider the approach presented by domínguez et al 2012a 2017 or bell et al 2018 in which the volume of water pumped is limited yet proportionately greater volumes of irrigation are applied during the early reproductive phases that are most sensitive to water stress because producers do not have the necessary knowledge of weather conditions and accurate forecasts during the growing season in advance of planting decisions will unavoidably involve risks associated with the fraction of the area that is irrigated irrigating a smaller fraction can result in significant opportunity costs if the year is wetter than average planting a larger area with the expectation for a wetter season can result in significant economic losses when precipitation is below normal our simulated results suggest that under limiting capacities opportunity costs can be minimized and net returns optimized for an average year tmy1 by planting dryland cotton in unirrigated areas in years with seasonal droughts forecasting well before planting time march is necessary for producers to respond with appropriate irrigation practices to mitigate potential losses the proposed method using tmy3 to assess irrigation strategies in conjunction with drought forecasts being implemented by the texas water development board fernando et al 2019 would provide actionable information for producers and also crop insurance

politi et al 2018 is being promoted in other areas of the world as is the case of the supromed project www supromed eu within the mediterranean basin 5 conclusions the mopeco crop model adapted to simulate maize water use and yield under center pivot irrigation in conjunction with the typical meteorological year approach was useful in delineating the optimal irrigation strategies that maximized net return under limited irrigation capacities inclusion of algorithms to schedule irrigation that considered actual constraints associated with moving the pivot through a field resulted in lower but more realistic yields compared with simulations without such restrictions although maize yields for the entire pivot area in an average rainfall year were predicted to be greater than or marginally less 1 mg ha 1 when the entire pivot area was cropped compared to a fraction reducing the irrigated area was the most prudent option for optimizing net returns under maize production when irrigation capacity was limiting 8 mm d 1 greater net returns achieved with concentrating the water was a consequence of greater irrigation water productivities combined with the lower seed and fertilizer costs resulting from reduced maize cropped land area greater applications of seasonal irrigation water did not always generate greater net returns and therefore there is an opportunity to both increase net returns and save water by irrigating a fraction of the pivot area with the crop production revenue and variable costs used in this study at an irrigation capacity of 3 mm d 1 net returns were on average negative even when only half the pivot area was planted to maize at irrigation capacities from 4 to 5 mm d 1 net returns were optimized when approximately half the pivot area was irrigated for an irrigation capacity of 7 mm d 1 typical of the thp net returns were optimized when approximately 75 of the pivot area was irrigated planting cotton in the unirrigated portion increased net returns except in years with a seasonal drought tmy3 the optimal irrigated fraction that maximized net returns depended principally on growing season precipitation and was relatively insensitive to maize prices and input costs because of the potentially large economic losses under maize production that occur in years with seasonal drought accurate climatic forecasting would be indispensable in

irrigation water delivery conventionally allocating and scheduling canal water were conducted in irrigation districts of china based mostly on canal flow capacities and constraints without considering soil moisture conditions and crop water demand at the field as a result water delivery was not optimized in terms of matching the timing and amount of the crop water demand which leads to large irrigation water loss and low irrigation wue at the irrigation district level optimizing water allocation and scheduling in an irrigation canal system is crucial for improving iwp from the irrigation district management perspective and maximizing the benefit from the irrigated land in a district especially for areas with limited water resources previous studies have largely focused on optimizing canal water delivery scheduling among different outlets with the constraints of canal system capacities among those models the objective or objectives set up in the models for the optimization varied reddy et al 1999 developed an irrigation scheduling optimization model between canal outlets with minimizing the difference between the required and actual capacity of the secondary canals during the given rotation period as the objective in another study minimizing the variation in the flow rate between canals and maximizing the number of canals that could be delivered at the requested time were set as the objectives to improve water delivery efficiency nixon et al 2001 meanwhile there have been many studies on optimizing irrigation scheduling at field scale and those optimization models

added into the objective function in the model kanooni and monem 2014 optimized water allocation in irrigation canals using integrated stepwise approach i e optimization at both farm and canal levels at the farm level water allocations among crops and among different growing seasons for each crop were both optimized while water delivery scheduling among outlets was optimized at the canal level in practice the time to start irrigation is often decided based on soil water status i e irrigation is applied when soil water content swc or potential reaches some threshold value until present the optimal irrigation time is often not explicitly addressed in many canal delivery optimization models and soil water status is mainly considered as a constraint in those models without being directly linked to the irrigation time the optimal water delivery schedule obtained from those models might not be practical in some cases especially for irrigation districts in china where most command areas are managed individually by different households in the study an irrigation scheduling optimization model with an objective of timely satisfying crop water demand based on field water dynamics has been proposed specifically minimizing the difference between the time of water delivery and target irrigation time and minimizing the difference between actual water discharge and designed water discharge were set as objectives in the optimization model optimal water delivery scheduling for secondary canals was obtained for the entire growing season and the performance of the optimized water delivery results was compared with the conventional approach in terms of wue total production and iwp for the command area of the canal system 2 model formulation the proposed optimization model was set to minimize the gap between the scheduled irrigation time with the target irrigation time while maintaining the flow stability and satisfying the canal capacity constraints as much as possible there are three major components of the model including the optimization with multiple objectives soil water modeling and a wp function the results from soil water modeling were used to determine the target irrigation time for each of the secondary canals while the wp function was to evaluate the performance of the different canal irrigation scheduling scenarios the model was applied under both sufficient and insufficient water conditions i e main canal discharge at 100 and 70 capacity respectively 2 1 canal irrigation scheduling optimization model the objective function is expressed as follows 1 min z p 1 j 1 n it j it j p 2 1 t 1 t 1 t q t u q t 2 p 3 s where j is the secondary canal number n is the total number of the secondary canals it j and it j are the target and actual

for setting the range of the flow rate for the main canal 0 6 and 1 2 respectively in the study 2 2 genetic algorithm in the study the genetic algorithm with an integer coding scheme was employed to solve the optimization problem the decision variables were the irrigation starting time and the irrigation duration for each secondary canal therefore the chromosome was composed by an array of 2 n integers indicating the irrigation starting time and the duration of the irrigation for all secondary canals an example of the chromosome for a network with six secondary canals is shown in fig 1 to a relatively larger irrigation district without an automatic control system switching water delivery from one canal to another requires some time and could not be done within minutes additionally a too short interval between switching could cause drastic changes in main canal discharge rate which should be avoided for the system consequently a relatively longer time step of 12 h was used in the study a starting time of 5 indicated that the irrigation in that canal would begin on the start the third day the unit for the irrigation duration was h thus the duration of 5 indicated that the irrigation would last for 5 h the coding scheme allows a relatively simple and easy way for mutation and cross over and also to be extended to larger canal networks the fitness function was set up to account for the objective function eq 1 with a penalty function applied to take into account the constraint on the maximum canal capacity and was expressed as 12 f fit 1 p 1 t p 2 f σ q p where f fit is the fitness function σ is penalty coefficient for the flow constraint q p is flow constraint for main canal when water flow exceeds the allowable maximum flow or is less than the minimum allowable flow in any period the penalty term σ q p would be infinite so that f fit was close to zero flow constraint was expressed as 13 q p γ d q u q t u q t u γ d q u q t u γ u q u q t u γ u q u 0 otherwise the chromosomes were selected based on their fitness values and a chromosome with the higher fitness value has a higher probability of being selected in this study roulette wheel selection technique

one point mutation were used for crossover and mutation respectively optimization was terminated when iteration reached 200 times 2 3 soil water modeling in the study the target irrigation time was

without water stress kg ha 1 et ai and et ci are the actual and potential evapotranspiration during i th growing period respectively mm d 1 3 model application the model was applied to a two level canal system located at zhangye gansu of northwest china there are 11 secondary canals for the main canal and the properties of each canal are shown in table 1 due to the insufficient water inflow the secondary canals are rotated conventionally the irrigation scheduling for the canal system is made following the principle that the canal furthest from the delivery point of the main canal is irrigated first and the discharge rate of the main canal is kept as stable as possible there were five irrigation events scheduled during the entire growing period of corn and fig 2 shows the irrigation schedule for the 11 secondary canals according to the conventional water delivery schedule the canal rotation was the same for each of the five irrigation events for each irrigation event water was applied at a rate of 1050 m3 ha 1 and the total irrigation water was 8 61 e 06 m3 for the system the discharge rate of the main canal and irrigation schedule of the secondary canals during one irrigation event is shown in fig 3 overall the discharge rate of the main canal was kept stable during the first 6 days of the whole irrigation duration and declined sharply during the later period with the reduction percentage more than 50 during the last day of irrigation soil properties including parameters in the water loss equation soil fc and pwp were set to be the same for all canals specifically fc and pwp were 0 216 and 0 07 cm3 cm 3 respectively and parameters of a and m in eq 5 were 1 9 and 0 4 respectively initial swc was randomly generated from the normal distribution with mean value of 0 193 cm3 cm 3 and standard deviation of 0 02 cm3 cm 3 all command area was assumed growing seed corn with a total growing period of 156 days and crop parameters are shown in table 2 the soil water threshold that triggered irrigation was set as 0 6 fc for all canals to compared the performance of the optimized with the conventional scheduling wue total et total delivered water and iwp were calculated for the sufficient and insufficient water supply conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimized irrigation schedule with full capacity the optimized irrigation schedule for the 11 secondary canals when water was not limited is shown in fig 4 relative to conventional water delivery irrigation frequency for the model increased from 5 to 9 times during the entire growing period with the optimization irrigation volume varied between each irrigation event ranging from 287 to 779 m3 ha 1 the irrigation duration was also varied from 3 to 8 days for the 9 irrigation events which was shorter than the duration of the conventional approach fig 5 shows the main canal discharge rate and irrigation time of the secondary canals during one of nine irrigation events the irrigation event was selected as the total discharge of the irrigation was close to the one of the conventional approach and the change of the discharge rate during the irrigation was a typical one among the 9 irrigations the discharge rate from the optimized schedule was fairly stable over the entire duration with the largest difference of the discharge rate being less than 0 8 m3 s 1 compared to more than 1 5 m3 s 1 for the conventional approach the irrigation schedule for the secondary canals was quite different between the optimization and conventional approach fig 3 vs fig 5 as the decision on whether and when to irrigate was made based on different principles for the conventional approach the further canals were irrigated first thus secondary canal 10 and 11 were always irrigated during the start of an irrigation event regardless of soil water condition of the command area of the canals for the optimization model irrigation was applied when the swc reached a threshold value thus canals rotation was different between irrigation events for this specific event canals 4 7 and 10 were scheduled during the start of the water delivery to evaluate the performance of the two irrigation scheduling systems the change of swc and crop water consumption water loss during the growing period and the total yield were compared between the two systems fig 6 shows the evolution of swc during the growing season for the conventional and optimized water delivery schedule for the optimized schedule swc was kept between 0 6 and 1 0 fc for 90 of the whole growing period and when out of the range it was only slightly lower than 0 6 fc noticeably swc was lower during the latest period for the optimized model as irrigation was not applied during the later mature stage regardless of field soil water status considering that irrigation during the time would not have much impact on yield for the conventional approach the percentage of swc within the range of 0 6 1 fc was 54 over the entire growing period and swc reached lower than pwp on occasions accordingly crop water consumption for the optimized schedule was larger than that of the conventional approach especially during the heading to grain filling period fig 7 over the whole growing season total water consumption was about 410 mm 75 of et0 compared to 300 mm 55 of et0 of the conventional approach indicating that the optimized irrigation schedule could better satisfy crop water demand with a similar amount of irrigation water with the optimization approach total irrigation volume was reduced to 8 93e 06 m3 from 9 31e 06 m3 of the conventional approach while the total water loss was 2 18e 06 m3 and 3 43e 06 m3 for the optimization and conventional approaches respectively in the study water loss was estimated as the sum of water delivery loss eqs 3 4 and deep percolation loss for both scheduling approaches deep percolation loss was the dominant component in the total water loss more than twice the amount of water delivery loss for the optimization and three times for the conventional approach the relatively larger water percolation loss was largely attributed to the approach used to estimate the loss in the study deep percolation loss of each irrigation event was calculated as the amount of irrigation water after swc in the root zone reached fc therefore the conventional approach resulted in much higher water percolation loss as the root depth was shallower and water demand was less during the earlier growing period nevertheless the same amount of irrigation water was applied as the later growing period for the optimization model percolation occurred when the target irrigation time was not always satisfied for each secondary canal when irrigation was applied earlier than the target irrigation time swc prior to the irrigation was higher than the threshold value to trigger irrigation thus the prescribed irrigation volume would exceed the one for swc in the root zone reaching fc the time unit 12 h used in the study also contributed to the larger water loss as more irrigation water was applied when irrigation duration was not the exact multiple of 12 h the optimized irrigation scheduling led to larger et and less water loss thus larger wue than conventional approach 0 76 vs 0 63 with similar water consumption the optimized irrigation scheduling led to higher corn production with the total production of 1 21e 07 kg compared to 1 02e 07 kg over the total command areas for the conventional approach as a result the overall iwp was 1 36 and 1 10 kg m 3 for the optimized and conventional irrigation scheduling respectively 4 2 optimized irrigation schedule with 70 capacity to evaluate the applicability of the optimization model under different conditions we also applied the model under insufficient water supply conditions for conditions under the conventional approach water discharge and irrigation water amount were simply reduced to 70 of the value at full capacity therefore there was no change in canal rotation during an irrigation event similar to the result at the full capacity water discharge of the main canal was stable during the first six days of an irrigation event then became sharply lower at the later period for the optimized approach the threshold to trigger irrigation was changed to 0 42 fc to accommodate the reduced water capacity under insufficient water supply in addition to reducing water discharge to 70 canal capacity accordingly the swc to terminate irrigation was adjusted to 0 7 fc the difference in the results of irrigation frequency discharge stability crop water consumption water loss percentage and wp between the optimized and conventional approaches under the reduced capacity condition was similar to those under full capacity fig 8 shows the optimized irrigation schedule for the 11 secondary canals with 70 capacity irrigation frequency from the optimized scheduling was 9 times under the reduced capacity which is the same as the optimized result under the full capacity meanwhile irrigation amount varied among irrigation events ranging from 215 to 600 m3 ha 1 and the irrigation duration was shortened in accordance with the reduced canal capacity relative to the full capacity condition the change of main canal discharge rate and the rotation of the secondary canals during an irrigation event was found similar between the full and reduced capacity conditions fig 9 the discharge rate from the optimized schedule was fairly stable with smaller variability than the conventional approach fig 10 shows the evolution of swc during the growing season for the conventional and optimized scheduling under insufficient water supply condition for the optimized schedule swc was kept between 0 6 and 1 0 fc for 27 of the whole growing period while for the conventional approach the percentage was 16 soil water content was in the range of 0 42 0 7 fc within 80 of the growth period for the optimized schedule while only within half time was swc in that range under convention schedule fig 11 shows the comparison of water consumption for the optimized and conventional approach under insufficient water supply condition with the optimized scheduling crop water consumption was consistently larger than that for the conventional approach for each growth period especially during heading to grain filling period during the whole growing period total water consumption for the optimized approach was about 300 mm i e 55 of et0 about 12 larger than that for the conventional approach the total irrigation volume under the reduced capacity was similar between the optimized and conventional scheduling while the loss for the optimized scheduling was 20 less than that of the conventional approach as a result the optimized schedule led to larger wue 0 75 vs 0 68 greater production for the command area 8 73e 06 kg vs 6 53e 06 kg and higher iwp 1 46 vs 1 00 kg m 3 5 conclusions attempting to obtain the optimal canal delivery and irrigation scheduling for irrigation districts an optimization model with minimizing the difference in time between water delivery

otherwise where q t j is water flow rate for the inlet of the j th secondary canal s j is the start time of the j th downstream canal water distribution d j is the duration of the j th downstream

for setting the range of the flow rate for the main canal 0 6 and 1 2 respectively in the study 2 2 genetic algorithm in the study the genetic algorithm with an integer coding scheme was employed to solve the optimization problem the decision variables were the irrigation starting time and the irrigation duration for each secondary canal therefore the chromosome was composed by an array of 2 n integers indicating the irrigation starting time and the duration of the irrigation for all secondary canals an example of the chromosome for a network with six secondary canals is shown in fig 1 to a relatively larger irrigation district without an automatic control system switching water delivery from one canal to another requires some time and could not be done within minutes additionally a too short interval between switching could cause drastic changes in main canal discharge rate which should be avoided for the system consequently a relatively longer time step of 12 h was used in the study a starting time of 5 indicated that the irrigation in that canal would begin on the start the third day the unit for the irrigation duration was h thus the duration of 5 indicated that the irrigation would last for 5 h the coding scheme allows a relatively simple and easy way for mutation and cross over and also to be extended to larger canal networks the fitness function was set up to account for the objective function eq 1 with a penalty function applied to take into account the constraint on the maximum canal capacity and was expressed as 12 f fit 1 p 1 t p 2 f σ q p where f fit is the fitness function σ is penalty coefficient for the flow constraint q p is flow constraint for main canal when water flow exceeds the allowable maximum flow or is less than the minimum allowable flow in any period the penalty term σ q p would be infinite so that f fit was close to zero flow constraint was expressed as 13 q p γ d q u q t u q t u γ d q u q t u γ u q u q t u γ u q u 0 otherwise the chromosomes were selected based on their fitness values and a chromosome with the higher fitness value has a higher probability of being selected in this study roulette wheel selection technique was used to select the best parents with the selection technique the probability of a chromosome being selected as a parent is proportional to its fitness value simple two point crossover and random one point mutation were used for crossover and mutation respectively optimization was terminated when iteration reached 200 times 2 3 soil water modeling in the study the target irrigation time was determined based on soil water modeling for the commend area of each secondary canal soil water content was obtained from the water budget equation 14 θ j t 1 θ j t ir j t p j t k j t et a j t dp j t

canal system located at zhangye gansu of northwest china there are 11 secondary canals for the main canal and the properties of each canal are shown in table 1 due to the insufficient water inflow the secondary canals are rotated conventionally the irrigation scheduling for the canal system is made following the principle that the canal furthest from the delivery point of the main canal is irrigated first and the discharge rate of the main canal is kept as stable as possible there were five irrigation events scheduled during the entire growing period of corn and fig 2 shows the irrigation schedule for the 11 secondary canals according to the conventional water delivery schedule the canal rotation was the same for each of the five irrigation events for each irrigation event water was applied at a rate of 1050 m3 ha 1 and the total irrigation water was 8 61 e 06 m3 for the system the discharge rate of the main canal and irrigation schedule of the secondary canals during one irrigation event is shown in fig 3 overall the discharge rate of the main canal was kept stable during the first 6 days of the whole irrigation duration and declined sharply during the later period with the reduction percentage more than 50 during the last day of irrigation soil properties including parameters in the water loss equation soil fc and pwp were set to be the same for all canals specifically fc and pwp were 0 216 and 0 07 cm3 cm 3 respectively and parameters of a and m in eq 5 were 1 9 and 0 4 respectively initial swc was randomly generated from the normal distribution with mean value of 0 193 cm3 cm 3 and standard deviation of 0 02 cm3 cm 3 all command area was assumed growing seed corn with a total growing period of 156 days and crop parameters are shown in table 2 the soil water threshold that triggered irrigation was set as 0 6 fc for all canals to compared the performance of the optimized with the conventional scheduling wue total et total delivered water and iwp were calculated for the sufficient and insufficient water supply conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimized irrigation schedule with full capacity the optimized irrigation schedule for the 11 secondary canals when water was not limited is shown in fig 4 relative to conventional water delivery irrigation frequency for the model increased from 5 to 9 times during the entire growing period with the optimization irrigation volume varied between each irrigation event ranging from 287 to 779 m3 ha 1 the irrigation duration was also varied from 3 to 8 days for the 9 irrigation events which was shorter than the duration of the conventional approach fig 5 shows the main canal discharge rate and irrigation time of the secondary canals during one of nine irrigation events the irrigation event was selected as the total discharge of the irrigation was close to the one of the conventional approach and the change of the discharge rate during the irrigation was a typical one among the 9 irrigations the discharge rate from the optimized schedule was fairly stable over the entire duration with the largest difference of the discharge rate being less than 0 8 m3 s 1 compared to more than 1 5 m3 s 1 for the conventional approach the irrigation schedule for the secondary canals was quite different between the optimization and conventional approach fig 3 vs fig 5 as the decision on whether and when to irrigate was made based on different principles for the conventional approach the further canals were irrigated first thus secondary canal 10 and 11 were always irrigated during the start of an irrigation event regardless of soil water condition of the command area of the canals for the optimization model irrigation was applied when the swc reached a threshold value thus canals rotation was different between irrigation events for this specific event canals 4 7 and 10 were scheduled during the start of the water delivery to evaluate the performance of the two irrigation scheduling systems the change of swc and crop water consumption water loss during the growing period and the total yield were compared between the two systems fig 6 shows the evolution of swc during the growing season for the conventional and optimized water delivery schedule for the optimized schedule swc was kept between 0 6 and 1 0 fc for 90 of the whole growing period and when out of the range it was only slightly lower than 0 6 fc noticeably swc was lower during the latest period for the optimized model as irrigation was not applied during the later mature stage regardless of field soil water status considering that irrigation during the time would not have much impact on yield for the conventional approach the percentage of swc within the range of 0 6 1 fc was 54 over the entire growing period and swc reached lower than pwp on occasions accordingly crop water consumption for the optimized schedule was larger than that of the conventional approach especially during the heading to grain filling period fig 7 over the whole growing season total water consumption was about 410 mm 75 of et0 compared to 300 mm 55 of et0 of the conventional approach indicating that the optimized irrigation schedule could better satisfy crop water demand with a similar amount of irrigation water with the optimization approach total irrigation volume was reduced to 8 93e 06 m3 from 9 31e 06 m3 of the conventional approach while the total water loss was 2 18e 06 m3 and 3 43e 06 m3 for the optimization and conventional approaches respectively in the study water loss was estimated as the sum of water delivery loss eqs 3 4 and deep percolation loss for both scheduling approaches deep percolation loss was the dominant component in the total water loss more than twice the amount of water delivery loss for the optimization and three times for the conventional approach the relatively larger water percolation loss was largely attributed to the approach used to estimate the loss in the study deep percolation loss of each irrigation event was calculated as the amount of irrigation water after swc in the root zone reached fc therefore the conventional approach resulted in much higher water percolation loss as the root depth was shallower and water demand was less during the earlier growing period nevertheless the same amount of irrigation water was applied as the later growing period for the optimization model percolation occurred when the target irrigation time was not always satisfied for each secondary canal when irrigation was applied earlier than the target irrigation time swc prior to the irrigation was higher than the threshold value to trigger irrigation thus the prescribed irrigation volume would exceed the one for swc in the root zone reaching fc the time unit 12 h used in the study also contributed to the larger water loss as more irrigation water was applied when irrigation duration was not the exact multiple of 12 h the optimized irrigation scheduling led to larger et and less water loss thus larger wue than conventional approach 0 76 vs 0 63 with similar water consumption the optimized irrigation scheduling led to higher corn production with the total production of 1 21e 07 kg compared to 1 02e 07 kg over the total command areas for the conventional approach as a result the overall iwp was 1 36 and 1 10 kg m 3 for the optimized and conventional irrigation scheduling respectively 4 2 optimized irrigation schedule with 70 capacity to evaluate the applicability of the optimization model under different conditions we also applied the model under insufficient water supply conditions for conditions under the conventional approach water discharge and irrigation water amount were simply reduced to 70 of the value at full capacity therefore there was no change in canal rotation during an irrigation event similar to the result at the full capacity water discharge of the main canal was stable during the first six days of an irrigation event then became sharply lower at the later period for the optimized approach the threshold to trigger irrigation was changed to 0 42 fc to accommodate the reduced water capacity under insufficient water supply in addition to reducing water discharge to 70 canal capacity accordingly the swc to terminate irrigation was adjusted to 0 7 fc the difference in the results of irrigation frequency discharge stability crop water consumption water loss percentage and wp between the optimized and conventional approaches under the reduced capacity condition was similar to those under full capacity fig 8 shows the optimized irrigation schedule for the 11 secondary canals with 70 capacity irrigation frequency from the optimized scheduling was 9 times under the reduced capacity which is the same as the optimized result under the full capacity meanwhile irrigation amount varied among irrigation events ranging from 215 to 600 m3 ha 1 and the irrigation duration was shortened in accordance with the reduced canal capacity relative to the full capacity condition the change of main canal discharge rate and the rotation of the secondary canals during an irrigation event was found similar between the full and reduced capacity conditions fig 9 the discharge rate from the optimized schedule was fairly stable with smaller variability than the conventional approach fig 10 shows the evolution of swc during the growing season for the conventional and optimized scheduling under insufficient water supply condition for the optimized schedule swc was kept between 0 6 and 1 0 fc for 27 of the whole growing period while for the conventional approach the percentage was 16 soil water content was in the range of 0 42 0 7 fc within 80 of the growth period for the optimized schedule while only within half time was swc in that range under convention schedule fig 11 shows the comparison of water consumption for the optimized and conventional approach under insufficient water supply condition with the optimized scheduling crop water consumption was consistently larger than that for the conventional approach for each growth period especially during heading to grain filling period during the whole growing period total water consumption for the optimized approach was about 300 mm i e 55 of et0 about 12 larger than that for the conventional approach the total irrigation volume under the reduced capacity was similar between the optimized and conventional scheduling while the loss for the optimized scheduling was 20 less than that of the conventional approach as a result the optimized schedule led to larger wue 0 75 vs 0 68 greater production for the command area 8 73e 06 kg vs 6 53e 06 kg and higher iwp 1 46 vs 1 00 kg m 3 5 conclusions attempting to obtain the optimal canal delivery and irrigation scheduling for irrigation districts an optimization model with minimizing the difference in time between water delivery
