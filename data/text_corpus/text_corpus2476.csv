12380,capture zone delineation has been in practice for decades as a part of groundwater management and wellhead protection schemes the energy possessed by a groundwater particle gets continuously dissipated as it traverses along its path and is the work done by it the study of energies within any domain probes into the innate nature of the system and its interaction with the surroundings hence energy computations in and around the realms of extraction wells can be used to analyze capture zones from the energy concept there has been very little research reported on the energy of groundwater flow and specifically that associated with the well capture zones this work intends to model two dimensional homogeneous isotropic confined aquifers using finite volume method then delineate the capture zones and examine the energies within steady state aquifer conditions will cause all the work done at the boundaries converted into frictional dissipation this frictional dissipation was found significant over regions of 95 capture surrounding the well within the capture zone graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater management capture zone wellhead protection frictional dissipation 1 introduction the increased attention towards the safeguarding of the quality and quantity of the available groundwater reserves has provided new impetuses for developing various groundwater management strategies groundwater protection zones wellhead protection programs and similar schemes strive towards the accomplishment of this goal and calls for capture zone delineation capture zone refers to the three dimensional region that contributes the groundwater extracted by one or more wells or drains u s epa 2008 in other words a capture zone is a volume through which groundwater flows to a pumping well over a given time this very idea of volumetric capture using graph theory is seen in flowsource modflow based software tool that delineates steady state and quasi steady state capture zones chowdhury 2016 although considerable research has been devoted to capture zone analysis following the early work of muskat 1946 only a few studies have been carried out on the energy concepts in porous media after hubbert 1940 whatever the internal geological structure may be the minimum dissipation theorem asserts that the patterns of flow speed and direction are those which minimize the overall energy dissipation rate phillips 2003 energy is preserved during any and every process following the first law of thermodynamics energy is a relative quantity representing the transformation

lower elevations of the water table than their previous methods there are many methods for delineating well capture zones ranging from very simple to very complex early models for capture zone

haitjema 2012 de smedt 2014 and samani and zarei doudeji 2015 the analytical equations for capture zones were also utilized to estimate transmissivity and hence for hydraulic conductivity calculations galvão et al 2017 the approach that has now become both standard and popular is to apply a flow model to solve the steady state flow field and then do backward particle tracking likely the most adopted particle tracking method is the semianalytical approach developed by pollock 1988 and used in particle tracking codes such as modpath frind et al 2002 pollock 2012 rayne et al 2013 okkonen and neupauer 2016 despite the advancements data uncertainty and scarcity often produce predictive uncertainty in capture zones hence considerable research has been devoted to quantifying uncertainty in groundwater models esling et al 2008 okkonen and neupauer 2016 applied the maximum chemical concentration to develop a new delineation methodology as opposed to the existing ones employing travel times of water or solute the examination of capture zones from any other viewpoint would contribute to the technical knowledge and development karney and seneviratne 1991 utilized the energy concept and developed an energy equation to analyze the dynamic behavior of aquifers the equation summarizes various energy transformations in a saturated one dimensional confined aquifer as frictional dissipation and change in the internal energy it helps categorize the system into steady quasi steady and transient depending on the relative magnitudes of the different energy components furthermore the energy terms spatially integrate the response of any region within the domain and facilitate their classification into zones of different transformations this helps to delineate the subdomains that are still undergoing transient conditions despite reaching the global steady state condition if the energy spent on the control system is only against overcoming frictional resistance then the compressibility associated with the confined aquifer can comfortably be ignored by assuming the groundwater system to have reached the pseudo steady state condition steady state condition helps to characterize the aquifer domain holistically as opposed to the transient condition wherein the system keeps changing a pseudo steady state equivalent of the transient aquifer will thus help forecast the process and aid in better groundwater management decisions application to the steady state systems yielded sub zones with different energy dissipation and accordingly the regions with high flow work that contributes significantly to the well within the capture zone the focus of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of energy concept in analyzing capture zones 2 methodology the accuracy and credibility of delineated capture zones depend upon the groundwater flow model the use of finite volume scheme presents two major advantages over the commonly used finite difference methods it ensures that the underlying laws of physics at all levels of discretization are maintained and handles a variety of mesh geometries assumptions have been made to simplify the groundwater flow equation and apply the energy equation to simple hydrogeological environments aquifers that respond very slow or very rapidly can be simulated using a steady state model or a series of steady state models with acceptable accuracy haitjema 2006 the list of assumptions considered in the present model is presented below the aquifer is homogeneous isotropic steady state flow conditions prevail the confined aquifer has a uniform transmissivity and no leakage rainfall infiltration or other vertical recharge dupuit s assumption of negligible vertical gradients is valid the well is fully penetrating with 100 efficiency and pumps at a constant rate considering the above assumptions the simplified governing groundwater flow equation can be written as given in eq 1 anderson et al 2015 1 x t x h x y t y h y r in eq 1 h is the hydraulic head in meter t is the transmissivity in square meter per day and r is the volumetric flux in cubic meter per day per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water eq 1 was solved using the finite volume fv and discretized as given by eq 2 patankar 1980 the control volume and the notations used are shown in fig 1 2 t e h e h p δ x e t w h p h w δ x w δ y t

h s b where a e a w a n a s a p the simplest numerical scheme of first order upwind is used for discretization as seen in eq 2 thereafter the finite volume mesh was converted into a graph and delineated the capture zones by computing the volume contribution of all cells to the sink cell a directed graph allows the groundwater flow path information to be represented in terms of the actual topology of the flow field chowdhury 2016 where each mesh cell is represented as a node and the intercell flows as edges this aids in visualization of the incoming and outgoing entities at the nodes such as velocity and also ease the calculations energy can travel across the boundaries of a system increasing or decreasing the total system energy the energy dissipation within the capture zones marks the boundary of the region contributing water to the extraction well the one dimensional energy equation developed by karney and seneviratne 1991 had been extended to two dimensions for the steady state condition and used for the analyses eqs 4 and 5 represents the original one dimensional and the rewritten two dimensional energy equations 4 x 0 x l ρ g v x 2 k x d x 1 2 x 0 x l α n β ρ

transformations in a saturated one dimensional constant thick confined aquifer and each term has dimensions of joules per second the first and second terms on the left hand side of the equation represent the frictional dissipation and the change in internal energy and the right hand side term equals the work done at the domain boundaries in the steady state case there are no time dependency and the discharge through the well is solely contributed by the inflow from the capture zones which serves as the recharge source thus the only term contributing to the work done w would be the frictional dissipation the eq 5 can be rewritten 6 0 x 0 y ρ g v x 2 k x v y 2 k y d x d y w the work done was computed using the above equation over the entire domain and analyzed the energy dissipation within and across the capture zone the methodology is shown in the flowchart fig 2 all the calculations were coded using python programming language the developed fvm capture zone delineation model was applied to a simple three dimensional 3d confined aquifer domain as shown in fig 3 hydraulic boundaries influence the model results in all aspects and therefore needs to be carefully defined the three dimensional conceptual model was translated to a two dimensional 2d equivalent by applying the assumptions the well pumps only from the confined aquifer and all the four sides of the domain were assigned to a constant head boundary all the four sides of the two dimensional domain were assigned to equal constant head boundary so that there was no regional velocity this flow situation was chosen for the first investigative step so that the capture zone and the cone of depression were same as their deviation is due to the impact of regional hydraulic gradients u s epa 2008 this flow model designated as case 1 represented the simplest aquifer geology consisting of a single extraction well and constant head of 10m on all sides of the model domain fig 4 a a flow condition with background velocity was also hypothesized assuming the constant head at the south boundary higher from that of the north and east west boundaries as no flow case 2 fig 4 b conventional flow modeling provides piezometric head distribution within the domain using the flow or hydraulic head boundaries this head information serves the input to the energy computations and yields the energy boundaries that mark the extents of subzones with different energy dissipation within the whole domain this helps to delineate regions based on the intensity of frictional dissipation and thereby areas of significant contribution the resulting energy boundaries will provide different results with more information over the conventional capture zone analyses 3 results and discussions 3 1 verification of the flow model verification of the fv flow model was done comparing the head distribution with that computed using the theim equation the theim equation is wang and anderson 1982 7 h r h r q 2 π t ln r r where r x 2 y 2 r is the radius of influence and h r 10m the numerical parameters for simulating results were assumed and listed in table 1 there is a good agreement between the two solutions fig 5 a the drawdown was assumed to extend to a radial distance of 1000m hence the static level remains unaffected for distances greater than 1000m from the well wang and anderson 1982 the heads were validated with the steady state pumping test data reported by altunkaynak 2007 table 1 lists the numerical parameters for validation again the results present a good match fig 5 b the flow equation was solved and obtained the corresponding head values using gauss seidel iterative scheme the scarborough criterion a sufficient condition for a system of linear equations to be stable and converge to a solution moukalled et al 2016 was ensured scarborough criterion a e a w a n a s a p 1 for all grid points if the differencing scheme produces coefficients that satisfy the above criterion the resulting matrix of coefficients is diagonally dominant diagonal dominance is a desirable feature for satisfying the boundedness criterion versteeg and malalasekera 2007 an under relaxation factor of 0 8 was adopted as it is reported to increase the stability of the numerical results but at the cost of slow convergence moukalled et al 2016 hence the under relaxation factor together with the scarborough criterion ensures the stability of the iteration process 3 2 numerical model the fv mesh of the flow model was transformed to an equivalent graph the numerical parameters in the present model were assumed and are listed in table 2 head information was translated to the graph nodes and flows were calculated using darcy s law the capture zone was delineated by computing capture fraction the term defined and utilized in modall potter et al 2008 to indicate the certainty or strength of capture in various areas modall uses modflow calculated cell by cell flows for calculating capture fraction the intensity of capture within the capture zone quantifies the relative capture to the well in this work the intercell flows were calculated from the graph and computed the capture fractions case 1 refers to the flow condition where there is no background velocity in the real field this corresponds to a remarkably flat hydraulic head gradient the capture zone and cone of depression are equal and hence head contours were used for comparison eq 6 was solved and computed the energies across the domain the cone of depression extends to touch the boundaries for the given extraction rate fig 6 a which was the case assumed therefore the model boundaries correspond to high values of capture fraction from 0 87 to 0 93 fig 6 b a region of 95 capture to the pumping well is outlined by a black circle in the cf plot and was found equal to the area encompassing drawdowns as high as 0 5m in the head contour plot fig 6 a fig 6 b figures fig 6 c and fig 7 c corresponding to the work done shows the frictional dissipation of the groundwater system over the model domain since the frictional term depends on the square of the velocity the energy dissipation is the maximum in the well vicinity and decreases as the distance from the well increases although high energies concentrated in the well neighborhood the maximum proportion of the computed values falls far below this range the energies corresponding to 95 of the computed statistics were chosen to be the cutoff value for plotting energy computations the head contours capture zone and the work done by groundwater flow for the case 1 are as shown in fig 6 the black circle in the cf and work done plots are of the same radius and correspond to 0 95 capture fraction in the former and major work done in the latter results indicated that the maximum energy dissipation was confined within 95 capture within the capture zone in other words the geometry of significant capture zone outlined the limits of major work done across the domain similar results were obtained for case 2 flow condition reverse particle tracking in modpath tracks particles backward from a supply well to contributing areas pollock 2012 and the capture zone is defined by a bounding pathline within which all other pathlines gets originated from the well hence the results were compared to the pathlines obtained from modpath as the ensemble of pathlines defines the capture zone of the well a good agreement can be seen among the modpath and capture fraction plots fig 7 fig 7 also compares the work done across the flow domain for the case 2 with the capture fraction plot the velocities upstream to the well is high and decreases to the downstream side for the case 2 with the background velocity therefore the distribution obtained for the work done plot is different compared to that from case 1 the white line in the work done plot when overlaid onto the cf plot gives a capture fraction of 0 95 again it was confirmed that the frictional dissipation concentrated within the region corresponding to 95 capture the work done plot also revealed the position of the stagnation point downstream of the well marked with the lowest energy value the difference of velocities due to pumping and natural flow yield the zero velocity at the stagnation point in steady state the work done at the boundaries would be equal to the frictional dissipation which is the result of excess outflow over inflow or vice versa in both the discussed cases the frictional dissipation is significant over regions of 95 capture within the capture zone in nutshell the significant inflow to the well was from an area of 95 capture hence the major contributing area to the well was only 95 capture region within the capture zone 4 conclusions application of energy equation to steady state systems yielded sub zones with different energy dissipation and accordingly the regions with high flow work that contributes significantly to the well within the entire capture zone the results show that the maximum energy dissipation is concentrated in the region of 95 capture within the capture zones and serves as the major area contributing to the well the steady state represents the final post pumping aquifer condition in equilibrium which might rarely be the prevailing condition in the real field whereas the energy transformations in the transient condition will give the relative dominance of dissipation over the change in internal energy within the aquifer domain over time the integration of energy into capture zone analysis will provide information of the areal extents with different energy partitioning and hence identify subdomains that are still undergoing transient conditions despite reaching the global steady state condition this will aid in understanding the capture zones in a new light hence the authors are currently applying the methodology to study transient conditions

steady state condition this will aid in understanding the capture zones in a new light hence the authors are currently applying the methodology to study transient conditions

in nature after adsorption all the pores sites are occupied by metal ions are shown in fig 1 a b the weight element present in lac was analyzed by edax the wt composition of carbon oxygen potassium phosphorous and copper are shown in table 1 and fig 2 a b the spectra of ftir for lac loaded and unloaded are shown in fig 3 the peak at 3748cm 1 assigned to minerals oh groups the peak at 1580cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching of c c bonds of aromatic rings the shift in the peak from 1069cm 1 to 1061cm 1 corresponds to c o groups the peak at 875cm 1 correspond to aromatic ch binding the peak 2922cm 1 appears after loading due to the presence of alkyl ch groups responsible for adsorption 3 2 response surface methodology of adsorption of cu2 and methylene blue the central composite design the most popular method is used to study the response methodology by using the statistical software minitab 18 the method is used to study the response of operating variables like contact time ph with yield as removal the experimental factors included are contact time 5 180min and ph 2 8 with their removal efficiency is studied the 13 trials were run to study the effect of two independent variables x1 contact time and ph and x2 adsorption capacity and response as removal efficiency with a test run of 1 0 1 the quadratic equation explains the statistical relationship between the selected variables and response in terms of coded factors as shown in the following equations y cu 2 96063 29 5x1 15228x2 0 00106x1 x1 603 2 x2 2 36 1 x2 y mb 3010342 143 7x1 582274x2 0 000832x1 x1 28156x2 x2 13 92x1 x2 where x1 contact time and x2 adsorption capacity in mgg 1 the results of central composite design shown in fig 4 a and b in form of surface and contour plots for the removal of cu2 ion by lac and regression analysis is shown in table 5 and for removal of methylene blue by lac as shown in fig 4 c and d and table 6 the figure shows the response in terms of removal the figure shows that the removal efficiency and capacity increases and become constant after 120min with maximum yield of more than 95 the values of multiple r2 was 57 49 cu2 and 55 85 mb for effect of contact time could be explained by quadratic and reduced quadratic models respectively as shown in tables 5 6 3 3 contact time study the adsorption rate is one of the important parameters for batch adsorption studies the adsorption of cu2 ni2 and mb onto lac may take place through multiple steps such as external film diffusion intraparticle diffusion and interaction between pollutants and active sites of adsorbent external film diffusion is a fast process so it is not a rate limiting step the adsorption of metal ions and dye was studied in the range of 5 180min at 30 c of 50mgl 1 metals ion and dye solution the maximum adsorption in case of cu2 ni2 and mb was attained at 120min with maximum adsorption capacity in the range of cu2 12 47mgg 1 mb 10 32mgg 1 ni2 6 2mgg 1 the metal and dye ions uptake on the adsorbent surface may indicate that most of the reactant sites are exposed for the interaction of metal ions and dye the presence of various group i e hydroxyl which forms a complex between adsorbate and adsorbent surface causing faster adsorption 3 4 effect of ph it is one of the important parameter for adsorption of pollutants the metal ion removal was observed at ph 6 and for methylene blue at ph 7 as shown in fig 5 it has been observed that removal percentage of cationic pollutants cu2 ni2 and mb increases with increase in ph at lower ph the h ions presence will hurdle the cationic pollutants resulting in lower attachment of pollutants on the site at lower ph the surface of the adsorbent is always protonated which reduces the extraction of cations due to electrostatic repulsion at high ph some of the functional groups present on the surface of adsorbent becomes negatively charged leading to increase in electrostatic interaction between adsorbents and cationic pollutants homagai et al 2010 mallampati and valiyaveettil 2012 removal of cu ii ion increases with increase in solution ph the hydrolysis products as a function of ph are as follows in the ph range 2 5 the dominant species are cu2 and cuoh above 6 3 the copper occur as insoluble cu oh 2 s at ph 6 there are three species cu2 in very small quantity cuoh and cu oh 2 in large quantity mallampati and valiyaveettil 2012 the reason of metal hydroxide formation is due to buffering using naoh solution the metal ions in aqueous solution exist predominantly as m h2o 6 2 the ions in hydroxide forms react with m h2o 6 2 to form insoluble metal hydroxide dehydrate as follows sadeek et al 2015 cu h2o 6 2 2oh cu h20 2 oh 2 2h2o ksp 2 2 10 20 ni2 h oh ni oh h ni2 2h2o ni oh 2 2h the phz point of zero charge is the point at which the functional groups does not take part in the ph of the solution the phz of lac was found to be around 7 0 adsorption of cations will be favourable at ph values higher than phzpc whereas the adsorptions of anions will be favourable at ph values lower than phz jiang et al 2015 the point of zero charge is also related to surface acidity low acid surface group concentration the point of zero charge value of lac is higher than the ph value which shows the basic nature of the adsorbent sardella et al 2015 3 5 adsorption kinetics the kinetic data gives the information about the mechanism of biosorption which is important for efficiency of adsorption process the design parameters can be optimized by controlling the biosorption rate of the removal process because the system controls the adsorbate residence time and reactor dimension as a result the predicted biosorption rate is the most important factor for the biosorption system design the kinetic models studied are pseudo 1st order pseudo 2nd order and intraparticle diffusion pseudo 1st order is generally expressed as follows 5 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 pseudo 2nd order equation is generally expressed as follows mittal et al 2010a 2010b 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e intraparticle diffusion equation is generally expressed as follows 7 q t k i d t 1 2 c where k1 is the pseudo 1st order rate constant in min 1 qt is the adsorption capacity the amount of pollutant absorbed at time t in mgg 1 qe is the adsorption capacity the amount of pollutant adsorbed at equilibrium in mgg 1 k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant mgl 1 min 1 kid is the intraparticle rate constant and c is the intercept to understand the applicability of the model a plot of log qe qt vs t t qt vs t and kid vs t1 2 are shown in table 1 according to the values given in table 1 pseudo 1st order model show inapplicability in describing the adsorption process of cu2 ni2 and mb due to low regression coefficient and qecal is not equal to qeexp whereas in case of pseudo 2nd order model as shown in table 1 qecal qeexp and have high regression coefficient this proves that cu2 ni2 and mb follows pseudo 2nd order kinetic model the intraparticle diffusion model for adsorption process is divided into three stages the rapid surface adsorption stage the gradual inward diffusion stage and the final equilibrium stage the intercept value gives the idea of boundary layer thickness which means larger is the intercept greater is the boundary layer thickness as the value given in table 1 the intercept value is greater than zero and it increases with increase in concentration of metal ion as compared to mass film control diffusion the results show that the boundary layer diffusion is the controlling step 3 6 adsorption isotherm the distribution of adsorbate molecules within the adsorbent at equilibrium can be explained by adsorption isotherm to study the adsorption behaviour of adsorbent in aqueous solution a correlation between adsorption capacity and residual concentration has been done several isotherm equations are available in the literature five of them are selected for the study langmuir freundlich temkin d r and halsey equations the langmuir isotherm model is explained by two ways in adsorption process first the adsorption process occurs at homogenous surface in the adsorbent secondly maximum monolayer adsorption occurs when absorbed molecules form a saturated layer on the surface of the adsorbent all the adsorption sites involved are energetically identical and the intermolecular forces decreases as the distance from the adsorption surface increases singha and das 2013 the langmuir adsorption model can be represented by following equation 8 q e q m b c e 1 b c e where b is the constant related to affinity of binding sites and energy of adsorption lmg 1 ce is the equilibrium concentration mgl 1 qe is the absorbed metal ion mgg 1 qm is the monolayer adsorption capacity mgg 1 the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent can be explained by freundlich isotherm using an empirical equation the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is related to the concentration of absorbed metal ions at equilibrium freundlich isotherm model is represented by following equation 9 q e k f c e 1 n where kf and n are the constant related to adsorption capacity and intensity respectively and qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mgg 1 temkin isotherm model is given as 10 q e b 1 ln k t b 1 ln c e where kt is the equilibrium binding constant lmg 1 and b1 related to heat of adsorption b1 rt b t is the absolute temperature in kelvin r is the universal gas constant 8 314jmolk 1 the dubinin radushkevich isotherm d r mittal et al 2009 is more general than the langmuir isotherm because it does not assume a homogenous surface or constant sorption potential 11 ln q e ln q m β 2 where qm is the theoretical saturation capacity and e is the polanyi potential which is equal to rt ln 1 1 ce where r 8 314jmol 1 k 1 is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature b is a constant related to the mean free energy of adsorption per mole of the adsorbate mol2 kj 2 halsey isotherm is given as 12 ln q e 1 n h ln k h 1 n h 1 c e the isotherm models with their error analysis are shown in table 2 and fig 6 a b according to the regression coefficient and error values the cu2 and ni2 ions are best fitted by freundlich isotherm as shown in fig 6 b and table 2 the higher the regression value and lower ᵡ2 and rsc value the freundlich isotherm model is best fitted the value of n is greater than unity which corresponds to the distribution of bonded ions on sorbent surface which is an indication of constant sorption mechanism where sorbate penetrate sorbent and show good adsorption in case of mb it is best fitted by langmuir isotherm showing monolayer coverage according to r2 and ᵡ2 value as shown in fig 6 a and table 2 3 7 adsorption thermodynamics the effect of temperature for the adsorption of cu2 ni2 and mb were studied in the temperature range of 303 323k the parameters such as change entropy change s enthalpy change h and gibb free energy g were estimated using the following equation 13 k c c s c e 14 δ g 0 r t ln k c where kc is the equilibrium constant cs is the solid phase concentration at equilibrium mgl 1 ce is the equilibrium concentration in solution mgl 1 15 log k c δ s 0 2 303 r δ h 0 2 303 r t by using van t hoff equation the value of δh and δs can be calculated the values of δh and δs were obtained from the slope and the intercept of the plot log kc vs 1 t and presented in table 3 the values of δg are negative with decreasing trend for the adsorption of cu2 and mb ion showing spontaneity with decreasing trend in increase in temperature and with increasing trend in case of ni2 onto lac shows the reaction is spontaneous and thermodynamically favourable at high temperature the negative value of δh and δs in case of cu2 and mb ion indicate the exothermic nature and decrease randomness at adsorbate adsorbent surface whereas in case of ni2 the value of δh and δs are positive in nature indicating endothermic in nature and the randomness at solid liquid solution interface 3 8 comparative study of adsorbent to study the feasibility and comparability of the adsorbent with other non conventional adsorbent in respect of adsorption capacity a comparative data has been reported in table 4 it is evident from the table that lac has got the highest monolayer adsorption capacity for cu2 33 16mgg 1 ni2 23 84mgg 1 and mb 24 84mgg 1 among all the adsorbents 4 conclusion the results of adsorption investigate that the lac is a suitable and promising alternative adsorbent for the removal of cu2 ni2 and mb from the industrial effluent various parameters such as equilibrium time ph and initial metal ion concentration were studied for the removal of cu2 ni2 and mb lac shows maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 33 16mgg 1 24 84 23 84 in order of cu2 mb ni2 the operating variableswas adjusted using the response surface methodology showing the yield of 95 and 80 in case of cu2 and mb it was found that adsorption data for cu2 and ni2 was best fitted by freundlich isotherm demonstrating heterogeneous adsorption and for mb it was best fitted by langmuir isotherm demonstrating monolayer adsorption the kinetic data was best fitted by pseudo 2nd order kinetics the thermodynamic studies reveals that adsorption of cu2 and mb is exothermic in nature whereas for ni2

observed and noted the difference between the initial ph phi and the final ph phf δph phi phf values were then plotted against phi the point of intersection of the resulting curve with the abscissa at which δph 0 gave the phzpc value 2 4 metal selection test the absorptive nature of lac was studied using cu2 ni2 pb2 methylene blue mb 2 4 d dichorophenols it follows in the order as cu2 mb ni2 pb2 2

flask for 24h after equilibration pollutant samples were filtered and analyzed by aas the ph was studied in the range of ph 2 8 and adjusted by using 0 5m hcl and naoh the experiment was performed at ph 7 0 for mb and ph 6 0 for cu2 and ni2 ion all the experiments were reported in triplicates mb concentration was determined by uuv visble spectrophotometer with maximum absorbance at 664nm the removal percentage and adsorption capacity qe mgg 1 of mb cu2 and ni2 were calculated using the following relationship 1 c o c e c o 100 2 q e c o c e v w where ce is the concentration of adsorbate at equilibrium mgl 1 v is the volume of the solution l qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium co is the initial concentration of the adsorbate mgl 1 and w is the mass of the adsorbent the desorption study for cu2 ni2 and mb was carried out using 0 1g lac loaded with 0 1m hcl 0 1m h2c2o4 and 0 1m hno3 for 2h the supernatant was filtered and then analyzed 2 5 error analysis various error

in nature after adsorption all the pores sites are occupied by metal ions are shown in fig 1 a b the weight element present in lac was analyzed by edax the wt composition of carbon oxygen potassium phosphorous and copper are shown in table 1 and fig 2 a b the spectra of ftir for lac loaded and unloaded are shown in fig 3 the peak at 3748cm 1 assigned to minerals oh groups the peak at 1580cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching of c c bonds of aromatic rings the shift in the peak from 1069cm 1 to 1061cm 1 corresponds to c o groups the peak at 875cm 1 correspond to aromatic ch binding the peak 2922cm 1 appears after loading due to the presence of alkyl ch groups responsible for adsorption 3 2 response surface methodology of adsorption of cu2 and methylene blue the central composite design the most popular method is used to study the response methodology by using the statistical software minitab 18 the method is used to study the response of operating variables like contact time ph with yield as removal the experimental factors included are contact time 5 180min and ph 2 8 with their removal efficiency is studied the 13 trials were run to study the effect of two independent variables x1 contact time and ph and x2 adsorption capacity and response as removal efficiency with a test run of 1 0 1 the quadratic equation explains the statistical relationship between the selected variables and response in terms of coded factors as shown in the following equations y cu 2 96063 29 5x1 15228x2 0 00106x1 x1 603 2 x2 2 36 1 x2 y mb 3010342 143 7x1 582274x2 0 000832x1 x1 28156x2 x2 13 92x1 x2 where x1 contact time and x2 adsorption capacity in mgg 1 the results of central composite design shown in fig 4 a and b in form of surface and contour plots for the removal of cu2 ion by lac and regression analysis is shown in table 5 and for removal of methylene blue by lac as shown in fig 4 c and d and table 6 the figure shows the response in terms of removal the figure shows that the removal efficiency and capacity increases and become constant after 120min with maximum yield of more than 95 the values of multiple r2 was 57 49 cu2 and 55 85 mb for effect of contact time could be explained by quadratic and reduced quadratic models respectively as shown in tables 5 6 3 3 contact time study the adsorption rate is one of the important parameters for batch adsorption studies the adsorption of cu2 ni2 and mb onto lac may take place through multiple steps such as external film diffusion intraparticle diffusion and interaction between pollutants and active sites of adsorbent external film diffusion is a fast process so it is not a rate limiting step the adsorption of metal ions and dye was studied in the range of 5 180min at 30 c of 50mgl 1 metals ion and dye solution the maximum adsorption in case of cu2 ni2 and mb was attained at 120min with maximum adsorption capacity in the range of cu2 12 47mgg 1 mb 10 32mgg 1 ni2 6 2mgg 1 the metal and dye ions uptake on the adsorbent surface may indicate that most of the reactant sites are exposed for the interaction of metal ions and dye the presence of various group i e hydroxyl which forms a complex between adsorbate and adsorbent surface causing faster adsorption 3 4 effect of ph it is one of the important parameter for adsorption of pollutants the metal ion removal was observed at ph 6 and for methylene blue at ph 7 as shown in fig 5 it has been observed that removal percentage of cationic pollutants cu2 ni2 and mb increases with increase in ph at lower ph the h ions presence will hurdle the cationic pollutants resulting in lower attachment of pollutants on the site at lower ph the surface of the adsorbent is always protonated which reduces the extraction of cations due to electrostatic repulsion at high ph some of the functional groups present on the surface of adsorbent becomes negatively charged leading to increase in electrostatic interaction between adsorbents and cationic pollutants homagai et al 2010 mallampati and valiyaveettil 2012 removal of cu ii ion increases with increase in solution ph the hydrolysis products as a function of ph are as follows in the ph range 2 5 the dominant species are cu2 and cuoh above 6 3 the copper occur as insoluble cu oh 2 s at ph 6 there are three species cu2 in very small quantity cuoh and cu oh 2 in large quantity mallampati and valiyaveettil 2012 the reason of metal hydroxide formation is due to buffering using naoh solution the metal ions in aqueous solution exist predominantly as m h2o 6 2 the ions in hydroxide forms react with m h2o 6 2 to form insoluble metal hydroxide dehydrate as follows sadeek et al 2015 cu h2o 6 2 2oh cu h20 2 oh 2 2h2o ksp 2 2 10 20 ni2 h oh ni oh h ni2 2h2o ni oh 2 2h the phz point of zero charge is the point at which the functional groups does not take part in the ph of the solution the phz of lac was found to be around 7 0 adsorption of cations will be favourable at ph values higher than phzpc whereas the adsorptions of anions will be favourable at ph values lower than phz jiang et al 2015 the point of zero charge is also related to surface acidity low acid surface group concentration the point of zero charge value of lac is higher than the ph value which shows the basic nature of the adsorbent sardella et al 2015 3 5 adsorption kinetics the kinetic data gives the information about the mechanism of biosorption which is important for efficiency of adsorption process the design parameters can be optimized by controlling the biosorption rate of the removal process because the system controls the adsorbate residence time and reactor dimension as a result the predicted biosorption rate is the most important factor for the biosorption system design the kinetic models studied are pseudo 1st order pseudo 2nd order and intraparticle diffusion pseudo 1st order is generally expressed as follows 5 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 pseudo 2nd order equation is generally expressed as follows mittal et al 2010a 2010b 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e intraparticle diffusion equation is generally expressed as follows 7 q t k i d t 1 2 c where k1 is the pseudo 1st order rate constant in min 1 qt is the adsorption capacity the amount of pollutant absorbed at time t in mgg 1 qe is the adsorption capacity the amount of pollutant adsorbed at equilibrium in mgg 1 k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant mgl 1 min 1 kid is the intraparticle rate constant and c is the intercept to understand the applicability of the model a plot of log qe qt vs t t qt vs t and kid vs t1 2 are shown in table 1 according to the values given in table 1 pseudo 1st order model show inapplicability in describing the adsorption process of cu2 ni2 and mb due to low regression coefficient and qecal is not equal to qeexp whereas in case of pseudo 2nd order model as shown in table 1 qecal qeexp and have high regression coefficient this proves that cu2 ni2 and mb follows pseudo 2nd order kinetic model the intraparticle diffusion model for adsorption process is divided into three stages the rapid surface adsorption stage the gradual inward diffusion stage and the final equilibrium stage the intercept value gives the idea of boundary layer thickness which means larger is the intercept greater is the boundary layer thickness as the value given in table 1 the intercept value is greater than zero and it increases with increase in concentration of metal ion as compared to mass film control diffusion the results show that the boundary layer diffusion is the controlling step 3 6 adsorption isotherm the distribution of adsorbate molecules within the adsorbent at equilibrium can be explained by adsorption isotherm to study the adsorption behaviour of adsorbent in aqueous solution a correlation between adsorption capacity and residual concentration has been done several isotherm equations are available in the literature five of them are selected for the study langmuir freundlich temkin d r and halsey equations the langmuir isotherm model is explained by two ways in adsorption process first the adsorption process occurs at homogenous surface in the adsorbent secondly maximum monolayer adsorption occurs when absorbed molecules form a saturated layer on the surface of the adsorbent all the adsorption sites involved are energetically identical and the intermolecular forces decreases as the distance from the adsorption surface increases singha and das 2013 the langmuir adsorption model can be represented by following equation 8 q e q m b c e 1 b c e where b is the constant related to affinity of binding sites and energy of adsorption lmg 1 ce is the equilibrium concentration mgl 1 qe is the absorbed metal ion mgg 1 qm is the monolayer adsorption capacity mgg 1 the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent can be explained by freundlich isotherm using an empirical equation the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is related to the concentration of absorbed metal ions at equilibrium freundlich isotherm model is represented by following equation 9 q e k f c e 1 n where kf and n are the constant related to adsorption capacity and intensity respectively and qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mgg 1 temkin isotherm model is given as 10 q e b 1 ln k t b 1 ln c e where kt is the equilibrium binding constant lmg 1 and b1 related to heat of adsorption b1 rt b t is the absolute temperature in kelvin r is the universal gas constant 8 314jmolk 1 the dubinin radushkevich isotherm d r mittal et al 2009 is more general than the langmuir isotherm because it does not assume a homogenous surface or constant sorption potential 11 ln q e ln q m β 2 where qm is the theoretical saturation capacity and e is the polanyi potential which is equal to rt ln 1 1 ce where r 8 314jmol 1 k 1 is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature b is a constant related to the mean free energy of adsorption per mole of the adsorbate mol2 kj 2 halsey isotherm is given as 12 ln q e 1 n h ln k h 1 n h 1 c e the isotherm models with their error analysis are shown in table 2 and fig 6 a b according to the regression coefficient and error values the cu2 and ni2 ions are best fitted by freundlich isotherm as shown in fig 6 b and table 2 the higher the regression value and lower ᵡ2 and rsc value the freundlich isotherm model is best fitted the value of n is greater than unity which corresponds to the distribution of bonded ions on sorbent surface which is an indication of constant sorption mechanism where sorbate penetrate sorbent and show good adsorption in case of mb it is best fitted by langmuir isotherm showing monolayer coverage according to r2 and ᵡ2 value as shown in fig 6 a and table 2 3 7 adsorption thermodynamics the effect of temperature for the adsorption of cu2 ni2 and mb were studied in the temperature range of 303 323k the parameters such as change entropy change s enthalpy change h and gibb free energy g were estimated using the following equation 13 k c c s c e 14 δ g 0 r t ln k c where kc is the equilibrium constant cs is the solid phase concentration at equilibrium mgl 1 ce is the equilibrium concentration in solution mgl 1 15 log k c δ s 0 2 303 r δ h 0 2 303 r t by using van t hoff equation the value of δh and δs can be calculated the values of δh and δs were obtained from the slope and the intercept of the plot log kc vs 1 t and presented in table 3 the values of δg are negative with decreasing trend for the adsorption of cu2 and mb ion showing spontaneity with decreasing trend in increase in temperature and with increasing trend in case of ni2 onto lac shows the reaction is spontaneous and thermodynamically favourable at high temperature the negative value of δh and δs in case of cu2 and mb ion indicate the exothermic nature and decrease randomness at adsorbate adsorbent surface whereas in case of ni2 the value of δh and δs are positive in nature indicating endothermic in nature and the randomness at solid liquid solution interface 3 8 comparative study of adsorbent to study the feasibility and comparability of the adsorbent with other non conventional adsorbent in respect of adsorption capacity a comparative data has been reported in table 4 it is evident from the table that lac has got the highest monolayer adsorption capacity for cu2 33 16mgg 1 ni2 23 84mgg 1 and mb 24 84mgg 1 among all the adsorbents 4 conclusion the results of adsorption investigate that the lac is a suitable and promising alternative adsorbent for the removal of cu2 ni2 and mb from the industrial effluent various parameters such as equilibrium time ph and initial metal ion concentration were studied for the removal of cu2 ni2 and mb lac shows maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 33 16mgg 1 24 84 23 84 in order of cu2 mb ni2 the operating variableswas adjusted using the response surface methodology showing the yield of 95 and 80 in case of cu2 and mb it was found that adsorption data for cu2 and ni2 was best fitted by freundlich isotherm demonstrating heterogeneous adsorption and for mb it was best fitted by langmuir isotherm demonstrating monolayer adsorption the kinetic data was best fitted by pseudo 2nd order kinetics the thermodynamic studies reveals that adsorption of cu2 and mb is exothermic in nature whereas for ni2 ion it is endothermic in nature the desorption results demonstrate that lac could be desorbed upto 90 by 0 1m hcl the results demonstrate that lac is an effective and promising adsorbent for the removal of pollutant acknowledgements the financial assistance to complete the work has been provided to the author by up cst uttar pradesh council of science and technology uttar pradesh india under

12382,groundwater based irrigation in sub saharan african is believed to hold the key for economic growth and poverty reduction however the associated consequences of the groundwater levels decline are not clearly understood due to lack of dedicated monitoring and scientific studies in this study we present the first direct attempt to use non parametric tool to study trends in rainfall temperature and groundwater levels from 2005 to 2014 using mann kendall test sen s slope estimator and arima models in the upper east region of ghana the results showed a seasonal variation with no trends in rainfall and temperature the mean groundwater levels depth below the ground surface ranged from 1 24 to 5 46m with gowrie bawku and kabingo showing a narrow variation in groundwater levels as compared to datoku and bongo on the seasonal scale both the mann kendall and sen s slope estimator have shown rising seasonal trends in all the wells except kabingo which showed a declining seasonal trend of 0 312 0 097m year however on the annual scale neither significant positive nor negative trends were observed in the groundwater levels in all the monitoring wells forecast for rainfall and groundwater levels using arima models indicates that there will be a significant decline in rainfall at a rate of 4 779mm year by 2020 the groundwater levels however showed a relatively stable trend to slight increase in most of the wells varying in magnitude across the study area and ranging from 0 000 to 0 006m yr the forecasted result showed an average rate of decline of 1 008m yr at kabingo where the groundwater level are expected to decline to about 12m by 2020 implications for groundwater utilization in the area and future research needs have been highlighted and discussed graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater levels mann kendall trend test sen s slope estimator arima gis white volta basin ghana 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of fresh water and very critical to meeting the growing demands for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes in ghana some studies reported that over 80 of rural communities which represent about 70 of the total population depend on groundwater as a source of potable water anim gyampo et al 2012 in recent years the demand for groundwater for agricultural purposes in the three northern regions of ghana is increasing a critical scenario that has led to increasing groundwater exploitation with growing population and potential water demand for domestic and agricultural use the sustainability of the groundwater resources in ghana is becoming a major concern to groundwater managers analysis of groundwater levels and modelling of future trends can provide a good basis for sustainable development utilization and scientific management of groundwater resources groundwater levels and trends modelling studies provide information on the causes of groundwater decline allowable exploitation limit direction and characteristics of the trends patle et al 2015 several authors have proved that time series analysis are very effective in planning management strategies for development and utilization of groundwater resources mack et el 2013 patle et al 2015 abdullahi et al 2015 statistical methods for trend analysis have also seen considerable improvement by evolving from simple linear regression to a more complex parametric and non parametric method helsel and hirsch 1992 chen et al 2007 the most commonly used non parametric method for testing trends in hydrological time series is the mann kendall test and the seasonal kendall slope estimator sen s slope estimator mann 1945 kendall 1955 aziz and burn 2006 thas et al 2007 studies by taylor and alley 2001 showed that a further decomposition of the groundwater level time series into trends seasonal and irregular components gives more insight into the processes that control the groundwater fluctuations and flow in an aquifer system the mann kendall test is a robust non parametric test for quantifying the significance of trends in data with seasonality missing values or reported as less than the sen s slope estimator on the other hand is an unbiased estimator of slope and magnitude of a linear trend it has a higher precision compared to the regression estimator on highly skewed data but somewhat lower precision on normal data lambrakis et al 1997 jan et al 2007 bouza dean et al 2008 in recent years these non parametric methods have been used by several researchers for detecting trends in precipitation temperature steam flows evaporation groundwater fluctuation water quality data lambrakis et al 1997 jan et al 2007 bouza dean et al 2008 ramazanipour and roshani 2011 tabari et al 2011 patle et al 2013 2015 chen et al 2004 vousoughi et al 2013 and mack et al 2013 studied groundwater levels using non parametric method in the ardabil plain of iran and kabul basin in afghanistan respectively the results showed significant decline in groundwater levels in the areas chen et al 2004 analysed a hundred years data of temperature precipitation and groundwater level from 1900 to 2000 in manitoba canada the results showed a significant correlation between groundwater levels and the annual temperature and precipitation in the area however studies in kuwait by almedeij and al ruwaih 2006 showed a negative correlation between groundwater levels and temperature while the precipitation showed a positive correlation with the groundwater levels in spain bouza dean et al 2008 analysed the trend of surface water quality along the spanish ebro river using the mann kendall test and the sen s slope estimator the y observed a variation in most of the physic chemical parameters over time mainly due to the reduction in phosphate po4 3 concentration and increasing ph levels from 1981 to 2004 in the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta in bangladesh shamsudduha et al 2009 studied the trends in a 20 year record of groundwater levels in bangladesh using nonparametric method the result indicated that seasonality dominated the observed variation in the groundwater levels these effects were more pronounced in the peri urban urban and dry season rice cultivation areas where groundwater levels decline by more than 1m year however the southern coastal region closer to the estuarine shows a rising groundwater level of about 0 5 2 5m year studies in taiwan also showed a linear correlation between groundwater levels and precipitation jan et al 2007 several other studies also used the non parametric test for groundwater level trend analysis panda et al 2007 lee et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 tabari et al 2012 a number of conceptual and physically based groundwater level forecasting models have been developed to depict hydrological parameters precipitation temperature groundwater level etc and to characterize the complex structures of aquifers however one of the disadvantages of these models is that they require large and consistent quality data with detailed understanding of the underlying aquifer system this restriction limits their usefulness in data scarce sub saharan african regions including ghana time series forecasting model are suitable alternatives for limited data environment they provide a powerful method for accurate and reliable results without a costly calibration time narayanan et al 2013 these have resulted in several efforts to establish and improve these time series models over the past decade khashei and bijari 2011 the use of autoregressive integrated moving average arima model for forecasting future trends has received wide application in predicting social engineering economic and hydrological problems shahwan and odening 2007 mitosek 2000 the arima model is popular because of its simplicity and robust statistical properties the arima is a linear prediction model which assumes that the current data has a direct relationship with the past data and its errors yurekli et al 2007 narayanan et al 2013 in hydrological studies arima model was used for forecasting monthly temperature humidity and precipitation jahanbakhsh and babapour basseri 2003 shamsnia et al 2011 stream flow data karamouz and zahraie 2004 samsudin et al 2011 and groundwater level panda and kumar 2011 patle et al 2015 despite the wide application of nonparametric trend analysis and groundwater level forecasting models in groundwater resources management in different parts of the world our literature search showed no available reference study on the trend analysis of groundwater through the use of nonparametric method and time series forecasting models in the upper east region and ghana as a whole furthermore studies by anayah and kaluarachchi 2009 on groundwater resources and data availability of the northern ghana recommended the use of trend analysis for groundwater levels in the area therefore the present study aimed at 1 investigating trends and magnitudes of historical groundwater levels in the upper east region of ghana 2 determining the spatial pattern of the groundwater level trends 3 forecasting future groundwater levels in the area using the arima model it is expected that this study will provide an insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of the groundwater levels and the need for more monitoring wells and weather observatories in the study area 2 study area the upper east region uer lies between longitude 00w and 10w and latitudes 100 30 n and 110n having a geographical area of 8842km2 the region is bounded by the upper west region northern burkina faso and togo in the west south north and east respectively fig 1 the altitude in the region varies from 128 to 455m with a mean value of 197m amsl liebe 2002 the uer is located in the area between the southern sudan savanna zone and the northern guinea savanna zone in which semi arid climatic conditions prevails kasei 1988 the area has a uni modal rainfall season influenced by the southwest monsoon the mean annual rainfall evaporation and temperature are 986mm 2050 and 28 6 c respectively at navrongo a synoptic station with longest available data the white volta red volta sisili and tono river are the four major rivers in the uer liebe 2002 the area is generally flat to slightly undulating with topographic height ranging from 180 to 300m above mean sea level the area is perennially drained by kulpawa yaragatanga red and white volta rivers with several ephemeral streams scattered in the region 2 1 geology and hydrogeology of the area about 92 of the area is underlain by two main geological formations namely precambrian crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks the other 8 is made up of the palaeozoic consolidated sedimentary rocks normally referred to as the votaian series granites bongo cape coast and discove underlie almost 65 of the study area and found almost in all the districts the bogo granite reddish microline granites found in isolated patches in the central part of the study area are generally foliated undifferentiated and outcrops as boulders of varying sizes this covers about 2 of the study area the cape coast granites are gneissic magmatic and potassium rich they consist of biotite muscovites rich granites grano diorites pegmatic aplite and biotite chist these are characterised with several enclave of schist and granites agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 the discove granites are highly altered feldspars unfoliated and consist of granites hornblends hornblend diorites and grano diorites and some are sometimes associated with biotite gneisses and hornblend biotite the precambrian birimian formation covers about 25 of the area and cut diagonally across all the districts in a ne sw direction this formation is further divided into lower and upper birimian due their distinct structural variations and lithological compositions the lower birimian are strongly foliated and jointed consisting of shales phylites siltstone greywacke and schist of pelitic origin the upper birimian is made up of a thick bed of agglomerates pyroclastic and intrusive rocks and overlies the lower birimian the tarkwaian consistute about 2 of the area and the rock types are coarse poorly sorted immature sediments with little roundness and consist of quartzites phyllites grits conglomerates and schists the voltain series about 8 of the area is a well consolidated sedimentary rock of palaeozoic age the main rock types are sandstones pebby grits and quartz sandstone other rock types include arkose mudstone limestone and conglomerate groundwater occurrence in all the formations is controlled by the occurrence of fractures beddings cleavage planes and joints and their degree of interconnectivity bates 1975 groundwater in the area occurs in four main zones weathered zone bedrock weathered zone interface fractured zone and zones intruded by quartz veins and pegmatites within the fresh rocks and the overburden the weathered zone aquifers are found within the regolith and their yield varies according to the topography and the thickness of the weathered mantle 25m yields appreciable quantities of water in the same way the regolith aquifers located in the weathered zone overlying the precambrian basement rocks and flanks of valleys with proximity to springs also provides good points for large amount of groundwater in most part of the volta basin martin 2006 the weathered zone aquifers where most boreholes are drilled are either phreatic or semi confine and observed to have large groundwater level fluctuations especially between the rainy and dry season agyekum et al 2006 the space between the regolith and the hard rock also serves a reservoir of large volume of groundwater the overburden thickness varies from place to place but has an average of approximately 7m the fractured and quartz vein aquifers are usually confine or semi confine and generally high yielding borehole drilling success rate is generally higher in the birimian compared to the granite and the sedimentary rocks with values ranging from 92 82 and 45 respectively within the three granitc terrains in the area the bongo granite has the lowest success rate due to the impervious nature of the rocks the summary of the hydro geological data from the various formations are shown in table 1 the results showed that borehole yields are higher in the fractured areas of the bedrocks similarly boreholes that intercept the quartz veins and pegmatites have significant yields boreholes depths ranged from 12 to 30m while static water levels are generally 10m however few isolated areas bawku bolgatanga and kasena nankana distrcts showed static water level 10m a typical hydro stratigraphic unit and borehole profiles in the uer are shown in fig 2 2 2 methodology the mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 and sen s slope estimator sen 1968 were used for trend analysis and detection of slope of the trends auto regressive integrated moving average arima model box and jenkins 1976 was used for groundwater levels modelling and forecasting gis was used to visualise the spatial distribution of the groundwater levels 2 3 mann kendall test the mann kendall test is a non parametric statistical test for trend analysis randomness with time this method has been extensively used to access significance of trend because it is free from statistical distribution which is required for parametric test kendall 1975 considering x1 x2 xn as a time series data the null hypothesis ho for the mann kendall test is that the data come from a population where the random variables are independent and identically distributed no trend the alternative hypothesis is that there is increasing or decreasing trend the mann kendall statistic s is given as 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sign x j x i where s is mann kendall statistics n is number of data points xj and xi are the data values of the time series i and j respectively such that i j sign is the sign function each data point xi is taken as a reference point which is compared with the rest of the data point xj so that 2 sign x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 the variance is computed as 3 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups set of samples having the same value and ti the number of ties with extent i when the samples size n 8 the standard normal test statistics zs is computed as 4 z s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 it follows that the null hypothesis no trend is rejected when the z value calculated from the above equations is greater than in absolute value than the critical value zα at a chosen level of significance α in this study zα and α were taken as 1 96 and 5 respectively as widely used by several authors patle et al 2015 vousoughi et al 2013 positive values of zs indicate increasing trends while negative zs values show decreasing trends 2 4 sen s slope estimator test a procedure to estimate the magnitude of the actual change per unit time true slope in time series data was proposed by sen 1968 for a linear trend the magnitude of the trend is predicted by the sen s slope estimator qi 5 q i x j x k j k for i 1 2 n where xj and xk are data values at times j and k j k respectively if there is only one datum in each time period then n n n 1 2 where n represents the number of time periods however if there are more than one observations in one or more time periods then n n n 1 2 n represents the total number of observations the n and qi are usually rank from the smallest to the highest the sen s slope estimator is represented median values of n and q and calculated as 6 q med q n 1 2 q n 2 q n 2 2 2 if n is odd if n is even the increasing trend and decreasing trend sign of the qmed reflects the trend direction while the value of the qmed indicates the steepness of the trend the confidence interval of the qmed at specific probability is used assess whether the median slope is statistically different from zero it can be computed as 7 c α z 1 α 2 var s where var s is obtained from eq 3 z1 α 2 is usually obtained from standard normal distribution table the confidence levels in this study was computed at two significant levels ie α 0 01 and α 0 05 2 5 serial correlation effect serial correlations have been found to have both the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator effects von storch and navarra 1995 their studies suggested pre whitening of the series before applying both mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator for a given series x1 x2 x3 xn are examined using the following procedures fist the lag 1 serial correlation coefficient r1 of the sample is computed as shown by kendall and stuart 1968 salas et al 1980 8 r 1 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 x i e x i x i 1 e x i 1 n i 1 n x i e x i 2 9 e x i 1 n i 1 n x i where e xi mean of sample data n sample size the next step is to test for the significance of the r1 if the r1 is not significant at 5 confidence level then the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator are applied to the original time series data however if the calculated r1 is significant at 5 level the pre whitened time series may be obtained as x2 r1x1 x3 r1x2 xn r1xn 1 the critical value of r1 for a given significance level depends on whether the test is one tailed or two tailed in the case of one tailed the alternative hypothesis is that true r1 is greater than zero while in the two tailed test the alternative hypothesis is that the true r1 is different from zero and can either be positive or negative the probability limit on the correlogram of an independent series for r1 can be calculated as suggested by salas et al 1980 10 r i 1 1 645 n 2 n 1 one tailed test 1 1 96 n 2 n 1 two tailed test where n sample size the choice of method to use depends on the problem generally if there is a reason to suspect positive correlation the one tailed test is best otherwise the two tailed is preferred 2 6 autoregressive integrated moving average arima model the arima models propose by box jenkins 1976 is perhaps the most popular and widely used tools for forecasting and modelling time series data the model is normally expressed as arima p d q and involves autoregressive ar integrated i and moving average ma denoted as p d and r respectively the rainfall and groundwater level data were used for the modelling and forecasting as function of time more details and explanations on the arima equations can be found in patle et al 2015 in short for a given time series yt it can be expressed as 11 y t y 1 y 2 y 3 y t where y1 y2 y3 are the observations at t1 t2 t3 the autoregressive ar component explains the relationship between present and previous p observations the equation is given as 12 y t c ϕ 1 y t 1 e t if p 1 however if p 1 the equation becomes 13 y t c ϕ 1 y t 1 ϕ 2 y t 2 ϕ p y t p e t where yt yt 1 are the observed values at time t and t 1 respectively et is random error and c and ϕ are constant the integrated i component explains whether the observed values are modelled directly or differentiated when the series is modelled directly then d 0 however in practice d can be 1 or 2 the need for differencing to make the series stationary has been thoroughly explained by dickey and fuller 1979 the moving average ma component shows the effect of the previous q errors on the current observation if 14 y t c θ 1 e t 1 e t then it implies that q 1 however if q 1 then other errors must be considered in the equation above where c is a constant et is random error at time t and et 1 is the previous random error at time t 1 the arima method of time series modelling consist of four main steps namely model identification parameter estimation diagnostic checking and forecasting samsudin et al 2011 patle et al 2015 in the first stage the stationarity and normality of the time series data is tested this is examined by the behaviour of the autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf after which the tentative model is chosen in the second step the model parameters are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood to choose the model parameters p d q in the diagnostic testing stage the model adequacy is examined to check if the model assumptions about the errors are satisfactory if the selected model is unsatisfactory the above procedure is repeated with a new model until the new model fits the assumptions around the errors the final stage involves the use of the selected model for calculating the fitted and predicted values the forecast package in r was used for the arima modelling of the time series data the groundwater level data were partitioned into two in the ratio 70 30 the first part was used for model identification while the second part was used for verification validation of the model performance accuracy and predictability the goodness fit criteria used in judging the performance of the models are root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r2 mape mae maxpe maxae and ljung box q statistics the observed and forecasted results were compared in order to select the best model for forecasting 2 7 data sets and exploratory analysis the groundwater level data used for the analysis were obtained from the database of the water resources commission of ghana monitoring of groundwater data started through the hydrological assessment programme hap in the northern region of ghana funded by the canadian international development agency cida in 2005 the data were taken every six hours from 2005 to 2014 with data loggers divers and baro the monitoring wells were located at bawku bongo bonia datoku gowrie tingre kabingo and doringa noviransa as shown in fig 1 these details of each well are summarised in table 2 however due to instrumental faults and other technical problems continuous data were not obtained in some monitoring wells hence data analysis was restricted to the period where both the baro and diver measurement were available to allow for compensation where there are missing data the mice package in r was used in fill in the missing data the mankendall and sen slope estimator were then applied on the monthly average groundwater levels the r statistical language r development team 2007 was used to read and structure the data all the water levels were subjected to systematic quality control procedures 3 results and discussions 3 1 rainfall and temperature variations rainfall and temperature variations at the navrongo meteorological station with the monthly distributions are shown in fig 3 both rainfall and temperature do not show any significant trend but exhibit strong seasonal variations the highest rainfall was recorded in august while january february march november and december recorded the least rainfall events temperature also exhibits a strong seasonal variation with march being the hottest month and august the coldest month 3 2 groundwater level variations continuous records on groundwater level are important to study the water level fluctuation and groundwater potential fig 4 shows the groundwater levels of all the monitoring wells along with their monthly distributions the gowrie tingre well showed a narrow variation in groundwater levels ranging from 0 85 to 1 71m with a mean value of 1 24m the bawku and kabingo also showed a narrow range with mean values of 2 63m and 2 72m respectively on the other hand the datoku and bongo wells showed wide variations ranging from 0 5 to 10 03m with a mean value of 3 96m and 1 71 8 30m with a mean value of 5 18m respectively these plots reveal a general seasonal trend in all the monitoring wells with significant variations in groundwater levels across the region generally most of the wells showed a rising seasonal trend in the groundwater levels with the exception of kabingo and gowrie which showed declining and stable trends respectively fig 4 a shows the data from bawku well with a rising groundwater levels and increasing seasonality this is located in the north eastern part of the study area the monthly box plot at bawku showed that groundwater levels variability is highest during the raining season the groundwater levels increases were observed to start in august which represents the peak of the raining season similar observations were also made at bongo datoku bonia and doninga noviransa the gowrie tingre well fig 4b showed a distinct characteristic with a relatively stable trend and with smaller overall variations than the other wells the boxplot of the monthly groundwater levels also showed a slight increase in groundwater levels throughout the year the gowrie tingre well is located few meters downstream of the vea irrigation dam hence the stable water levels observed throughout year may suggest a possible recharge from the dam 3 3 trends in groundwater levels in the study area the mann kendal test and sen s slope estimates were applied to each of the data from the monitoring wells for the trend analysis prior to the application of both mann kendal and sen s slope estimates autocorrelation test were carried out on each of the time series data in order to check for randomness in the data the lag 1 serial correlation coefficients of all the wells were statistically not significant hence no need to pre white the data therefore the statistical tests described above were applied to the original time series data the results of the statistical test on the seasonal and annual zc and qmed of the mann kendall and sen s slope of the rainfall temperature and groundwater levels in the upper east region are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the rainfall and temperature do not show any significant annual and seasonal trends however the groundwater levels show generally different magnitude of rising trend in all the wells except kabingo strong seasonal trends were observed at bongo and bawku in the north eastern and central part of the study area doninga well in the south western part of the region showed a positive trend but not significant at p value of 0 05 while the kabingo well located at the south western part showed a strong seasonal decreasing trend on the seasonal time scale the rates of change vary from 0 817 to 0 312m yr with a mean value of 0 011m yr and 0 673 to 0 412m yr with a mean value of 0 064m yr from the mann kendall and sen slope estimators respectively on the annual scale neither significant positive nor negative trends were observed in the groundwater levels in all the monitoring wells moreover rainfall and temperature showed insignificant positive and negative trends respectively in the case of the groundwater levels with the exception of doninga and datoku all other wells showed decreasing insignificant trends fig 5 showed the annual hydrograph of the groundwater levels in all the monitoring wells the results of the correlation coefficient show a general strong correlation coefficient between the groundwater levels in the area table 5 the rainfall on the other hand showed a weak correlation with almost all the wells careful analysis of fig 3 showed that the peak of the rainfall is in august however in fig 4 it can be observed that the impact of wet season rainfall on the groundwater levels was observed approximately one to two month after the rainfall peak shamsudduha et al 2009 lowest groundwater levels were observed between april and june for almost all the locations a possible reason for the observed delay between peak rainfall and groundwater response could be the attainment of a threshold rainfall to saturate the soil moisture and rock matrix before recharge takes place and navrongo rainfall may not be the representative for the whole region shamsudduha et al 2009 there was also a general strong correlation between the groundwater levels in most of the monitoring wells of this study although these correlations and fluctuations are more of location specific response to recharge at the initial stage the persistence tendency progressively spread to the whole study area by inter aquifer linkage the distinct spatial patterns of the trends also suggest a possibility of hydraulic connection between the aquifers in the region and the trends are interdependent to visualise all the factors responsible for the groundwater levels dynamics the groundwater levels were decomposed trends seasonal and residual irregular event components using decomposition method called seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess stl to resolve the trends cleveland et al 1990 fig 6 is the decomposed time series for bawku and kabingo in fig 6 it can be observed that the bawku well showed a rising trend mainly influenced by the events component with a relatively no significant change in the magnitude of the seasonal components the kabingo well on the other hand showed a declining trend and a stable seasonality over time this implies that there is no significant change in the groundwater levels from one season to the other and the observed variations are mainly influenced by the event components this method provides an improved insight into the processes that control the groundwater level by simultaneously considering all the aspects of the underlining trends of the time series the rest of the plots are presented as supplementary material supplementary fig 1 the magnitude of each trend at each of the monitoring well was determined and compared to the original this was done by comparing the variance of each component as a percentage of the variance of the original time series shamsudduha et al 2009 generally the seasonal event irregular and trend components have almost the same impact on the groundwater level with mean value of 34 7 34 7 and 34 5 respectively it is however worthy to note that the variance of the event irregular components is a major factor in the total groundwater level variance in the entire study area ranging from 19 2 to 81 high irregular variances in groundwater levels result in anomalous seasonal extremes due to flood events and extensive groundwater abstraction this observation is not surprising because the upper east region is a flood prone area and most communities get flooded during the rainy season this normally gets worse whenever there is a spillage from the bagre dam in burkina faso 3 4 model selection and forecasting of groundwater level using arima model the first step in analysing time series is to examine the autocorrelation acf and partial autocorrelation pacf the plots of acf and pacf are shown in fig 7 and supplementary material supplementary fig 2 the dashed lines represent the confidence limit it can be observed from the plots that most of the spikes were below the confidence limit after differencing suggesting stationarity of the data based on the plots the order of p and q were decided for developing the tentative arima model for all the monitoring stations the auto arima function in r was used to select the best models for each monitoring well based on the bayesian information criteria and akaike information criteria aic 3 5 model diagnostic checking and validation the selected models were first validated by a diagnostic checking of the residuals from the fitted models for any sign of randomness the plot of the residuals the autocorrelation of the residuals and the p values of the ljung box for the first ten lags of the bawku are shown in fig 8 from the plots it can be observed that the residuals of the model are independently distributed hence the model is a good model a further comparison of the forecasted and observed for rainfall and bawku groundwater levels are shown in fig 9 and the rest as supplementary data supplementary fig 3 it is observed that the forecasted groundwater levels are in close agreement and the models fits the data with some little variation that can relatively be considered as random 3 6 forecasting of rainfall and groundwater levels in the study area the results of the forecasted rainfall and the groundwater levels using the arima models are presented in fig 9 and supplementary material supplementary fig 3 in fig 9 the rainfall and the groundwater levels at bawku are shown in this example it is observed that the rainfall would decline gradually from 2015 to 2020 the average rate of decline of rainfall using the sen s slope estimate is 4 779mm yr on the other hand the groundwater levels showed a relatively stable trend in most of the wells varying in magnitude across the study area except kabingo the forecasted results in kabingo showed a significant groundwater levels decline to about 12m by 2020 with an average annual rate of decline of about 1 008m yr studies by zango et al 2014 using linear regression observed a gradual decrease in mean annual rainfall at a rate of 3 391mm yr representing 0 5 and recharge at a rate of 1 012mm yr representing 6 other studies using climate models also predicted a decline in annual precipitation run off and groundwater recharge in the volta river basin by mid 21st century lutz et al 2015 mccartney et al 2012 this predicted decline in rainfall is likely to threaten the livelihood of these communities that depend on rain fed agriculture and also push for more groundwater exploitation for domestic and agricultural use lutz et al 2015 3 7 implications for groundwater utilization in the upper east region the demand for potable water in the upper east region and ghana as a whole especially in the rural and peri urban areas has been on the increase in the last two or more decades this rise in water demand has been attributed to population growth agricultural and industrial activities at the local levels furthermore the government effort to meet the millennium development goals and quite recently the sustainable development goals has led to massive investment in the water and sanitation sector in the country this resulted in the provision of several thousands of mechanized wells boreholes and hand dug wells to rural and urban communities across the country this development has raised concerns among the various stakeholders in the water sector for proper management practices to ensure the groundwater sustainability groundwater recharge rate in the white volta basin of ghana varied from 2 5 in the driest parts to about 7 5 in the relatively wet parts and strongly dependant on rainfall andreini et al 2000 martin 2006 the relatively high estimated groundwater recharge compared to the estimated water demand of inhabitants in the area showed that recharge could currently be considered not to be a limiting factor zango et al 2014 martin 2006 the predicted groundwater levels in the white volta basin of the upper east region indicate a stable to slight increase in the groundwater levels in most of the monitoring wells however the kabingo well has decreased considerably from 2009 to 2012 and will continue to decline to 12m by 2020 the forecasted gradual decline in mean annual rainfall rate at 4 779mm yr in the study area compares well with the value of 3 391mm yr and 1 012mm yr decline in rainfall and estimated recharge in bawku municipality which form part of the study area zango et al 2014 however the magnitude of the direct impact of this on the net groundwater level is not well understood due to the absence of isotopes data to determine the contribution of surface water dams to groundwater recharge the data available cannot confirm this as the impact of the several dams and rivers on groundwater recharge have not been adequately studied previous study by zango et al 2014 on the groundwater demand and abstraction in the bawku municipality area with least rainfall shows an abstraction rate of 13 6 of the current annual groundwater recharge they further estimated a surplus of 57 1 3 72 106m3 yr between the abstraction rate and groundwater reserve these findings and the predicted stable groundwater levels in our work suggest the groundwater reserve is sustainable and can support current and future demand for domestic and food production in summary sustainable utilization of groundwater in the basin must involve a holistic management studies that include rainfall and surface water groundwater interaction well structured and dedicated climate surface water and groundwater level monitoring are needed for an informed decision on the groundwater sustainability in the area 3 8 limitations of the study and future research needs in the area one major caveat is the limitation of the data used for the analysis the maximum data available is 85 months representing about 7 5 years of data and sporadic nature of the data in some wells due to equipment failure furthermore the climate data of navrongo used cannot be a representative of the wholes upper east region hence rainfall data cannot account for spatial variation in the area another major caveat is the lack of localised sub surface geologic information hydrogeologic parameters and the extraction volumes of the hand pumps lutz et al 2015 in the future there would be a need for a more thorough evaluation of recharge patterns with respect to the onset distribution of rainfall to determine the spatial distribution of natural recharge to the aquifers so that groundwater development can be properly planned the installation of weather stations at each individual study sites and continuous monitoring of groundwater levels yield discharge and water quality will be ideal if possible to guide future studies another interesting study will be the use of stable and radioactive isotopes to study groundwater surface water interaction age of the groundwater and the potential sources of contamination to the groundwater 4 conclusion groundwater level fluctuations in seven monitoring wells in the white volta river basin of the upper east region of ghana have been assessed using non parametric mann kendal test and sen s slope estimator arima models and spatial analysis using gis were also carried out to predict the future groundwater levels and spatial variation of the trends in the area respectively the results showed a seasonal variation with no trend in rainfall and temperature the mean groundwater levels range from 1 240 to 5 460m with gowrie bawku and kabingo showing a narrow variation in groundwater levels as compared to datoku and bongo both the mann kendall and sen s slope estimator on the annual scale have shown groundwater level increase in all the monitoring wells except kabingo which showed a declining level the rate of groundwater level increase ranged from 0 312 to 0 097 with mean value of 0 247m year while the kabingo well declined to about 0 817m year on the seasonal scale neither significant positive nor negative trends were observed in the groundwater levels in all the monitoring wells forecast using arima models for the rainfall and groundwater levels indicates that there will be a significant decline in rainfall at a rate of 0 95mm year by 2020 the groundwater levels however showed relatively stable trends in most of the wells varying in magnitude across the study area ranging from 0 000 to 0 006m yr the forecasted result showed an average rate of groundwater decline of about 1 008m yr at kabingo which is expected to decrease to about 12m by 2020 in conclusion the study has revealed that current and predicted groundwater levels trends in the upper east region can sustain the current demand and have the potential for further development it is hoped that this study has provided more insight into the spatial and temporal characteristics of the groundwater levels and the need for more monitoring wells and weather observatories in the area acknowledgement the paper constitutes

12382,groundwater based irrigation in sub saharan african is believed to hold the key for economic growth and poverty reduction however the associated consequences of the groundwater levels decline are not clearly understood due to lack of dedicated monitoring and scientific studies in this study we present the first direct attempt to use non parametric tool to study trends in rainfall temperature and groundwater levels from 2005 to 2014 using mann kendall test sen s slope estimator and arima models in the upper east region of ghana the results showed a seasonal variation with no trends in rainfall and temperature the mean groundwater levels depth below the ground surface ranged from 1 24 to 5 46m with gowrie bawku and kabingo showing a narrow variation in groundwater levels as compared to datoku and bongo on the seasonal scale both the mann kendall and sen s slope estimator have shown rising seasonal trends in all the wells except kabingo which showed a declining seasonal trend of 0 312 0 097m year however on the annual scale neither significant positive nor negative trends were observed in the groundwater levels in all the monitoring wells forecast for rainfall and groundwater levels using arima models indicates that there will be a significant decline in rainfall at a rate of 4 779mm year by 2020 the groundwater levels however showed a relatively stable trend to slight increase in most of the wells varying in magnitude across the study area and ranging from 0 000 to 0 006m yr the forecasted result showed an average rate of decline of 1 008m yr at kabingo where the groundwater level are expected to decline to about 12m by 2020 implications for groundwater utilization in the area and future research needs have been highlighted and discussed graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater levels mann kendall trend test sen s slope estimator arima gis white volta basin ghana 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of fresh water and very critical to meeting the growing demands for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes in ghana some studies reported that over 80 of rural communities which represent about 70 of the total population depend on groundwater as a source of potable water anim gyampo et al 2012 in recent years the demand for groundwater for agricultural purposes in the three northern regions of ghana is increasing a critical scenario that has led to increasing groundwater exploitation with growing population and potential water demand for domestic and agricultural use the sustainability of the groundwater resources in ghana is becoming a major concern to groundwater managers analysis of groundwater levels and modelling of future trends can provide a good basis for sustainable development utilization and scientific management of groundwater resources groundwater levels and trends modelling studies provide information on the causes of groundwater decline allowable exploitation limit direction and characteristics of the trends patle et al 2015 several authors have proved that time series analysis are very effective in planning management strategies for development and utilization of groundwater resources mack et el 2013 patle et al 2015 abdullahi et al 2015 statistical methods for trend analysis have also seen considerable improvement by evolving from simple linear regression to a more complex parametric and non parametric method helsel and hirsch 1992 chen et al 2007 the most commonly used non parametric method for testing trends in hydrological time series is the mann kendall test and the seasonal kendall slope estimator sen s slope estimator mann 1945 kendall 1955 aziz and burn 2006 thas et al 2007 studies by taylor and alley 2001 showed that a further decomposition of the groundwater level time series into trends seasonal and irregular components gives more insight into the processes that control the groundwater fluctuations and flow in an aquifer system the mann kendall test is a robust non parametric test for quantifying the significance of trends in data with seasonality missing values or reported as less than the sen s slope estimator on the other hand is an unbiased estimator of slope and magnitude of a linear trend it has a higher precision compared to the regression estimator on highly skewed data but somewhat lower precision on normal data lambrakis et al 1997 jan et al 2007 bouza dean et al 2008 in recent years these non parametric methods have been used by several researchers for detecting trends in precipitation temperature steam flows evaporation groundwater fluctuation water quality data lambrakis et al 1997 jan et al 2007 bouza dean et al 2008 ramazanipour and roshani 2011 tabari et al 2011 patle et al 2013 2015 chen et al 2004 vousoughi et al 2013 and mack et al 2013 studied groundwater levels using non parametric method in the ardabil plain of iran and kabul basin in afghanistan respectively the results showed significant decline in groundwater levels in the areas chen et al 2004 analysed a hundred years data of temperature precipitation and groundwater level from 1900 to 2000 in manitoba canada the results showed a significant correlation between groundwater levels and the annual temperature and precipitation in the area however studies in kuwait by almedeij and al ruwaih 2006 showed a negative correlation between groundwater levels and temperature while the precipitation showed a positive correlation with the groundwater levels in spain bouza dean et al 2008 analysed the trend of surface water quality along the spanish ebro river using the mann kendall test and the sen s slope estimator the y observed a variation in most of the physic chemical parameters over time mainly due to the reduction in phosphate po4 3 concentration and increasing ph levels from 1981 to 2004 in the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta in bangladesh shamsudduha et al 2009 studied the trends in a 20 year record of groundwater levels in bangladesh using nonparametric method the result indicated that seasonality dominated the observed variation in the groundwater levels these effects were more pronounced in the peri urban urban and dry season rice cultivation areas where groundwater levels decline by more than 1m year however the southern coastal region closer to the estuarine shows a rising groundwater level of about 0 5 2 5m year studies in taiwan also showed a linear correlation between groundwater levels and precipitation jan et al 2007 several other studies also used the non parametric test for groundwater level trend analysis panda et al 2007 lee et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 tabari et al 2012 a number of conceptual and physically based groundwater level forecasting models have been developed to depict hydrological parameters precipitation temperature groundwater level etc and to characterize the complex structures of aquifers however one of the disadvantages of these models is that they require large and consistent quality data with detailed understanding of the underlying aquifer system this restriction limits their usefulness in data scarce sub saharan african regions including ghana time series forecasting model are suitable alternatives for limited data environment they provide a powerful method for accurate and reliable results without a costly calibration time narayanan et al 2013 these have resulted in several efforts to establish and improve these time series models over the past decade khashei and bijari 2011 the use of autoregressive integrated moving average arima model for forecasting future trends has received wide application in predicting social engineering economic and hydrological problems shahwan and odening 2007 mitosek 2000 the arima model is popular because of its simplicity and robust statistical properties the arima is a linear prediction model which assumes that the current data has a direct relationship with the past data and its errors yurekli et al 2007 narayanan et al 2013 in hydrological studies arima model was used for forecasting monthly temperature humidity and precipitation jahanbakhsh and babapour basseri 2003 shamsnia et al 2011 stream flow data karamouz and zahraie 2004 samsudin et al 2011 and groundwater level panda and kumar 2011 patle et al 2015 despite the wide application of nonparametric trend analysis and groundwater level forecasting models in groundwater resources management in different parts of the world our literature search showed no available reference study on the trend analysis of groundwater through the use of nonparametric method and time series forecasting models in the upper east region and ghana as a whole furthermore studies by anayah and kaluarachchi 2009 on groundwater resources and data availability of the northern ghana recommended the use of trend analysis for groundwater levels in the area therefore the present study aimed at 1 investigating trends and magnitudes of historical groundwater levels in the upper east region of ghana 2 determining the spatial pattern of the groundwater level trends 3 forecasting future groundwater levels in the area using the arima model it is expected that this study will provide an insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of the groundwater levels and the need for more monitoring wells and weather observatories in the study area 2 study area the upper east region uer lies between longitude 00w and 10w and latitudes 100 30 n and 110n having a geographical area of 8842km2 the region is bounded by the upper west region northern burkina faso and togo in the west south north and east respectively fig 1 the altitude in the region varies from 128 to 455m with a mean value of 197m amsl liebe 2002 the uer is located in the area between the southern sudan savanna zone and the northern guinea savanna zone in which semi arid climatic conditions prevails kasei 1988 the area has a uni modal rainfall season influenced by the southwest monsoon the mean annual rainfall evaporation and temperature are 986mm 2050 and 28 6 c respectively at navrongo a synoptic station with longest available data the white volta red volta sisili and tono river are the four major rivers in the uer liebe 2002 the area is generally flat to slightly undulating with topographic height ranging from 180 to 300m above mean sea level the area is perennially drained by kulpawa yaragatanga red and white volta rivers with several ephemeral streams scattered in the region 2 1 geology and hydrogeology of the area about 92 of the area is underlain by two main geological formations namely precambrian crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks the other 8 is made up of the palaeozoic consolidated sedimentary rocks normally referred to as the votaian series granites bongo cape coast and discove underlie almost 65 of the study area and found almost in all the districts the bogo granite reddish microline granites found in isolated patches in the central part of the study area are generally foliated undifferentiated and outcrops as boulders of varying sizes this covers about 2 of the study area the cape coast granites are gneissic magmatic and potassium rich they consist of biotite muscovites rich granites grano diorites pegmatic aplite and biotite chist these are characterised with several enclave of schist and granites agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 the discove granites are highly altered feldspars unfoliated and consist of granites hornblends hornblend diorites and grano diorites and some are sometimes associated with biotite gneisses and hornblend biotite the precambrian birimian formation covers about 25 of the area and cut diagonally across all the districts in a ne sw direction this formation is further divided into lower and upper birimian due their distinct structural variations and lithological compositions the lower birimian are strongly foliated and jointed consisting of shales phylites siltstone greywacke and schist of pelitic origin the upper birimian is made up of a thick bed of agglomerates pyroclastic and intrusive rocks and overlies the lower birimian the tarkwaian consistute about 2 of the area and the rock types are coarse poorly sorted immature sediments with little roundness and consist of quartzites phyllites grits conglomerates and schists the voltain series about 8 of the area is a well consolidated sedimentary rock of palaeozoic age the main rock types are sandstones pebby grits and quartz sandstone other rock types include arkose mudstone limestone and conglomerate groundwater occurrence in all the formations is controlled by the occurrence of fractures beddings cleavage planes and joints and their degree of interconnectivity bates 1975 groundwater in the area occurs in four main zones weathered zone bedrock weathered zone interface fractured zone and zones intruded by quartz veins and pegmatites within the fresh rocks and the overburden the weathered zone aquifers are found within the regolith and their yield varies according to the topography and the thickness of the weathered mantle 25m yields appreciable quantities of water in the same way the regolith aquifers located in the weathered zone overlying the precambrian basement rocks and flanks of valleys with proximity to springs also provides good points for large amount of groundwater in most part of the volta basin martin 2006 the weathered zone aquifers where most boreholes are drilled are either phreatic or semi confine and observed to have large groundwater level fluctuations especially between the rainy and dry season agyekum et al 2006 the space between the regolith and the hard rock also serves a reservoir of large volume of groundwater the overburden thickness varies from place to place but has an average of approximately 7m the fractured and quartz vein aquifers are usually confine or semi confine and generally high yielding borehole drilling success rate is generally higher in the birimian compared to the granite and the sedimentary rocks with values ranging from 92 82 and 45 respectively within the three granitc terrains in the area the bongo granite has the lowest success rate due to the impervious nature of the rocks the summary of the hydro geological data from the various formations are shown in table 1 the results showed that borehole yields are higher in the fractured areas of the bedrocks similarly boreholes that intercept the quartz veins and pegmatites have significant yields boreholes depths ranged from 12 to 30m while static water levels are generally 10m however few isolated areas bawku bolgatanga and kasena nankana distrcts showed static water level 10m a typical hydro stratigraphic unit and borehole profiles in the uer are shown in fig 2 2 2 methodology the mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 and sen s slope estimator sen 1968 were used for trend analysis and detection of slope of the trends auto regressive integrated moving average arima model box and jenkins 1976 was used for groundwater levels modelling and forecasting gis was used to visualise the spatial distribution of the groundwater levels 2 3 mann kendall test the mann kendall test is a non parametric statistical test for trend analysis randomness with time this method has been extensively used to access significance of trend because it is free from statistical distribution which is required for parametric test kendall 1975 considering x1 x2 xn as a time series data the null hypothesis ho for the mann kendall test is that the data come from a population where the random variables are independent and identically distributed no trend the alternative hypothesis is that there is increasing or decreasing trend the mann kendall statistic s is given as 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sign x j x i where s is mann kendall statistics n is number of data points xj and xi are the data values of the time series i and j respectively such that i j sign is the sign function each data point xi is taken as a reference point which is compared with the rest of the data point xj so that 2 sign x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 the variance is computed as 3 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups set of samples having the same value and ti the number of ties with extent i when the samples size n 8 the standard normal test statistics zs is computed as 4 z s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 it follows that the null hypothesis no trend is rejected when the z value calculated from the above equations is greater than in absolute value than the critical value zα at a chosen level of significance α in this study zα and α were taken as 1 96 and 5 respectively as widely used by several authors patle et al 2015 vousoughi et al 2013 positive values of zs indicate increasing trends while negative zs values show decreasing trends 2 4 sen s slope estimator test a procedure to estimate the magnitude of the actual change per unit time true slope in time series data was proposed by sen 1968 for a linear trend the magnitude of the trend is predicted by the sen s slope estimator qi 5 q i x j x k j k for i 1 2 n where xj and xk are data values at times j and k j k respectively if there is only one datum in each time period then n n n 1 2 where n represents the number of time periods however if there are more than one observations in one or more time periods then n n n 1 2 n represents the total number of observations the n and qi are usually rank from the smallest to the highest the sen s slope estimator is represented median values of n and q and calculated as 6 q med q n 1 2 q n 2 q n 2 2 2 if n is odd if n is even the increasing trend and decreasing trend sign of the qmed reflects the trend direction while the value of the qmed indicates the steepness of the trend the confidence interval of the qmed at specific probability is used assess whether the median slope is statistically different from zero it can be computed as 7 c α z 1 α 2 var s where var s is obtained from eq 3 z1 α 2 is usually obtained from standard normal distribution table the confidence levels in this study was computed at two significant levels ie α 0 01 and α 0 05 2 5 serial correlation effect serial correlations have been found to have both the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator effects von storch and navarra 1995 their studies suggested pre whitening of the series before applying both mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator for a given series x1 x2 x3 xn are examined using the following procedures fist the lag 1 serial correlation coefficient r1 of the sample is computed as shown by kendall and stuart 1968 salas et al 1980 8 r 1 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 x i e x i x i 1 e x i 1 n i 1 n x i e x i 2 9 e x i 1 n i 1 n x i where e xi mean of sample data n sample size the next step is to test for the significance of the r1 if the r1 is not significant at 5 confidence level then the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator are applied to the original time series data however if the calculated r1 is significant at 5 level the pre whitened time series may be obtained as x2 r1x1 x3 r1x2 xn r1xn 1 the critical value of r1 for a given significance level depends on whether the test is one tailed or two tailed in the case of one tailed the alternative hypothesis is that true r1 is greater than zero while in the two tailed test the alternative hypothesis is that the true r1 is different from zero and can either be positive or negative the probability limit on the correlogram of an independent series for r1 can be calculated as suggested by salas et al 1980 10 r i 1 1 645 n 2 n 1 one tailed test 1 1 96 n 2 n 1 two tailed test where n sample size the choice of method to use depends on the problem generally if there is a reason to suspect positive correlation the one tailed test is best otherwise the two tailed is preferred 2 6 autoregressive integrated moving average arima model the arima models propose by box jenkins 1976 is perhaps the most popular and widely used tools for forecasting and modelling time series data the model is normally expressed as arima p d q and involves autoregressive ar integrated i and moving average ma denoted as p d and r respectively the rainfall and groundwater level data were used for the modelling and forecasting as function of time more details and explanations on the arima equations can be found in patle et al 2015 in short for a given time series yt it can be expressed as 11 y t y 1 y 2 y 3 y t where y1 y2 y3 are the observations at t1 t2 t3 the autoregressive ar component explains the relationship between present and previous p observations the equation is given as 12 y t c ϕ 1 y t 1 e t if p 1 however if p 1 the equation becomes 13 y t c ϕ 1 y t 1 ϕ 2 y t 2 ϕ p y t p e t where yt yt 1 are the observed values at time t and t 1 respectively et is random error and c and ϕ are constant the integrated i component explains whether the observed values are modelled directly or differentiated when the series is modelled directly then d 0 however in practice d can be 1 or 2 the need for differencing to make the series stationary has been thoroughly explained by dickey and fuller 1979 the moving average ma component shows the effect of the previous q errors on the current observation if 14 y t c θ 1 e t 1 e t then it implies that q 1 however if q 1 then other errors must be considered in the equation above where c is a constant et is random error at time t and et 1 is the previous random error at time t 1 the arima method of time series modelling consist of four main steps namely model identification parameter estimation diagnostic checking and forecasting samsudin et al 2011 patle et al 2015 in the first stage the stationarity and normality of the time series data is tested this is examined by the behaviour of the autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf after which the tentative model is chosen in the second step the model parameters are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood to choose the model parameters p d q in the diagnostic testing stage the model adequacy is examined to check if the model assumptions about the errors are satisfactory if the selected model is unsatisfactory the above procedure is repeated with a new model until the new model fits the assumptions around the errors the final stage involves the use of the selected model for calculating the fitted and predicted values the forecast package in r was used for the arima modelling of the time series data the groundwater level data were partitioned into two in the ratio 70 30 the first part was used for model identification while the second part was used for verification validation of the model performance accuracy and predictability the goodness fit criteria used in judging the performance of the models are root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r2 mape mae maxpe maxae and ljung box q statistics the observed and forecasted results were compared in order to select the best model for forecasting 2 7 data sets and exploratory analysis the groundwater level data used for the analysis were obtained from the database of the water resources commission of ghana monitoring of groundwater data started through the hydrological assessment programme hap in the northern region of ghana funded by the canadian international development agency cida in 2005 the data were taken every six hours from 2005 to 2014 with data loggers divers and baro the monitoring wells were located at bawku bongo bonia datoku gowrie tingre kabingo and doringa noviransa as shown in fig 1 these details of each well are summarised in table 2 however due to instrumental faults and other technical problems continuous data were not obtained in some monitoring wells hence data analysis was restricted to the period where both the baro and diver measurement were available to allow for compensation where there are missing data the mice package in r was used in fill in the missing data the mankendall and sen slope estimator were then applied on the monthly average groundwater levels the r statistical language r development team 2007 was used to read and structure the data all the water levels were subjected to systematic quality control procedures 3 results and discussions 3 1 rainfall and temperature variations rainfall and temperature variations at the navrongo meteorological station with the monthly distributions are shown in fig 3 both rainfall and temperature do not show any significant trend but exhibit strong seasonal variations the highest rainfall was recorded in august while january february march november and december recorded the least rainfall events temperature also exhibits a strong seasonal variation with march being the hottest month and august the coldest month 3 2 groundwater level variations continuous records on groundwater level are important to study the water level fluctuation and groundwater potential fig 4 shows the groundwater levels of all the monitoring wells along with their monthly distributions the gowrie tingre well showed a narrow variation in groundwater levels ranging from 0 85 to 1 71m with a mean value of 1 24m the bawku and kabingo also showed a narrow range with mean values of 2 63m and 2 72m respectively on the other hand the datoku and bongo wells showed wide variations ranging from 0 5 to 10 03m with a mean value of 3 96m and 1 71 8 30m with a mean value of 5 18m respectively these plots reveal a general seasonal trend in all the monitoring wells with significant variations in groundwater levels across the region generally most of the wells showed a rising seasonal trend in the groundwater levels with the exception of kabingo and gowrie which showed declining and stable trends respectively fig 4 a shows the data from bawku well with a rising groundwater levels and increasing seasonality this is located in the north eastern part of the study area the monthly box plot at bawku showed that groundwater levels variability is highest during the raining season the groundwater levels increases were observed to start in august which represents the peak of the raining season similar observations were also made at bongo datoku bonia and doninga noviransa the gowrie tingre well fig 4b showed a distinct characteristic with a relatively stable trend and with smaller overall variations than the other wells the boxplot of the monthly groundwater levels also showed a slight increase in groundwater levels throughout the year the gowrie tingre well is located few meters downstream of the vea irrigation dam hence the stable water levels observed throughout year may suggest a possible recharge from the dam 3 3 trends in groundwater levels in the study area the mann kendal test and sen s slope estimates were applied to each of the data from the monitoring wells for the trend analysis prior to the application of both mann kendal and sen s slope estimates autocorrelation test were carried out on each of the time series data in order to check for randomness in the data the lag 1 serial correlation coefficients of all the wells were statistically not significant hence no need to pre white the data therefore the statistical tests described above were applied to the original time series data the results of the statistical test on the seasonal and annual zc and qmed of the mann kendall and sen s slope of the rainfall temperature and groundwater levels in the upper east region are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the rainfall and temperature do not show any significant annual and seasonal trends however the groundwater levels show generally different magnitude of rising trend in all the wells except kabingo strong seasonal trends were observed at bongo and bawku in the north eastern and central part of the study area doninga well in the south western part of the region showed a positive trend but not significant at p value of 0 05 while the kabingo well located at the south western part showed a strong seasonal decreasing trend on the seasonal time scale the rates of change vary from 0 817 to 0 312m yr with a mean value of 0 011m yr and 0 673 to 0 412m yr with a mean value of 0 064m yr from the mann kendall and sen slope estimators respectively on the annual scale neither significant positive nor negative trends were observed in the groundwater levels in all the monitoring wells moreover rainfall and temperature showed insignificant positive and negative trends respectively in the case of the groundwater levels with the exception of doninga and datoku all other wells showed decreasing insignificant trends fig 5 showed the annual hydrograph of the groundwater levels in all the monitoring wells the results of the correlation coefficient show a general strong correlation coefficient between the groundwater levels in the area table 5 the rainfall on the other hand showed a weak correlation with almost all the wells careful analysis of fig 3 showed that the peak of the rainfall is in august however in fig 4 it can be observed that the impact of wet season rainfall on the groundwater levels was observed approximately one to two month after the rainfall peak shamsudduha et al 2009 lowest groundwater levels were observed between april and june for almost all the locations a possible reason for the observed delay between peak rainfall and groundwater response could be the attainment of a threshold rainfall to saturate the soil moisture and rock matrix before recharge takes place and navrongo rainfall may not be the representative for the whole region shamsudduha et al 2009 there was also a general strong correlation between the groundwater levels in most of the monitoring wells of this study although these correlations and fluctuations are more of location specific response to recharge at the initial stage the persistence tendency progressively spread to the whole study area by inter aquifer linkage the distinct spatial patterns of the trends also suggest a possibility of hydraulic connection between the aquifers in the region and the trends are interdependent to visualise all the factors responsible for the groundwater levels dynamics the groundwater levels were decomposed trends seasonal and residual irregular event components using decomposition method called seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess stl to resolve the trends cleveland et al 1990 fig 6 is the decomposed time series for bawku and kabingo in fig 6 it can be observed that the bawku well showed a rising trend mainly influenced by the events component with a relatively no significant change in the magnitude of the seasonal components the kabingo well on the other hand showed a declining trend and a stable seasonality over time this implies that there is no significant change in the groundwater levels from one season to the other and the observed variations are mainly influenced by the event components this method provides an improved insight into the processes that control the groundwater level by simultaneously considering all the aspects of the underlining trends of the time series the rest of the plots are presented as supplementary material supplementary fig 1 the magnitude of each trend at each of the monitoring well was determined and compared to the original this was done by comparing the variance of each component as a percentage of the variance of the original time series shamsudduha et al 2009 generally the seasonal event irregular and trend components have almost the same impact on the groundwater level with mean value of 34 7 34 7 and 34 5 respectively it is however worthy to note that the variance of the event irregular components is a major factor in the total groundwater level variance in the entire study area ranging from 19 2 to 81 high irregular variances in groundwater levels result in anomalous seasonal extremes due to flood events and extensive groundwater abstraction this observation is not surprising because the upper east region is a flood prone area and most communities get flooded during the rainy season this normally gets worse whenever there is a spillage from the bagre dam in burkina faso 3 4 model selection and forecasting of groundwater level using arima model the first step in analysing time series is to examine the autocorrelation acf and partial autocorrelation pacf the plots of acf and pacf are shown in fig 7 and supplementary material supplementary fig 2 the dashed lines represent the confidence limit it can be observed from the plots that most of the spikes were below the confidence limit after differencing suggesting stationarity of the data based on the plots the order of p and q were decided for developing the tentative arima model for all the monitoring stations the auto arima function in r was used to select the best models for each monitoring well based on the bayesian information criteria and akaike information criteria aic 3 5 model diagnostic checking and validation the selected models were first validated by a diagnostic checking of the residuals from the fitted models for any sign of randomness the plot of the residuals the autocorrelation of the residuals and the p values of the ljung box for the first ten lags of the bawku are shown in fig 8 from the plots it can be observed that the residuals of the model are independently distributed hence the model is a good model a further comparison of the forecasted and observed for rainfall and bawku groundwater levels are shown in fig 9 and the rest as supplementary data supplementary fig 3 it is observed that the forecasted groundwater levels are in close agreement and the models fits the data with some little variation that can relatively be considered as random 3 6 forecasting of rainfall and groundwater levels in the study area the results of the forecasted rainfall and the groundwater levels using the arima models are presented in fig 9 and supplementary material supplementary fig 3 in fig 9 the rainfall and the groundwater levels at bawku are shown in this example it is observed that the rainfall would decline gradually from 2015 to 2020 the average rate of decline of rainfall using the sen s slope estimate is 4 779mm yr on the other hand the groundwater levels showed a relatively stable trend in most of the wells varying in magnitude across the study area except kabingo the forecasted results in kabingo showed a significant groundwater levels decline to about 12m by 2020 with an average annual rate of decline of about 1 008m yr studies by zango et al 2014 using linear regression observed a gradual decrease in mean annual rainfall at a rate of 3 391mm yr representing 0 5 and recharge at a rate of 1 012mm yr representing 6 other studies using climate models also predicted a decline in annual precipitation run off and groundwater recharge in the volta river basin by mid 21st century lutz et al 2015 mccartney et al 2012 this predicted decline in rainfall is likely to threaten the livelihood of these communities that depend on rain fed agriculture and also push for more groundwater exploitation for domestic and agricultural use lutz et al 2015 3 7 implications for groundwater utilization in the upper east region the demand for potable water in the upper east region and ghana as a whole especially in the rural and peri urban areas has been on the increase in the last two or more decades this rise in water demand has been attributed to population growth agricultural and industrial activities at the local levels furthermore the government effort to meet the millennium development goals and quite recently the sustainable development goals has led to massive investment in the water and sanitation sector in the country this resulted in the provision of several thousands of mechanized wells boreholes and hand dug wells to rural and urban communities across the country this development has raised concerns among the various stakeholders in the water sector for proper management practices to ensure the groundwater sustainability groundwater recharge rate in the white volta basin of ghana varied from 2 5 in the driest parts to about 7 5 in the relatively wet parts and strongly dependant on rainfall andreini et al 2000 martin 2006 the relatively high estimated groundwater recharge compared to the estimated water demand of inhabitants in the area showed that recharge could currently be considered not to be a limiting factor zango et al 2014 martin 2006 the predicted groundwater levels in the white volta basin of the upper east region indicate a stable to slight increase in the groundwater levels in most of the monitoring wells however the kabingo well has decreased considerably from 2009 to 2012 and will continue to decline to 12m by 2020 the forecasted gradual decline in mean annual rainfall rate at 4 779mm yr in the study area compares well with the value of 3 391mm yr and 1 012mm yr decline in rainfall and estimated recharge in bawku municipality which form part of the study area zango et al 2014 however the magnitude of the direct impact of this on the net groundwater level is not well understood due to the absence of isotopes data to determine the contribution of surface water dams to groundwater recharge the data available cannot confirm this as the impact of the several dams and rivers on groundwater recharge have not been adequately studied previous study by zango et al 2014 on the groundwater demand and abstraction in the bawku municipality area with least rainfall shows an abstraction rate of 13 6 of the current annual groundwater recharge they further estimated a surplus of 57 1 3 72 106m3 yr between the abstraction rate and groundwater reserve these findings and the predicted stable groundwater levels in our work suggest the groundwater reserve is sustainable and can support current and future demand for domestic and food production in summary sustainable utilization of groundwater in the basin must involve a holistic management studies that include rainfall and surface water groundwater interaction well structured and dedicated climate surface water and groundwater level monitoring are needed for an informed decision on the groundwater sustainability in the area 3 8 limitations of the study and future research needs in the area one major caveat is the limitation of the data used for the analysis the maximum data available is 85 months representing about 7 5 years of data and sporadic nature of the data in some wells due to equipment failure furthermore the climate data of navrongo used cannot be a representative of the wholes upper east region hence rainfall data cannot account for spatial variation in the area another major caveat is the lack of localised sub surface geologic information hydrogeologic parameters and the extraction volumes of the hand pumps lutz et al 2015 in the future there would be a need for a more thorough evaluation of recharge patterns with respect to the onset distribution of rainfall to determine the spatial distribution of natural recharge to the aquifers so that groundwater development can be properly planned the installation of weather stations at each individual study sites and continuous monitoring of groundwater levels yield discharge and water quality will be ideal if possible to guide future studies another interesting study will be the use of stable and radioactive isotopes to study groundwater surface water interaction age of the groundwater and the potential sources of contamination to the groundwater 4 conclusion groundwater level fluctuations in seven monitoring wells in the white volta river basin of the upper east region of ghana have been assessed using non parametric mann kendal test and sen s slope estimator arima models and spatial analysis using gis were also carried out to predict the future groundwater levels and spatial variation of the trends in the area respectively the results showed a seasonal variation with no trend in rainfall and temperature the mean groundwater levels range from 1 240 to 5 460m with gowrie bawku and kabingo showing a narrow variation in groundwater levels as compared to datoku and bongo both the mann kendall and sen s slope estimator on the annual scale have shown groundwater level increase in all the monitoring wells except kabingo which showed a declining level the rate of groundwater level increase ranged from 0 312 to 0 097 with mean value of 0 247m year while the kabingo well declined to about 0 817m year on the seasonal scale neither significant positive nor negative trends were observed in the groundwater levels in all the monitoring wells forecast using arima models for the rainfall and groundwater levels indicates that there will be a significant decline in rainfall at a rate of 0 95mm year by 2020 the groundwater levels however showed relatively stable trends in most of the wells varying in magnitude across the study area ranging from 0 000 to 0 006m yr the forecasted result showed an average rate of groundwater decline of about 1 008m yr at kabingo which is expected to decrease to about 12m by 2020 in conclusion the study has revealed that current and predicted groundwater levels trends in the upper east region can sustain the current demand and have the potential for further development it is hoped that this study has provided more insight into the spatial and temporal characteristics of the groundwater levels and the need for more monitoring wells and weather observatories in the area acknowledgement the paper constitutes

12383,the activity concentrations of the gross α and β in ground water samples were determined for 178 bore wells of karnataka state of india the aim of this study was to develop a first insight regarding the radiological quality of ground water samples from karnataka state sampling and measurements were carried out from 2013 to 2014 so far there has been no detailed study in the radioactivity measurements in drinking water of karnataka state tds ph and gross alpha and gross beta activity measurements have been performed according to standards the gross alpha and gross beta activity concentrations in the bore water samples of karnataka state have been found to lie between 0 69 15 26mbq l with a mean of 5 66 0 50mbq l and 14 6 108 5mbq l with a mean of 57 76mbq l respectively in general the gross beta activity was higher than the alpha activity concentration from the value of gross alpha and gross beta it is clear that the water samples are investigated are acceptable for consumption complying with the who recommendations for drinking water the data obtained can provide information for to make decisions about potential future drinking water regulations graphical abstract fx1 keywords natural radioactivity ground water gross alpha gross beta 1 introduction water is of paramount importance for sustaining life development and the environment the availability of water is the key determinant of economic growth and social prosperity however water is a finite resource and its use for one purpose reduces its availability for other purposes availability of high quality water is the prime factor for the health condition of human natural radioactivity origins are from the decay of natural radionuclide s and their products in the earth s crust and cosmic radionuclide from outer space unscear 1988 2008 natural background radiation is measure of the radioactivity level from the naturally occurring radionuclide these radionuclides pollute the environment very easily due to the high geochemical stability of these in the environment egunyinka et al 2009 alpha emitter 226ra with a half life of 1600 years and beta emitter 228ra with a half life of 5 8 years half are isotopes rich in ground water iyengar 1990 marovic et al 1996 sidhu et al 2002 surface water especially ground water plays an important role in dissemination of the radionuclide into the earth s crust certain factor like flow rate and chemical composition of water soil ion retention and the minerals in soil influences the concentration of the radionuclide in the ground water gilkeson et al 1987 shashikumar et al 2011 concentrations of natural radionuclides in water can be related to the physico chemical conditions and the geological formation of the area therefore determining of the concentration levels of the natural and artificial radionuclides in drinking water is an important factor for public health studies which allow the assessment of population exposure to radiation by the consumption of water one of the drinking water standards were established by world health organization who for gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity concentrations who 2006 in general gross alpha beta analysis which is one of the simplest radio analytical procedures is used as the first step of the radiological characterization of drinking water as a screening method in the field of radioecology environmental monitoring and industrial applications as well its main advantages are the relatively low costs and simplicity from the literatures available for radioactivity studies in karnataka it is observed that much importance have been given for the radionuclides study and less attention have been given for the basic screening studies of radioactivity like gross α and gross β analysis hence the present study is carried out to bring about knowledge on the gross α and gross β radioactivity in karnataka state as water pollution is a matter of concern and there is a necessity for providing clean water the study is entitled analysis of gross α and gross β radioactivity in drinking waters of karnataka suriyanarayanan et al 2015 this study will provide a for baseline data for gross α and gross β for the whole karnataka and will be helpful for identify the areas much affected due to radioactivity and will be a pathway for the future studies on radioactivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area karnataka is the eighth largest state in india with an area of 1 91 791km2 constituting 5 83 of the total area of india which supports a total population of 61 095 297 it lies between the latitude of 11 30 18 25 n and longitude 74 10 78 35e agriculture is the main occupation of the state the water samples from all taluks of 29 districts with 178 different locations throughout the karnataka state have been collected maps 1 and 2 bore wells have been chosen as the water sources since expect very few majority of the people in karnataka state depending on the ground water for their drinking water sources puttaswamaiah 2004 the samples were collected in the containers and 1ml of conc hcl was added to the sample in order to prevent it from further physico chemical and biological changes in it during preservation the ph temperature and tds was recorded in the site using ph tds pen and thermometer the latitudes and longitudes were recorded using a hand held gps instrument the gross alpha and gross beta activity was carried out by standard procedure used liquid scintillation counting approved by atomic energy regulatory board aerb of india and who who 2004 guidelines the residue collected in the planchet at the end of chemical precipitation was counted for gross alpha and gross beta concentrations using an alpha counter and beta counter manufactured by nucleonix india 3 results and discussion the gross alpha and gross beta activity concentrations in the bore water samples of karnataka state have been found to lie between 0 69 15 26mbq l with a mean of 5 66 0 50mbq l and 14 6 108 5mbq l with a mean of 57 76mbq l respectively fig 1 maximum alpha activity of 15 26mbq l has been found in the samples collected from challakere hubli and in chitradurga dharwad and districts respectively among the districts chitradurga dharwad gulbera and shimoga bore well samples shows the maximum gross alpha activity regarding the gross beta activity the bore well samples from sorba of shimoga district recorded maximum of 108mbq l among the districts shimoga recorded maximum of beta activity followed by uttar kannada bangalore and chittradurga mysore tumkur fig 1 shows the frequency distribution of measured gross alpha and gross beta values from the 178 samples the variation in gross alpha and beta concentration in the different locations is mainly due to the different geology and different levels of natural radiation presents in the soil comparing the values of gross alpha and gross beta activities with others results published in the literature it is observed that gross alpha and gross beta activities of bore well water samples in karnataka are lower than values of other countries of the world like nigeria turkey bangladesh india and brazil silva and pecequilo 2011 tettey larbi et al 2013 turhan et al 2013 biswas et al 2015 devajayanthi et al 2011 it is also observed that the gross alpha and gross beta activities in bore well water samples in karnataka are lower than the water samples of other parts of india devajayanthi et al 2011 marbaniang 2011 table 1 shows the gross alpha and gross beta activities of drinking water samples around the world world health organization who 2004 advises 0 1bq l for gross alpha and 1 0bq l for gross beta activity as limit values for drinking water the results showed that the activity concentrations of gross alpha and gross beta in karnataka bore water samples did not exceed who recommended levels and were comparable with the data available in other parts of the world who 2004 3 1 gis mapping of the gross alpha and gross beta activities the conventional method of preparation of maps keeping the records of chemical analysis and trying to relate to the analytical procedures like multi layer integration tabular attribute data linkage needed for planning becomes laborious and time consuming at the same time the multi dimensions of information if linked properly and provided with a synoptic view creates a knowledge base that is essential for development oriented planning in this regard we decided to adopt a geographic information system gis approach to develop a spatial information and knowledge base on the groundwater quality of karnataka to establish its relationship with the influencing factors from the analytical results it was decided to adopt a geographic information system gis approach to develop spatial information and knowledge based on the ground water quality of karnataka has been found to be very useful the gis database of the entire state in terms of natural background radioactivity has been created for the first time in the state would go a long way in water quality monitoring also the government authorities should concentrate on water quality monitoring and surveillance strategies for karnataka the outputs of water quality mapping exercise provide a synoptic view of the taluk state and would form a powerful tool for monitoring water quality across the state the gis database also helps in decision making process by identifying the most sensitive zones that need immediate attention the planning process can also foresee the quality fluctuations and decide upon the priority schedule corrective measures and protection aspects with finer details two thematic maps for the parameters of gross alpha concentration gross beta were integrated using the addition function available in the arcgis software we created a final radioactivity quality map by overlaying thematic maps which are produced as a result of inverse distance weighted idw interpolations maps 1 and 2 gross alpha activity in natural water is mainly due to uranium and radium isotopes found in the earth crust contribution of thorium might bet rather low due to the solubility in the waters osmond and ivanovich 1992 jobbágy et al 2011 principally radium 226 radium 224 polonium 210 and occasionally thorium 232 are the main contributors to the alpha particle activity jobbágy et al 2011 blanchard et al 1985 damla et al 2006 but most of the cases uranium can be expected to be the main source of alpha activity as for the beta activity it is primarily caused by pottasium 40 radium 228 lead 210 isotopes jobbágy et al 2011 it can be established that the drinking water samples collected from 178 bore wells across the karnataka state possess least risk for causing radiation risk for long term consumption from this study it has well shown that the gross alpha and beta activity concentrations in bore well drinking waters in the karnataka state are generally acceptable for consumption satisfying the who regulations for drinking water this is the first detailed study of gross alpha and beta activity concentrations in bore well drinking waters of karnataka state our study believed to be a first study in entire karnataka gross alpha and beta activity from the study it is well clear that we should do a detailed correlation study between soil topology and seasonal variation and then it is possible to identify the soil rock samples which are the cause of high level of radioactivity hence it must be emphasized that more detailed surveys must be carried out for determine the proper doses and for a clear picture concerning the source of radioactivity and seasonal variation in these waters 4 conclusion the present work was aimed to measure the gross alpha and gross beta activity in the drinking water samples of karnataka state india to provide a baseline data for the radiation levels in the drinking water samples from the collected 178 samples the activity levels have been measured and it was found to be very low and it does radiologically not possess any threat the activity

12383,the activity concentrations of the gross α and β in ground water samples were determined for 178 bore wells of karnataka state of india the aim of this study was to develop a first insight regarding the radiological quality of ground water samples from karnataka state sampling and measurements were carried out from 2013 to 2014 so far there has been no detailed study in the radioactivity measurements in drinking water of karnataka state tds ph and gross alpha and gross beta activity measurements have been performed according to standards the gross alpha and gross beta activity concentrations in the bore water samples of karnataka state have been found to lie between 0 69 15 26mbq l with a mean of 5 66 0 50mbq l and 14 6 108 5mbq l with a mean of 57 76mbq l respectively in general the gross beta activity was higher than the alpha activity concentration from the value of gross alpha and gross beta it is clear that the water samples are investigated are acceptable for consumption complying with the who recommendations for drinking water the data obtained can provide information for to make decisions about potential future drinking water regulations graphical abstract fx1 keywords natural radioactivity ground water gross alpha gross beta 1 introduction water is of paramount importance for sustaining life development and the environment the availability of water is the key determinant of economic growth and social prosperity however water is a finite resource and its use for one purpose reduces its availability for other purposes availability of high quality water is the prime factor for the health condition of human natural radioactivity origins are from the decay of natural radionuclide s and their products in the earth s crust and cosmic radionuclide from outer space unscear 1988 2008 natural background radiation is measure of the radioactivity level from the naturally occurring radionuclide these radionuclides pollute the environment very easily due to the high geochemical stability of these in the environment egunyinka et al 2009 alpha emitter 226ra with a half life of 1600 years and beta emitter 228ra with a half life of 5 8 years half are isotopes rich in ground water iyengar 1990 marovic et al 1996 sidhu et al 2002 surface water especially ground water plays an important role in dissemination of the radionuclide into the earth s crust certain factor like flow rate and chemical composition of water soil ion retention and the minerals in soil influences the concentration of the radionuclide in the ground water gilkeson et al 1987 shashikumar et al 2011 concentrations of natural radionuclides in water can be related to the physico chemical conditions and the geological formation of the area therefore determining of the concentration levels of the natural and artificial radionuclides in drinking water is an important factor for public health studies which allow the assessment of population exposure to radiation by the consumption of water one of the drinking water standards were established by world health organization who for gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity concentrations who 2006 in general gross alpha beta analysis which is one of the simplest radio analytical procedures is used as the first step of the radiological characterization of drinking water as a screening method in the field of radioecology environmental monitoring and industrial applications as well its main advantages are the relatively low costs and simplicity from the literatures available for radioactivity studies in karnataka it is observed that much importance have been given for the radionuclides study and less attention have been given for the basic screening studies of radioactivity like gross α and gross β analysis hence the present study is carried out to bring about knowledge on the gross α and gross β radioactivity in karnataka state as water pollution is a matter of concern and there is a necessity for providing clean water the study is entitled analysis of gross α and gross β radioactivity in drinking waters of karnataka suriyanarayanan et al 2015 this study will provide a for baseline data for gross α and gross β for the whole karnataka and will be helpful for identify the areas much affected due to radioactivity and will be a pathway for the future studies on radioactivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area karnataka is the eighth largest state in india with an area of 1 91 791km2 constituting 5 83 of the total area of india which supports a total population of 61 095 297 it lies between the latitude of 11 30 18 25 n and longitude 74 10 78 35e agriculture is the main occupation of the state the water samples from all taluks of 29 districts with 178 different locations throughout the karnataka state have been collected maps 1 and 2 bore wells have been chosen as the water sources since expect very few majority of the people in karnataka state depending on the ground water for their drinking water sources puttaswamaiah 2004 the samples were collected in the containers and 1ml of conc hcl was added to the sample in order to prevent it from further physico chemical and biological changes in it during preservation the ph temperature and tds was recorded in the site using ph tds pen and thermometer the latitudes and longitudes were recorded using a hand held gps instrument the gross alpha and gross beta activity was carried out by standard procedure used liquid scintillation counting approved by atomic energy regulatory board aerb of india and who who 2004 guidelines the residue collected in the planchet at the end of chemical precipitation was counted for gross alpha and gross beta concentrations using an alpha counter and beta counter manufactured by nucleonix india 3 results and discussion the gross alpha and gross beta activity concentrations in the bore water samples of karnataka state have been found to lie between 0 69 15 26mbq l with a mean of 5 66 0 50mbq l and 14 6 108 5mbq l with a mean of 57 76mbq l respectively fig 1 maximum alpha activity of 15 26mbq l has been found in the samples collected from challakere hubli and in chitradurga dharwad and districts respectively among the districts chitradurga dharwad gulbera and shimoga bore well samples shows the maximum gross alpha activity regarding the gross beta activity the bore well samples from sorba of shimoga district recorded maximum of 108mbq l among the districts shimoga recorded maximum of beta activity followed by uttar kannada bangalore and chittradurga mysore tumkur fig 1 shows the frequency distribution of measured gross alpha and gross beta values from the 178 samples the variation in gross alpha and beta concentration in the different locations is mainly due to the different geology and different levels of natural radiation presents in the soil comparing the values of gross alpha and gross beta activities with others results published in the literature it is observed that gross alpha and gross beta activities of bore well water samples in karnataka are lower than values of other countries of the world like nigeria turkey bangladesh india and brazil silva and pecequilo 2011 tettey larbi et al 2013 turhan et al 2013 biswas et al 2015 devajayanthi et al 2011 it is also observed that the gross alpha and gross beta activities in bore well water samples in karnataka are lower than the water samples of other parts of india devajayanthi et al 2011 marbaniang 2011 table 1 shows the gross alpha and gross beta activities of drinking water samples around the world world health organization who 2004 advises 0 1bq l for gross alpha and 1 0bq l for gross beta activity as limit values for drinking water the results showed that the activity concentrations of gross alpha and gross beta in karnataka bore water samples did not exceed who recommended levels and were comparable with the data available in other parts of the world who 2004 3 1 gis mapping of the gross alpha and gross beta activities the conventional method of preparation of maps keeping the records of chemical analysis and trying to relate to the analytical procedures like multi layer integration tabular attribute data linkage needed for planning becomes laborious and time consuming at the same time the multi dimensions of information if linked properly and provided with a synoptic view creates a knowledge base that is essential for development oriented planning in this regard we decided to adopt a geographic information system gis approach to develop a spatial information and knowledge base on the groundwater quality of karnataka to establish its relationship with the influencing factors from the analytical results it was decided to adopt a geographic information system gis approach to develop spatial information and knowledge based on the ground water quality of karnataka has been found to be very useful the gis database of the entire state in terms of natural background radioactivity has been created for the first time in the state would go a long way in water quality monitoring also the government authorities should concentrate on water quality monitoring and surveillance strategies for karnataka the outputs of water quality mapping exercise provide a synoptic view of the taluk state and would form a powerful tool for monitoring water quality across the state the gis database also helps in decision making process by identifying the most sensitive zones that need immediate

12384,emerging contaminants ecs such as personal care products pcps endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pharmaceuticals phacs and their transformation products whose occurrence at trace levels in treated wastewater is of concern for human health and the aquatic ecosystem due to the relatively new introduction or detection of these pollutants there exists a gap in the knowledge on their fate behaviors and effects as well as on treatment technologies for their efficient removal furthermore despite the advances in treatment technologies the design of existing treatment plants are not suited to remove these ecs in addition to there being a lack of published health standards that provide guideline in treating these pollutants many new ecs are being introduced into the environment without detection in these context this paper reviews existing research that provide reliable and quantitative information on pharmaceuticals pcps and edcs and their concentrations in surface water ground water drinking water and treated wastewater and the removal efficiency of different treatment processes for different emerging pollutants with a focus on recent studies regarding the fate and behavior of the contaminants in wastewater treatment plants and in the environment as well the paper also highlights various biological and chemical treatment techniques and their drawbacks also this review discusses the scope of future research on ecs graphical abstract fx1 keywords emerging contaminants pharmaceuticals personal care products endocrine disrupting compounds municipal wastewater 1 introduction in the recent decades studies on wastewater characteristics have drawn attention towards the environmental occurrence of a variety of newly identified compounds of anthropogenic origin the occurrence of such trace compounds mostly organic known as the emerging pollutants and their harmful impact on both aquatic and terrestrial life forms as well as on human health is now an issue of concern among the scientists engineers and the general public as well the non regulated organic trace pollutants known as emerging micro pollutants have been recently introduced or newly detected with the help of advanced analytical technologies richardson 2007 a contaminant whose new origin alternate route to humans or new treatment techniques has been innovated is termed as emerging they are categorized by apprehensible probable or actual risk to human health and environment dod 2011 us epa 2012 they may be industrial in origin or may originate from municipal domestic agricultural hospital or laboratory wastewater in large part the compounds in question are derived from three broad categories viz a pharmaceuticals phacs b personal care products pcps and c endocrine disrupting compounds edcs but they are not confined to the above and may comprise of nanomaterials nms metabolites of ecs illegal drugs engineered genes etc nms affect the bacterial biomass during waste water treatment and thereby decrease their biological activity leading to decrease in ec removal efficiency wang et al 2012 ecs are present and have been found in surface water ground water as well as drinking water and in wastewater treatment plants wwtp discharge samaras et al 2013 yang et al 2014 cabeza et al 2012 municipal wastewater is viewed as one of the principle discharge sources for the emanation of emerging contaminants like non point and point sources industries and storm water wastewater from households and water treatment facilities into the environment ternes et al 2004 also there is a growing concern of sludge management due to high levels of ecs in them wu et al 2010 the design of the current wwtp could not restrict the elimination of the emerging contaminants and their metabolites where it is released into rivers or streams having high biodiversity as sewage effluents so far considerable work have been done in regard to the performance of wastewater technologies in case of nutrient removal molinos senante et al 2012 daughton and ternes 1999 heberer 2002 barcelo 2003 daughton 2004 petrovic et al 2009 while there is an absence of data on the ability to removal of ecs and additionally on the adverse ecotoxicological impacts of these compounds on surface water bodies pharmaceutical molecules identified in the wastewater belong to several classes of human and veterinary antibiotics human prescription and non prescription drugs and some sex and steroid hormones as well personal care products pcps include chemicals found in consumer products e g galaxolide tonalide endocrine disrupting compounds edcs can elicit adverse effects on endocrine systems as they have androgenic or estrogenic activities even at low concentrations fig 1 potential concerns from the environmental presence of these emerging contaminants include abnormal physiological processes and reproductive impairment increased incidences of cancer the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the potential increased toxicity of chemical mixtures ecs are generally not monitored in our environment and they are not regulated in our drinking water oviedo and aga 2016 the present gap of knowledge holds specifically for incessant impacts that have just seldom been explored whilst significant amount of human medicines pharmaceuticals are discharged into the environment succinct controls for ecological risk assessment are to a great extent missing prior to their discharge efficient treatment of wastewaters is required thus the occurrence of emerging contaminants at trace level in wastewaters their behavior during wastewater treatment and drinking water production are the key issues that require further study therefore this review presents an overview on the state of art as regards ecs of concern such as phacs pcps and edcs our objective is to obtain reliable and quantitative information on phacs pcps and edcs concentrations and their removal efficiency we also reviewed an account for removal efficiency of the different treatment processes for different phacs pcps and edcs focus has been given on recent studies regarding the fate and behavior of the contaminants in wwtp and in the environment as well 1 1 emerging contaminants 1 1 1 pharmaceuticals phacs phacs are a set of developing ecological contaminants that are broadly and progressively being utilized as a part of human and veterinary medication they include compounds of environmental concern like antibiotics legal and illicit drugs analgesics steroids beta blockers etc fatta kassinos et al 2010 their persistence in the body occurs due to their specific mode of action they have been detected in wwtp effluents sludge sediments natural waters drinking water and groundwater they are supposed to provoke the development of antibiotic resistant genes in soil bacteria nowadays active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and their biotransformation products which are largely unstudied are bioaccumulating and causing significant consequences to ecosystem arnold et al 2013 although these compounds have been entering the environment for many years but investigation on their adverse effects on aquatic organisms have started only recently they are considered as pseudo persistent pollutants which continually enter the environment at very low concentrations a large number of more than 160 different pharmaceuticals have as of now been detected in aquatic systems in very low concentrations of ngl 1 to low μgl 1 range kummerer 2010 there is very little knowledge about the eco toxicological impacts of pharmaceuticals on terrestrial and aquatic life forms and a complete analysis eco toxicological impact is inadequate one of the critical targets is the aquatic organisms as they are subjected to wastewater remnants over their entire life fent 2003 1 1 2 personal care products pcps pcps are yet another class of emerging contaminants that incorporate prescribed and non prescribed veterinary and human pharmaceuticals and the agile and inert elements for individual care purposes a few pcps to name are cosmetic products engineered hormones steroids perfumes shampoos etc uv filters known to have estrogenic activity are reported to be one of the most commonly found pcps in ground water and other aquatic environment jurado et al 2014 oviedo and aga 2016 pcps are released into wastewater and advance toward wwtps in their native or biologically transformed structures in wwtps the likely fates of pcps and their metabolites are conversion to co2 and water mixing with the receiving water bodies either as the original or mineralized product and sorption by the solids like sludge biosolids mainly if the compound or the biologically moderated transformation product is lipophilic 1 1 3 endocrine disruptors edcs edcs are characterized as the artificial chemicals that when ingested into the body can either copy or obstruct hormones and effect body s normal functioning the environmental protection agency epa characterizes edcs as external agents that meddle with the formation release transport attachment activity or displacement of body s natural hormones that maintains homeostasis development reproduction and behavior united states environmental protection agency usepa 1997 it is by and large acknowledged that the three main classes of edcs are estrogenic i e they mimic or alters the functioning of natural estrogens androgenic copy or obstruct natural testosterone and thyroidal causes immediate or oblique effects to the thyroid snyder et al 2003 natural and engineered edcs are discharged into the environment by human activities creatures and industries essentially through sewage treatment systems before finally going to soil surface water silt and ground water preponderance research has concentrated just on estrogenic compounds edcs are present in immensely low concentrations ngl 1 or μgl 1 in wastewater these compounds are of profound concern as their long term exposure and adverse impact on human are unknown 2 environmental health issues and regulations related to emerging contaminants due to the absence of relevant data on the impacts fate and concentration levels of emerging contaminants make it troublesome for governments to control their utilization and also manage the levels that are already persisting in the environment there are as of now no laws or mandates illustrating the upper limits of concentrations of emerging contaminants in wastewater discharge drinking water or the environment in united states a preparatory observing technique was organized and an archive was communicated illustrating the preparatory way to deal with edcs and to decrease its intrusion in people and wildlife european commission 2011 this document concentrates on the diminishment of the utilization of edcs in consumer products sustenance added substances and beauty care products however does not set any proposals for uttermost permissible concentrations in drinking water wastewater and in nature european commission 2011 the european union water framework directive ec 2013 listed 45 priority compounds with environmental quality standard eqs to be respected in aquatic environments and listed 10 others on contemporary watch list decision 2015 495 published on 24th march 2015 similar regulations were followed by switzerland for several ecs in 1995 the european union eu set 10ngl 1 and 10µgkg 1 as the concentration of phacs and pcps in surface water and soil the u s food and drug administration fda usa publicized directions for the evaluation of human drugs environmental assessment has reported the expected introduction concentration of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment as 1µgl 1 us fda 1998 eawag institute switzerland proposed similar to eqs environmental quality criteria for several ecs such as pharmaceuticals and hormones pphs and pesticides kase et al 2011 many disinfection byproducts that are transformation products of ecs after treatment are regulated by the us european union and world health organization who oviedo and aga 2016 but in canada and india there is no such regulation for ecs the water framework directive included anti inflammatory diclofenac or the synthetic hormones ethynylestradiol ee2 in the supposed watch list of priority compounds to address the risk posed by these substances collado et al 2014 european commision 2013 various phacs and edcs were enlisted in the drinking water contaminant candidate list us epa 2012 different phacs for example carbamazepine naproxen sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen gemfibrozil atenolol diclofenac erythromycin and bezafibrate have been rated prime concern pharmaceuticals to the water cycle by the global water research coalition global water research coalition 2008 contaminants from phacs pcps and edcs enter water bodies and can exceed and persist beyond acceptable levels the widespread occurrence of ecs in water has high probability of their incorporation in crops irrigated with contaminated water and posses risk to human health upon consumption hurtado et al 2016 ecs can cause harmful impacts on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife and human communities table 1 summarizes the adverse effects of ecs in the environment endocrine disrupting chemicals cause a number of reproductive and sexual abnormalities in wildlife and humans subjection to these chemicals amid pre and postnatal life can impair the development and signaling of the endocrine system the effects during development are permanent and sometimes irreversible managing ecs in water resources is a critical issue that requires attention especially in sensitive ecosystems and in rapidly developing areas however the ecological effects of ecs in natural environment are different from laboratory tests when present in the environment many factors like ph soil or water type ionizable compounds etc can influence the bioavailability of the ecs nichols et al 2015 du et al 2015 there is a need for a comprehensive framework that aims at system wide abatement source transfer fate levels using both structural and non structural approaches 3 emerging contaminants in wastewater 3 1 occurrence sources and concentration municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are by and large not furnished to manage complex pharmaceuticals as they were constructed and updated chiefly with the intension to eliminate effortlessly or modestly biodegradable carbon phosphorus and nitrogeneous substances and microbes which consistently appear at the wwtp in µgl 1 levels verlicchi et al 2012 parent human pharmaceuticals or their metabolites enter the aquatic systems through wwtps and pcps e g perfumes are released through shower waste countries like usa boyd et al 2004 japan nakada et al 2006 united kingdom ashton et al 2004 finland lindqvist et al 2005 and spain carballa et al 2004 had documented the presence of phacs and pcps in concentrations of ngl 1 to µgl 1 in wwtps nowadays engineered nanomaterials from consumer products are entering the environment which is seldom detected but can have inimical affects bour et al 2015 in march 2015 a total of 1814 consumer products with nanomaterials were included in an inventory vance et al 2015 table 2 describes the concentrations of some emerging contaminants in various environmental media studies also report that the effectiveness of removal of ecs by traditional wastewater treatment techniques such as sedimentation flocculation and active sludge treatment is low castiglioni et al 2006 lishman et al 2006 paxeus 2004 santos et al 2007 the primary origin of steroidal hormones in aquatic environment is human and animal defecation in the long run the natural and engineered hormones and their metabolites finally reach wwtp hormone replacement therapy hrth along with oral dose of progesterone estrogens and at times testosterone can add to the absolute estrogenicity of municipal wastewater the conceivable removal course of the hormones from various treatment techniques can be categorized under four procedures viz abiotic degradation biological degeneration volatilization and adsorption onto solids hamid and eskicioglu 2012 3 2 fate of ecs during wastewater treatment the traditional wastewater treatment systems for the most part comprises of an primary treatment secondary treatment and occasionally a tertiary step with various biological and physicochemical procedures accessible for every phase of the treatment in the primary treatment the solid waste substances of the wastewater such as settleable solids plastics oils and fats sand and grit etc are separated this method is common for almost all urban wastewater treatment plant uwtp and is accomplished mechanically by filtration and sedimentation nonetheless the secondary treatment which normally depends on the biological aerobic or anaerobic degradation of organic substances or nutrients can vary significantly among the various biological treatment techniques e g fixed bed bioreactors fbr membrane bioreactors mbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr etc used in uwtps the most well known technique is conventional activated sludge cas organic substances and nitrogen are removed under certain conditions by activated sludge plants through the formation of biological floc utilizing dissolved oxygen lastly in the tertiary treatment phosphorous can be removed by precipitation and filtration batt et al 2007 also some uwtps disinfection of the effluent is done by uv irradiation or chlorination before discharging them in the environment but these treatments alone do not ensure complete removal of the ecs the most common activated sludge technique which is used worldwide cannot remove all ppcps efficiently and entirely e g diclofenac and carbamazepine that are resistant to biodegradation celiz et al 2009 moreover various processes like biological and chemical degradation and photolysis may transform ecs into forms that can be more toxic than their parent compound partial oxidation of phacs leads to generation of transformation products tps with more ecotoxicity such as n 4 carbamoyl 2 imino 5 oxoimidazolidin formamido n methoxyacetic acid cofa and carboxy acyclovir are the two tps of the antiviral drug acyclovir that are more harmful than acyclovir schlüter vorberg et al 2015 disinfection byproducts dbps are yet another type of tp that is formed when organic matter present in water reacts with disinfection agents like ozone chlorine etc today more than 600 dbps are reported and the number is ever rising richardson 2011 4 effect of treatment technologies on the removal of emerging pollutants 4 1 aerobic processes 4 1 1 activated sludge process table 3 summarizes the removal efficiencies of phacs pcps and edcs by different treatment technologies in environmental media in 1999 germany canada and brazil studied the removal of edcs by activated sludge process in which they were analyzed by gc ms ms the removal efficiency for estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 was 83 99 9 and 78 respectively ternes et al 1999 a mean removal rate of 81 was found for estrogenic edcs in case of activated sludge process using yeast estrogen screen yes bioassay in sweden indicating a high efficiency of the process over other treatment processes svenson et al 2003 an overall degradation of e1 and e2 has been reported to be about 90 in activated sludge process in andersen et al 2003 while ee2 removal was found to be slower the removal efficiency of edcs in aerobic conditions was reported to be more than in anaerobic condition furuichi et al 2006 90 99 efficiency of removal of edcs by activated sludge process have been reported by leusch et al 2006 results obtained from suzuki and maruyama 2006 suggests that e1 and e2 were initially absorbed by activated sludge at a high rate and then within a few hours they were biodegraded by the same the removal of estrogens by activated sludge is independent of the dissolved organic carbon doc decomposition and nitrification this study also revealed that the activity of activated sludge noticeably decreases at lower temperature e1 concentration in wwtp effluent was found to be greater than that in influent in some instances which has been explained as a result of biotransformation of e2 into e1 johnson and sumpter 2001 layton et al 2000 reported that 70 80 of added e2 was mineralized to co2 by activated sludge obtained from wwtpsin 24h while the mineralization of ee2 was 25 75 fold less than that of e2 ee2 was also recorded to be degeneratedentirely within 6 days by nitrifying activated sludge vader et al 2000 in paris france a promising technique of tertiary treatment using fluidized bed micro grain activated carbon µgac was done and tested in large pilot scale µgac have been found to reduce bod 38 45 cod 21 48 doc 13 44 and removes pphs 60 80 pcps artificial sweeteners pesticides etc 50 90 the technique has many operational advantages as well as produces better wastewater quality as compared to powdered activated carbon pac mailler et al 2016 4 1 2 membrane bioreactor mbr and sequencing batch reactor sbrs the removal efficiency of emerging micropollutants eps under anaerobic conditions combined with mbr was reported to be very lessas compared to conventional activated sludge systems joss et al 2004 during anaerobic digestion of sludge under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions the removal efficiencies of sulfamethoxazole smx were above 99 carballa et al 2007 while hai et al 2011 reported the removal efficiencies of smx under anoxic and aerobic conditions to be 65 when cellulose was used as a primary substrate under anaerobic conditions it was seen that ethinylestradiol progesterone and metoprolol tartrate was significantly removed faster musson et al 2010 with unified process of anaerobic pre treatment followed by aerobic treatment might be a good choice for enhancement of ep removal removal efficiencies of more than 70 have been observed for some eps such as 4 nonylphenol or caffeine and trimethoprim by the amalgamation of aerobic and anaerobic processes xue et al 2010 reyes contreras et al 2011 racz et al 2012 had reported the removal of 17b estradiol e2 and 17a ethinyl estradiol ee2 with removal efficiencies of 99 3 for e2 and 95 7 for ee2 in the first 2h in sbr 1 and 98 5 and 96 4 respectively within the first 2h in sbr 2 4 2 natural aerobic processes 4 2 1 waste stabilization ponds wsp li et al 2013 reported that the wsp technology s removal efficiencies for the identified pharmaceuticals and personal care products were relatively high with the exception for carbamazepine and a general removal efficiency extending from 88 to 100 wsp technology had the greatest overall removal efficiency with an average removal efficiency of 82 and overall mass weight removal of 96 the high effectiveness of removal accomplished by this technique may be elucidated by the conjunction of various removal techniques such as biodegradation sorption and photodegradation as well as the technology s high hydraulic retention time which is around 20 30 days 4 2 2 constructed wetlands cws removal efficiencies of certain ecs such as ciprofloxacin hcl oxytetracycline hcl nadolol cotinine and enrofloxacin in cws are reported to be as high as 70 on the other hand removal efficiencies of monensin narasin and salinomycin are comparatively less in the range of 20 50 li et al 2014 it is observed that for various other pharmaceuticals the greater part of their removal efficiencies in cws seem by all accounts to be nearly or better than those in traditional wwtps thus it can be inferred that cws have great capability of being utilized as an option for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater in secondary wwtp 4 3 anaerobic treatment bench scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor study along with aerobic stirred tank reactor has been conducted for the degradation of sulfonamide sulfamerazine sponza and demirden 2007 in spite of the detected removal efficiencies up to 97 the concentration used in the study which was 90mgl 1 are not virtually similar with those found in agro based wastewaters and therefore may not be useful in mirroring the real removal mechanism and therefore might not be practical samaras et al 2013 proclaimed the consequential removal of more than 80 of ibuprofen and naproxen from sludge through anaerobic digestion in a former report carballa et al 2006 listed the removal for these compounds to be 40 and 87 using laboratory scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters muller et al 2010 studied the removal of three natural hormones viz e1 e2 and e3 in a full scale anaerobic digester with akin feed 65 35 v v primary sludge secondary sludge and found no critical removal efficiency 30 40 the conjunction of various wastewater treatment technologies exhibited more noteworthy efficiency in the removal of phthalate esters than individual treatment procedures e g the combination of anaerobic digester and a membrane bioreactor increment the efficiency of phthalate ester removal from 65 71 to 95 97 4 4 physical chemical treatment table 4 summarizes the removal efficiencies of phacs pcps and edcs by different treatment technologies in environmental media 4 4 1 activated carbon adsorption numerous hydrophobic and charged pharmaceuticals in water can be removed by activated carbon adsorption le minh et al 2010 the adsorption process predominantly consists of the subsequent steps i the solute is transported by the static fluid film encompassing the adsorbent by the bulk adsorbate movement ii film diffusion adsorbate transport across the film iii pores diffusion adsorbate diffusion through the permeable system to the active sites iv the interaction between the porous fabric and the adsorbate homem and santos 2011 the properties of the adsorbent such as specific surface area permeability polarity etc removal efficiency of the activated carbon adsorptive treatment framework in addition the inceptive concentrations of the chosen compounds e g temperature ph existence of various other species may considerably amend the sorption effectiveness of antibiotic agents aksu and tunç 2005 non particular dispersive interactions like the van der waals interaction between molecules are the prevailing means of removal of antibiotics and other organic compounds by activated carbon while the non polar antibiotics with logkow 2 are eliminated furthermore ionic polar antibiotics can be removed by the electrostatic interaction of it with the surface charge group of activated carbon snyder et al 2003 powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac both posses pronounced prospective for the adsorption of smidgen ecs especially the non polar contaminants with log kow 2 pac measurements or gac recovery substitution are necessary for better removal rates snyder et al 2006 bolong et al 2009 schafer et al 2003 proclaimed that with 5mgl 1 and contact time of 4h the removal efficiency of pac may reach up to 90 for endocrine disrupting compounds snyder et al 2006 analyzed removal efficiency at 5mgl 1 concentration and 5h contact time of pac for 66 ppcps and just nine of them were removed with less than 50 it is vital to consider the inevitable carbon redemption disposition issue pac must be discarded through land filling or different solid management technique whilst used gac should either is discarded or recovered thermal recovery used for gac requires an enormous amount of energy which may lead in a roundabout way to more prominent ecological dangers than the presence of ecs 4 4 2 hydrothermal carbonization htc of biomass in htc biomass is heated in temperatures 180 250 c under saturated pressure in water medium for several hours unlike carbonization by pyrolysis which requires very high temperatures htc is simple process and reduces energy and economical cost fernandez et al 2015 the other processes applied to the biomass are hydrolysis decarboxylation dehydration polymerization etc but their detailed reaction mechanisms are not known funke and ziegler 2010 the resultant biochar developed contains functional groups on their surface that increases their chemical reactivity and they serve as potent adsorbent roman et al 2013 kitchen and food wastes that are dumped can be used as the starting material for preparing carbonaceous adsorbent many ubiquitously available agro industrial wastes have been utilized as precursor to produce biochar such as sunflower stem olives and walnut shells roman et al 2012 orange peels fernandez et al 2015 corn silage and poultry waste oliveira et al 2013 empty bunches of palm parshetti et al 2013 4 4 3 coagulation flocculation coagulation is the alteration of colloidal particles causing aggregation by chemicals allowing them to flump over time in a study it is reported that certain pharmaceuticals such as betaxolol warfarin and hydrochlorothiazide are removed 80 removal efficiency using aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 by coagulation flocculation combined with sand filtration huerta fontela et al 2011 few antibiotics have been observed to be removed fairly adequately by this process choi et al 2008 musk compounds personal care products in particular celestolide galaxolide and tonalide from hospital wastewater were reported to be removed with notable removal rates of 83 79 and 78 respectively suarez et al 2009 many aspects such as ph temperature coagulant type and quantity etc govern the efficacy of the coagulation process the utilization of aluminum sulfate as a coagulant was turned out to be profoundly powerful in eliminating certain hydrophobic pharmaceuticals specifically doxazosin warfarin chlordiazepoxide bromazepam betaxolol etc huerta fontela et al 2011 on the other hand for estrone and estradiol the efficiency was found to be less than 5 bundy et al 2007 le minh et al 2010 it was also found that coagulants that are pre hydrolyzed polyferroussulphate pfs polyaluminium chloride pacl polyferric chloride pfcl etc can remove soluble dyes more effectively than hydrolyzing metal salts verma et al 2012 pcps or musk were reported to be removed by ferric chloride suarez et al 2009 the media ph likewise impacts the level of dissociation of the contaminants and thus shows definite removal operation for specific kind of coagulant zhao et al 2008 4 4 4 advanced oxidation process aops biological oxidation process has many advantages but some of the biorefractory compounds are not effectively removed lor et al 2012 aops can be applied pre and or post biological treatments oxidative debasement can happen either by direct response with the administered oxidant or by means of formation of reactive secondary species such as hydroxyl radicals oh metcalf and eddy 2007 aops refer to the processes that assist the elevated generation of hydroxyl radicals the generation of hydroxyl radicals usually starts with uv radiation and can be attained by various methods e g photo catalysis using titanium dioxide tio2 egerton et al 2006 murray and parsons 2006 or electrooxidation using boron doped diamond electrodes barrios et al 2015 or by direct reaction of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 other aops are ozone h2o2 uv ozone etc that enhances hydroxyl radical production aops are very proficient novel strategies for water and wastewater treatment legrini et al 1993 klavarioti et al 2009 malato et al 2009 ho is intense oxidizing agent that oxidizes organic matter litter 2005 but it is non specific catalysis this property is of great significance in wastewater treatment since radicals strafe oxidizable organic compounds with rate of 106 109m 1 s 1 andreozzi et al 2003 the adaptability of the aops is improved by the reality there are diverse methods for creating hydroxyl radicals expediting assent with particular treatment necessities the main drawback of this process is the economic constraint therefore nowadays environment friendly energy saving techniques using solar energy for oxidation is used an investigation using solar heterogeneous photocatalysis with tio2 ozonation and solar photo fenton using fe iii was done and it was found that photocatalytic ozonation offers a higher degradation rate than photocatalytic oxidation gimeno et al 2016 the most well known aops that have been utilized and assessed chiefly at a bench scale and also at pilot scale are ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 photolysis using uv fenton reagent homogeneous semiconductors heterogeneous and ultrasound sonolysis 4 4 5 ozonation ozonation treatment technology is based on the use of ozone gas which is a strong oxidizing agent and also as a disinfectant ozone after the reaction with microbes and their products and other chemicals is transformed into oxygen about 90 removal efficiency was noted by ozonation for aromatic compounds that are abundant in electron e g sulfamethoxazoles and additionally those compounds with deprotonated amine groups e g trimethoprim and also non aromatic alkenes as they are profoundly amendable to oxidative reactions dickenson et al 2009 amid wastewater ozonation numerous antibiotics e g sulfonamides fluoroquinolones and macrolides have been appeared to be prevalently changed by ozone dodd et al 2006 while n4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole cephalexin and penicillin were changed to a huge degree by hydroxyl groups dodd et al 2006 the bactericidal characteristics of anti microbials are deactivated by ozone by altering the functional groups for example dimethylamino groups and n etheroxime lange et al 2006 aniline part of sulfonamides huber et al 2005 etc 4 4 6 chlorination chemical compounds can be made non functional by inactivating the functional groups by chlorine substitution or addition crain and gottlieb 1935 on the other hand compounds like antibiotics having active properties may be oxidized disintegrated by chlorine crain and gottlieb 1935 the efficacious removal of antibiotic agents by chlorination from drinking water needs adequate free chlorine and enough contact time a chlorine concentration of 1 2mgl 1 contact time of 24h diminution of antibiotics in drinking water viz 99 for tetracyclines 42 for trimethoprim 50 80 for sulfonamides 30 40 for fluoroquinolones and less than 10 for macrolides were accomplished and these were entirely removed after the duration of 10 days gibs et al 2007 at chlorine concentrations of 3 5 3 8mgl 1 and time interval of one day expulsions of 90 to 99 were accomplished for sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and erythromycin in river water westerhoff et al 2005 albeit a few antibiotics might be more impervious to chlorination than others they appear to slowly degenerate when subjected to free chlorine moreover with increase in organic matters in the water the ideal concentration and contact time should be increased reactivity of sulfonamides with hocl decreases in the subsequent manner sulfadiamethoxine sulfathiazole sulfamethazine sulfamerazine sulfamethoxazole sulfamethizole chamberlain and adams 2006 a ph greater than 8 alkaline restrains the expulsion of sulfonamides by chlorine oxidation chamberlain and adams 2006 gibs et al 2007 huber et al 2005 detected that in water the reaction between clo2 and antibiotics e g sulfonamides and macrolides are rapid chlorine reacts with organic matter to produce toxic byproducts hence chlorination technique for treatment is of concern 4 4 7 ultraviolet uv irradiation uv radiation can be utilized to debase the organic matter in water rosenfeldt and linden 2004 degradation is administered by quantum yield of the compounds and the amount of uv imbibed kim et al 2009 the contact time dosage and doc concentration are additionally imperative variables regulating the removal efficiency the radiation emitted from uv light has germicidal properties and is used as a wastewater disinfectant appropriate dose of uv radiation has ended up being a successful bactericide and virucide for wastewater not adding to build up of byproducts uv rays are utilized generally for microbial purification of wastewater besides they have been utilized for removal of micropollutants uv rays are absorbed by various pharmaceuticals edcs and pcps that contains chromophores which are transformed amid uv treatment it was accounted for that uv light delivered by mercury lamps oxidizes pcps and with the introduction of hydrogen peroxide shows elevated transformation rates nevertheless uv illumination is to some degree costlier when analogized with most other traditional treatment techniques 4 4 8 nano filtration nf pharmaceuticals can be removed by nf films by means of three methods adsorption electrostatic repulsion and sieving dolara et al 2012 depending on various compounds the removal efficiencies vary and is stringently associated to a the micro pollutants physicochemical properties viz size solvency hydrophobicity charge polarity etc b film properties porousness pore size hydrophobicity and surface charge and c membrane functioning conditions such as flux transmembrane pressure dismissals recuperation and water supply quality nf has been shown to be a propitious option for dispensing with pharmaceuticals as it can accomplish more than 90 removal efficiency bolong et al 2009 5 future research perspectives relatively little data is available with respect to the adequacy of recent treatment techniques including chemical and biological treatments membrane filtration adsorption processes etc nevertheless with the guide of a couple of essential molecular and physicochemical properties it has been conceivable to subjectively describe the sensitivity of different antibiotic agents to some of the removal processes while it seems to be no processes with good efficiency for the removal of every single ec under regular operational conditions inferring that prudent treatment techniques should be applied for the efficacious removal with the development of advanced analytical instruments it is possible to quantify the emerging contaminants approach should also be made to detect new ecs in our complex environment and to find their efficient removal strategies a large number of new emerging contaminants are emanating that are not reported or detected due to the lack of knowledge the knowledge about the fate of persistent transformation products after the treatment of ecs that can be more harmful and toxic to the environment is still lacking the absence of ecs does not guarantee lack of tps also the ecs behave differently in natural environment and shows different ecotoxicological effects that cannot be predicted by conventional tests in labs therefore it is required to develop new protocols for ecotoxicity test and measure different effects by using different organisms with suitable endpoints it is suggested that more exhaustive studies be led to fill knowledge gaps in the conduct of ecs under traditional sewage treatment and advanced treatment techniques future research ought to incorporate a keen emphasis on the treatment techniques and fate of these contaminants into the sewage biomass and their conversion into more toxic or pharmacologically active metabolites during the treatment combination of treatment methods should be applied for removal of ecs that is more efficient in removing rather than treatment applying single technique or conventional methods besides future research ought to govern and delineate all fundamental treatment plant operational variables since these are crucial for later correlation or analysis in summary the appearance of emerging contaminants in the nature has become more evident as persistently enhancing assay methods have brought down the limit of detection for a broad cluster of ecs in natural specimens ecs are commonly found in the water environment since at standard temperatures and pressures ecs dissolve nimbly without being evaporated although individual ec parameters occurring usually at ngl 1 levels their impact on the environment and human health is unknown particularly the additive effects have still not been considered also it is important to direct research on the prevalence fate and treatment of human originated metabolites in wwtps majority of antibiotics and their byproducts are discharged into the municipal sewage by men notwithstanding there is very few knowledge about their behavior and biodegradability in water in future to predict the sources fate and behaviors of ecs in the water environment researchers should concentrate on the development of a risk based screening models and framework acknowledgement this work is financially supported by asia pacific network apn under global

12384,emerging contaminants ecs such as personal care products pcps endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pharmaceuticals phacs and their transformation products whose occurrence at trace levels in treated wastewater is of concern for human health and the aquatic ecosystem due to the relatively new introduction or detection of these pollutants there exists a gap in the knowledge on their fate behaviors and effects as well as on treatment technologies for their efficient removal furthermore despite the advances in treatment technologies the design of existing treatment plants are not suited to remove these ecs in addition to there being a lack of published health standards that provide guideline in treating these pollutants many new ecs are being introduced into the environment without detection in these context this paper reviews existing research that provide reliable and quantitative information on pharmaceuticals pcps and edcs and their concentrations in surface water ground water drinking water and treated wastewater and the removal efficiency of different treatment processes for different emerging pollutants with a focus on recent studies regarding the fate and behavior of the contaminants in wastewater treatment plants and in the environment as well the paper also highlights various biological and chemical treatment techniques and their drawbacks also this review discusses the scope of future research on ecs graphical abstract fx1 keywords emerging contaminants pharmaceuticals personal care products endocrine disrupting compounds municipal wastewater 1 introduction in the recent decades studies on wastewater characteristics have drawn attention towards the environmental occurrence of a variety of newly identified compounds of anthropogenic origin the occurrence of such trace compounds mostly organic known as the emerging pollutants and their harmful impact on both aquatic and terrestrial life forms as well as on human health is now an issue of concern among the scientists engineers and the general public as well the non regulated organic trace pollutants known as emerging micro pollutants have been recently introduced or newly detected with the help of advanced analytical technologies richardson 2007 a contaminant whose new origin alternate route to humans or new treatment techniques has been innovated is termed as emerging they are categorized by apprehensible probable or actual risk to human health and environment dod 2011 us epa 2012 they may be industrial in origin or may originate from municipal domestic agricultural hospital or laboratory wastewater in large part the compounds in question are derived from three broad categories viz a pharmaceuticals phacs b personal care products pcps and c endocrine disrupting compounds edcs but they are not confined to the above and may comprise of nanomaterials nms metabolites of ecs illegal drugs engineered genes etc nms affect the bacterial biomass during waste water treatment and thereby decrease their biological activity leading to decrease in ec removal efficiency wang et al 2012 ecs are present and have been found in surface water ground water as well as drinking water and in wastewater treatment plants wwtp discharge samaras et al 2013 yang et al 2014 cabeza et al 2012 municipal wastewater is viewed as one of the principle discharge sources for the emanation of emerging contaminants like non point and point sources industries and storm water wastewater from households and water treatment facilities into the environment ternes et al 2004 also there is a growing concern of sludge management due to high levels of ecs in them wu et al 2010 the design of the current wwtp could not restrict the elimination of the emerging contaminants and their metabolites where it is released into rivers or streams having high biodiversity as sewage effluents so far considerable work have been done in regard to the performance of wastewater technologies in case of nutrient removal molinos senante et al 2012 daughton and ternes 1999 heberer 2002 barcelo 2003 daughton 2004 petrovic et al 2009 while there is an absence of data on the ability to removal of ecs and additionally on the adverse ecotoxicological impacts of these compounds on surface water bodies pharmaceutical molecules identified in the wastewater belong to several classes of human and veterinary antibiotics human prescription and non prescription drugs and some sex and steroid hormones as well personal care products pcps include chemicals found in consumer products e g galaxolide tonalide endocrine disrupting compounds edcs can elicit adverse effects on endocrine systems as they have androgenic or estrogenic activities even at low concentrations fig 1 potential concerns from the environmental presence of these emerging contaminants include abnormal physiological processes and reproductive impairment increased incidences of cancer the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the potential increased toxicity of chemical mixtures ecs are generally not monitored in our environment and they are not regulated in our drinking water oviedo and aga 2016 the present gap of knowledge holds specifically for incessant impacts that have just seldom been explored whilst significant amount of human medicines pharmaceuticals are discharged into the environment succinct controls for ecological risk assessment are to a great extent missing prior to their discharge efficient treatment of wastewaters is required thus the occurrence of emerging contaminants at trace level in wastewaters their behavior during wastewater treatment and drinking water production are the key issues that require further study therefore this review presents an overview on the state of art as regards ecs of concern such as phacs pcps and edcs our objective is to obtain reliable and quantitative information on phacs pcps and edcs concentrations and their removal efficiency we also reviewed an account for removal efficiency of the different treatment processes for different phacs pcps and edcs focus has been given on recent studies regarding the fate and behavior of the contaminants in wwtp and in the environment as well 1 1 emerging contaminants 1 1 1 pharmaceuticals phacs phacs are a set of developing ecological contaminants that are broadly and progressively being utilized as a part of human and veterinary medication they include compounds of environmental concern like antibiotics legal and illicit drugs analgesics steroids beta blockers etc fatta kassinos et al 2010 their persistence in the body occurs due to their specific mode of action they have been detected in wwtp effluents sludge sediments natural waters drinking water and groundwater they are supposed to provoke the development of antibiotic resistant genes in soil bacteria nowadays active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and their biotransformation products which are largely unstudied are bioaccumulating and causing significant consequences to ecosystem arnold et al 2013 although these compounds have been entering the environment for many years but investigation on their adverse effects on aquatic organisms have started only recently they are considered as pseudo persistent pollutants which continually enter the environment at very low concentrations a large number of more than 160 different pharmaceuticals have as of now been detected in aquatic systems in very low concentrations of ngl 1 to low μgl 1 range kummerer 2010 there is very little knowledge about the eco toxicological impacts of pharmaceuticals on terrestrial and aquatic life forms and a complete analysis eco toxicological impact is inadequate one of the critical targets is the aquatic organisms as they are subjected to wastewater remnants over their entire life fent 2003 1 1 2 personal care products pcps pcps are yet another class of emerging contaminants that incorporate prescribed and non prescribed veterinary and human pharmaceuticals and the agile and inert elements for individual care purposes a few pcps to name are cosmetic products engineered hormones steroids perfumes shampoos etc uv filters known to have estrogenic activity are reported to be one of the most commonly found pcps in ground water and other aquatic environment jurado et al 2014 oviedo and aga 2016 pcps are released into wastewater and advance toward wwtps in their native or biologically transformed structures in wwtps the likely fates of pcps and their metabolites are conversion to co2 and water mixing with the receiving water bodies either as the original or mineralized product and sorption by the solids like sludge biosolids mainly if the compound or the biologically moderated transformation product is lipophilic 1 1 3 endocrine disruptors edcs edcs are characterized as the artificial chemicals that when ingested into the body can either copy or obstruct hormones and effect body s normal functioning the environmental protection agency epa characterizes edcs as external agents that meddle with the formation release transport attachment activity or displacement of body s natural hormones that maintains homeostasis development reproduction and behavior united states environmental protection agency usepa 1997 it is by and large acknowledged that the three main classes of edcs are estrogenic i e they mimic or alters the functioning of natural estrogens androgenic copy or obstruct natural testosterone and thyroidal causes immediate or oblique effects to the thyroid snyder et al 2003 natural and engineered edcs are discharged into the environment by human activities creatures and industries essentially through sewage treatment systems before finally going to soil surface water silt and ground water preponderance research has concentrated just on estrogenic compounds edcs are present in immensely low concentrations ngl 1 or μgl 1 in wastewater these compounds are of profound concern as their long term exposure and adverse impact on human are unknown 2 environmental health issues and regulations related to emerging contaminants due to the absence of relevant data on the impacts fate and concentration levels of emerging contaminants make it troublesome for governments to control their utilization and also manage the levels that are already persisting in the environment there are as of now no laws or mandates illustrating the upper limits of concentrations of emerging contaminants in wastewater discharge drinking water or the environment in united states a preparatory observing technique was organized and an archive was communicated illustrating the preparatory way to deal with edcs and to decrease its intrusion in people and wildlife european commission 2011 this document concentrates on the diminishment of the utilization of edcs in consumer products sustenance added substances and beauty care products however does not set any proposals for uttermost permissible concentrations in drinking water wastewater and in nature european commission 2011 the european union water framework directive ec 2013 listed 45 priority compounds with environmental quality standard eqs to be respected in aquatic environments and listed 10 others on contemporary watch list decision 2015 495 published on 24th march 2015 similar regulations were followed by switzerland for several ecs in 1995 the european union eu set 10ngl 1 and 10µgkg 1 as the concentration of phacs and pcps in surface water and soil the u s food and drug administration fda usa publicized directions for the evaluation of human drugs environmental assessment has reported the expected introduction concentration of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment as 1µgl 1 us fda 1998 eawag institute switzerland proposed similar to eqs environmental quality criteria for several ecs such as pharmaceuticals and hormones pphs and pesticides kase et al 2011 many disinfection byproducts that are transformation products of ecs after treatment are regulated by the us european union and world health organization who oviedo and aga 2016 but in canada and india there is no such regulation for ecs the water framework directive included anti inflammatory diclofenac or the synthetic hormones ethynylestradiol ee2 in the supposed watch list of priority compounds to address the risk posed by these substances collado et al 2014 european commision 2013 various phacs and edcs were enlisted in the drinking water contaminant candidate list us epa 2012 different phacs for example carbamazepine naproxen sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen gemfibrozil atenolol diclofenac erythromycin and bezafibrate have been rated prime concern pharmaceuticals to the water cycle by the global water research coalition global water research coalition 2008 contaminants from phacs pcps and edcs enter water bodies and can exceed and persist beyond acceptable levels the widespread occurrence of ecs in water has high probability of their incorporation in crops irrigated with contaminated water and posses risk to human health upon consumption hurtado et al 2016 ecs can cause harmful impacts on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife and human communities table 1 summarizes the adverse effects of ecs in the environment endocrine disrupting chemicals cause a number of reproductive and sexual abnormalities in wildlife and humans subjection to these chemicals amid pre and postnatal life can impair the development and signaling of the endocrine system the effects during development are permanent and sometimes irreversible managing ecs in water resources is a critical issue that requires attention especially in sensitive ecosystems and in rapidly developing areas however the ecological effects of ecs in natural environment are different from laboratory tests when present in the environment many factors like ph soil or water type ionizable compounds etc can influence the bioavailability of the ecs nichols et al 2015 du et al 2015 there is a need for a comprehensive framework that aims at system wide abatement source transfer fate levels using both structural and non structural approaches 3 emerging contaminants in wastewater 3 1 occurrence sources and concentration municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are by and large not furnished to manage complex pharmaceuticals as they were constructed and updated chiefly with the intension to eliminate effortlessly or modestly biodegradable carbon phosphorus and nitrogeneous substances and microbes which consistently appear at the wwtp in µgl 1 levels verlicchi et al 2012 parent human pharmaceuticals or their metabolites enter the aquatic systems through wwtps and pcps e g perfumes are released through shower waste countries like usa boyd et al 2004 japan nakada et al 2006 united kingdom ashton et al 2004 finland lindqvist et al 2005 and spain carballa et al 2004 had documented the presence of phacs and pcps in concentrations of ngl 1 to µgl 1 in wwtps nowadays engineered nanomaterials from consumer products are entering the environment which is seldom detected but can have inimical affects bour et al 2015 in march 2015 a total of 1814 consumer products with nanomaterials were included in an inventory vance et al 2015 table 2 describes the concentrations of some emerging contaminants in various environmental media studies also report that the effectiveness of removal of ecs by traditional wastewater treatment techniques such as sedimentation flocculation and active sludge treatment is low castiglioni et al 2006 lishman et al 2006 paxeus 2004 santos et al 2007 the primary origin of steroidal hormones in aquatic environment is human and animal defecation in the long run the natural and engineered hormones and their metabolites finally reach wwtp hormone replacement therapy hrth along with oral dose of progesterone estrogens and at times testosterone can add to the absolute estrogenicity of municipal wastewater the conceivable removal course of the hormones from various treatment techniques can be categorized under four procedures viz abiotic degradation biological degeneration volatilization and adsorption onto solids hamid and eskicioglu 2012 3 2 fate of ecs during wastewater treatment the traditional wastewater treatment systems for the most part comprises of an primary treatment secondary treatment and occasionally a tertiary step with various biological and physicochemical procedures accessible for every phase of the treatment in the primary treatment the solid waste substances of the wastewater such as settleable solids plastics oils and fats sand and grit etc are separated this method is common for almost all urban wastewater treatment plant uwtp and is accomplished mechanically by filtration and sedimentation nonetheless the secondary treatment which normally depends on the biological aerobic or anaerobic degradation of organic substances or nutrients can vary significantly among the various biological treatment techniques e g fixed bed bioreactors fbr membrane bioreactors mbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr etc used in uwtps the most well known technique is conventional activated sludge cas organic substances and nitrogen are removed under certain conditions by activated sludge plants through the formation of biological floc utilizing dissolved oxygen lastly in the tertiary treatment phosphorous can be removed by precipitation and filtration batt et al 2007 also some uwtps disinfection of the effluent is done by uv irradiation or chlorination before discharging them in the environment but these treatments alone do not ensure complete removal of the ecs the most common activated sludge technique which is used worldwide cannot remove all ppcps efficiently and entirely e g diclofenac and carbamazepine that are resistant to biodegradation celiz et al 2009 moreover various processes like biological and chemical degradation and photolysis may transform ecs into forms that can be more toxic than their parent compound partial oxidation of phacs leads to generation of transformation products tps with more ecotoxicity such as n 4 carbamoyl 2 imino 5 oxoimidazolidin formamido n methoxyacetic acid cofa and carboxy acyclovir are the two tps of the antiviral drug acyclovir that are more harmful than acyclovir schlüter vorberg et al 2015 disinfection byproducts dbps are yet another type of tp that is formed when organic matter present in water reacts with disinfection agents like ozone chlorine etc today more than 600 dbps are reported and the number is ever rising richardson 2011 4 effect of treatment technologies on the removal of emerging pollutants 4 1 aerobic processes 4 1 1 activated sludge process table 3 summarizes the removal efficiencies of phacs pcps and edcs by different treatment technologies in environmental media in 1999 germany canada and brazil studied the removal of edcs by activated sludge process in which they were analyzed by gc ms ms the removal efficiency for estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 was 83 99 9 and 78 respectively ternes et al 1999 a mean removal rate of 81 was found for estrogenic edcs in case of activated sludge process using yeast estrogen screen yes bioassay in sweden indicating a high efficiency of the process over other treatment processes svenson et al 2003 an overall degradation of e1 and e2 has been reported to be about 90 in activated sludge process in andersen et al 2003 while ee2 removal was found to be slower the removal efficiency of edcs in aerobic conditions was reported to be more than in anaerobic condition furuichi et al 2006 90 99 efficiency of removal of edcs by activated sludge process have been reported by leusch et al 2006 results obtained from suzuki and maruyama 2006 suggests that e1 and e2 were initially absorbed by activated sludge at a high rate and then within a few hours they were biodegraded by the same the removal of estrogens by activated sludge is independent of the dissolved organic carbon doc decomposition and nitrification this study also revealed that the activity of activated sludge noticeably decreases at lower temperature e1 concentration in wwtp effluent was found to be greater than that in influent in some instances which has been explained as a result of biotransformation of e2 into e1 johnson and sumpter 2001 layton et al 2000 reported that 70 80 of added e2 was mineralized to co2 by activated sludge obtained from wwtpsin 24h while the mineralization of ee2 was 25 75 fold less than that of e2 ee2 was also recorded to be degeneratedentirely within 6 days by nitrifying activated sludge vader et al 2000 in paris france a promising technique of tertiary treatment using fluidized bed micro grain activated carbon µgac was done and tested in large pilot scale µgac have been found to reduce bod 38 45 cod 21 48 doc 13 44 and removes pphs 60 80 pcps artificial sweeteners pesticides etc 50 90 the technique has many operational advantages as well as produces better wastewater quality as compared to powdered activated carbon pac mailler et al 2016 4 1 2 membrane bioreactor mbr and sequencing batch reactor sbrs the removal efficiency of emerging micropollutants eps under anaerobic conditions combined with mbr was reported to be very lessas compared to conventional activated sludge systems joss et al 2004 during anaerobic digestion of sludge under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions the removal efficiencies of sulfamethoxazole smx were above 99 carballa et al 2007 while hai et al 2011 reported the removal efficiencies of smx under anoxic and aerobic conditions to be 65 when cellulose was used as a primary substrate under anaerobic conditions it was seen that ethinylestradiol progesterone and metoprolol tartrate was significantly removed faster musson et al 2010 with unified process of anaerobic pre treatment followed by aerobic treatment might be a good choice for enhancement of ep removal removal efficiencies of more than 70 have been observed for some eps such as 4 nonylphenol or caffeine and trimethoprim by the amalgamation of aerobic and anaerobic processes xue et al 2010 reyes contreras et al 2011 racz et al 2012 had reported the removal of 17b estradiol e2 and 17a ethinyl estradiol ee2 with removal efficiencies of 99 3 for e2 and 95 7 for ee2 in the first 2h in sbr 1 and 98 5 and 96 4 respectively within the first 2h in sbr 2 4 2 natural aerobic processes 4 2 1 waste stabilization ponds wsp li et al 2013 reported that the wsp technology s removal efficiencies for the identified pharmaceuticals and personal care products were relatively high with the exception for carbamazepine and a general removal efficiency extending from 88 to 100 wsp technology had the greatest overall removal efficiency with an average removal efficiency of 82 and overall mass weight removal of 96 the high effectiveness of removal accomplished by this technique may be elucidated by the conjunction of various removal techniques such as biodegradation sorption and photodegradation as well as the technology s high hydraulic retention time which is around 20 30 days 4 2 2 constructed wetlands cws removal efficiencies of certain ecs such as ciprofloxacin hcl oxytetracycline hcl nadolol cotinine and enrofloxacin in cws are reported to be as high as 70 on the other hand removal efficiencies of monensin narasin and salinomycin are comparatively less in the range of 20 50 li et al 2014 it is observed that for various other pharmaceuticals the greater part of their removal efficiencies in cws seem by all accounts to be nearly or better than those in traditional wwtps thus it can be inferred that cws have great capability of being utilized as an option for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater in secondary wwtp 4 3 anaerobic treatment bench scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor study along with aerobic stirred tank reactor has been conducted for the degradation of sulfonamide sulfamerazine sponza and demirden 2007 in spite of the detected removal efficiencies up to 97 the concentration used in the study which was 90mgl 1 are not virtually similar with those found in agro based wastewaters and therefore may not be useful in mirroring the real removal mechanism and therefore might not be practical samaras et al 2013 proclaimed the consequential removal of more than 80 of ibuprofen and naproxen from sludge through anaerobic digestion in a former report carballa et al 2006 listed the removal for these compounds to be 40 and 87 using laboratory scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters muller et al 2010 studied the removal of three natural hormones viz e1 e2 and e3 in a full scale anaerobic digester with akin feed 65 35 v v primary sludge secondary sludge and found no critical removal efficiency 30 40 the conjunction of various wastewater treatment technologies exhibited more noteworthy efficiency in the removal of phthalate esters than individual treatment procedures e g the combination of anaerobic digester and a membrane bioreactor increment the efficiency of phthalate ester removal from 65 71 to 95 97 4 4 physical chemical treatment table 4 summarizes the removal efficiencies of phacs pcps and edcs by different treatment technologies in environmental media 4 4 1 activated carbon adsorption numerous hydrophobic and charged pharmaceuticals in water can be removed by activated carbon adsorption le minh et al 2010 the adsorption process predominantly consists of the subsequent steps i the solute is transported by the static fluid film encompassing the adsorbent by the bulk adsorbate movement ii film diffusion adsorbate transport across the film iii pores diffusion adsorbate diffusion through the permeable system to the active sites iv the interaction between the porous fabric and the adsorbate homem and santos 2011 the properties of the adsorbent such as specific surface area permeability polarity etc removal efficiency of the activated carbon adsorptive treatment framework in addition the inceptive concentrations of the chosen compounds e g temperature ph existence of various other species may considerably amend the sorption effectiveness of antibiotic agents aksu and tunç 2005 non particular dispersive interactions like the van der waals interaction between molecules are the prevailing means of removal of antibiotics and other organic compounds by activated carbon while the non polar antibiotics with logkow 2 are eliminated furthermore ionic polar antibiotics can be removed by the electrostatic interaction of it with the surface charge group of activated carbon snyder et al 2003 powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac both posses pronounced prospective for the adsorption of smidgen ecs especially the non polar contaminants with log kow 2 pac measurements or gac recovery substitution are necessary for better removal rates snyder et al 2006 bolong et al 2009 schafer et al 2003 proclaimed that with 5mgl 1 and contact time of 4h the removal efficiency of pac may reach up to 90 for endocrine disrupting compounds snyder et al 2006 analyzed removal efficiency at 5mgl 1 concentration and 5h contact time of pac for 66 ppcps and just nine of them were removed with less than 50 it is vital to consider the inevitable carbon redemption disposition issue pac must be discarded through land filling or different solid management technique whilst used gac should either is discarded or recovered thermal recovery used for gac requires an enormous amount of energy which may lead in a roundabout way to more prominent ecological dangers than the presence of ecs 4 4 2 hydrothermal carbonization htc of biomass in htc biomass is heated in temperatures 180 250 c under saturated pressure in water medium for several hours unlike carbonization by pyrolysis which requires very high temperatures htc is simple process and reduces energy and economical cost fernandez et al 2015 the other processes applied to the biomass are hydrolysis decarboxylation dehydration polymerization etc but their detailed reaction mechanisms are not known funke and ziegler 2010 the resultant biochar developed contains functional groups on their surface that increases their chemical reactivity and they serve as potent adsorbent roman et al 2013 kitchen and food wastes that are dumped can be used as the starting material for preparing carbonaceous adsorbent many ubiquitously available agro industrial wastes have been utilized as precursor to produce biochar such as sunflower stem olives and walnut shells roman et al 2012 orange peels fernandez et al 2015 corn silage and poultry waste oliveira et al 2013 empty bunches of palm parshetti et al 2013 4 4 3 coagulation flocculation coagulation is the alteration of colloidal particles causing aggregation by chemicals allowing them to flump over time in a study it is reported that certain pharmaceuticals such as betaxolol warfarin and hydrochlorothiazide are removed 80 removal efficiency using aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 by coagulation flocculation combined with sand filtration huerta fontela et al 2011 few antibiotics have been observed to be removed fairly adequately by this process choi et al 2008 musk compounds personal care products in particular celestolide galaxolide and tonalide from hospital wastewater were reported to be removed with notable removal rates of 83 79 and 78 respectively suarez et al 2009 many aspects such as ph temperature coagulant type and quantity etc govern the efficacy of the coagulation process the utilization of aluminum sulfate as a coagulant was turned out to be profoundly powerful in eliminating certain hydrophobic pharmaceuticals specifically doxazosin warfarin chlordiazepoxide bromazepam betaxolol etc huerta fontela et al 2011 on the other hand for estrone and estradiol the efficiency was found to be less than 5 bundy et al 2007 le minh et al 2010 it was also found that coagulants that are pre hydrolyzed polyferroussulphate pfs polyaluminium chloride pacl polyferric chloride pfcl etc can remove soluble dyes more effectively than hydrolyzing metal salts verma et al 2012 pcps or musk were reported to be removed by ferric chloride suarez et al 2009 the media ph likewise impacts the level of dissociation of the contaminants and thus shows definite removal operation for specific kind of coagulant zhao et al 2008 4 4 4 advanced oxidation process aops biological oxidation process has many advantages but some of the biorefractory compounds are not effectively removed lor et al 2012 aops can be applied pre and or post biological treatments oxidative debasement can happen either by direct response with the administered oxidant or by means of formation of reactive secondary species such as hydroxyl radicals oh metcalf and eddy 2007 aops refer to the processes that assist the elevated generation of hydroxyl radicals the generation of hydroxyl radicals usually starts with uv radiation and can be attained by various methods e g photo catalysis using titanium dioxide tio2 egerton et al 2006 murray and parsons 2006 or electrooxidation using boron doped diamond electrodes barrios et al 2015 or by direct reaction of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 other aops are ozone h2o2 uv ozone etc that enhances hydroxyl radical production aops are very proficient novel strategies for water and wastewater treatment legrini et al 1993 klavarioti et al 2009 malato et al 2009 ho is intense oxidizing agent that oxidizes organic matter litter 2005 but it is non specific catalysis this property is of great significance in wastewater treatment since radicals strafe oxidizable organic compounds with rate of 106 109m 1 s 1 andreozzi et al 2003 the adaptability of the aops is improved by the reality there are diverse methods for creating hydroxyl radicals expediting assent with particular treatment necessities the main drawback of this process is the economic constraint therefore nowadays environment friendly energy saving techniques using solar energy for oxidation is used an investigation using solar heterogeneous photocatalysis with tio2 ozonation and solar photo fenton using fe iii was done and it was found that photocatalytic ozonation offers a higher degradation rate than photocatalytic oxidation gimeno et al 2016 the most well known aops that have been utilized and assessed chiefly at a bench scale and also at pilot scale are ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 photolysis using uv fenton reagent homogeneous semiconductors heterogeneous and ultrasound sonolysis 4 4 5 ozonation ozonation treatment technology is based on the use of ozone gas which is a strong oxidizing agent and also as a disinfectant ozone after the reaction with microbes and their products and other chemicals is transformed into oxygen about 90 removal efficiency was noted by ozonation for aromatic compounds that are abundant in electron e g sulfamethoxazoles and additionally those compounds with deprotonated amine groups e g trimethoprim and also non aromatic alkenes as they are profoundly amendable to oxidative reactions dickenson et al 2009 amid wastewater ozonation numerous antibiotics e g sulfonamides fluoroquinolones and macrolides have been appeared to be prevalently changed by ozone dodd et al 2006 while n4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole cephalexin and penicillin were changed to a huge degree by hydroxyl groups dodd et al 2006 the bactericidal characteristics of anti microbials are deactivated by ozone by altering the functional groups for example dimethylamino groups and n etheroxime lange et al 2006 aniline part of sulfonamides huber et al 2005 etc 4 4 6 chlorination chemical compounds can be made non functional by inactivating the functional groups by chlorine substitution or addition crain and gottlieb 1935 on the other hand compounds like antibiotics having active properties may be oxidized disintegrated by chlorine crain and gottlieb 1935 the efficacious removal of antibiotic agents by chlorination from drinking water needs adequate free chlorine and enough contact time a chlorine concentration of 1 2mgl 1 contact time of 24h diminution of antibiotics in drinking water viz 99 for tetracyclines 42 for trimethoprim 50 80 for sulfonamides 30 40 for fluoroquinolones and less than 10 for macrolides were accomplished and these were entirely removed after the duration of 10 days gibs et al 2007 at chlorine concentrations of 3 5 3 8mgl 1 and time interval of one day expulsions of 90 to 99 were accomplished for sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and erythromycin in river water westerhoff et al 2005 albeit a few antibiotics might be more impervious to chlorination than others they appear to slowly degenerate when subjected to free chlorine moreover with increase in organic matters in the water the ideal concentration and contact time should be increased reactivity of sulfonamides with hocl decreases in the subsequent manner sulfadiamethoxine sulfathiazole sulfamethazine sulfamerazine sulfamethoxazole sulfamethizole chamberlain and adams 2006 a ph greater than 8 alkaline restrains the expulsion of sulfonamides by chlorine oxidation chamberlain and adams 2006 gibs et al 2007 huber et al 2005 detected that in water the reaction between clo2 and antibiotics e g sulfonamides and macrolides are rapid chlorine reacts with organic matter to produce toxic byproducts hence chlorination technique for treatment is of concern 4 4 7 ultraviolet uv irradiation uv radiation can be utilized to debase the organic matter in water rosenfeldt and linden 2004 degradation is administered by quantum yield of the compounds and the amount of uv imbibed kim et al 2009 the contact time dosage and doc concentration are additionally imperative variables regulating the removal efficiency the radiation emitted from uv light has germicidal properties and is used as a wastewater disinfectant appropriate dose of uv radiation has ended up being a successful bactericide and virucide for wastewater not adding to build up of byproducts uv rays are utilized generally for microbial purification of wastewater besides they have been utilized for removal of micropollutants uv rays are absorbed by various pharmaceuticals edcs and pcps that contains chromophores which are transformed amid uv treatment it was accounted for that uv light delivered by mercury lamps oxidizes pcps and with the introduction of hydrogen peroxide shows elevated transformation rates nevertheless uv illumination is to some degree costlier when analogized with most other traditional treatment techniques 4 4 8 nano filtration nf pharmaceuticals can be removed by nf films by means of three methods adsorption electrostatic repulsion and sieving dolara et al 2012 depending on various compounds the removal efficiencies vary and is stringently associated to a the micro pollutants physicochemical properties viz size solvency hydrophobicity charge polarity etc b film properties porousness pore size hydrophobicity and surface charge and c membrane functioning conditions such as flux transmembrane pressure dismissals recuperation and water supply quality nf has been shown to be a propitious option for dispensing with pharmaceuticals as it can accomplish more than 90 removal efficiency bolong et al 2009 5 future research perspectives relatively little data is available with respect to the adequacy of recent treatment techniques including chemical and biological treatments membrane filtration adsorption processes etc nevertheless with the guide of a couple of essential molecular and physicochemical properties it has been conceivable to subjectively describe the sensitivity of different antibiotic agents to some of the removal processes while it seems to be no processes with good efficiency for the removal of every single ec under regular operational conditions inferring that prudent treatment techniques should be applied for the efficacious removal with the development of advanced analytical instruments it is possible to quantify the emerging contaminants approach should also be made to detect new ecs in our complex environment and to find their efficient removal strategies a large number of new emerging contaminants are emanating that are not reported or detected due to the lack of knowledge the knowledge about the fate of persistent transformation products after the treatment of ecs that can be more harmful and toxic to the environment is still lacking the absence of ecs does not guarantee lack of tps also the ecs behave differently in natural environment and shows different ecotoxicological effects that cannot be predicted by conventional tests in labs therefore it is required to develop new protocols for ecotoxicity test and measure different effects by using different organisms with suitable endpoints it is suggested that more exhaustive studies be led to fill knowledge gaps in the conduct of ecs under traditional sewage treatment and advanced treatment techniques future research ought to incorporate a keen emphasis on the treatment techniques and fate of these contaminants into the sewage biomass and their conversion into more toxic or pharmacologically active metabolites during the treatment combination of treatment methods should be applied for removal of ecs that is more efficient in removing rather than treatment applying single technique or conventional methods besides future research ought to govern and delineate all fundamental treatment plant operational variables since these are crucial for later correlation or analysis in summary the appearance of emerging contaminants in the nature has become more evident as persistently enhancing assay methods have brought down the limit of detection for a broad cluster of ecs in natural specimens ecs are commonly found in the water environment since at standard temperatures and pressures ecs dissolve nimbly without being evaporated although individual ec parameters occurring usually at ngl 1 levels their impact on the environment and human health is unknown particularly the additive effects have still not been considered also it is important to direct research on the prevalence fate and treatment of human originated metabolites in wwtps majority of antibiotics and their byproducts are discharged into the municipal sewage by men notwithstanding there is very few knowledge about their behavior and biodegradability in water in future to predict the sources fate and behaviors of ecs in the water environment researchers should concentrate on the development of a risk based screening models and framework acknowledgement this work is financially supported by asia pacific network apn under global
