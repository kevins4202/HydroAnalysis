15390,wastewater treatment plants wwtps rarely eliminate emerging contaminants from effluents they discharged into waterways and therefore represent significant contaminations sources with deleterious environmental risks this paper presents a vikor based model to assess the contamination risk posed by a cluster of wwtps a risk index was defined via building a membership function embodying the performance degrees of wwtps and risks levels within the framework of fuzzy set theory the proposed approach was tested using a case study of wwtps cluster along the pearl river sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the robustness of the model the results confirmed the ability of the proposed approach to reveal the risk level of a given treatment point further the comparison with a topsis scheme as well as sensitivity analysis results substantiate the consistency accuracy and reliability of the proposed approach it is therefore bounds to improve the decentralized management of wwtps induced river contamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plants contamination risk risk assessment river pollution wastewater discharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps lead to a growing environmental concern because of the residual contaminants load they transfer to inland and marine waterbodies wwtps reduce the mass of contaminants in wastewater generated by anthropogenic activities upstream these facilities are successful in removing macro pollutants and organic matters but seldom eliminate emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals cargouet et al 2004 tran et al 2019 personal care products birch et al 2015 pesticides and food additive khan et al 2022 which are discharged into rivers bodies eventually the harmful effect of these pollutants is exacerbated by flow conditions that tend to reduce the dilution of discharges yet after reaching the river system contaminants from wastewater discharges of wwtps may also form deleterious clusters with other pollutants from various sources along their way downstream vliet et al 2021 fig 1 shows that a large portion of rivers downstream of wwtps worldwide contains over 10 of treated effluent for low flow conditions which underscores the severity of environmental and health risk stemming from these facilities recent studies established the correlation between the portion of waterbodies downstream of wwtps and i ecosystems and biodiversity integrity purdom et al 1994 jobling et al 1998 bunzel et al 2013 munz et al 2017 as well as ii human health degradation pal et al 2014 griffiths 2017 for example it was reported that reproductive abnormalities in fishes is directly proportional to exposure to wwtp effluents even at far distance away from outfalls jobling et al 1998 furthermore wwtp effluents have been identified as an important source of pollution for surface water and groundwater reservoirs located downstream of wwtps chung et al 2008 in recent years these reservoirs have served as source of drinking water putting the surrounding population at large risks of diseases griffiths 2017 to reduce relevant risks it is essential to understand the magnitude of the impact of treated wastewater discharged into lakes and rivers by wwtps and to develop effective management approaches software packages such as qual2k mike11 or sms have achieved tremendous success in the field these models however mainly simulate the transport mechanism of pollutants downstream moreover they generally require various parameters model calibration and field data that are not always readily available e g steady state hydraulics parameters water quality kinetics topographical maps gis geodatabases bathymetry data etc except for these tools many studies were dedicated to the understanding of impact of effluents discharges on waterbodies contamination rice and westerhoff 2017 vigiak et al 2020 however efficient approaches for evaluating and managing this impact are still very rare such approaches are urgently needed given the increasing amount and toxicity of emerging contaminants that are gradually being discovered morin crini et al 2022 the identification of zones of high contaminant concentrations and the most hazardous wwtps upstream are of pivotal importance to reduce their harmful effects on waterbodies the proper quantification of risk levels of point sources of contaminants discharges also appears as a key asset in the view of the 2030 agenda for united nations sustainable development associated to clean and stable water supply sdg6 https sdgs un org goals this study proposes an approach based on an entropy integrated vikor to evaluate and quantify the risks level stemming from wwtps discharges into rivers and lakes this study defines an index for characterizing the risk status level of point sources of contaminants which can be employed to identify wwtps that need to be targeted for the application of more strict treatment requirements the proposed approach is applied to a cluster of treatment plants along the pearl river which allows mapping risk evolution over the years then the behavior and performance of the proposed model are discussed the outcome of this study will enhance the decision making and allow an efficient decentralized management of these facilities with respect to waterbodies contamination 2 methodology the proposed approach can be discretized into three complementary stages as depicted in fig 2 the first stage mainly relates to the mathematical delineation of problem and risk characterization namely the construction of the decision and risk matrices as well as their normalized counterparts the second stage involves the application of the cross entropy integrated vikor method vikor is the serbian abbreviation for višekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje which means multicriteria optimization and compromise solution chang 2010 gul et al 2016 to the normalized matrices to obtain the performance indices φ bi and η pi from the risk and decision matrices respectively finally the performance values obtained in the previous stage are used to determine the risk index via constructing a membership within the framework of fuzzy set theory in other words this final step corresponds to risk levels assessment 2 1 mathematical discretization of the problem the objective of this process is to obtain the normalized matrices and weights of criteria the decision matrix dm and risk matrix rm are first constructed as in eqs 1 and 2 in the decision matrix dm ci i 1 2 3 m represents the i th criterion of the system investigated while pj j 1 2 3 n stands for its corresponding alternative as for the risk matrix rm the alternatives are defined according to the characterization of the contamination risk for each criteria ci in this study five risk levels risk matrix alternatives were considered namely li lii liii liv and lv from the lowest risk to the highest risk respectively 1 c 1 c 2 c m dm p 1 p 2 p n x 11 x 12 x 1 m x 21 x 22 x 2 m x n 1 x n 2 x n m 2

carried to homogenize the scale of matrices data and so reduce the risk of redundancy this procedure was performed for both the decision and risk matrices using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 x i j n o r

q r 1 q cos t c r i t e r i a using the normalized matrices weights wj of each criterion is determined using the entropy method this approach was used to consider the randomness of interaction between the criteria the features weight pij for the i th alternative and j th criterion are first computed using eq 5 then the output entropy e j are determined using eq 6 thereafter wj are calculated using eq 7 beirlant et al 1997 5 p i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 6 e j 1 log m i 1 m p i j log p i j j 1 2 n 7 w j 1 e j i 1 m 1 e j j 1 2 n 2 2 implementation of vikor model the generalized vikor model is implemented to derive the performance values η pi and φ bi of each alternative a dual implementation of this model was thus carried out to compute η pi and φ bi based upon the decision and risks matrices respectively to these ends three key steps was consecutively undertaken chang 2010 gul et al 2016 step 1 the ideal f i and anti ideal f i solutions of criteria under risk level criteria and wwtps criteria are determined basically when the criterion j has a benefit nature these solutions are given by eq 8 otherwise if the criterion j has a cost nature these solutions are computed using eq 9 8 f i max j x i j n o r m and f i min j x i j n o r m 9 f i min j x i j n o r m and f i max j x i j n o r m step 2 the weighted and normalized manhattan distance sj as well as weighted and normalized chebyshev distance rj are then calculated using eq 10 and eq 11 respectively s j represents the distance rate of j alternative to the positive ideal solution while the contrary is true for rj 10 s j i 1 n w i f i x i j n o r m f i f i 11 r j max i w i f i x i j n o r m f i f i where j 1 2 n i 1 2 m and wi represent the weights of criteria step 3 the performance η pj j 1 2 n of each alternative is computed using the following relation 12 η p j υ s j s s s 1 υ r j r r r where s max j s j s min j s j r min j r j and r max j r j the same procedure is performed to obtain the vector φ bj under the risk level criteria 2 3 risk status assessment the goal of this process is to determine a risk level to each wwtp through the establishment of a discrete risk index i pi the risks status allocation is performed via using the fuzzy set theory zadeh 1965 the choice of fuzzy set theory stemmed naturally from the fuzziness and uncertainties characterizing the problem investigated i e environmental pollution specifically the concept of membership function was adopted given its ability to map each point of a certain input space to a membership value between 0 and 1 fig 3 shows the triangular membership function μ used to represent the magnitude of participation of each element of vector η pj to the set φ bj φ b1 φ b2 φ b3 φ b4 φ b5 the calculation of the different value of membership function μ η pi is provided in appendix 1 ultimately the discrete risk index i pi for each alternative is obtained using eq 13 13 i p i z 1 5 l μ z η p i 3 case study 3 1 background the proposed approach was applied to a cluster of treatment points located along the pearl river at the maritime frontier between the cities of dongguan and guangzhou china see fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the study area includes 12 treatment points p1 p12 located at various distance away from the river these treatment points comprise conventional wwtps but also important industries that are compelled to treat their effluents before discharging them to waterbodies as per the chinese standard gb8978 1996 the effluents discharged to selected study area therefore feature various contamination degrees in the sense previously discussed in the introduction for instance the effluent treated may include i wool washing synthetic fatty acid organophosphorus etc see p2 p3 p4 p7 p10 p12 in fig 4 ii urban sewage see p1 p5 p6 p8 p9 in fig 4 and iii pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical wastes see p11 in fig 4 the quantity and concentration of effluents produced by this cluster may jeopardize the integrity of the pearl river in addition the spot of effluent discharge into the river may a bit differ from the actual location of treatment points 3 2 data acquisition and description the data were acquired from the department of ecology and environment of guangdong province http gdee gd gov cn jhszl index html the data include the parameters for wastewater analytical categories which telegraph wastewater quality these categories are physical properties ph temperature etc nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus solids total suspended solids total dissolved solids etc and organics biochemical oxygen demand total organic carbon etc to map the yearly variation of risk while preserving the consistency of the data the data collected over the three consecutive years 2019 2021 were considered in fact the data monitoring of some treatment points was not operational at certain periods which underlines the need to strengthen the monitoring process in view of implementing the approach proposed in this article future applications shall consider additional meaningful parameters e g nitrate and dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids at this stage to further improved the reliability of results such approach shall also be guided by the local standards table 1 shows the seven criteria that were adopted for the proposed simulation the sewage flow was considered to reflect the volume of discharged effluents at each treatment points while the other parameters epitomize the analytical categories of wastewater discussed previously the decision matrix was therefore defined as a 12 treatment points by 7 criteria matrix on the other hand the establishment of risk level matrix was carried out using the upper values of effluent water quality level ranges for each criterion see table 2 these subdivisions were obtained as a result of expert consultation and via exploiting chinese standards gb8978 1996 moreover except for the ph that was set as benefit criterion all the other criteria were set as cost criteria 4 results and discussion 4 1 risk status visualization based on the risk index values determined using the procedure discussed section 2 the status of contamination risk was divided into five categories as shown in table 3 to further analyze how each treatment point is mapped to the risk index ri via the membership value the risk status assessed for the year 2021 is illustrated in fig 5 with the smallest risk index values the risk of contamination of the pearl river by the treatment points p3 p4 p10 and p12 is deemed insignificant in comparison p2 and p8 were found to pose a severe contamination risk to the river these observations justify the need to implement more stringent control measures of the discharged wastewater quality at these treatment points otherwise the emerging contaminant from these discharge points could spread from local to national scale and become a greater environmental concern macedo et al 2022 the complementarity of the proposed approach with robust modeling software packages like qual2k mike11 and sms become particularly pivotal at this point given that they will subsequently allow capturing the transport mechanism of pollutants downstream from the point of view of managing authorities and decision makers the proposed risk status perception is critical as it can enable the efficient assessment of treatment points and their potential contamination degree on a given period it is thus very useful for macro management in the sense that based on the risk status it will allow chirurgical actions on problematic sub indicators to abate the problem locally given that wwtps are non negligible sources of pollutants into receiving waters their risk index must be monitored over the time to cater for environmental hazards associated with effluent water quality fig 6 a shows the performance of treatment points for the three years investigated the treatment point p10 presents the highest consistency for reduction of contamination risk to the pearl river see fig 6a its situation contrasts significantly with the treatment point p2 for which the risk index slightly increases over the years again stressing the need for more rigorous standards globally the wwtps achieved their highest performance in 2021 while it can be speculated that control of the quality of the discharged effluents was the most laxist in 2020 see fig 6b also it is essential to acknowledge that the risk index may have different effects in different countries due to the variability of treatment levels standards between countries 4 2 performance assessment fig 7 shows the different risk levels for all the wwtps calculated using vikor and topsis models to better capture the behavior of these models it is important to understand the implications of criteria weights fig 8 presents the weights of influential factors for the periods investigated it is observed that the criteria c1 c2 c3 and c4 will have a greater impact on the decision process i e the value of the performance index η pj it can also be seen that while the criteria c7 possesses the smallest weight for the year 2021 it yields relatively larger weights for 2020 and 2019 this discrepancy is imputable to a smaller number of alternatives which influenced weight values liu et al 2017 considering that the index value ri is reliant on η pj weight values mostly affected the performance of wwtps from the same set for instance the implication of the first criteria sewage flow was most pronounced at the treatment point p2 comparatively to treatment point p10 keeping in mind that the sewage flow reflects the volume of treated wastewater discharged into the pearl river it can naturally be speculated that the larger volume discharged the larger the risk then again the implication of other parameters cannot be dissociated from this assessment a consideration that the proposed vikor and topsis schemes robustly integrate in terms of models performance it is reasonable not to state a priori that the vikor based approach outperforms the topsis scheme due to larger risk index values or vice versa see fig 7 the intrinsic attributes and topology of each approach result in a different behavior of the two methods however it is important to note that the topsis scheme tends to slightly minimize the risk index compared with the vikor model the reason for that is arguably the slight difference between the two methods the vikor method does consider the relative importance of the farthest distance to the anti ideal solution and shortest distance to the ideal solution gul et al 2016 while the topsis model does not jahanshahloo 2006 abo sinna and amer 2005 4 3 sensitivity analysis 4 3 1 effect of influential factors fig 9 shows the results of the global sensitivity analysis that was performed to investigate how the system responds to minor changes in the input criteria specifically the pearson correlation coefficient berman 2016 was used to reveal the individual and interaction contributions of criteria via quantifying uncertainties in the model output see eq 14 14 c o r r c j i 1 n i p i i p i x i j x i j i 1 n i p i i p i 2 i 1 n x i j x i j 2 where corr cj represents the value of the pearson correlation coefficient of the j th criterion a higher value of corr cj implies a higher contribution of criterion cj i p i and x i j are the mean values of risk index and criteria respectively four criteria namely the total phosphorous total nitrogen sewage flow and chemical oxygen demand cod were found to have the most significant impact on the contamination risk index on the other hand the ammonia ph and suspended solid were found to have a smaller contribution these observations are consistent with some recent research azevedo et al 2015 breton deval et al 2019 carpenter et al 1998 dash and mallikarjuna 2022 particularly the study of deval et al 2019 that established a clear relationship between cod levels and pathogen genera in aquatic microbial community dynamics 4 3 2 effect of alternatives the degree of reliability of matrix elements typically shapes that of the result of mcdm problems therefore a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the variation of decision matrix stemming from uncertainty inaccuracy fuzziness and randomness of alternatives with reference to criteria the goal of this process is therefore to show how accurately a criterion evaluates an alternative this was achieved by analyzing number of realizations of effective alternatives which were obtained through 3 steps mukhametzyanov and pamučar 2017 i consider different values of relative error δij e g 25 20 15 10 5 ii determine the rank of alternatives based on a large number of random simulations e g 1000 simulations iii make decisions using the statistics of alternatives ranks fig 10 shows the point of realization of effectives alternatives obtained by simulating the 2021 decision matrix considering the high ranks i ii iii or combination of ranks total of i ii total of i ii iii it can be seen that the alternative p10 achieved the highest performance while p2 resulted in the lowest performance p10 was found to be the most effective alternative as it resulted in the lowest contamination risk while on the other hand p2 was found to be the most detrimental one the results of these simulations are in line with the risk indices discussed in section 4 2 which confirms the robustness of the proposed approach fig 11 allows capturing the overall degree of the effectiveness of alternative p1 for δ 25 the distribution of all alternatives for the different values of the total error can be found in the supplementary document s1 5 conclusions this study proposed a vikor based approach to evaluate the river contamination risk stemming from wwtps an index characterizing the degree of risk was defined using the fuzzy set theory the model was applied to a case study and its performances were systematically evaluated and discussed the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the proposed model can cater for the decentralized management of a cluster of wwtps distributed along the river as its risk index allows a reliable mapping of the risk status of treatment points 2 the proposed model can enable the monitoring of risk status levels from years to another the wwtps along the pearl river achieved their best performance in 2021 while worst performances were obtained in 2020 and 2019 consecutively it was also found that in this assessment the topsis scheme supplies quite conservative risk indices 3 the total phosphorous total nitrogen sewage flow and chemical oxygen demand cod have a prominent impact on the river contamination besides multiple simulations of decision matrix showed a good consistency for the highest contamination or lowest contamination spots declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

table 2 these subdivisions were obtained as a result of expert consultation and via exploiting chinese standards gb8978 1996 moreover except for the ph that was set as benefit criterion all the other criteria were set as cost criteria 4 results and discussion 4 1 risk status visualization based on the risk index values determined using the procedure discussed section 2 the status of contamination risk was divided into five categories as shown in table 3 to further analyze how each treatment point is mapped to the risk index ri via the membership value the risk status assessed for the year 2021 is illustrated in fig 5 with the smallest risk index values the risk of contamination of the pearl river by the treatment points p3 p4 p10 and p12 is deemed insignificant in comparison p2 and p8 were found to pose a severe contamination risk to the river these observations justify the need to implement more stringent control measures of the discharged wastewater quality at these treatment points otherwise the emerging contaminant from these discharge points could spread from local to national scale and become a greater environmental concern macedo et al 2022 the complementarity of the proposed approach with robust modeling software packages like qual2k mike11 and sms become particularly pivotal at this point given that they will subsequently allow capturing the transport mechanism of pollutants downstream from the point of view of managing authorities and decision makers the proposed risk status perception is critical as it can enable the efficient assessment of treatment points and their potential contamination degree on a given period it is thus very useful for macro management in the sense that based on the risk status it will allow chirurgical actions on problematic sub indicators to abate the problem locally given that wwtps are non negligible sources of pollutants into receiving waters their risk index must be monitored over the time to cater for environmental hazards associated with effluent water quality fig 6 a shows the performance of treatment points for the three years investigated the treatment point p10 presents the highest consistency for reduction of contamination risk to the pearl river see fig 6a its situation contrasts significantly with the treatment point p2 for which the risk index slightly increases over the years again stressing the need for more rigorous standards globally the wwtps achieved their highest performance in 2021 while it can be speculated that control of the quality of the discharged effluents was the most laxist in 2020 see fig 6b also it is essential to acknowledge that the risk index may have different effects in different countries due to the variability of treatment levels standards between countries 4 2 performance assessment fig 7 shows the different risk levels for all the wwtps calculated using vikor and topsis models to better capture the behavior of these models it is important to understand the implications of criteria weights fig 8 presents the weights of influential factors for the periods investigated it is observed that the criteria c1 c2 c3 and c4 will have a greater impact on the decision process i e the value of the performance index η pj it can also be seen that while the criteria c7 possesses the smallest weight for the year 2021 it yields relatively larger weights for 2020 and 2019 this discrepancy is imputable to a smaller number of alternatives which influenced weight values liu et al 2017 considering that the index value ri is reliant on η pj weight values mostly affected the performance of wwtps from the same set for instance the implication of the first criteria sewage flow was most pronounced at the treatment point p2 comparatively to treatment point p10 keeping in mind that the sewage flow reflects the volume of treated wastewater discharged into the pearl river it can naturally be speculated that the larger volume discharged the larger the risk then again the implication of other parameters cannot be dissociated from this assessment a consideration that the proposed vikor and topsis schemes robustly integrate in terms of models performance it is reasonable not to state a priori that the vikor based approach outperforms the topsis scheme due to larger risk index values or vice versa see fig 7 the intrinsic attributes and topology of each approach result in a different behavior of the two methods however it is important to note that the topsis scheme tends to slightly minimize the risk index compared with the vikor model the reason for that is arguably the slight difference between the two methods the vikor method does consider the relative importance of the farthest distance to the anti ideal solution and shortest distance to the ideal solution gul et al 2016 while the topsis model does not jahanshahloo 2006 abo sinna and amer 2005 4 3 sensitivity analysis 4 3 1 effect of influential factors fig 9 shows the results of the global sensitivity analysis that was performed to investigate how the system responds to minor changes in the input criteria specifically the pearson correlation coefficient berman 2016 was used to reveal the individual and interaction contributions of criteria via quantifying uncertainties in the model output see eq 14 14 c o r r c j i 1 n i p i i p i x i j x i j i 1 n i p i i p i 2 i 1 n x i j x i j 2 where corr cj represents the value of the pearson correlation coefficient of the j th criterion a higher value of corr cj implies a higher contribution of criterion cj i p i and x i j are the mean values of risk index and criteria respectively four criteria namely the total phosphorous total nitrogen sewage flow and chemical oxygen demand cod were found to have the most significant impact on the contamination risk index on the other hand the ammonia ph and suspended solid were found to have a smaller contribution these observations are consistent with some recent research azevedo et al 2015 breton deval et al 2019 carpenter et al 1998 dash and mallikarjuna 2022 particularly the study of deval et al 2019 that established a clear relationship between cod levels and pathogen genera in aquatic microbial community dynamics 4 3 2 effect of alternatives the degree of reliability of matrix elements typically shapes that of the result of mcdm problems therefore a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the variation of decision matrix stemming from uncertainty inaccuracy fuzziness and randomness of alternatives with reference to criteria the goal of this process is therefore to show how accurately a criterion evaluates an alternative this was achieved by analyzing number of realizations of effective alternatives which were obtained through 3 steps mukhametzyanov and pamučar 2017 i consider different values of relative error δij e g 25 20 15 10 5 ii determine the rank of alternatives based on a large number of random simulations e g 1000 simulations iii make decisions using the statistics of alternatives ranks fig 10 shows the point of realization of effectives alternatives obtained by simulating the 2021 decision matrix considering the high ranks i ii iii or combination of ranks total of i ii total of i ii iii it can be seen that the alternative p10 achieved the highest performance while p2 resulted in the lowest performance p10 was found to be the most effective alternative as it resulted in the lowest contamination risk while on the other hand p2 was found to be the most detrimental one the results of these simulations are in line with the risk indices discussed in section 4 2 which confirms the robustness of the proposed approach fig 11 allows capturing the overall degree of the effectiveness of alternative p1 for δ 25 the distribution of all alternatives for the different values of the total error can be found in the supplementary document s1 5 conclusions this study proposed a vikor based approach to evaluate the river contamination risk stemming from wwtps an index characterizing the degree of risk was defined using the fuzzy set theory the model was applied to a case study and its performances were systematically evaluated and discussed the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the proposed model can cater for the decentralized management of a cluster of wwtps distributed along the river as its risk index allows a reliable mapping of the risk status of treatment points 2 the proposed model can enable the monitoring of risk status levels from years to another the wwtps along the pearl river achieved their best performance in 2021 while worst performances were obtained in 2020 and 2019 consecutively it was also found that in this assessment the topsis scheme supplies quite conservative risk indices 3 the total phosphorous total nitrogen sewage flow and chemical oxygen demand cod have a prominent impact on the river contamination besides multiple simulations of decision matrix showed a good consistency for the highest contamination or lowest contamination spots declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15391,solar driven interfacial evaporation has enormous promise for fresh water recovery and salt harvesting but salt accumulation related challenges stand in its way herein we report a spined groove

localization is now considered a promising and sustainable freshwater technology due to its inexhaustible supply of solar energy and seawater ghasemi et al 2014 hogan et al 2014 tao et al 2018 despite great progress over the last few years the salt resistant performance of the solar driven interfacial evaporator remains a significant roadblock towards long term high salinity brine desalination bae

includes two categories salt reflux and localized salt crystallization chen et al 2019 xu et al 2020a zhang et al 2021b zhao et al 2020 the former aims to dilute the salinity on the evaporator surface by enhancing convection between the evaporation area and bulk water dong et al 2021 he et al 2019 kashyap et al 2017 kuang et al 2019 ni et al 2018 the latter is to tailor brine transport and form salt precipitants at specific locations such as the edge of the evaporator for localized crystallization dong et al 2022 li et al 2021 shao et al 2020 xia et al 2019 compared with salt reflux purely for freshwater collection localized salt crystallization can harvest clean water from otherwise unusable water while also enabling the recovery of solid salts because of the prospect of achieving zero liquid discharge zld localized salt crystallization has attracted increasing attention great efforts have been devoted to architecting a wide variety of locally crystallized solar evaporators finnerty

many approaches have been proposed for rational regulation of the water transport layer still long term evaporation could easily block water transport channels by accumulated salt crystals due to insufficient vertical brine loading and unsatisfactory design therefore exploring locally crystallized solar evaporators with an advanced water delivery structure will benefit water transport and continuous anti clogging performance to this end emerging trends are being shifted towards open capillary channels whose rapid directional transport capability and inherent anti clogging properties open up new possibilities in developing advanced evaporators chen et al 2016 comanns et al 2015 feng et al 2021 in a recent attempt singh et al created a laser etched aluminium surface with an open

surface of the nepenthes alata and the resulting solar evaporator allows high salinity desalination via localized salt crystallization wu et al 2020 while tremendous progress has been made to develop a variety of solar driven evaporation platforms as of today some hurdles such as salt scaling and long term stability of high salinity water desalination need to be overcome for successful real life applications besides there is a pressing need for increasing supplies of fit for purpose anti scaling solutions to the ever changing demands therefore more new alternative evaporators with high performance salt resistance are worthy of further exploration nature is full of technologies and billions of years of earth life coevolution yield countless innovative solutions biomimicry of mother nature s craftiness has inspired numerous diverse engineering medicine and apparel designs as we seek to create localized salt crystallization based solar desalination innovations molded from nature infaunal bivalves captured our attention with their unique motility and burrowing behaviors trueman 1966 vogel 1997 the vasticardium vertebratum is one such example its outer shell surface contains a series of grooves and spine bearing ridges arranged radially the groove promotes water flow by reducing resistance during swimming and the spine on the ridge facilitates fast sand transfer during burrowing fig 1 a and b stanley 1969 stanley 1981 the shell ornamentation serves the dual purpose of the liquid and solid delivery and it is precisely similar to the properties of localized salt crystallization that we are pursuing encouraged by this discovery herein we construct a volcano like evaporator with seashell mimetic microstructures using three dimensional 3d printing and in situ polypyrrole ppy polymerization the hollow truncated cone shaped enclosure allows for efficient evaporation via the afloat stability and localized heating and recovers both the diffuse reflected light energy and the radiative heat loss the radial groove and ridge as an important shell skeletal feature are applied onto the surface of the evaporator the optimized microgroove geometry enables rapid directional water transport and localized salt precipitation as another unique shell pattern feature the periodic spine on the ridge is accurately imitated and provides numerous micro unit salt reflux effects the 3d solar evaporator with the spined groove ridge pairs displays high water evaporation performance and excellent stable salt resistance even during the long term treatment of high concentrated brine 20 wt nacl in addition water quality analysis indicates that the volcano like evaporator is highly efficient in metal ion removal and salt recycling from seawater and wastewater the scale up experiments have proved that our design advances one step further towards creating zld solar evaporators for practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals pyrrole

using thermoplastic polymers pla abs asa petg and pc note that pla was selected in this study because of its superior printing capabilities the 3d printed objects can be made from any of the previously mentioned thermoplastic materials the printing process had the following operational parameters 0 4 mm nozzle diameter 0 1 mm layer thickness 50 mm s 1 nozzle speed 195 c nozzle temperatures and a 60 c bed temperature 2 4 fabrication of the 3d solar evaporator a simple one step in situ polymerization method was used to coat the model surface with ppy as reported in the literature pan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 solution a was produced in a typical polymer synthesis process by dissolving 2 74 g of aps in 5 ml of deionized water and storing it in a spray bottle solution b was then prepared by adding 0 84 ml of pyrrole and 1 84 ml of pa to 5 ml of ipa and blending evenly to improve the coating quality the uncoated sample was first ultrasonically washed with deionized water followed by a five minute plasma cleaning process when spraying spray solution b first then solution a and repeat the process several times to generate a homogeneous coating repeat washing with di water and ethanol was used to remove organic residue and aps finally the samples were dried at 45 c 2 5 solar desalination experiment the evaporator performance was evaluated using a solar simulator cel hxf300 ceaulight china before the experiment began the light intensity on the evaporator surface was determined by a light power meter cel np200 ceaulight china to improve the experiment accuracy the light intensity was calibrated by five spot measurement and the evaporator was placed within a 3d printed cup with a diameter of 53 mm the cup was filled with water brine or a highly concentrated metal salt solution throughout the experiment for the 3d evaporator the top projected plane is utilized to normalize the differences in light intensity measurements and evaporation rate calculations induced by height the evaporation rate was determined by measuring the weight loss of water in real time using an electronic mass balance with 0 01 mg precision tle204 02 mettler toledo ltd switzerland meanwhile an infrared camera dm i220 dongmei china was used to monitor the surface temperature of the evaporator during the experiment the ambient temperature and relative humidity were maintained at 25 c and 45 5 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 shell morphology and groove choice as mentioned above the outer shell surface of the vasticardium vertebratum bears a series of radial grooves and ridges and these two kinds of ornamentation are gradually narrowed towards the umbo fig 1b the average height and width of the groove are 1 8 mm and 2 6 mm respectively with the ridge in between having an average width of 1 1 mm the outer shell surface allows water droplets to spread and wet easily suggesting a typical hydrophilic property fig s1 also we found that liquid could flow towards the umbo along the groove via capillary action when applying it on the open edge of the shell fig 1c and video s1 triggered by this observation we first prepared a series of 3d printed open capillary grooves the three most representative geometric groove shapes i e ellipse square and v groove were selected to investigate the effect of groove configurations on the fluid flow performance the length l width w height h and horizontal inclination angle α of these three kinds of grooves were set to fixed values respectively to better compare the results to each other fig 1d the detailed design parameters and exact dimensions of the 3d printed open capillary grooves with different cross sections are illustrated in figs s2 and s3 with a continuous infusion of water the three open capillary channels exhibit similar fluid flow behaviors to the shell groove of the vasticardium vertebratum while filter paper as a control behaves quite differently at the same time the progression of the flow front was found in the increasing order of filter paper ellipse and square grooves v groove within 8 s for example the capillary rise distance up the v groove reached up to 21 mm and yet only around 8 mm of water transport length was observed on the paper strip fig 1e and f video s2 obviously when water flows through porous filter paper the wicking rate is affected by the disordered layout and swelling of the fiber matrix chang and kim 2020 when it comes to the groove the better transport performance of the open capillary channel can be explained by the filling conditions of the corners the inner corners of the groove enhance the capillary effect by increasing the local curvature of the surface to meet the contact angle wetting conditions higuera et al 2008 ouali et al 2013 compared to ellipse and square grooves under the same conditions the v groove has a smaller cross sectional area resulting in less liquid containment and a higher capillary rise taking square and v grooves as examples the capillary rise distance l of the groove can be expressed as bamorovat abadi and bahrami 2020 deng et al 2014 khan et al 2011 tian et al 2010 1 l s σ l 2 h w c o s θ s w ρ g h w s i n α 2 l v σ l 2 c o s θ v h 2 w 2 4 w ρ g h w 2 s i n α where l s and l v are the capillary rise distance of the square and v grooves respectively ρ and σ are the density and surface tension of water and θ and g respectively represent liquid solid contact angle and gravitational acceleration for the same horizontal inclination angle the ratio of the capillary rise distances of the square and v grooves can be written as 3 l s l v 2 h w c o s θ s w 2 2 c o s θ v h 2 w 2 4 w the following assumptions were made to obtain an approximation 1 the height and width of the groove are almost equal i e h w 2 each groove surface is superhydrophilic after plasma cleaning i e c o s θ s c o s θ v 1 therefore the ratio can be calculated as 4 l s l v 1 5 1 0 81 the experimental results indicate that the capillary rise distance of the square and v grooves are 16 4 mm and 21 3 mm respectively fig 1f that is the capillary rise distance ratio of these two grooves is 0 77 it demonstrates good agreement with the results obtained by the theoretical estimation in addition the experimental results of the ellipse groove match up well with the theoretical analysis fig s4 thus the v groove could provide a significantly high rise of capillary water furthermore the v groove as an open capillary channel can reduce the risk of clogging and promote evaporation by increasing the air water interface all the benefits indicate that the v groove lends itself to developing a high performance solar evaporator with localized salt crystallization 3 2 fabrication and characterization of the basic evaporator after selecting the optimal groove channel a 3d printed truncated conical supporter ornamented with a radial v groove array was first fabricated fig 2 a subsequently ppy nanoparticles as photothermal materials were deposited onto the supporter surface to obtain a basic truncated conical solar evaporator the detailed dimensions of the 3d prints are provided in fig s5 as shown in fig 2b the supporter using virgin pla has an ivory white compact surface after the overall coating of ppy nanoparticles except the external bottom the supporter morphology was retained well but there was remarkable black coloration fig 2f further scanning electron microscopy sem analysis also reveals similar highly stacked layered filament structures before and after ppy deposition with each layer being 80 μm thick fig 2c d g and h under higher magnification the truncated conical evaporator reveals a randomly rough surface where numerous papillae can be clearly explored fig 2e and i these tightly packed papillae are composed of aggregated ppy nanoparticles with a diameter of 250 nm fig s6 to clarify the ppy coating distribution on the evaporator surface energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was performed the element mapping analysis confirms the uniform distribution of n element on the evaporator surface suggesting a successful even ppy coating fig s7 in addition the supporter surface has a water contact angle of 98 9 due to the hydrophobic nature of pla after introducing the ppy coating the water contact angle of the evaporator surface decreases dramatically and it can be easily wet remarkably the 3d truncated cones can float on water readily regardless of whether they have a ppy coating or not fig s8 which could be attributed to the fact that strong layer adhesion provides a compact structure of the print and thus prevents them from overturning this steady floating feature is critical for effective water evaporation what s more water moves upward along v grooves and spreads out transversely on the surface as soon as the evaporator contacts the bulk water fig 2j and video s3 also a steady and continuous water film covering the surface is formed in only 5 seconds this rapid directional water transport performance provides the prerequisite for efficient evaporation and localized salt crystallization 3 3 photothermal properties and steam generation as depicted in fig 3 a the hollow truncated conical evaporator provides an air cavity to enhance light reflections since the external bottom is not coated with ppy it still maintains hydrophobic properties and exhibits a silver mirror like sheen during water immersion such a sheathing layer of air trapped on the surface can serve as a good thermal insulator fig s8 besides the floating characteristic of the evaporator keeps most of the evaporation zone above the water reducing heat loss through conduction the ppy coated v groove array on the evaporator outwall facilitates rapid and directed water flow as well as localized heating induced evaporation meanwhile this groove ridge inner wall with ppy coating provides micro nano multiscale surface morphology that can efficiently utilize incident light via multiple reflections for a better evaluation of the photothermal performance of the basic evaporator a plane solar evaporator with parallel closed capillary channels was fabricated using the same preparation process as the control the detailed experimental setup for water evaporation evaluation can be found in fig s9 the top projected plane and the corresponding projected area were utilized to normalize the differences in light intensity measurement and evaporation rate calculation fig s10 li et al 2019 the results of the evaporation capability of the evaporators in fig 3b confirm our conception that the 3d truncated conical evaporator demonstrates superior evaporation performance under one sun illumination the water evaporation rate increases significantly with the aid of the evaporators from 0 51 kg m 2 h 1 for bare water to 1 01 kg m 2 h 1 for the plane evaporator and to 1 73 kg m 2 h 1 for the truncated conical evaporator the shadowed region between the curves indicates the net mass change over time after subtracting the evaporation amount in the darkness the truncated conical evaporator can promote water evaporation efficiently compared to the plane evaporator after 1 h of operation at one sun illumination the net change in water mass increases from 0 83 kg m 2 for the plane evaporator to 1 40 kg m 2 for the truncated conical evaporator after an investigation of water evaporation performance the energy conversion efficiency η of both evaporators was further calculated using eq 5 li et al 2018 5 η m δ q t b t i l v t i α s p i n where m is the net mass change rate of water kg m 2 h 1 δ q is the sensible heat differential of water from t b the temperature of bulk water to t i the steady state evaporation temperature l v is the vaporization enthalpy for water at t i α s is the solar absorptance of the evaporator and p i n is the power of the incident simulated sunlight beam according to the above equation α s and t i must be obtained first to calculate the energy conversion efficiency the uv vis nir diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was employed to quantify the solar absorption property of the evaporators as the solar spectrum is not uniformly distributed the light absorption performance is currently characterized by α s which can be calculated using the following equation shi et al 2018a 6 α s 300 2500 i λ 1 r λ d λ 300 2500 i λ d λ where i λ and r λ are the solar intensity and the sample reflectance at different wavelengths λ respectively the value of α s for the plane and truncated conical supporters is 49 34 and 80 30 respectively whereas it increases to 97 30 and 99 49 after ppy coating fig 3e the results prove that the truncated conical evaporator could enhance the solar absorption via its air cavity and micro nano surface texture on the inwall fig s11 similar phenomena have been described in some reported 3d solar evaporators shi et al 2018a wang et al 2018 then an infrared camera was used to capture the evaporator temperature distribution for determining t i under one sun illumination both evaporators in the dry state exhibited a fast thermal response and a stable temperature distribution figs s12 and s13 the truncated conical evaporator showed apparent temperature inhomogeneity along the longitudinal axis the closer to the top of the evaporator the higher the temperature obviously anything close to the light source could obtain great thermal energy and thus a high temperature however when the truncated conical evaporator is in contact with water it has a temperature profile that is the opposite of that in the dry state showing a negative correlation between slant height and temperature even in the darkness a similar but relatively small variation in surface temperature distribution can be observed in the wet state truncated conical evaporator fig 3d by contrast the plane evaporator proves a straightforward concentric temperature distribution under illumination due to its simple structure fig 3c because of its simple temperature distribution and small temperature range we can calculate its evaporation enthalpy easily using an approximation of the steady state evaporation temperature when it comes to the 3d solar evaporator the steady state evaporation temperature is often approximated using the surface area weighted average approach li et al 2018 however our truncated conical evaporator has a wide temperature range and unique geometry so it s a challenge to use this approach therefore we proposed an image processing based solution we first collected the average gray value of the evaporator region from infrared images and then transformed it using the image s gray value temperature scale the detailed process in fig s14 then the average steady state evaporation temperature of each evaporator was obtained which was 37 1 c for the plane one and 33 4 c for the 3d one respectively vaporization enthalpy could be easily estimated once the steady state evaporation temperature was determined henderson sellers 1984 finally the energy efficiency of the plane evaporator is 58 40 whereas the truncated conical evaporator is 95 86 compared with the plane evaporator the truncated conical evaporator demonstrates significantly higher energy efficiency it could be attributed to the rational structural design that improved light harvesting and thermal management the hollow truncated cone shaped enclosure not only allows for reliable localized heating driven evaporation but also recovers both the diffuse reflected light and the thermal radiation loss from the evaporator bottom fig s15 more importantly such a design also causes an interesting and unique variation in temperature with height a better understanding is needed of how the evaporator temperature distribution affects its water evaporation behavior using the image processing based solution as mentioned above a 3d surface temperature plot was thus constructed to reveal the temperature gradient along the outwall of the truncated conical evaporator in detail the temperature reaches 35 4 c at the bottom edge and 26 8 c at the top edge of the 3d evaporator under illumination figs 3f g and s16 in comparison to the one in the dry state up to a 42 2 c difference in temperature was detected at the top edge while an 11 1 c difference was recorded at the bottom edge which means that the evaporative flux increases along the outwall and reaches its maximum at the top the steam presence also proves the more considerable evaporative flux at the top fig s17 when water moves upward via the v groove the narrowing channel design leads to a continuous reduction in the amount of water and the water film thickness the thin interfacial water film absorbs the generated heat at the top edge and a significant evaporative cooling effect occurs in other words the highest evaporative flux would be achieved at the top edge in addition the evaporation triggered temperature change brings about a surface tension gradient and a resulting thermocapillary force that produces an upward fluid circulation fig 3h wu et al 2020 thermocapillary force as the surface shear caused by a thermal gradient could be expressed as gamboa et al 2018 7 τ d γ d t t where τ is the thermocapillary force d γ d t is the temperature derivative of the liquid surface tension and t is the temperature gradient the thermal gradient along the longitudinal axis alters the surface tension of the liquid and induces a shear flow which contributes to the upward propulsion of fluid from hot to cold regions the consequent marangoni effect could also boost the evaporation process with this upward water circumfluence the evaporation on the top is further enhanced and the temperature drops 3 4 solar driven desalination and evaporator upgrade for zld encouraged by the good photothermal water evaporation performance of the basic truncated conical evaporator we began to investigate its desalination capability the evaporator demonstrated excellent localized salt crystallization property when treating low salinity brine i e 3 5 wt nacl for up to 12 h as shown in fig 4 b the salt precipitation did not occur along the evaporator outwall but instead only on its top edge because the crystallization area is physically separated from the evaporating surface salt precipitation during brine treatment does not affect its desalination performance unlike most 2d evaporators to further investigate whether it could broaden the range of practical desalination applications the salt resistance of the evaporator to hypersaline brine 20 wt nacl was characterized unfortunately its salt resistance and evaporation rate deteriorated severely fig 4c and g the salt crystals gradually accumulated in locations coalesced with each other on the top edge and covered most of the evaporator surface after 12 h of continuous operation fig 4c notably most of the salt crystals appeared on the ridges whereas only few were found on the v grooves this ridge preferential crystallization could be attributed to the fact that the ridge lacks an efficient water transport structure compared to the groove during the treatment of hypersaline brine water evaporation causes a rapid increase in localized brine concentration and insufficient water supply on the ridge cannot effectively dilute the concentrated brine the slow back diffusion process makes the balance of salt dissolution crystallization shift toward crystallization it leads to a sharp increase in local salt concentration and salts precipitate out of the fluid similar phenomena have been reported in locally crystallized evaporators with a closed capillary channel that salt scaling blocks the channel and restricts water transport because of diffusion limited local salt concentration increase and crystal accumulation finnerty et al 2017 liu et al 2021 shao et al 2020 xia et al 2019 obviously there is a need for upgrading the basic truncated conical evaporator to promote its practical application we once again found inspiration from the exterior structure of the vasticardium vertebratum seashell fig 4a as shown in fig s18 the high magnification sem image indicates that the basic truncated conical evaporator does not truly mimic the external seashell structure because the spines on the ridge are omitted these spines turn out to be a critical feature of the vasticardium vertebratum seashell helping burrow and desand stanley 1969 stanley 1981 in view of this fact the upgrade truncated conical evaporator was built by introducing periodic spines on the ridge and its detailed dimensions are provided in fig s19 the optical and sem images show that the periodic spines on the ridge have an average spacing of 500 μm providing a grainy feel like the vasticardium vertebratum seashell figs s20 and s21 when the upgrade evaporator was used to treat a concentrated brine 20 wt nacl for 12 h it could display a stable and superior salt rejecting performance compared to the basic one fig 4f and g all salt precipitants on the outwall disappeared and the salt crystallization was only observed on the top of the upgrade evaporator fig 4d as the crystallized salt blocks were loosely adhered to the evaporator surface they could be easily removed and collected fig s22 even after the brine was evaporated to dryness there was no salt crystal at the bottom of the bulk water container suggesting the promising zld capability of the evaporator fig s23 additionally its salt resistance was further evaluated using a series of highly concentrated alkali alkali earth metal and heavy metal salt solutions i e k mg2 ca2 co2 cu2 and cr6 and the evaporator exhibited outstanding anti scaling properties with localized salt crystallization figs 4e and s24 we believe that the spine could improve local water transport by interconnecting and interacting with the adjoining groove and enhancing the micro unit salt reflux on the ridge to visually observe the change of water flow and salt transportation around the spines the following two experiments were conducted when applying dyed water to a v groove channel the liquid climbed upward immediately by contrast the water flow on the spined groove ridge pairs of the upgraded evaporator split into two directions and moved laterally around the spine leaving a dye trail on the ridge fig s25 also in the case of the redissolution of salt crystals dissolution proceeded quickly with the dissolved of 0 25 g crystals in only 7 min when applying solid nacl onto the outer wall of the upgrade evaporator fig s26 however the basic evaporator could not complete the dissolution of the same amount of nacl even after 25 min thus not effectively rejecting the salt to uncover the role that the periodic spine plays in salt rejection a comparative study was conducted by using two evaporators embedded with pure v grooves and spines respectively in view of the ridge preferential crystallization in the previous results we first fabricated an evaporator with an array of pure v grooves to decrease this effect when using it to treat hypersaline brine under illumination a salt crystal capped evaporator was still obtained also a certain amount of crystalline salt appeared on the evaporator outwall although less than that on the basic evaporator fig s27 it is evident that the regions where diffusion dominated were significantly reduced due to the disappearance of the ridge of note however is that there is a connecting line between two v grooves next to each other although we maximized the number of v grooves to ensure that the connecting line had the smallest width as the diameter of the printing nozzle 300 μm it could still provide locations for diffusion limited local salt precipitation then we turned our focus to another evaporator the evaporator only with periodic spines on its outwall for treating hypersaline brine as expected most parts of the evaporator outwall remained free of salt precipitants fig s28 it indicates that the introduction of periodic spines enables nacl to be distributed evenly over the outwall area avoiding local overconcentration i e crystallization hot spots besides the salt crystallized regions on the top edge expanded suggesting that the lack of the v groove impairs the ability of upward transport of water and limits the performance of localized crystallization obviously the introduced spines create new flow paths for timely supplementation of bulk brine and the the highly concentrated salt solution on the ridge is diluted by continuously replenishing low concentration brine in other words the periodic spines introduced in the ridge can effectively provide micro unit salt reflux to avoid reaching its saturation concentration by sufficient lateral brine transfer on the basis of the above results it can be concluded that due to the integrated design of v grooves and periodic spines on the ridge the upgrade evaporator achieves not only local crystallization with rapid directional brine transport but also improves local brine transport to enhance the salt reflux effect and prevent salt precipitation additionally compared with other reported evaporators via additive manufacturing our integrated design reveals excellent long term salt resistance while treating hypersaline water and heavy metal solutions table s2 therefore we believe that the upgrade truncated conical evaporator could help solve the issue of industrial brine treatment zld 3 5 water purification performance and evaporator scale up as mentioned above growing environmental concerns make locally crystallized solar evaporators attractive because the solid salts can be separated and recycled detailed evaluation of the performance of wastewater treatment is thus needed for a successful design and operation of a locally crystallized solar evaporator to demonstrate water quality after desalination using the upgrade truncated conical evaporator seawater collected from the south china sea and a series of heavy metal salt solutions were used as raw water fig 5 a presents the detailed water quality of the water samples before and after treatment the inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms analysis indicates that the na concentration was significantly decreased by approximately three orders of magnitude after desalination and was far below the drinking water quality guidelines defined by the world health organization in addition there was no heavy metal of interest i e cu2 co2 and cr6 with a level above 0 1 mg l 1 after water purification and the color of heavy metal solutions changed to colorless and transparent fig 5b up to six orders of magnitude reduction in heavy metal ion concentration indicate highly efficient heavy metal ion removal the purified water basically meets the requirements of the surface water quality standard gb3838 2002 in china wu et al 2017 also of note fused deposition modeling fdm was selected here because it is the most widely used 3d printing technology and the most cost effective way of producing prototypes and functional parts even though fdm has the lower dimensional accuracy and resolution among the common 3d printing technologies the simple structure of the truncated conical solar evaporator exhibits high scalability and practicality fig 5e in addition to pla a wide range of fdm materials such as polyamide pa polycarbonate pc acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs acrylonitrile styrene acrylate asa and polyethylene terephthalate glycol petg can be successfully utilized to print the evaporation equipment fig 5c finally a solar evaporation system was introduced to investigate the practical application potential of the scale up evaporator system in the outdoors fig 5f the evaporation rate was measured concurrently with the ambient sunlight intensity where the evaporation rate reached 1 5 kg m 2 h 1 at 13 00 pm fig 5d these results indicate that our design has great advantages for advancing the use of solar desalination technology in the real world 4 conclusions with a hierarchical morphological structure similar to the outer shell of the vasticardium vertebratum we demonstrate a truncated conical solar driven evaporator for high performance brine desalination and zld the macroscopic groove ridge pair provides rapid guided water transport and the spine microstructure on the ridge prevents salt precipitation even for high salinity brine treatment the spine induced micro grade water transport can still avoid salt accumulation along the channel and ensure top edge preferential crystallization these two features in combination endow our volcano like solar evaporator with superior locally crystallized desalination performance under one sun illumination the evaporator yields a high evaporation rate of 1 73 kg m 2 h 1 with an energy conversion efficiency of 95 86 furthermore the potential of the evaporator for heavy metal recovery and water purification from wastewater has been proven by a series of experiments we believe that our design could contribute to

15391,solar driven interfacial evaporation has enormous promise for fresh water recovery and salt harvesting but salt accumulation related challenges stand in its way herein we report a spined groove ridge pairs inspired by the shell ornamentation of the vasticardium vertebratum which addresses salt accumulation by artfully integrating salt reflux into localized salt crystallization the seashell

localization is now considered a promising and sustainable freshwater technology due to its inexhaustible supply of solar energy and seawater ghasemi et al 2014 hogan et al 2014 tao et al 2018 despite great progress over the last few years the salt resistant performance of the solar driven interfacial evaporator remains a significant roadblock towards long term high salinity brine desalination bae

includes two categories salt reflux and localized salt crystallization chen et al 2019 xu et al 2020a zhang et al 2021b zhao et al 2020 the former aims to dilute the salinity on the evaporator surface by enhancing convection between the evaporation area and bulk water dong et al 2021 he et al 2019 kashyap et al 2017 kuang et al 2019 ni et al 2018 the latter is to tailor brine transport and form salt precipitants at specific locations such as the edge of the evaporator for localized crystallization dong et al 2022 li et al 2021 shao et al 2020 xia et al 2019 compared with salt reflux purely for freshwater collection localized salt crystallization can harvest clean water from otherwise unusable water while also enabling the recovery of solid salts because of the prospect of achieving zero liquid discharge zld localized salt crystallization has attracted increasing attention great efforts have been devoted to architecting a wide variety of locally crystallized solar evaporators finnerty et al 2017 liu et al 2021 shi et al 2018b zhang et al 2021a often locally crystallized solar evaporators rely on capillary wicking for water transport through porous media e g paper liu et al 2015 non

many approaches have been proposed for rational regulation of the water transport layer still long term evaporation could easily block water transport channels by accumulated salt crystals due to insufficient vertical brine loading and unsatisfactory design therefore exploring locally crystallized solar evaporators with an advanced water delivery structure will benefit water transport and continuous anti clogging performance to this end emerging trends are being shifted towards open capillary channels whose rapid directional transport capability and inherent anti clogging properties open up new possibilities in developing advanced evaporators chen et al 2016 comanns et al 2015 feng et al 2021 in a recent attempt singh et al created a laser etched aluminium surface with an open capillary architecture for high efficiency photothermal water evaporation singh et al 2020 another creative design is inspired by droplet transport along the shorebird beak and on the peristome surface of the nepenthes alata and the resulting solar evaporator allows high salinity desalination via localized salt crystallization wu et al 2020 while tremendous progress has been made to develop a variety of solar driven evaporation platforms as of today some hurdles such as salt scaling and long term stability of high salinity water desalination need to be overcome for successful real life applications besides there is a pressing need for increasing supplies of fit for purpose anti scaling solutions to the ever changing demands therefore more new alternative evaporators with high performance salt resistance are worthy of further exploration nature is full of technologies and billions of years of earth life coevolution yield countless innovative solutions biomimicry of mother nature s craftiness has inspired numerous diverse engineering medicine and apparel designs as we seek to create localized salt crystallization based solar desalination innovations molded from nature infaunal bivalves captured our attention with their unique motility and burrowing behaviors trueman 1966 vogel 1997 the vasticardium vertebratum is one such example its outer shell surface contains a series of grooves and spine bearing ridges arranged radially the groove promotes water flow by reducing resistance during swimming and the spine on the ridge facilitates fast sand transfer during burrowing fig 1 a and b stanley 1969 stanley 1981 the shell ornamentation serves the dual purpose of the liquid and solid delivery and it is precisely similar to the properties of localized salt crystallization that we are pursuing encouraged by this discovery herein we construct a volcano like evaporator with seashell mimetic microstructures using three dimensional 3d printing and in situ polypyrrole ppy polymerization the hollow truncated cone shaped enclosure allows for efficient evaporation via the afloat stability and localized heating and recovers both the diffuse reflected light energy and the radiative heat loss the radial groove and ridge as an important shell skeletal feature are applied onto the surface of the evaporator the optimized microgroove geometry enables rapid directional water transport and localized salt precipitation as another unique shell pattern feature the periodic spine on the ridge is accurately imitated and provides numerous micro unit salt reflux effects the 3d solar evaporator with the spined groove ridge pairs displays high water evaporation performance and excellent stable salt resistance even during the long term treatment of high concentrated brine 20 wt nacl in addition water quality analysis indicates that the volcano like evaporator is highly efficient in metal ion removal and salt recycling from seawater and wastewater the scale up experiments have proved that our design advances one step further towards creating zld solar evaporators for practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals pyrrole

using thermoplastic polymers pla abs asa petg and pc note that pla was selected in this study because of its superior printing capabilities the 3d printed objects can be made from any of the previously mentioned thermoplastic materials the printing process had the following operational parameters 0 4 mm nozzle diameter 0 1 mm layer thickness 50 mm s 1 nozzle speed 195 c nozzle temperatures and a 60 c bed temperature 2 4 fabrication of the 3d solar evaporator a simple one step in situ polymerization method was used to coat the model surface with ppy as reported in the literature pan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 solution a was produced in a typical polymer synthesis process by dissolving 2 74 g of aps in 5 ml of deionized water and storing it in a spray bottle solution b was then prepared by adding 0 84 ml of pyrrole and 1 84 ml of pa to 5 ml of ipa and blending evenly to improve the coating quality the uncoated sample was first ultrasonically washed with deionized water followed by a five minute plasma cleaning process when spraying spray solution b first then solution a and repeat the process several times to generate a homogeneous coating repeat washing with di water and ethanol was used to remove organic residue and aps finally the samples were dried at 45 c 2 5 solar desalination experiment the evaporator performance was evaluated using a solar simulator cel hxf300 ceaulight china before the experiment began the light intensity on the evaporator surface was determined by a light power meter cel np200 ceaulight china to improve the experiment accuracy the light intensity was calibrated by five spot measurement and the evaporator was placed within a 3d printed cup with a diameter of 53 mm the cup was filled with water brine or a highly concentrated metal salt solution throughout the experiment for the 3d evaporator the top projected plane is utilized to normalize the differences in light intensity measurements and evaporation rate calculations induced by height the evaporation rate was determined by measuring the weight loss of water in real time using an electronic mass balance with 0 01 mg precision tle204 02 mettler toledo ltd switzerland meanwhile an infrared camera dm i220 dongmei china was used to monitor the surface temperature of the evaporator during the experiment the ambient temperature and relative humidity were maintained at 25 c and 45 5 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 shell morphology and groove choice as mentioned above the outer shell surface of the vasticardium vertebratum bears a series of radial grooves and ridges and these two kinds of ornamentation are gradually narrowed towards the umbo fig 1b the average height and width of the groove are 1 8 mm and 2 6 mm respectively with the ridge in between having an average width of 1 1 mm the outer shell surface allows water droplets to spread and wet easily suggesting a typical hydrophilic property fig s1 also we found that liquid could flow towards the umbo along the groove via capillary action when applying it on the open edge of the shell fig 1c and video s1 triggered by this observation we first prepared a series of 3d printed open capillary grooves the three most representative geometric groove shapes i e ellipse square and v groove were selected to investigate the effect of groove configurations on the fluid flow performance the length l width w height h and horizontal inclination angle α of these three kinds of grooves were set to fixed values respectively to better compare the results to each other fig 1d the detailed design parameters and exact dimensions of the 3d printed open capillary grooves with different cross sections are illustrated in figs s2 and s3 with a continuous infusion of water the three open capillary channels exhibit similar fluid flow behaviors to the shell groove of the vasticardium vertebratum while filter paper as a control behaves quite differently at the same time the progression of the flow front was found in the increasing order of filter paper ellipse and square grooves v groove within 8 s for example the capillary rise distance up the v groove reached up to 21 mm and yet only around 8 mm of water transport length was observed on the paper strip fig 1e and f video s2 obviously when water flows through porous filter paper the wicking rate is affected by the disordered layout and swelling of the fiber matrix chang and kim 2020 when it comes to the groove the better transport performance of the open capillary channel can be explained by the filling conditions of the corners the inner corners of the groove enhance the capillary effect by increasing the local curvature of the surface to meet the contact angle wetting conditions higuera et al 2008 ouali et al 2013 compared to ellipse and square grooves under the same conditions the v groove has a smaller cross sectional area resulting in less liquid containment and a higher capillary rise taking square and v grooves as examples the capillary rise distance l of the groove can be expressed as bamorovat abadi and bahrami 2020 deng et al 2014 khan et al 2011 tian et al 2010 1 l s σ l 2 h w c o s θ s w ρ g h w s i n α 2 l v σ l 2 c o s θ v h 2 w 2 4 w ρ g h w 2 s i n α where l s and l v are the capillary rise distance of the square and v grooves respectively ρ and σ are the density and surface tension of water and θ and g respectively represent liquid solid contact angle and gravitational acceleration for the same horizontal inclination angle the ratio of the capillary rise distances of the square and v grooves can be written as 3 l s l v 2 h w c o s θ s w 2 2 c o s θ v h 2 w 2 4 w the following assumptions were made to obtain an approximation 1 the height and width of the groove are almost equal i e h w 2 each groove surface is superhydrophilic after plasma cleaning i e c o s θ s c o s θ v 1 therefore the ratio can be calculated as 4 l s l v 1 5 1 0 81 the experimental results indicate that the capillary rise distance of the square and v grooves are 16 4 mm and 21 3 mm respectively fig 1f that is the capillary rise distance ratio of these two grooves is 0 77 it demonstrates good agreement with the results obtained by the theoretical estimation in addition the experimental results of the ellipse groove match up well with the theoretical analysis fig s4 thus the v groove could provide a significantly high rise of capillary water furthermore the v groove as an open capillary channel can reduce the risk of clogging and promote evaporation by increasing the air water interface all the benefits indicate that the v groove lends itself to developing a high performance solar evaporator with localized salt crystallization 3 2 fabrication and characterization of the basic evaporator after selecting the optimal groove channel a 3d printed truncated conical supporter ornamented with a radial v groove array was first fabricated fig 2 a subsequently ppy nanoparticles as photothermal materials were deposited onto the supporter surface to obtain a basic truncated conical solar evaporator the detailed dimensions of the 3d prints are provided in fig s5 as shown in fig 2b the supporter using virgin pla has an ivory white compact surface after the overall coating of ppy nanoparticles except the external bottom the supporter morphology was retained well but there was remarkable black coloration fig 2f further scanning electron microscopy sem analysis also reveals similar highly stacked layered filament structures before and after ppy deposition with each layer being 80 μm thick fig 2c d g and h under higher magnification the truncated conical evaporator reveals a randomly rough surface where numerous papillae can be clearly explored fig 2e and i these tightly packed papillae are composed of aggregated ppy nanoparticles with a diameter of 250 nm fig s6 to clarify the ppy coating distribution on the evaporator surface energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was performed the element mapping analysis confirms the uniform distribution of n element on the evaporator surface suggesting a successful even ppy coating fig s7 in addition the supporter surface has a water contact angle of 98 9 due to the hydrophobic nature of pla after introducing the ppy coating the water contact angle of the evaporator surface decreases dramatically and it can be easily wet remarkably the 3d truncated cones can float on water readily regardless of whether they have a ppy coating or not fig s8 which could be attributed to the fact that strong layer adhesion provides a compact structure of the print and thus prevents them from overturning this steady floating feature is critical for effective water evaporation what s more water moves upward along v grooves and spreads out transversely on the surface as soon as the evaporator contacts the bulk water fig 2j and video s3 also a steady and continuous water film covering the surface is formed in only 5 seconds this rapid directional water transport performance provides the prerequisite for efficient evaporation and localized salt crystallization 3 3 photothermal properties and steam generation as depicted in fig 3 a the hollow truncated conical evaporator provides an air cavity to enhance light reflections since the external bottom is not coated with ppy it still maintains hydrophobic properties and exhibits a silver mirror like sheen during water immersion such a sheathing layer of air trapped on the surface can serve as a good thermal insulator fig s8 besides the floating characteristic of the evaporator keeps most of the evaporation zone above the water reducing heat loss through conduction the ppy coated v groove array on the evaporator outwall facilitates rapid and directed water flow as well as localized heating induced evaporation meanwhile this groove ridge inner wall with ppy coating provides micro nano multiscale surface morphology that can efficiently utilize incident light via multiple reflections for a better evaluation of the photothermal performance of the basic evaporator a plane solar evaporator with parallel closed capillary channels was fabricated using the same preparation process as the control the detailed experimental setup for water evaporation evaluation can be found in fig s9 the top projected plane and the corresponding projected area were utilized to normalize the differences in light intensity measurement and evaporation rate calculation fig s10 li et al 2019 the results of the evaporation capability of the evaporators in fig 3b confirm our conception that the 3d truncated conical evaporator demonstrates superior evaporation performance under one sun illumination the water evaporation rate increases significantly with the aid of the evaporators from 0 51 kg m 2 h 1 for bare water to 1 01 kg m 2 h 1 for the plane evaporator and to 1 73 kg m 2 h 1 for the truncated conical evaporator the shadowed region between the curves indicates the net mass change over time after subtracting the evaporation amount in the darkness the truncated conical evaporator can promote water evaporation efficiently compared to the plane evaporator after 1 h of operation at one sun illumination the net change in water mass increases from 0 83 kg m 2 for the plane evaporator to 1 40 kg m 2 for the truncated conical evaporator after an investigation of water evaporation performance the energy conversion efficiency η of both evaporators was further calculated using eq 5 li et al 2018 5 η m δ q t b t i l v t i α s p i n where m is the net mass change rate of water kg m 2 h 1 δ q is the sensible heat differential of water from t b the temperature of bulk water to t i the steady state evaporation temperature l v is the vaporization enthalpy for water at t i α s is the solar absorptance of the evaporator and p i n is the power of the incident simulated sunlight beam according to the above equation α s and t i must be obtained first to calculate the energy conversion efficiency the uv vis nir diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was employed to quantify the solar absorption property of the evaporators as the solar spectrum is not uniformly distributed the light absorption performance is currently characterized by α s which can be calculated using the following equation shi et al 2018a 6 α s 300 2500 i λ 1 r λ d λ 300 2500 i λ d λ where i λ and r λ are the solar intensity and the sample reflectance at different wavelengths λ respectively the value of α s for the plane and truncated conical supporters is 49 34 and 80 30 respectively whereas it increases to 97 30 and 99 49 after ppy coating fig 3e the results prove that the truncated conical evaporator could enhance the solar absorption via its air cavity and micro nano surface texture on the inwall fig s11 similar phenomena have been described in some reported 3d solar evaporators shi et al 2018a wang et al 2018 then an infrared camera was used to capture the evaporator temperature distribution for determining t i under one sun illumination both evaporators in the dry state exhibited a fast thermal response and a stable temperature distribution figs s12 and s13 the truncated conical evaporator showed apparent temperature inhomogeneity along the longitudinal axis the closer to the top of the evaporator the higher the temperature obviously anything close to the light source could obtain great thermal energy and thus a high temperature however when the truncated conical evaporator is in contact with water it has a temperature profile that is the opposite of that in the dry state showing a negative correlation between slant height and temperature even in the darkness a similar but relatively small variation in surface temperature distribution can be observed in the wet state truncated conical evaporator fig 3d by contrast the plane evaporator proves a straightforward concentric temperature distribution under illumination due to its simple structure fig 3c because of its simple temperature distribution and small temperature range we can calculate its evaporation enthalpy easily using an approximation of the steady state evaporation temperature when it comes to the 3d solar evaporator the steady state evaporation temperature is often approximated using the surface area weighted average approach li et al 2018 however our truncated conical evaporator has a wide temperature range and unique geometry so it s a challenge to use this approach therefore we proposed an image processing based solution we first collected the average gray value of the evaporator region from infrared images and then transformed it using the image s gray value temperature scale the detailed process in fig s14 then the average steady state evaporation temperature of each evaporator was obtained which was 37 1 c for the plane one and 33 4 c for the 3d one respectively vaporization enthalpy could be easily estimated once the steady state evaporation temperature was determined henderson sellers 1984 finally the energy efficiency of the plane evaporator is 58 40 whereas the truncated conical evaporator is 95 86 compared with the plane evaporator the truncated conical evaporator demonstrates significantly higher energy efficiency it could be attributed to the rational structural design that improved light harvesting and thermal management the hollow truncated cone shaped enclosure not only allows for reliable localized heating driven evaporation but also recovers both the diffuse reflected light and the thermal radiation loss from the evaporator bottom fig s15 more importantly such a design also causes an interesting and unique variation in temperature with height a better understanding is needed of how the evaporator temperature distribution affects its water evaporation behavior using the image processing based solution as mentioned above a 3d surface temperature plot was thus constructed to reveal the temperature gradient along the outwall of the truncated conical evaporator in detail the temperature reaches 35 4 c at the bottom edge and 26 8 c at the top edge of the 3d evaporator under illumination figs 3f g and s16 in comparison to the one in the dry state up to a 42 2 c difference in temperature was detected at the top edge while an 11 1 c difference was recorded at the bottom edge which means that the evaporative flux increases along the outwall and reaches its maximum at the top the steam presence also proves the more considerable evaporative flux at the top fig s17 when water moves upward via the v groove the narrowing channel design leads to a continuous reduction in the amount of water and the water film thickness the thin interfacial water film absorbs the generated heat at the top edge and a significant evaporative cooling effect occurs in other words the highest evaporative flux would be achieved at the top edge in addition the evaporation triggered temperature change brings about a surface tension gradient and a resulting thermocapillary force that produces an upward fluid circulation fig 3h wu et al 2020 thermocapillary force as the surface shear caused by a thermal gradient could be expressed as gamboa et al 2018 7 τ d γ d t t where τ is the thermocapillary force d γ d t is the temperature derivative of the liquid surface tension and t is the temperature gradient the thermal gradient along the longitudinal axis alters the surface tension of the liquid and induces a shear flow which contributes to the upward propulsion of fluid from hot to cold regions the consequent marangoni effect could also boost the evaporation process with this upward water circumfluence the evaporation on the top is further enhanced and the temperature drops 3 4 solar driven desalination and evaporator upgrade for zld encouraged by the good photothermal water evaporation performance of the basic truncated conical evaporator we began to investigate its desalination capability the evaporator demonstrated excellent localized salt crystallization property when treating low salinity brine i e 3 5 wt nacl for up to 12 h as shown in fig 4 b the salt precipitation did not occur along the evaporator outwall but instead only on its top edge because the crystallization area is physically separated from the evaporating surface salt precipitation during brine treatment does not affect its desalination performance unlike most 2d evaporators to further investigate whether it could broaden the range of practical desalination applications the salt resistance of the evaporator to hypersaline brine 20 wt nacl was characterized unfortunately its salt resistance and evaporation rate deteriorated severely fig 4c and g the salt crystals gradually accumulated in locations coalesced with each other on the top edge and covered most of the evaporator surface after 12 h of continuous operation fig 4c notably most of the salt crystals appeared on the ridges whereas only few were found on the v grooves this ridge preferential crystallization could be attributed to the fact that the ridge lacks an efficient water transport structure compared to the groove during the treatment of hypersaline brine water evaporation causes a rapid increase in localized brine concentration and insufficient water supply on the ridge cannot effectively dilute the concentrated brine the slow back diffusion process makes the balance of salt dissolution crystallization shift toward crystallization it leads to a sharp increase in local salt concentration and salts precipitate out of the fluid similar phenomena have been reported in locally crystallized evaporators with a closed capillary channel that salt scaling blocks the channel and restricts water transport because of diffusion limited local salt concentration increase and crystal accumulation finnerty et al 2017 liu et al 2021 shao et al 2020 xia et al 2019 obviously there is a need for upgrading the basic truncated conical evaporator to promote its practical application we once again found inspiration from the exterior structure of the vasticardium vertebratum seashell fig 4a as shown in fig s18 the high magnification sem image indicates that the basic truncated conical evaporator does not truly mimic the external seashell structure because the spines on the ridge are omitted these spines turn out to be a critical feature of the vasticardium vertebratum seashell helping burrow and desand stanley 1969 stanley 1981 in view of this fact the upgrade truncated conical evaporator was built by introducing periodic spines on the ridge and its detailed dimensions are provided in fig s19 the optical and sem images show that the periodic spines on the ridge have an average spacing of 500 μm providing a grainy feel like the vasticardium vertebratum seashell figs s20 and s21 when the upgrade evaporator was used to treat a concentrated brine 20 wt nacl for 12 h it could display a stable and superior salt rejecting performance compared to the basic one fig 4f and g all salt precipitants on the outwall disappeared and the salt crystallization was only observed on the top of the upgrade evaporator fig 4d as the crystallized salt blocks were loosely adhered to the evaporator surface they could be easily removed and collected fig s22 even after the brine was evaporated to dryness there was no salt crystal at the bottom of the bulk water container suggesting the promising zld capability of the evaporator fig s23 additionally its salt resistance was further evaluated using a series of highly concentrated alkali alkali earth metal and heavy metal salt solutions i e k mg2 ca2 co2 cu2 and cr6 and the evaporator exhibited outstanding anti scaling properties with localized salt crystallization figs 4e and s24 we believe that the spine could improve local water transport by interconnecting and interacting with the adjoining groove and enhancing the micro unit salt reflux on the ridge to visually observe the change of water flow and salt transportation around the spines the following two experiments were conducted when applying dyed water to a v groove channel the liquid climbed upward immediately by contrast the water flow on the spined groove ridge pairs of the upgraded evaporator split into two directions and moved laterally around the spine leaving a dye trail on the ridge fig s25 also in the case of the redissolution of salt crystals dissolution proceeded quickly with the dissolved of 0 25 g crystals in only 7 min when applying solid nacl onto the outer wall of the upgrade evaporator fig s26 however the basic evaporator could not complete the dissolution of the same amount of nacl even after 25 min thus not effectively rejecting the salt to uncover the role that the periodic spine plays in salt rejection a comparative study was conducted by using two evaporators embedded with pure v grooves and spines respectively in view of the ridge preferential crystallization in the previous results we first fabricated an evaporator with an array of pure v grooves to decrease this effect when using it to treat hypersaline brine under illumination a salt crystal capped evaporator was still obtained also a certain amount of crystalline salt appeared on the evaporator outwall although less than that on the basic evaporator fig s27 it is evident that the regions where diffusion dominated were significantly reduced due to the disappearance of the ridge of note however is that there is a connecting line between two v grooves next to each other although we maximized the number of v grooves to ensure that the connecting line had the smallest width as the diameter of the printing nozzle 300 μm it could still provide locations for diffusion limited local salt precipitation then we turned our focus to another evaporator the evaporator only with periodic spines on its outwall for treating hypersaline brine as expected most parts of the evaporator outwall remained free of salt precipitants fig s28 it indicates that the introduction of periodic spines enables nacl to be distributed evenly over the outwall area avoiding local overconcentration i e crystallization hot spots besides the salt crystallized regions on the top edge expanded suggesting that the lack of the v groove impairs the ability of upward transport of water and limits the performance of localized crystallization obviously the introduced spines create new flow paths for timely supplementation of bulk brine and the the highly concentrated salt solution on the ridge is diluted by continuously replenishing low concentration brine in other words the periodic spines introduced in the ridge can effectively provide micro unit salt reflux to avoid reaching its saturation concentration by sufficient lateral brine transfer on the basis of the above results it can be concluded that due to the integrated design of v grooves and periodic spines on the ridge the upgrade evaporator achieves not only local crystallization with rapid directional brine transport but also improves local brine transport to enhance the salt reflux effect and prevent salt precipitation additionally compared with other reported evaporators via additive manufacturing our integrated design reveals excellent long term salt resistance while treating hypersaline water and heavy metal solutions table s2 therefore we believe that the upgrade truncated conical evaporator could help solve the issue of industrial brine treatment zld 3 5 water purification performance and evaporator scale up as mentioned above growing environmental concerns make locally crystallized solar evaporators attractive because the solid salts can be separated and recycled detailed evaluation of the performance of wastewater treatment is thus needed for a successful design and operation of a locally crystallized solar evaporator to demonstrate water quality after desalination using the upgrade truncated conical evaporator seawater collected from the south china sea and a series of heavy metal salt solutions were used as raw water fig 5 a presents the detailed water quality of the water samples before and after treatment the inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms analysis indicates that the na concentration was significantly decreased by approximately three orders of magnitude after desalination and was far below the drinking water quality guidelines defined by the world health organization in addition there was no heavy metal of interest i e cu2 co2 and cr6 with a level above 0 1 mg l 1 after water purification and the color of heavy metal solutions changed to colorless and transparent fig 5b up to six orders of magnitude reduction in heavy metal ion concentration indicate highly efficient heavy metal ion removal the purified water basically meets the requirements of the surface water quality standard gb3838 2002 in china wu et al 2017 also of note fused deposition modeling fdm was selected here because it is the most widely used 3d printing technology and the most cost effective way of producing prototypes and functional parts even though fdm has the lower dimensional accuracy and resolution among the common 3d printing technologies the simple structure of the truncated conical solar evaporator exhibits high scalability and practicality fig 5e in addition to pla a wide range of fdm materials such as polyamide pa polycarbonate pc acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs acrylonitrile styrene acrylate asa and polyethylene terephthalate glycol petg can be successfully utilized to print the evaporation equipment fig 5c finally a solar evaporation system was introduced to investigate the practical application potential of the scale up evaporator system in the outdoors fig 5f the evaporation rate was measured concurrently with the ambient sunlight intensity where the evaporation rate reached 1 5 kg m 2 h 1 at 13 00 pm fig 5d these results indicate that our design has great advantages for advancing the use of solar desalination technology in the real world 4 conclusions with a hierarchical morphological structure similar to the outer shell of the vasticardium vertebratum we demonstrate a truncated conical solar driven evaporator for high performance brine desalination and zld the macroscopic groove ridge pair provides rapid guided water transport and the spine microstructure on the ridge prevents salt precipitation even for high salinity brine treatment the spine induced micro grade water transport can still avoid salt accumulation along the channel and ensure top edge preferential crystallization these two features in combination endow our volcano like solar evaporator with superior locally crystallized desalination performance under one sun illumination the evaporator yields a high evaporation rate of 1 73 kg m 2 h 1 with an energy conversion efficiency of 95 86 furthermore the potential of the evaporator for heavy metal recovery and water purification from wastewater has been proven by a series of experiments we believe that our design could contribute to the practical application of solar driven interfacial evaporation in various fields such as seawater desalination wastewater treatment and solute enrichment declaration of competing interest the

ubiquitous constituent in rivers and streams is now recognized as a significant part of global carbon cycling rosentreter and eyre 2020 wang et al 2021 alterations to dissolved organic and inorganic carbon doc and dic characteristics are frequently occurring in relation to biotic and abiotic conditions lapierre et al 2015 kaijser et al 2021 for instance the currently observed photolytic and biological degradation will increase organic matter decomposition followed by remineralization of doc to carbon dioxide co2 ni and li 2019 yang et al 2021 riverine dic comprised of carbonic acid h2co3 bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and dissolved co2 originates mostly from mineral weathering as well as leaching and respiration of vegetations and soils raymond and hamilton 2018 globally doc and dic together contribute 90 of the total terrestrial to aquatic carbon delivery drake et al 2020 in river systems drivers such as hydrology climate lithology biology and human activities largely alter doc and dic thereby routing their dynamics and inner links tian et al 2013 moatar et al 2017 li et al 2022 since dc is highly important variable and multifaceted responses of its composition origin and

2020 terrestrial inputs and endogenous controls typically characterize doc characteristics source and fate wang et al 2002 meanwhile shifts in level composition and availability of doc can impact in

waters karst landforms account for 15 of the global continent which experiences specific geological hydrologic and biological conditions fleury 2009 carbonate bedrocks e g limestone and dolomite significantly contribute to aquatic dic concentration while dissolution and chemical weathering of carbonates are sensitive to seasonal precipitation warming and runoff li et al 2010 jiang et al 2013 for example rainwater greatly accelerates terrestrial carbonate dissolution and carbonate debris output the latter further consumes co2 from decayed organic carbon increasing dic levels in karst aquatic systems xiong et al 2021 large amounts of terrestrial carbon input into karst waters attributing to severe soil erosion which further results in regional ecological vulnerability butscher and huggenberger 2009 thus karst rivers are sensitive to environmental changes and artificial disturbances huang et al 2019 studies suggest combined carbonate dissolution water cycling and photosynthetic uptake of dic predominantly control carbon budget in karst waters liu et al 2010 2011 this induces mutual transformation of organic and inorganic carbon and couples doc with dic species observations previously focused on dic biogeochemical processes and water chemistry assayag et al 2008 wang et al 2020 however understanding on the links of doc characteristic to dic species was limited unravelling dc dynamics and internal linkages may provide implications for its composition origin and fate and therefore allow for a better understanding of carbon cycling zeng et al 2011 bastidas navarro et al 2021 we chose the karst river system because its notable autochthonous or allochthonous carbon inputs and environmental sensitivity we hypothesize that dc species can be mutually coupled due to their collective sources and internal transformation sun et al 2021 and spatiotemporal conditions of hydrology and meteorology will constrain this coupling process in testing our hypotheses we investigated aquatic dc species as well as co2 uptake or emission from a karst river system qijiang guizhou province china the objectives of this study are to 1 examine spatiotemporal variability of dic species water air co2 exchange and doc composition and 2 explore internal links between doc and dic and further reveal origin and fate of dc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field sampling

the eem raman and rayleigh scatterings were cut and interpolated in the corresponding areas bahram et al 2006 2 3 water air co2 flux calculation and optical analysis thin boundary layer model was used to compute water air co2 flux f mmol m2 d as follows 1 f k k h p c o 2 w a t e r p c o 2 a i r 2 k h 10 1 11 0 016 t 0 00007 t 2 where k cm h is gas transfer velocity of co2 pco2water μatm 410 μatm in

riverine k is dominated by hydraulic characteristics e g water depth and channel slope and particularly links to w however water turbulence greatly disturbs w and thus k resulting in large uncertainties in water air co2 flux calculation liu et al 2017 therefore previous studies focused on empirical formula between w and k raymond et al 2012 li et al 2019 in this study we employed a

inverse of fractional projected excitation emission area briefly u i n was obtained using originlab originpro 2021 in volume integration program the parallel factor analysis parafac can separate eem into independent fluorophores and capture the collective doc composition across samples stedmon and bro 2008 the raman and rayleigh scatterings were previously deducted by interpolation which also ensured non negativity of data built in program in interpolation the model selection and correspondence validation between the excitation and emission loadings for each component were performed using residual analysis and split half analysis currently parafac is widely used to semi quantitatively decipher principal components of natural doc hosen et al 2021 zhuang et al 2021 2 4 data quality water

300 342 nm red shifted and ex em 228 274 334 nm 4 discussion 4 1 drivers of dic species dynamics carbonate dissolution is a determinant driver of dic dynamics in karst waters zeng et al 2011 for example carbonate dissolution consumed dissolved co2 and generated co3 2 resulting in notable high co3 2 but low dissolved co2 levels in aug fig 2 aqueous co3 2 was supposed to be rapidly transformed into hco3 in the caco2 co2 h2o system caco3 co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 liu et al 2004 it was partially consistent with the observations except for the unexpected low hco3 levels fig 2 implying a potential driver for hco3 consumption in fact photosynthetic uptake was the most probable explanation for consumed hco3 ca2 2hco3 caco3 ch2o o2 causing counteracted primary production and co2 production in karst waters lerman and mackenzie 2005 this was supported by significant carbohydrate production consumption from photosynthesis respiration in the adjacent karst waters ni et al 2022 therefore combined actions of carbonate dissolution with photosynthetic uptake could explain variability of dic species in the karst river system fig 2 which was understandably accelerated by elevated temperature t 28 8 3 34 c table 1 however high levels of dissolved co2 were driven by in stream respiration in consideration of abnormally high doc concentrations in dec fig 2 and table 2 this counteracted and even masked photosynthetic process leading to hco3 accumulation in the river system goldman et al 2017 the river sx was characterized by agricultural practices based on in situ observations and land use types fig 1 which showed remarkable low levels of dic and hco3 fig s1 indeed cropping systems trend to alter land water connectivity neutralizing inorganic carbon via soil derived organic acids solomon et al 2000 aquatic pco2 generally originates from terrestrial co2 input and in situ respiration of doc and is consumed by photosynthesis and carbonate dissolution wang et al 2017 riverine pco2 averaged 620 3 1028 7 μatm across samples fig 3 which was lower than previous global estimates 3100 μatm on average raymond et al 2013 studies indicated that specific carbonate process primarily sequestrated co2 and cause its low magnitude in karst waters pu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in addition to carbonate dissolution photosynthesis respiration interactions hydrology rainfall and runoff also triggered dilution effect and led to temporal shifts of pco2 between aug post wet period and dec initial drought period fig 3 however rainfall induced terrestrial input was apparently masked and failed to increase the pco2 in august spatiotemporal trends of riverine f values were highly in agreement with pco2 and 35 samples showed f 0 whereas the others exhibited f 0 fig 3 this suggested that the karst river system could be both co2 sink and source with respect to the overlying atmosphere zhang et al 2017 using a surface water area of 31 8 km2 and an average f value of 154 3 772 6 mmol m2 d annual co2 flux was estimated to be 0 079 tg co2 y in the river system qijiang 4 2 drivers of doc compositional dynamics humic like dom was the primary doc compounds and occupied 39 0 75 2 of doc in the river system fig 4 this was in accordance with previously reported rivers and lakes in the upper yangtze wang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 as a recalcitrant fraction in natural environments humic like dom was accumulated in rivers via hydrologic and biochemical processes ni et al 2020a we thus observed autochthonous e g c1 in apr aug and mar and allochthonous e g c2 in aug and dec humic like compounds fig 5 limited rainfall weakened soil flushing whereas abundant doc storage stimulated biological process in dec initial drought period which respectively led to a low terrigenous signal fulvic acid like but a high biogenic signal soluble microbial byproduct like table 2 and fig 4 in aug high abundance of bioavailable fraction tyrosine like dom could be associated with prominent photosynthesis implying that increased primary production enhanced microbial activities and further accelerated biogenic metabolites hsieh et al 2021 prior observations also suggested that newly microbial derived doc tended to be preferentially utilized in situ mayorga et al 2005 ni et al 2020b human disturbance however might aggravate the unbalance of biological processes resulting in lower abundance of soluble microbial byproduct like dom under agricultural condition sx when compared to relatively natural condition sk and zd figs 1 and 4 low molecular weight doc was generally more labile and bioavailable hansen et al 2016 thus the higher sr and bix values were found in mar indicating in situ enriched micromolecular and endogenous doc table 2 and fig 5 particularly relatively high uri 5 suggested considerable abundance of protein like substances e g tryptophan like fluorophores her et al 2004 these evidenced biology as a primary role driving doc dynamics in the karst river system photosynthesis could be enhanced by carbonate dissolution and generated bioavailable carbohydrates promoting microbial metabolism and thus biogenic doc production tuchman et al 2006 bocaniov and smith 2009 ni et al 2022 meanwhile recently produced doc trended to be biodegraded and even remineralized into co2 ni and li 2020 2023 in this context we speculate that partial dissolved carbon will always undergo a rapid transformation between inorganic and organic phases under the biological pump effect in karst waters liu et al 2015 4 3 internal linkages between doc and dic carbonate dissolution and precipitation largely drove dic transformation in karst waters vesper et al 2016 for example precipitated co3 2 rose co2 levels and accumulated co2 triggered hco3 and dic concentrations increase this process was inherent and hence caused remarkable linkages between dic species fig 6 metabolism produced biological fractions and byproducts hajje and jaffé 2006 or alternatively consumed labile fractions and caused relative accumulation of refractory doc hu et al 2018 this explained linkages between doc composition fig 6 regarding inner linkages between dc carbonate dissolution provided dic for photosynthesis causing bioavailable substrates amino acids generated sojka et al 1967 pentecost 1992 therefore biological metabolites region ⅰ ⅱ and ⅳ could be positively or negatively correlated to dic species dic hco3 and co3 2 as reflected in apr and dec fig 6a and 6c depending on whether dic was continuously replenished elevated temperature facilitated metabolism e g biological utilization of dic photosynthesis and labile doc respiration butterwick et al 2005 this implied decreased dic species hco3 and dissolved co2 and relatively accumulated humic like dom c1 c2 and c3 in aug fig 6b the labile doc consumption region ⅰ ⅱ and c3 stimulated biological mineralization mao and li 2019 which produced co2 or pco2 and led to recalcitrant doc c1 and c2 accumulation in dec fig 6c however the linkages between doc and dic were decoupled in mar fig 6d principal components pcs in pca captured variable information and indicated their possible sources or processes fig 7 i in apr pc1 was corelated with dic hco3 pco2 ta region ⅱ and ⅳ indicating that photosynthetic dic species increased abundance of amino acids reiche and bard 1979 pc2 consisted of region ⅰ ⅲ ⅴ c1 c2 and doc linking to terrigenous doc inputs yang et al 2020 ii in aug pc1 was comprised of co3 2 co2 region ⅱ ⅳ ⅴ pco2 c4 and c5 which represented photosynthetic uptake of co2 and subsequent enhancement of metabolism parazoo et al 2018 pc2 referred to dic hco3 ta c1 and c3 which might suggest that high ph as a result of photosynthesis table 1 increased levels of hco3 formation and impeded humus dissolution jòzefaciuk et al 1996 stirling 2011 iii in dec pc1 was dominated by co3 2 region ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ ⅴ c1 c2 c3 and c4 which could originate from strong human inputs due to large and undifferentiated inputs of doc composition liu et al 2020 pc2 was typical of water chemistry and related to dic hco3 ta and pco2 iv pc1 exhibited strong loadings of co2 pco2 region ⅱ ⅲ and c2 which represented mutually masked autochthonous and allochthonous co2 inputs it might explain the decoupled doc dic fig 6d ni et al 2020b pc2 was linked to dic hco3 region ⅲ ⅳ c1 and c3 implying that metabolism enhanced refractory doc accumulation catalá et al 2015 4 4 implications for dc composition origin and fate natural dc is highly variable and interactive which contributes 90 flux of terrestrial carbon to aquatic ecosystems globally drake et al 2020 while current datasets have revealed doc and dic dynamics rosentreter and eyre 2020 he et al 2022 and their compositional transformation and inner linkages remain elusive karst waters are selected due to the notable inorganic organic carbon transformation mechanism and allochthonous inputs sun et al 2021 in the present study we acknowledged the determinant biological pump effect in karst waters liu et al 2015 which interpreted some specific observations in the river system for example photosynthetic uptake of dic altered synchronized variations between hco3 co3 2 and dissolved co2 resulting in carbon sequestration and low magnitude of co2 emissions figs 2 and 3 we found strong biogenic signals fig 4 but low doc concentrations 1 26 3 76 mg l on average except for anthropogenic doc in dec these apparently conflicting observations implied that rapid kinetics of the biological pump drove partial active dc constantly in the cycling young doc e g carbohydrates amino acids and metabolic byproducts is preferentially degraded and mineralized into co2 mayorga et al 2005 and the produced co2 will be reacted by carbonate dissolution and subsequent photosynthesis for young doc generation liu et al 2010 the cycling not only deciphered dc source and fate but also established its inner links for instance coupled hco3 co3 2 doc and co2 pco2 doc fig 6 suggested the dc transformations from photosynthesis and respiration respectively however irregular allochthonous terrigenous and anthropogenic inputs might mask and even decouple the linkages fig 6d and 7 in this context temporal variability of hydro meteorological conditions e g rainfall temperature and soil flushing also constrained internal dc couplings regier et al 2020 song et al 2021 this was consistent with our hypotheses and could be extended to most karst waters we thus highlighted that biology derived transformation between riverine dic and doc could largely explain aquatic carbon cycling however which was previously undervalued in karst regions specific functions of karst biology are merited in further works 5 conclusion natural dissolved carbon dc is ubiquitous and essentially contributes to global carbon cycling whereas its spatiotemporal dynamics and internal links have yet to be revealed this study demonstrates biotic and abiotic drivers of dc and the implications for composition origin and fate in a karst river system the general notion carbonate dissolution combined with photosynthetic uptake as a biological pump was applicable to explain temporal dynamics of dic species agricultural practices altered land water connectivity and thus caused spatial patterns of dic and hco3 levels carbon sequestration in the karst critical zone led to low magnitude of pco2 and hence limited co2 emissions in surface waters riverine doc was constrained by terrigenous and biogenic drivers and human disturbance aggravated the unbalance of endogenous inputs particularly biology could be regarded as a determinant for doc dynamics driving partial dc constantly in the cycling of inorganic organic phases biological metabolism established linkages between dic and doc composition which might be affected by temporal hydro meteorological conditions specific links and mutual transformations between karst dic and doc should be

abstract keywords dissolved carbon dissolved co2 co2 emission yangtze changjiang mutual transformation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved carbon dc as a ubiquitous constituent in rivers and streams is now recognized as a significant part of global carbon cycling rosentreter and eyre 2020 wang et al 2021 alterations to dissolved organic and inorganic carbon doc and dic characteristics are frequently occurring in relation to biotic and abiotic conditions lapierre et al 2015 kaijser et al 2021 for instance the currently observed photolytic and biological degradation will increase organic matter decomposition followed by remineralization of doc to carbon dioxide co2 ni and li 2019 yang et al 2021 riverine dic comprised of carbonic acid h2co3 bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and dissolved co2 originates mostly from mineral weathering as well as leaching and respiration of vegetations and soils raymond and hamilton 2018 globally doc and dic together contribute 90 of the total terrestrial to aquatic carbon delivery drake et al 2020 in river systems drivers such as hydrology climate lithology biology and human activities largely alter doc and dic thereby routing their dynamics and inner links tian et al 2013 moatar et al 2017 li et al 2022 since dc is highly important variable and multifaceted responses of its composition origin and fate to carbon cycling are to be merited natural doc in river system consists of heterogeneous mixtures e g humus lignin protein carbohydrates and phenolic compounds kawahigashi et al 2004 ni and li 2020 terrestrial inputs and endogenous controls typically characterize doc characteristics source and fate wang et al 2002 meanwhile shifts in level composition and availability of doc can impact in situ biochemistry and thus give feedback on aquatic environments cao et al 2016 as a result spatiotemporal patterns of hydrologic climatic and ambient conditions are likely to regulate doc dynamics chen et al 2021 and further regulate aqueous co2 tang et al 2021 gu et al 2022 fluvial networks transport and outgas carbon species causing lateral and vertical fluxes of its species h2co3 hco3 co3 2 and co2 doctor et al 2008 particularly waters supersaturated in co2 with respect to the overlying atmosphere are typical of high magnitude partial pressure of aqueous co2 pco2 and thus potentially serve as co2 emitters geldern et al 2015 biological metabolism links dc inner transformations between organic and inorganic phases wissmar et al 1981 doc respiration generates aquatic pco2 dissolved co2 and increases dic levels pu et al 2020 while photosynthesis in turn consumes dic and produces doc sun et al 2021 this pervasive part of carbon cycling however can be particularly profound in karst waters karst landforms account for 15 of the global continent which experiences specific geological hydrologic and biological conditions fleury 2009 carbonate bedrocks e g limestone and dolomite significantly contribute to aquatic dic concentration while dissolution and chemical weathering of carbonates are sensitive to seasonal precipitation warming and runoff li et al 2010 jiang et al 2013 for example rainwater greatly accelerates terrestrial carbonate dissolution and carbonate debris output the latter further consumes co2 from decayed organic carbon increasing dic levels in karst aquatic systems xiong et al 2021 large amounts of terrestrial carbon input into karst waters attributing to severe soil erosion which further results in regional ecological vulnerability butscher and huggenberger 2009 thus karst rivers are sensitive to environmental changes and artificial disturbances huang et al 2019 studies suggest combined carbonate dissolution water cycling and photosynthetic uptake of dic predominantly control carbon budget in karst waters liu et al 2010 2011 this induces mutual transformation of organic and inorganic carbon and couples doc with dic species observations previously focused on dic biogeochemical processes and water chemistry assayag et al 2008 wang et al 2020 however understanding on the links of doc characteristic to dic species was limited unravelling dc dynamics and internal linkages may provide implications for its composition origin and fate and therefore allow for a better understanding of carbon cycling zeng et al 2011 bastidas navarro et al 2021 we chose the karst river system because its notable autochthonous or allochthonous carbon inputs and environmental sensitivity we hypothesize that dc species can be mutually coupled due to their collective sources and internal transformation sun et al 2021 and spatiotemporal conditions of hydrology and meteorology will constrain this coupling process in testing our hypotheses we investigated aquatic dc species as well as co2 uptake or emission from a karst river system qijiang guizhou province china the objectives of this study are to 1 examine spatiotemporal variability of dic species water air co2 exchange and doc composition and 2 explore internal links between doc and dic and further reveal origin and fate of dc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field sampling

instrument specific biases were converted to the corrected sc rc according to manufacturer s correction factors the eem inner filter effect were corrected using non linear function fits ni et al 2020a the eem raman and rayleigh scatterings were cut and interpolated in the corresponding areas bahram et al 2006 2 3 water air co2 flux calculation and optical analysis thin boundary layer model was used to compute water air co2 flux f mmol m2 d as follows 1 f k k h p c o 2 w a t e r p c o 2 a i r 2 k h 10 1 11 0 016 t 0 00007 t 2 where k cm h is gas transfer velocity of co2 pco2water μatm 410 μatm in this study and pco2air μatm are partial pressures of co2 in surface water and atmospheric equilibrium respectively kh mmol m3 μatm refer to t c corrected solubility coefficient henry s constant riverine k is dominated by hydraulic characteristics e g water depth and channel slope and particularly links to w however water turbulence greatly disturbs w and thus k resulting in large uncertainties in water air co2 flux calculation liu et al 2017 therefore previous studies focused on empirical formula between w and k raymond et al 2012 li et al 2019 in this study we employed a widely used empirical model for k calibration alin et al 2011 which is also optimum model for the river system according to spatial scale 3 k t k 600 s c t 600 0 5 4 s c t 1911 1 118 11 t 3 4527 t 2 0

hix was obtained at an excitation of 254 nm and dividing the emission intensity at 435 480 nm by 300 345 nm detailed information of uv visible and fluorescent optical properties is summarized in table s1 fluorescence regional integration fri was applied to trace doc composition based on modelled fluorescence compounds and the corresponding fluorescence regions zhou et al 2013 accordingly each eem was divided into five regions as follows region ⅰ ex 220 250 nm em 280 330 nm tyrosine like region ⅱ ex 220 250 nm em 330 380 nm tryptophan like region ⅲ ex 220 250 nm em 380 550 nm fulvic acid like

fluorescence response p i n were calculated as follows 6 u i n m f i u i 7 p i n u i n i 1 5 u i n where mf i refers to multiplication factors for the corresponding fluorescence regions and is the inverse of fractional projected excitation emission area briefly u i n was obtained using originlab originpro 2021 in volume integration program the parallel factor analysis parafac can separate eem into independent fluorophores and capture the collective doc composition across samples stedmon and bro 2008 the raman and rayleigh scatterings were previously deducted by interpolation which also ensured non negativity of data built in program in interpolation the model selection and correspondence validation between the excitation and emission loadings for each component were performed using residual analysis and split half analysis currently parafac is widely used to semi quantitatively decipher principal components of natural doc hosen et al 2021 zhuang et al 2021 2 4 data quality water sampling and chemical analysis followed the standard procedures and methods proposed by american public health association 1985 the ph probe was calibrated with ph 4 01 7 00 and 9 18 standard solution at 25 c ensuring 0 002 unit ph accuracy replicate measurements suggested an accuracy of 0 5 c for water temperature probe three parallel titrations indicated that uncertainties of ta were controlled within 3 the outliers were picked out and the averaged readings was record during doc measuring coefficient of variation 2 with the majority being 1 non carbonate alkalinity nc alk is the primary contributor to aquatic pco2 which originates mostly from ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp and organic acid ni et al 2019 our unpublished data indicated that concentrations of nh4 n tp and doc are 0 92 0 56 2 52 2 14 and 330 3 740 3 μmol l respectively this could cause an uncertainty of 12 for ta 2686 651 μeq l and thus aquatic pco2 optical properties were analyzed in duplicates different readings suggested that coefficient of variation was below 2 2 5 statistical analyses kolmogorov smirnov and levene s test were used to test normality of data and homogeneity of variance respectively natural logarithm transformation was applied for data that did not obey a normal distribution analysis of variance anova with turkey hsd test was conducted to estimate significant spatiotemporal dynamics of dic species co2 flux optical properties and doc composition spearman s correlation coefficients were employed to explore the linkages between doc compositions and dic species principal component analysis pca was carried out to identify possible variable sources in the karst river system the parafac was conducted using matlab 2018a in domfluor toolbox 1 71 mathematical statistics were performed using originlab originpro 2021 matlab 2018a and spss statistical package 19 0 all the figures were prepared using matlab 2018a and originlab originpro 2021 3

example carbonate dissolution consumed dissolved co2 and generated co3 2 resulting in notable high co3 2 but low dissolved co2 levels in aug fig 2 aqueous co3 2 was supposed to be rapidly transformed into hco3 in the caco2 co2 h2o system caco3 co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 liu et al 2004 it was partially consistent with the observations except for the unexpected low hco3 levels fig 2 implying a potential driver for hco3 consumption in fact photosynthetic uptake was the most probable explanation for consumed hco3 ca2 2hco3 caco3 ch2o o2 causing counteracted primary production and co2 production in karst waters lerman and mackenzie 2005 this was supported by significant carbohydrate production consumption from photosynthesis respiration in the adjacent karst waters ni et al 2022 therefore combined actions of carbonate dissolution with photosynthetic uptake could explain variability of dic species in the karst river system fig 2 which was understandably accelerated by elevated temperature t 28 8 3 34 c table 1 however high levels of dissolved co2 were driven by in stream respiration in consideration of abnormally high doc concentrations in dec fig 2 and table 2 this counteracted and even masked photosynthetic process leading to hco3 accumulation in the river system goldman et al 2017 the river sx was characterized by agricultural practices based on in situ observations and land use types fig 1 which showed remarkable low levels of dic and hco3 fig s1 indeed cropping systems trend to alter land water connectivity neutralizing inorganic carbon via soil derived organic acids solomon et al 2000 aquatic pco2 generally originates from terrestrial co2 input and in situ respiration of doc and is consumed by photosynthesis and carbonate dissolution wang et al 2017 riverine pco2 averaged 620 3 1028 7 μatm across samples fig 3 which was lower than previous global estimates 3100 μatm on average raymond et al 2013 studies indicated that specific carbonate process primarily sequestrated co2 and cause its low magnitude in karst waters pu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in addition to carbonate dissolution photosynthesis respiration interactions hydrology rainfall and runoff also triggered dilution effect and led to temporal shifts of pco2 between aug post wet period and dec initial drought period fig 3 however rainfall induced terrestrial input was apparently masked and failed to increase the pco2 in august spatiotemporal trends of riverine f values were highly in agreement with pco2 and 35 samples showed f 0 whereas the others exhibited f 0 fig 3 this suggested that the karst river system could be both co2 sink and source with respect to the overlying atmosphere zhang et al 2017 using a surface water area of 31 8 km2 and an average f value of 154 3 772 6 mmol m2 d annual co2 flux was estimated to be 0 079 tg co2 y in the river system qijiang 4 2 drivers of doc compositional dynamics humic like dom was the primary doc compounds and occupied 39 0 75 2 of doc in the river system fig 4 this was in accordance with previously reported rivers and lakes in the upper yangtze wang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 as a recalcitrant fraction in natural environments humic like dom was accumulated in rivers via hydrologic and biochemical processes ni et al 2020a we thus observed autochthonous e g c1 in apr aug and mar and allochthonous e g c2 in aug and dec humic like compounds fig 5 limited rainfall weakened soil flushing whereas abundant doc storage stimulated biological process in dec initial drought period which respectively led to a low terrigenous signal fulvic acid like but a high biogenic signal soluble microbial byproduct like table 2 and fig 4 in aug high abundance of bioavailable fraction tyrosine like dom could be associated with prominent photosynthesis implying that increased primary production enhanced microbial activities and further accelerated biogenic metabolites hsieh et al 2021 prior observations also suggested that newly microbial derived doc tended to be preferentially utilized in situ mayorga et al 2005 ni et al 2020b human disturbance however might aggravate the unbalance of biological processes resulting in lower abundance of soluble microbial byproduct like dom under agricultural condition sx when compared to relatively natural condition sk and zd figs 1 and 4 low molecular weight doc was generally more labile and bioavailable hansen et al 2016 thus the higher sr and bix values were found in mar indicating in situ enriched micromolecular and endogenous doc table 2 and fig 5 particularly relatively high uri 5 suggested considerable abundance of protein like substances e g tryptophan like fluorophores her et al 2004 these evidenced biology as a primary role driving doc dynamics in the karst river system photosynthesis could be enhanced by carbonate dissolution and generated bioavailable carbohydrates promoting microbial metabolism and thus biogenic doc production tuchman et al 2006 bocaniov and smith 2009 ni et al 2022 meanwhile recently produced doc trended to be biodegraded and even remineralized into co2 ni and li 2020 2023 in this context we speculate that partial dissolved carbon will always undergo a rapid transformation between inorganic and organic phases under the biological pump effect in karst waters liu et al 2015 4 3 internal linkages between doc and dic carbonate dissolution and precipitation largely drove dic transformation in karst waters vesper et al 2016 for example precipitated co3 2 rose co2 levels and accumulated co2 triggered hco3 and dic concentrations increase this process was inherent and hence caused remarkable linkages between dic species fig 6 metabolism produced biological fractions and byproducts hajje and jaffé 2006 or alternatively consumed labile fractions and caused relative accumulation of refractory doc hu et al 2018 this explained linkages between doc composition fig 6 regarding inner linkages between dc carbonate dissolution provided dic for photosynthesis causing bioavailable substrates amino acids generated sojka et al 1967 pentecost 1992 therefore biological metabolites region ⅰ ⅱ and ⅳ could be positively or negatively correlated to dic species dic hco3 and co3 2 as reflected in apr and dec fig 6a and 6c depending on whether dic was continuously replenished elevated temperature facilitated metabolism e g biological utilization of dic photosynthesis and labile doc respiration butterwick et al 2005 this implied decreased dic species hco3 and dissolved co2 and relatively accumulated humic like dom c1 c2 and c3 in aug fig 6b the labile doc consumption region ⅰ ⅱ and c3 stimulated biological mineralization mao and li 2019 which produced co2 or pco2 and led to recalcitrant doc c1 and c2 accumulation in dec fig 6c however the linkages between doc and dic were decoupled in mar fig 6d principal components pcs in pca captured variable information and indicated their possible sources or processes fig 7 i in apr pc1 was corelated with dic hco3 pco2 ta region ⅱ and ⅳ indicating that photosynthetic dic species increased abundance of amino acids reiche and bard 1979 pc2 consisted of region ⅰ ⅲ ⅴ c1 c2 and doc linking to terrigenous doc inputs yang et al 2020 ii in aug pc1 was comprised of co3 2 co2 region ⅱ ⅳ ⅴ pco2 c4 and c5 which represented photosynthetic uptake of co2 and subsequent enhancement of metabolism parazoo et al 2018 pc2 referred to dic hco3 ta c1 and c3 which might suggest that high ph as a result of photosynthesis table 1 increased levels of hco3 formation and impeded humus dissolution jòzefaciuk et al 1996 stirling 2011 iii in dec pc1 was dominated by co3 2 region ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ ⅴ c1 c2 c3 and c4 which could originate from strong human inputs due to large and undifferentiated inputs of doc composition liu et al 2020 pc2 was typical of water chemistry and related to dic hco3 ta and pco2 iv pc1 exhibited strong loadings of co2 pco2 region ⅱ ⅲ and c2 which represented mutually masked autochthonous and allochthonous co2 inputs it might explain the decoupled doc dic fig 6d ni et al 2020b pc2 was linked to dic hco3 region ⅲ ⅳ c1 and c3 implying that metabolism enhanced refractory doc accumulation catalá et al 2015 4 4 implications for dc composition origin and fate natural dc is highly variable and interactive which contributes 90 flux of terrestrial carbon to aquatic ecosystems globally drake et al 2020 while current datasets have revealed doc and dic dynamics rosentreter and eyre 2020 he et al 2022 and their compositional transformation and inner linkages remain elusive karst waters are selected due to the notable inorganic organic carbon transformation mechanism and allochthonous inputs sun et al 2021 in the present study we acknowledged the determinant biological pump effect in karst waters liu et al 2015 which interpreted some specific observations in the river system for example photosynthetic uptake of dic altered synchronized variations between hco3 co3 2 and dissolved co2 resulting in carbon sequestration and low magnitude of co2 emissions figs 2 and 3 we found strong biogenic signals fig 4 but low doc concentrations 1 26 3 76 mg l on average except for anthropogenic doc in dec these apparently conflicting observations implied that rapid kinetics of the biological pump drove partial active dc constantly in the cycling young doc e g carbohydrates amino acids and metabolic byproducts is preferentially degraded and mineralized into co2 mayorga et al 2005 and the produced co2 will be reacted by carbonate dissolution and subsequent photosynthesis for young doc generation liu et al 2010 the cycling not only deciphered dc source and fate but also established its inner links for instance coupled hco3 co3 2 doc and co2 pco2 doc fig 6 suggested the dc transformations from photosynthesis and respiration respectively however irregular allochthonous terrigenous and anthropogenic inputs might mask and even decouple the linkages fig 6d and 7 in this context temporal variability of hydro meteorological conditions e g rainfall temperature and soil flushing also constrained internal dc couplings regier et al 2020 song et al 2021 this was consistent with our hypotheses and could be extended to most karst waters we thus highlighted that biology derived transformation between riverine dic and doc could largely explain aquatic carbon cycling however which was previously undervalued in karst regions specific functions of karst biology are merited in further works 5 conclusion natural dissolved carbon dc is ubiquitous and essentially contributes to global carbon cycling whereas its spatiotemporal dynamics and internal links have yet to be revealed this study demonstrates biotic and abiotic drivers of dc and the implications for composition origin and fate in a karst river system the general notion carbonate dissolution combined with photosynthetic uptake as a biological pump was applicable to explain temporal dynamics of dic species agricultural practices altered land water connectivity and thus caused spatial patterns of dic and hco3 levels carbon sequestration in the karst critical zone led to low magnitude of pco2 and hence limited co2 emissions in surface waters riverine doc was constrained by terrigenous and biogenic drivers and human disturbance aggravated the unbalance of endogenous inputs particularly biology could be regarded as a determinant for doc dynamics driving partial dc constantly in the cycling of inorganic organic phases biological metabolism established linkages between dic and doc composition which might be affected by temporal hydro meteorological conditions specific links and mutual transformations between karst dic and doc should be

15393,humus accumulation during sludge stabilization is attracting increasing attention because of its land use potential this study investigated the effects of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp on sludge humification and the related regulatory mechanisms during anaerobic digestion ad the sludge subjected to ad with thp at 160 c and 160 exhibited 7 3 and 8 5 higher total extractable carbon tec and humic acid carbon hac concentrations than the unpretreated sludge respectively while the sludge subjected to ad with thp at 180 c and 180 exhibited 1 4 and 7 0 lower concentrations humification of and 160 and and 180 were enhanced and inhibited respectively thp influenced sludge humification during ad through both intracellular polyphenol synthesis and extracellular humus condensation pathways related to polysaccharide metabolism the 160 c pretreated sludge exhibited higher polysaccharide availability more soluble polysaccharides and reducing sugars than the other samples and thus had more active intracellular polyphenol metabolism during ad the polyphenol accumulation stimulated the synthesis of related condensation enzymes polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductases facilitating extracellular ha production during ad however thp at 180 c resulted in the highest production of melanoidins with co c heterocycles through c o and ch sites of polysaccharides 778 46 vs 193 87 r u nm2 ml g for the unpretreated sample this heterocyclization decreased the polysaccharide availability and inhibited intracellular polyphenol synthesis consequently inhibiting condensation enzymes supply and extracellular ha production during ad overall this study highlights the crucial but neglected role of polysaccharides in sludge humification during ad the availability of polysaccharides affected by their occurrence state and molecular structure could determine the humification which can be regulated by thp at different temperature graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge thermal hydrolysis polysaccharide transformation anaerobic conversion humification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewage sludge a byproduct of wastewater treatment accumulates 50 of the carbon in sewage accounting for approximately 250 300 mg c g total solids dai 2020 it also contains various nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and is thus considered to have a high potential for land use tang et al 2022 in recent years the use of sludge stabilization products for soil improvement in woodlands and lawns and mine remediation has attracted increasing attention abreu junior et al 2017 wu et al 2021 the macromolecular humus in sludge stabilization products is the key substance responsible for soil improvement pollutant prevention nutrient provision heavy metals absorption and phytotoxicity reduction wan et al 2022 and is thus regarded as one of the most promising soil additives thus promoting humus accumulation in sludge during the stabilization process is vital for the effective land use of sludge anaerobic digestion ad is a typical sludge stabilization technology widely used for removing perishable organic matter to obtain methane rich biogas and enrich humus in digestate li et al 2021 thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp is the preferred method for strengthening the degradation of perishable organic matter and improving digestate availability barber 2016 thp has been conducted in a wide range of temperatures 50 220 c climent et al 2007 tang et al 2022 reported that organic matter in sludge leached out from cells or extracellular polymeric substances at temperatures exceeding 140 c and hydrolyzed into low molecular weight organic matter high temperatures 140 200 c have been identified in most studies and engineering cases as the preferred thp conditions for enhancing methane production during the ad of sludge chen et al 2019 xue et al 2015 methane production is only one of the aspects of resource recovery from sludge and digestate utilization is another key link however the effects of thp on the digestate characteristics after the ad of sludge particularly humus formation have not been sufficiently investigated during sludge biotransformation humus is mainly synthesized through the metabolism of microorganisms varadachari and ghosh 1984 the existence of a polyphenol protein theory has been widely accepted in this theory microorganisms intracellularly synthesize polyphenols by absorbing extracellular low molecular weight compounds and then secrete the polyphenols outside the cells through lysis the polyphenols and amino acids then undergo free radical condensation reactions over extracellular enzymes to form humus wu et al 2021 polyphenols are direct precursors to humus formation and numerous studies have attributed humus production to the polyphenol content of sludge fan et al 2017 zhou et al 2022 furthermore polysaccharide hydrolysis products reducing sugars are the key substrates for polyphenol synthesis and humus condensation varadachari and ghosh 1984 therefore to illustrate the mechanisms of the effect of high temperature thp on sludge humification during ad the conversion of polysaccharides and their derivatives should be investigated high temperature thp has several effects on polysaccharides xue et al 2015 showed that thp at 100 180 c increased polysaccharide dissolution in sludge by a factor of 4 7 12 5 wilson and novak found that during high temperature thp 130 220 c polysaccharides were significantly converted into mono or dimeric reducing sugars wilson and novak 2009 chen et al 2022 reported that during thp at 180 c polysaccharides underwent heterocyclization after dissolution and hydrolysis the maillard reaction is the most significant and common heterocyclization process it produces melanoidins which are macromolecular substances formed through the polymerization of polysaccharides and amino compounds li et al 2018 melanoidins have been mischaracterized as humus in previous studies owing to their comparable fluorescence intensity to humus huang et al 2021 however they lack of quinone group which makes them fundamentally different from humus the quinone group in humus can transfer electrons and adsorb organic matters and heavy metals through hydrophobic interaction and ligand exchange therefore characterizing the melanoidins in sludge subjected to high temperature thp is necessary to exclude their interference in humus determination high temperature thp results in both hydrolysis and heterocyclization which alters the physicochemical properties of polysaccharides the mechanism through which the alterations affect humification during the ad of sludge needs to be further explored considering the above issues the objectives of the present study are to 1 investigate the effects of thp on the occurrence state and molecular structure of polysaccharides in sludge 2 identify the changes in sludge humification during ad with high temperature thp and 3 explore the microbial regulation mechanism of sludge humification during ad with high temperature thp in terms of polysaccharide metabolism the results can elucidate thp driven humification in sludge during ad and guide the land applications of sludge stabilization products 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates

compounds the treated sludge was removed from the reactor when the temperature cooled below 100 c sludge without thp was labeled as rs 0 the characteristics of the inoculum rs 0 and rs 140 rs 200 are

influence of thp on the occurrence state of polysaccharides in sludge 3 1 1 solubilization and conversion of polysaccharides during thp clarifying the composition and structural characteristics of organic matters in sludge during thp is the basis for the exploration of humus formation during ad fig 1 a shows the dom in the sludge samples before and after thp after thp all pretreated samples exhibited considerably higher scod values than rs 0 1992 2 mg l and the increasing rate varied from 296 7 to 376 6 moreover the pretreated samples exhibited higher spss and spros than the raw sample rs 0 379 2 and 782 4 mg l respectively and the maximum of sps and spro were obtained in rs 160 which were 689 7 and 2990 4 mg l respectively this indicates that at high temperatures 140 200 c the polymeric particles of sludge were disrupted and hydrolyzed then they leached out and entered the liquid phase resulting in a considerable increase in the dom concentration consistent with the findings of our previous study xue et al 2015 the sps and spro concentrations increased with increasing thp temperature up to 160 c after which they considerably decreased so that rs 160 exhibited the highest sps and spro concentrations studies have reported that at higher temperatures sps and spro transform into melanoidins through the coupling condensation of carbonyl reducing sugars hydrolyzed

temperature of food waste increased from 130 c to 160 c the fmax value increased from 22 37 r u nm2 ml g to 155 79 r u nm2 ml g the maillard reaction is divided into initial intermediate and final stages helou et al 2014 the products of the initial and intermediate stages are the precursors of the final reaction coca et al 2004 and are the rate limiting substrates for final melanoidin production henning and glomb 2016 in this study the maillard reaction mostly remained in the initial or intermediate stage and only small quantities of melanoidin precursors were produced at 140 c and 160 c the significant transformation of polysaccharides and proteins into melanoidins via the maillard reaction started at 180 c moreover rs 200 exhibited a lower melanoidin concentration than rs 180 attributable to the carbonization of organic matter during thp at 200 c chen et al 2022 which was evidenced by the declined scod in rs 200 fig 1a therefore 160 c and 180 c can be regarded as the inflection points for the conversion of polysaccharides to spss and melanoidin respectively rs 160 and rs 180 were further investigated to clarify the mechanism through which the thp temperature influences the polysaccharide occurrence state the pyrolysis products of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 were classified into 24 categories according to the py gc ms results table 1 the products were subdivided into five major groups according to their possible sources nitrogenous organic derivatives n polysaccharide derivatives ps aromatic derivatives ar lignin derivatives lig and lipid derivatives lip the distributions of the products in rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 are shown in table 1 rs 180 exhibited significantly fewer ps products and more n products than both rs 0 and rs 160 that was certain ps products were absent in rs 180 and additional n products were present it can be deduced that at 180 c polysaccharides and proteins were significantly converted into melanoidins recognized as n products via the maillard reaction rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 were analyzed via principal component analysis pca fig 2 and the results detailed the differences among them five pyrolysis products py4 py12 py14 py20 py23 were identified and analyzed rs 0 exhibited a considerably higher concentration of py23 traced to lipid derivatives gómez et al 2018 than rs 160 and rs 180 fig 2 rs 0 contained a large amount of lipids which were significantly decomposed during thp at 160 c consistent with the disrupted and hydrolyzed polymeric particles of sludge in fig 1 py12 py14 and py20 were traced to polysaccharide and lipid derivatives py12 was furan like and possibly originated from polysaccharide depolymerization py14 was pyran like possibly from lignocellulosic decomposition and py20 was n alkanol like possibly from lipid decomposition pognani et al 2011 they are mostly abundant in rs 160 with similar and substantially less concentration in rs 0 and rs 180 it was clear that various types of organic matters in sludge underwent depolymerization at 160 c with further decomposition or synthesis into other substances at 180 c py4 was determined as a glycosylated protein derivative and was direct evidence of carbamide ammonia condensation yu et al 2021 rs 0 and rs 160 exhibited nearly the same py4 concentrations while rs 180 exhibited a significantly higher concentration confirming that the evident production of melanoidins started at 180 c therefore the mechanism of the influence of thp temperature on the occurrence state of polysaccharides in sludge is as follows at 160 c the polysaccharides and proteins in sludge were mainly hydrolyzed and decomposed while at 180 c certain decomposition products of proteins and polysaccharides reacted to form melanoidins recognized as n 3 1 2 changes in the molecular structure of polysaccharides during thp ftir 2d correlation spectroscopy enhances the spectral resolution by spreading the spectrum in a second dimension thereby facilitating the deconvolution of overlapping peaks although different molecular origins may exhibit features with similar spectral contributions in the static case such features may behave differently either delayed or accelerated in the dynamic case chen et al 2015 fig 3 a and b present synchronous and asynchronous 2d correlation maps generated from the 800 1800 cm 1 region of the ftir spectra of the pretreated sludge samples in the synchronous plots the cross peaks at 1650 1415 1252 and 981 cm 1 were positive this indicates that the corresponding groups amide i and or carbonyl and aldehyde associated with polysaccharides 1650 cm 1 nc h associated with proteins 1415 cm 1 co c associated with lipids and cellulose 1252 cm 1 and aromatic hydrocarbon 981 cm 1 exhibited conformational changes in the same direction tang et al 2020 according to the asynchronous map with increasing thp temperature from 100 to 180 c the functional groups varied in the following sequence 1182 1396 1080 981 1545 1650 1415 1250 1739 1706 cm 1 indicating that the organics transformed in the following order coh ch related to amino acids or polysaccharides coo related to amino acids or carboxylic acids c o related to polysaccharides aromatic hydrocarbons amide ii amide i nc h in protein co c in lipids and cellulose aromatic aldehydes and cyclic co c ye et al 2018 it was indicated that during thp organic matters in the sludge underwent successive structural changed as follows 1 the coh ch and coo groups of amino acids or polysaccharides were first exposed solubilized during thp 2 the protein structure unfolded and amide i and amide ii groups were gradually exposed 3 co c ester structure in lipids and co c ether structure in cellulose were successively exposed and 4 the exposed coh ch coo amide i and amide ii groups of polysaccharides and proteins further polymerized to form cc structures of unsaturated aromatics or heterocycles this clarified the changes in polysaccharide structure from chains to aromatics or heterocycles during high temperature thp the chemical speciation of organic elements in sludge was determined via xps the c peaks c1s c1sa c1sb c1sc were assigned to four bonds fig 4 1 ch from polysaccharides corresponding to the binding energy of 284 95 ev c1s 2 cc from lipids and amino acid side chains corresponding to the binding energy of

the binding energy of 288 07 ev c1sc the o peaks o1s o1sa o1sb were due to three bonds 1 co c from heterocyclic structures 530 95 ev 2 o c from carboxylic acid carboxylate and carbonyl 531 76 ev and 3 oc from carboxylic acid and hydroxide 532 59 ev the n peaks n1s n1sa and n1sb were due to n c and n o c in amid or amine 399 31 ev and 399 9 ev and nh in ammonia or protonated amine 402 10 ev li et al 2018 liao et al 2011 liu et al 2012 the binding energy assignments and quantitation of the main elements in the xps spectra of rs rs 160 and rs 180 are shown in table s2 rs 160 and rs 180 exhibited weakened intensities of c o n and c o which are associated with amides and acetals compared with rs 0 moreover co c associated with cyclic species exhibited the strongest intensity in rs 180 while c o exhibited the weakest intensity compared with rs 0 both rs 160 and rs 180 exhibited weaker peaks of n c and n o c associated with amides or amines and enhanced peaks of nh associated with ammonia or protonated amines from the above mentioned changes in the peaks of c o and n the main mechanism underlying the transformation of polysaccharides in sludge from long chain structures to unsaturated aromatic or heterocyclic structures during high temperature thp can be deduced ch and c o in polysaccharides or their derivatives combined with amino compounds containing n c n nh to form co c containing cyclic melanoidins consistent with the previous report on the possible pathway of melanoidin formation kroh 1994 3 2 effects of high temperature thp on the transformation and humification of organic matters in sludge during ad 3 2 1 effects of high temperature thp on the transformation of organic matters in sludge during ad fig 5 a shows the cumulative methane production versus digestion time for each group the pretreated groups exhibited significantly higher methane potential and methane production rate than the raw sludge p 0 05 rs 160 showed the best methanogenic performance its cumulative methane production reached 159 1 ml g tsadded 125 8 greater than that of the rs 0 sample the s 180 sample exhibited a cumulative methane production of 137 0 ml g tsadded which was slightly less than that of the s 160 and 94 5 greater than that of the s 0 sample the methanogenesis potential of the pretreated sludge are consistent with the results of previous studies chen et al 2018 xue et al 2015 fig 5b shows the changes in the organic matters contents of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 before and after ad as detected via py gc ms the n concentrations of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 subjected to ad and 0 and 160 and and 180 190 0 165 6 and 170 7 mg g tsadded respectively were significantly lower than those of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 213 2 225 9 and 268 7 mg g tsadded moreover the ps concentrations of and 0 and 160 and and 180 were lower than those of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 and the maximum decreasing rate was 55 2 for rs 160 it can be seen that rs 160 exhibited the optimal degradation of both n and ps compounds it was because that thp at 160 c promoted organic matter solubilization and hydrolysis meanwhile the maillard reaction did not reach the final stage and the difficult to degrade substances such as melanoidins were not substantially generated in rs 180 the increased n due to melanoidin production could be degraded in the subsequent ad but the ps degradation performance was considerably lower than that of rs 160 this indicated that during thp at 180 c after the heterocyclization between polysaccharides and amino compounds with melanoidin formation the amino related content was still usable by microorganisms during ad while the polysaccharide related contents that transformed from a chainlike structure to a cyclic structure were the resistant components they re dissociated to ps after the degradation of the amino related content in n during ad and were difficult to be used by microorganisms dwyer et al 2008 so that they remained in and 180 in addition the concentration of aromatic derivatives in and 160 30 3 mg g tsadded was significantly greater than those in and 0 24 0 mg g tsadded and and 180 24 1 mg g tsadded during ad the aromatization of the digestate is often correlated with the humification degree li et al 2017 higher aromaticity may reflect stronger humification bartoszek et al 2008 which suggests a significant change in sludge humification during ad with high temperature thp which is analyzed in depth below 3 2 2 effects of high temperature thp on sludge humification during ad the distribution of humus in sludge samples before and after ad was further investigated fig 6 the hac concentration of sludge subjected to high temperature thp was lower than that of the unpretreated sludge while the content of fac concentration was higher indicating that some ha was decomposed into fa during high temperature thp after ad the sludge subjected to high temperature thp exhibited a higher tec content than the unpretreated sludge and 160 exhibited the highest average tec content 286 9 mg g vsadded which was 7 3 greater than that of and 0 267 4 mg g vsadded the average tec content 263 6 mg g vsadded of and 180 was 1 4 less than that of and 0 the 160 c intensified sludge humification during ad while 180 c had a lesser or even a negative effect on sludge humification the hac concentrations of and 160 224 5 mg g vsadded and and 180 192 3 mg g vsadded were 1 1 and 0 9 times that of and 0 206 9 mg g vsadded respectively and 180 exhibited the highest fac concentration 71 2 mg g vsadded comparable to those of and 160 62 4 mg g vsadde and and 0 60 5 mg g vsadded fa is easily soluble in water and has a low aromatic polymerization degree thus it can be further polymerized into the more complex structure of ha bartoszek et al 2008 therefore it can be tentatively assumed that and 160 exhibited the optimal humification the higher fa concentration and lower ha concentration of and 180 than those of and 160 indicated the inhibition of fa conversion into ha in and 180 eem spectra are usually divided into five regions corresponding to five types of fluorophore tyrosine like region i tryptophan like region ii fa like region iii soluble microbial product like region iv and ha and melanoidin like region v liu et al 2018 as can be seen from fig 7 in rs 0 the fluorescence peaks mainly occurred in regions i ii and iv indicating that the dom was mainly composed of protein like substances and microbial metabolites fig 7a thp resulted in the inactivation of microorganisms in the sludge and the leaching out of intracellular substances thus the spectra of the pretreated samples featured considerably higher peak intensities for region iv soluble microbial product like and region ii tryptophan like than did the rs 0 spectrum fig 7b with increasing temperature the humus dissolved and melanoidins were produced and the fluorescence intensities of regions iii fa like and v ha and melanoidin like increased fig 7b 7c and 0 exhibited higher ha and melanoidin like fluorophore region v intensities than rs 0 while and 160 and and 180 exhibited lower intensities than rs 160 and rs 180 during ad the melanoidin produced during thp could dissociate into ps owing to the degradation of the amino related fraction so that the fluorescence intensities of the and 160 and and 180 spectra diminished moreover among the samples subjected to ad and 180 exhibited the highest fluorescence intensities of fa like region iii fig 7f this is consistent with the results in section 3 2 1 that the further polymerization of fa into ha in rs 180 was hindered so that fa increasingly accumulated in and 180 it was also found that and 180 exhibited the highest fluorescence intensities of soluble microbial product like region iv and ha and melanoidin like region v fluorophores among the samples subjected to ad as the hac content of and 180 was the lowest among the samples subjected to ad the highest fluorescence intensities of region v of and 180 was more likely due to the highest content of melanoidin like materials instead of ha like materials thus the findings can be further explained as follows 1 the melanoidins in rs 180 were not sufficiently degraded during ad and 2 the large amounts of melanoidins in rs 180 could compete with other organics for reaction sites inhibiting the adequate degradation of fragmented cells and metabolites mauron 1990 yu et al 2021 zang and hatcher 2002 moreover the melanoidin like materials have been often mischaracterized as ha like materials in previous studies based on the results of 3d eem huang et al 2021 concluded that the macromolecule released in large quantities from sludge after high temperature thp was ha region v and reached a maximum at 180 c while in their investigation the melanoidin like materials were not investigated and might interrupt the results in this study the contents of melanoid and humus were analyzed separately in order to supplement the results of eem spectra this avoided the misjudgment of region v as only ha like materials after high temperature thp a dom van krevelen diagram was created to visualize the compound distribution in dom fig s1 antony et al 2014 and 160 and and 180 exhibited significantly lower dom concentrations of labile organic matters e g lipid like and protein like than and 0 and significantly higher humus concentration this indicated that the degradation of organic matters in sludge increased after thp and the humus proportion in dom increased which were consistent with the results mentioned above the aromaticity index ai was used to reflect the c c density in a molecule which can be calculated from the exact molecular masses of single dom compounds gu et al 2022 the ai is used to distinguish between non aromatic compounds ai 0 5 aromatic compounds 0 5 ai 0 67 and condensed aromatic hydrocarbons ai 0 67 koch and dittmar 2016 compared with and 0 the results showed that and 160 and and 180 exhibited 15 9 and 20 9 lower abundance of dom compounds with ai 0 5 respectively fig 8 further demonstrating that thp promoted the aromatization of organic matter in sludge during ad and 160 exhibited the highest abundance of condensed aromatic hydrocarbons ai 0 67 in the dom 18 7 indicating the highest degree of humus condensation this confirms that and 160 exhibited the optimal humification in addition and 180 exhibited a higher abundance of dom compounds with ai of 0 5 0 67 37 9 than and 0 and and 160 this indicated that the dom of and 180 contained a large amount of simple aromatic compounds rather than condensed aromatic hydrocarbons verifying that the further polymerization of fa to ha in sludge during ad was hindered during thp at 180 c resulting in fa accumulation in the digestate 3 3 effects of high temperature thp on the metabolisms involved in ha formation in sludge during ad 3 3 1 effects on intracellular polyphenol biosynthesis ha formation requires several functional metabolic genes and enzymes in this study metagenomic sequencing analyses were performed based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg function annotation a possible ha formation process is shown in fig 9 a varadachari and ghosh 1984 this study focused on the genes of intracellular rate limiting enzymes involved in ha formation through association with the shikimate and phenylalanine pathways according to the polyphenol protein theory fig 9b illustrates the specific metabolic pathway for the conversion of polysaccharide derivatives into polyphenolic compounds six intracellular metabolism modules have been reported to be involved in intracellular polyphenol biosynthesis cheng and breen 1991 wu et al 2021 glycolysis the embden meyerhof pathway m00001 the pentose phosphate pathway the pentose phosphate cycle m00004 the shikimate pathway m00022 phenylalanine biosynthesis m00024 monolignol biosynthesis m00039 and flavonoid biosynthesis m00138 the relative abundance ra of genes assigned to the enzymes involved was examined and 160 and and 180 respectively showed trends of gene upregulation and downregulation compared with and 0 the ra distribution of the genes assigned to enzymes not shown in fig 9b is presented in table s3 the ra of genes assigned to most enzymes did not fluctuate significantly in and 0 and 160 and and 180 p 0 01 because the changes in the ra of genes associated with phenylalanine conversion into polyphenols were not significant phenylalanine synthesis would directly affect polyphenol accumulation for the conversion of d glucose into phenylalanine changes in the ra of genes assigned to enzymes associated with m00001 m00004 m00022 and m00024 suggest that phenylalanine synthesis was promoted in and 160 and inhibited in and 180 therefore high temperature thp may alter intracellular polyphenol biosynthesis by affecting the production of intermediates such as 2 dehydro 3 deoxy d arabino heptonate 7 phosphate and phenylalanine cui et al 2012 yun et al 2015 the initial substrates for the synthesis of these intermediates were polysaccharide derivatives absorbed from extracellular sources in rs 160 the polysaccharides were solubilized and hydrolyzed into small molecules that were more easily transferred into the cell by microorganisms while in rs 180 the polysaccharides were hydrolyzed and then heterocyclized to form melanoidins that were difficult to be utilized m00001 and m00004 belong to glycolysis gluconeogenesis ko00010 m00022 and m00024 belong to phenylalanine and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis ko00400 m00039 and m00138 belong to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ko00940 fig 10 a shows the shifted ra of genes assigned to these three pathways among the three metabolic pathways associated with intracellular polyphenol synthesis glycolysis gluconeogenesis ko00010 was the most active accounting for 14 92 16 93 followed by aromatic amino acid biosynthesis ko00400 5 8 6 6 and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ko00940 1 7 1 9 compared with the and 0 group and 160 and and 180 respectively exhibited upregulation and downregulation of the ra of genes assigned to all three pathways which further explains the results of intensified and reduced sludge humification during ad with thp at 160 and 180 c respectively 3 3 2 effects on the condensation of extracellular humus the intracellularly synthesized polyphenols and enzymes were excreted extracellularly polyphenols quinones and amino acids were extracellularly condensed by polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductase to form humus building blocks the humus building blocks would condense into fa and ha under the action of enzymes fig 9a varadachari and ghosh 1984 there is no significant difference between ha and fa in terms of the building blocks the main difference is that ha has a greater degree of polymerization which tends to make it less soluble than fa chin et al 1994 therefore the condensation degree of humus derived from the extracellular conversion of polyphenols was highly dependent on the enzymes involved in the condensation reaction furthermore the ras of genes assigned to polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductases in sludge samples subjected to ad were compared fig 10b the ra of genes assigned to polyphenol oxidase increased by 5 3 in and 160 18 2 and decreased by 4 6 in and 180 16 5 compared with and 0 17 3 for the four quinone oxidoreductases the ras of the assigned genes increased by 19 1 in and 160 4 1 and decreased by 25 1 in and 180 2 6 compared with and 0 3 5 this trend substantiates the higher polymerization degree in and 160 than in both and 0 and and 180 consistent with the changes in the distributions of the ha content fig 6 and the ai value fig 8 in summary the effects of high temperature thp on the metabolism involved in ha formation during ad were reflected in both intracellular polyphenol synthesis and extracellular humus condensation and 160 exhibited greater polysaccharide availability than the other samples and thus more active intracellular polyphenol metabolism of microorganisms polyphenol accumulation stimulated the synthesis of related condensation enzymes polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductases which eventually promoted extracellular ha production in contrast polysaccharide heterocyclization in the and 180 group inhibited intracellular polyphenol synthesis generating negative feedback which impeded the supply of condensation enzymes and further increased the difficulty of humus condensation 3 4 the effect of high temperature thp on sludge humification during ad mechanism based on polysaccharide metabolism fig 11 summarizes the polysaccharide metabolism based mechanism through which high temperature thp affects sludge humification during ad first the polysaccharides in sludge were dissolved and hydrolyzed into reducing sugars e g glucose during high temperature thp and the highest sps concentration was obtained at 160 c with increasing thp temperature up to 180 c the c o and ch sites of reducing sugars underwent the maillard reaction with amino compounds to produce heterocyclic melanoidins containing co c the solubilization and hydrolysis of polysaccharides during thp at 160 c facilitated their entrance into microbial cells thereby increasing polysaccharide availability rs 160 in contrast the heterocyclization of polysaccharides subjected to thp at 180 c inhibited their uptake by microbial cells reducing polysaccharide availability rs 180 the upgrade and downgrade of polysaccharide availability increased and reduced the ra of genes associated with intracellular polyphenol synthesis during ad respectively enhancing and inhibiting glycolysis ko00010 phenylalanine biosynthesis ko00400 and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ko00940 consequently the intracellular polyphenol biosynthesis process was inhibited in and 180 and facilitated in and 160 as polyphenols were substrates for extracellular humus condensation reaction the upregulation and downregulation of the intracellular synthesis of polyphenols increased and 160 and reduced and 180 the ra of genes attributed to condensation polyphenol oxidase quinone oxidoreductase thus ha was intensively enriched in and 160 and fa was accumulated in and 180 the mechanism highlighted the crucial but neglected role of polysaccharides in the humification of sludge during ad namely the bio accessibility of polysaccharides influenced by thp in terms of their occurrence state and molecular structure could determine the humification of sludge during ad which can be regulated by thp at different temperature future studies on the effects of other pretreatments on polysaccharide metabolism and humus production during ad of sludge maybe also important for the humus investigation 4 conclusion this study investigated the regulatory mechanisms of humification in sludge during ad by high temperature thp based on polysaccharide metabolism the main findings are as follows 1 the sludge with thp under 160 c and 160 showed a significant up regulation in total humus and total ha contents after ad compared to that without thp while and 180 showed a significant down regulation namely appropriate thp temperature would promote the humification during ad while the too high temperature would inhibit it 2 thp affected humification of sludge during ad through both intracellular polyphenol synthesis and extracellular humus condensation pathways related to polysaccharides metabolism determined by the bio accessibility of polysaccharides 3 after thp under 160 c the availability of polysaccharides in sludge was increased the highest soluble polysaccharides and reducing sugars and the intracellular polyphenol metabolism of the microorganisms was thus more active during ad the accumulation of polyphenols stimulated the synthesis of related extracellular condensation enzymes polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductases eventually leading to the promotion of extracellular ha production during ad 4 while after thp under 180 c the availability of polysaccharides in sludge was decreased due to heterocyclization the highest production of melanoidin with co c heterocycles from 193 87 r u nm2 ml g without thp to 778 46 r u nm2 ml g through c o ch sites of sps and amino acids this led to inhibition of intracellular polyphenol synthesis generating negative feedback of blocked supply of condensing enzymes and further deepening the difficulty of extracellular humus formation and condensation during ad this study expands the theoretical research of anaerobic humification in sludge and provides a data basis and mechanism support for the process design of ad based sludge

15393,humus accumulation during sludge stabilization is attracting increasing attention because of its land use potential this study investigated the effects of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp on sludge humification and the related regulatory mechanisms during anaerobic digestion ad the sludge subjected to ad with thp at 160 c and 160 exhibited 7 3 and 8 5 higher total extractable carbon tec and humic acid carbon hac concentrations than the unpretreated sludge respectively while the sludge subjected to ad with thp at 180 c and 180 exhibited 1 4 and 7 0 lower concentrations humification of and 160 and and 180 were enhanced and inhibited respectively thp influenced sludge humification during ad through both intracellular polyphenol synthesis and extracellular humus condensation pathways related to polysaccharide metabolism the 160 c pretreated sludge exhibited higher polysaccharide availability more soluble polysaccharides and reducing sugars than the other samples and thus had more active intracellular polyphenol metabolism during ad the polyphenol accumulation stimulated the synthesis of related condensation enzymes polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductases facilitating extracellular ha production during ad however thp at 180 c resulted in the highest production of melanoidins with co c heterocycles through c o and ch sites of polysaccharides 778 46 vs 193 87 r u nm2 ml g for the unpretreated sample this heterocyclization decreased the polysaccharide availability and inhibited intracellular polyphenol synthesis consequently inhibiting condensation enzymes supply and extracellular ha production during ad overall this study highlights the crucial but neglected role of polysaccharides in sludge humification during ad the availability of polysaccharides affected by their occurrence state and molecular structure could determine the humification which can be regulated by thp at different temperature graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge thermal hydrolysis polysaccharide transformation anaerobic conversion humification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewage sludge a byproduct of wastewater treatment accumulates 50 of the carbon in sewage accounting for approximately 250 300 mg c g total solids dai 2020 it also contains various nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and is thus considered to have a high potential for land use tang et al 2022 in recent years the use of sludge stabilization products for soil improvement in woodlands and lawns and mine remediation has attracted increasing attention abreu junior et al 2017 wu et al 2021 the macromolecular humus in sludge stabilization products is the key substance responsible for soil improvement pollutant prevention nutrient provision heavy metals absorption and phytotoxicity reduction wan et al 2022 and is thus regarded as one of the most promising soil additives thus promoting humus accumulation in sludge during the stabilization process is vital for the effective land use of sludge anaerobic digestion ad is a typical sludge stabilization technology widely used for removing perishable organic matter to obtain methane rich biogas and enrich humus in digestate li et al 2021 thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp is the preferred method for strengthening the degradation of perishable organic matter and improving digestate availability barber 2016 thp has been conducted in a wide range of temperatures 50 220 c climent et al 2007 tang et al 2022 reported that organic matter in sludge leached out from cells or extracellular polymeric substances at temperatures exceeding 140 c and hydrolyzed into low molecular weight organic matter high temperatures 140 200 c have been identified in most studies and engineering cases as the preferred thp conditions for enhancing methane production during the ad of sludge chen et al 2019 xue et al 2015 methane production is only one of the aspects of resource recovery from sludge and digestate utilization is another key link however the effects of thp on the digestate characteristics after the ad of sludge particularly humus formation have not been sufficiently investigated during sludge biotransformation humus is mainly synthesized through the metabolism of microorganisms varadachari and ghosh 1984 the existence of a polyphenol protein theory has been widely accepted in this theory microorganisms intracellularly synthesize polyphenols by absorbing extracellular low molecular weight compounds and then secrete the polyphenols outside the cells through lysis the polyphenols and amino acids then undergo free radical condensation reactions over extracellular enzymes to form humus wu et al 2021 polyphenols are direct precursors to humus formation and numerous studies have attributed humus production to the polyphenol content of sludge fan et al 2017 zhou et al 2022 furthermore polysaccharide hydrolysis products reducing sugars are the key substrates for polyphenol synthesis and humus condensation varadachari and ghosh 1984 therefore to illustrate the mechanisms of the effect of high temperature thp on sludge humification during ad the conversion of polysaccharides and their derivatives should be investigated high temperature thp has several effects on polysaccharides xue et al 2015 showed that thp at 100 180 c increased polysaccharide dissolution in sludge by a factor of 4 7 12 5 wilson and novak found that during high temperature thp 130 220 c polysaccharides were significantly converted into mono or dimeric reducing sugars wilson and novak 2009 chen et al 2022 reported that during thp at 180 c polysaccharides underwent heterocyclization after dissolution and hydrolysis the maillard reaction is the most significant and common heterocyclization process it produces melanoidins which are macromolecular substances formed through the polymerization of polysaccharides and amino compounds li et al 2018 melanoidins have been mischaracterized as humus in previous studies owing to their comparable fluorescence intensity to humus huang et al 2021 however they lack of quinone group which makes them fundamentally different from humus the quinone group in humus can transfer electrons and adsorb organic matters and heavy metals through hydrophobic interaction and ligand exchange therefore characterizing the melanoidins in sludge subjected to high temperature thp is necessary to exclude their interference in humus determination high temperature thp results in both hydrolysis and heterocyclization which alters the physicochemical properties of polysaccharides the mechanism through which the alterations affect humification during the ad of sludge needs to be further explored considering the above issues the objectives of the present study are to 1 investigate the effects of thp on the occurrence state and molecular structure of polysaccharides in sludge 2

influence of thp on the occurrence state of polysaccharides in sludge 3 1 1 solubilization and conversion of polysaccharides during thp clarifying the composition and structural characteristics of organic matters in sludge during thp is the basis for the exploration of humus formation during ad fig 1 a shows the dom in the sludge samples before and after thp after thp all pretreated samples exhibited considerably higher scod values than rs 0 1992 2 mg l and the increasing rate varied from 296 7 to 376 6 moreover the pretreated samples exhibited higher spss and spros than the raw sample rs 0 379 2 and 782 4 mg l respectively and the maximum of sps and spro were obtained in rs 160 which were 689 7 and 2990 4 mg l respectively this indicates that at high temperatures 140 200 c the polymeric particles of sludge were disrupted and hydrolyzed then they leached out and entered the liquid phase resulting in a considerable increase in the dom concentration consistent with the findings of our previous study xue et al 2015 the sps and spro concentrations increased with increasing thp temperature up to 160 c after which they considerably decreased so that rs 160 exhibited the highest sps and spro concentrations studies have reported that at higher temperatures sps and spro transform into melanoidins through the coupling condensation of carbonyl reducing sugars hydrolyzed from polysaccharides and amino compounds e g proteins amino acids peptides amines echavarría et al 2012 li et al 2017 in the current study melanoidins in the raw and pretreated sludge samples were semi quantified via parafac four independent fluorescent components were evaluated using the core consistency diagnostic corcondia procedure fig 1b component 2 was identified as melanoidin stedmon and bro 2008 and its concentration was analyzed according to its maximum fluorescence intensity fmax fig 1a compared with rs 0 the fmax values of rs 140 and rs 160 exhibited increasing rates less than 37 0 while that of rs 180 and rs 200 obtained significant increasing rates more than 255 6 a similar trend was observed in the study by liu et al 2018 they found that as the hydrothermal treatment temperature of food waste increased from 130 c to 160 c the fmax value increased from 22 37 r u nm2 ml g to 155 79 r u nm2 ml g the maillard reaction is divided into initial intermediate and final stages helou et al 2014 the products of the initial and intermediate stages are the precursors of the final reaction coca et al 2004 and are the rate limiting substrates for final melanoidin production henning and glomb 2016 in this study the maillard reaction mostly remained in the initial or intermediate stage and only small quantities of melanoidin precursors were produced at 140 c and 160 c the significant transformation of polysaccharides and proteins into melanoidins via the maillard reaction started at 180 c moreover rs 200 exhibited a lower melanoidin concentration than rs 180 attributable to the carbonization of organic matter during thp at 200 c chen et al 2022 which was evidenced by the declined scod in rs 200 fig 1a therefore 160 c and 180 c can be regarded as the inflection points for the conversion of polysaccharides to spss and melanoidin respectively rs 160 and rs 180 were further investigated to clarify the mechanism through which the thp temperature influences the polysaccharide occurrence state the pyrolysis products of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 were classified into 24 categories according to the py gc ms results table 1 the products were subdivided into five major groups according to their possible sources nitrogenous organic derivatives n polysaccharide derivatives ps aromatic derivatives ar lignin derivatives lig and lipid derivatives lip the distributions of the products in rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 are shown in table 1 rs 180 exhibited significantly fewer ps products and more n products than both rs 0 and rs 160 that was certain ps products were absent in rs 180 and additional n products were present it can be deduced that at 180 c polysaccharides and proteins were significantly converted into melanoidins recognized as n products via the maillard reaction rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 were analyzed via principal component analysis pca fig 2 and the results detailed the differences among them five pyrolysis products py4 py12 py14 py20 py23 were identified and analyzed rs 0 exhibited a considerably higher concentration of py23 traced to lipid derivatives gómez et al 2018 than rs 160 and rs 180 fig 2 rs 0 contained a large amount of lipids which were significantly decomposed during thp at 160 c consistent with the disrupted and hydrolyzed polymeric particles of sludge in fig 1 py12 py14 and py20 were traced to polysaccharide and lipid derivatives py12 was furan like and possibly originated from polysaccharide depolymerization py14 was pyran like possibly from lignocellulosic decomposition and py20 was n alkanol like possibly from lipid decomposition pognani et al 2011 they are mostly abundant in rs 160 with similar and substantially less concentration in rs 0 and rs 180 it was clear that various types of organic matters in sludge underwent depolymerization at 160 c with further decomposition or synthesis into other substances at 180 c py4 was determined as a glycosylated protein derivative and was direct evidence of carbamide ammonia condensation yu et al 2021 rs 0 and rs 160 exhibited nearly the same py4 concentrations while rs 180 exhibited a significantly higher concentration confirming that the evident production of melanoidins started at 180 c therefore the mechanism of the influence of thp temperature on the occurrence state of polysaccharides in sludge is as follows at 160 c the polysaccharides and proteins in sludge were mainly hydrolyzed and decomposed while at 180 c certain decomposition products of proteins and polysaccharides reacted to form melanoidins recognized as n 3 1 2 changes in the molecular structure of polysaccharides during thp ftir 2d correlation spectroscopy enhances the spectral resolution by spreading the spectrum in a second dimension thereby facilitating the deconvolution of overlapping peaks although different molecular origins may exhibit features with similar spectral contributions in the static case such features may behave differently either delayed or accelerated in the dynamic case chen et al 2015 fig 3 a and b present synchronous and asynchronous 2d correlation maps generated from the 800 1800 cm 1 region of the ftir spectra of the pretreated sludge samples in the synchronous plots the cross peaks at 1650 1415 1252 and 981 cm 1 were positive this indicates that the corresponding groups amide i and or carbonyl and aldehyde associated with polysaccharides 1650 cm 1 nc h associated with proteins 1415 cm 1 co c associated with lipids and cellulose 1252 cm 1 and aromatic hydrocarbon 981 cm 1 exhibited conformational changes in the same direction tang et al 2020 according to the asynchronous map with increasing thp temperature from 100 to 180 c the functional groups varied in the following sequence 1182 1396 1080 981 1545 1650 1415 1250 1739 1706 cm 1 indicating that the organics transformed in the following order coh ch related to amino acids or polysaccharides coo related to amino acids or carboxylic acids c o related to polysaccharides aromatic hydrocarbons amide ii amide i nc h in protein co c in lipids and cellulose aromatic aldehydes and cyclic co c ye et al 2018 it was indicated that during thp organic matters in the sludge underwent successive structural changed as follows 1 the coh ch and coo groups of amino acids or polysaccharides were first exposed solubilized during thp 2 the protein structure unfolded and amide i and amide ii groups were gradually exposed 3 co c ester structure in lipids and co c ether structure in cellulose were successively exposed and 4 the exposed coh ch coo amide i and amide ii groups of polysaccharides and proteins further polymerized to form cc structures of unsaturated aromatics or heterocycles this clarified the changes in polysaccharide structure from chains to aromatics or heterocycles during high temperature thp the chemical speciation of organic elements in sludge was determined via xps the c peaks c1s c1sa c1sb c1sc were assigned to four bonds fig 4 1 ch from polysaccharides corresponding to the binding energy of 284 95 ev c1s 2 cc from lipids and amino acid side chains corresponding to the binding energy of 284 81 ev c1sa 3 c o n including ether alcohol amine and amide corresponding to the binding energy of 286 05 ev c1sb and 4 c o and oc o from carbonyl carboxylate acetal or hemiacetal corresponding to the binding energy of 288 07 ev c1sc the o peaks o1s o1sa o1sb were due to three bonds 1 co c from heterocyclic structures 530 95 ev 2 o c from carboxylic acid carboxylate and carbonyl 531 76 ev and 3 oc from carboxylic acid and hydroxide 532 59 ev the n peaks n1s n1sa and n1sb were due to n c and n o c in amid or amine 399 31 ev and 399 9 ev and nh in ammonia or protonated amine 402 10 ev li et al 2018 liao et al 2011 liu et al 2012 the binding energy assignments and quantitation of the main elements in the xps spectra of rs rs 160 and rs 180 are shown in table s2 rs 160 and rs 180 exhibited weakened intensities of c o n and c o which are associated with amides and acetals compared with rs 0 moreover co c associated with cyclic species exhibited the strongest intensity in rs 180 while c o exhibited the weakest intensity compared with rs 0 both rs 160 and rs 180 exhibited weaker peaks of n c and n o c associated with amides or amines and enhanced peaks of nh associated with ammonia or protonated amines from the above mentioned changes in the peaks of c o and n the main mechanism underlying the transformation of polysaccharides in sludge from long chain structures to unsaturated aromatic or heterocyclic structures during high temperature thp can be deduced ch and c o in polysaccharides or their derivatives combined with amino compounds containing n c n nh to form co c containing cyclic melanoidins consistent with the previous report on the possible pathway of melanoidin formation kroh 1994 3 2 effects of high temperature thp on the transformation and humification of organic matters in sludge during ad 3 2 1 effects of high temperature thp on the transformation of organic matters in sludge during ad fig 5 a shows the cumulative methane production versus digestion time for each group the pretreated groups exhibited significantly higher methane potential and methane production rate than the raw sludge p 0 05 rs 160 showed the best methanogenic performance its cumulative methane production reached 159 1 ml g tsadded 125 8 greater than that of the rs 0 sample the s 180 sample exhibited a cumulative methane production of 137 0 ml g tsadded which was slightly less than that of the s 160 and 94 5 greater than that of the s 0 sample the methanogenesis potential of the pretreated sludge are consistent with the results of previous studies chen et al 2018 xue et al 2015 fig 5b shows the changes in the organic matters contents of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 before and after ad as detected via py gc ms the n concentrations of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 subjected to ad and 0 and 160 and and 180 190 0 165 6 and 170 7 mg g tsadded respectively were significantly lower than those of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 213 2 225 9 and 268 7 mg g tsadded moreover the ps concentrations of and 0 and 160 and and 180 were lower than those of rs 0 rs 160 and rs 180 and the maximum decreasing rate was 55 2 for rs 160 it can be seen that rs 160 exhibited the optimal degradation of both n and ps compounds it was because that thp at 160 c promoted organic matter solubilization and hydrolysis meanwhile the maillard reaction did not reach the final stage and the difficult to degrade substances such as melanoidins were not substantially generated in rs 180 the increased n due to melanoidin production could be degraded in the subsequent ad but the ps degradation performance was considerably lower than that of rs 160 this indicated that during thp at 180 c after the heterocyclization between polysaccharides and amino compounds with melanoidin formation the amino related content was still usable by microorganisms during ad while the polysaccharide related contents that transformed from a chainlike structure to a cyclic structure were the resistant components they re dissociated to ps after the degradation of the amino related content in n during ad and were difficult to be used by microorganisms dwyer et al 2008 so that they remained in and 180 in addition the concentration of aromatic derivatives in and 160 30 3 mg g tsadded was significantly greater than those in and 0 24 0 mg g tsadded and and 180 24 1 mg g tsadded during ad the aromatization of the digestate is often correlated with the humification degree li et al 2017 higher aromaticity may reflect stronger humification bartoszek et al 2008 which suggests a significant change in sludge humification during ad with high temperature thp which is analyzed in depth below 3 2 2 effects of high temperature thp on sludge humification during ad the distribution of humus in sludge samples before and after ad was further investigated fig 6 the hac concentration of sludge subjected to high temperature thp was lower than that of the unpretreated sludge while the content of fac concentration was higher indicating that some ha was decomposed into fa during high temperature thp after ad the sludge subjected to high temperature thp exhibited a higher tec content than the unpretreated sludge and 160 exhibited the highest average tec content 286 9 mg g vsadded which was 7 3 greater than that of and 0 267 4 mg g vsadded the average tec content 263 6 mg g vsadded of and 180 was 1 4 less than that of and 0 the 160 c intensified sludge humification during ad while 180 c had a lesser or even a negative effect on sludge humification the hac concentrations of and 160 224 5 mg g vsadded and and 180 192 3 mg g vsadded were 1 1 and 0 9 times that of and 0 206 9 mg g vsadded respectively and 180 exhibited the highest fac concentration 71 2 mg g vsadded comparable to those of and 160 62 4 mg g vsadde and and 0 60 5 mg g vsadded fa is easily soluble in water and has a low aromatic polymerization degree thus it can be further polymerized into the more complex structure of ha bartoszek et al 2008 therefore it can be tentatively assumed that and 160 exhibited the optimal humification the higher fa concentration and lower ha concentration of and 180 than those of and 160 indicated the inhibition of fa conversion into ha in and 180 eem spectra are usually divided into five regions corresponding to five types of fluorophore tyrosine like region i tryptophan like region ii fa like region iii soluble microbial product like region iv and ha and melanoidin like region v liu et al 2018 as can be seen from fig 7 in rs 0 the fluorescence peaks mainly occurred in regions i ii and iv indicating that the dom was mainly composed of protein like substances and microbial metabolites fig 7a thp resulted in the inactivation of microorganisms in the sludge and the leaching out of intracellular substances thus the spectra of the pretreated samples featured considerably higher peak intensities for region iv soluble microbial product like and region ii tryptophan like than did the rs 0 spectrum fig 7b with increasing temperature the humus dissolved and melanoidins were produced and the fluorescence intensities of regions iii fa like and v ha and melanoidin like increased fig 7b 7c and 0 exhibited higher ha and melanoidin like fluorophore region v intensities than rs 0 while and 160 and and 180 exhibited lower intensities than rs 160 and rs 180 during ad the melanoidin produced during thp could dissociate into ps owing to the degradation of the amino related fraction so that the fluorescence intensities of the and 160 and and 180 spectra diminished moreover among the samples subjected to ad and 180 exhibited the highest fluorescence intensities of fa like region iii fig 7f this is consistent with the results in section 3 2 1 that the further polymerization of fa into ha in rs 180 was hindered so that fa increasingly accumulated in and 180 it was also found that and 180 exhibited the highest fluorescence intensities of soluble microbial product like region iv and ha and melanoidin like region v fluorophores among the samples subjected to ad as the hac content of and 180 was the lowest among the samples subjected to ad the highest fluorescence intensities of region v of and 180 was more likely due to the highest content of melanoidin like materials instead of ha like materials thus the findings can be further explained as follows 1 the melanoidins in rs 180 were not sufficiently degraded during ad and 2 the large amounts of melanoidins in rs 180 could compete with other organics for reaction sites inhibiting the adequate degradation of fragmented cells and metabolites mauron 1990 yu et al 2021 zang and hatcher 2002 moreover the melanoidin like materials have been often mischaracterized as ha like materials in previous studies based on the results of 3d eem huang et al 2021 concluded that the macromolecule released in large quantities from sludge after high temperature thp was ha region v and reached a maximum at 180 c while in their investigation the melanoidin like materials were not investigated and might interrupt the results in this study the contents of melanoid and humus were analyzed separately in order to supplement the results of eem spectra this avoided the misjudgment of region v as only ha like materials after high temperature thp a dom van krevelen diagram was created to visualize the compound distribution in dom fig s1 antony et al 2014 and 160 and and 180 exhibited significantly lower dom concentrations of labile organic matters e g lipid like and protein like than and 0 and significantly higher humus concentration this indicated that the degradation of organic matters in sludge increased after thp and the humus proportion in dom increased which were consistent with the results mentioned above the aromaticity index ai was used to reflect the c c density in a molecule which can be calculated from the exact molecular masses of single dom compounds gu et al 2022 the ai is used to distinguish between non aromatic compounds ai 0 5 aromatic compounds 0 5 ai 0 67 and condensed aromatic hydrocarbons ai 0 67 koch and dittmar 2016 compared with and 0 the results showed that and 160 and and 180 exhibited 15 9 and 20 9 lower abundance of dom compounds with ai 0 5 respectively fig 8 further demonstrating that thp promoted the aromatization of organic matter in sludge during ad and 160 exhibited the highest abundance of condensed aromatic hydrocarbons ai 0 67 in the dom 18 7 indicating the highest degree of humus condensation this confirms that and 160 exhibited the optimal humification in addition and 180 exhibited a higher abundance of dom compounds with ai of 0 5 0 67 37 9 than and 0 and and 160 this indicated that the dom of and 180 contained a large amount of simple aromatic compounds rather than condensed aromatic hydrocarbons verifying that the further polymerization of fa to ha in sludge during ad was hindered during thp at 180 c resulting in fa accumulation in the digestate 3 3 effects of high temperature thp on the metabolisms involved in ha formation in sludge during ad 3 3 1 effects on intracellular polyphenol biosynthesis ha formation requires several functional metabolic genes and enzymes in this study metagenomic sequencing analyses were performed based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg function annotation a possible ha formation process is shown in fig 9 a varadachari and ghosh 1984 this study focused on the genes of intracellular rate limiting enzymes involved in ha formation through association with the shikimate and phenylalanine pathways according to the polyphenol protein theory fig 9b illustrates the specific metabolic pathway for the conversion of polysaccharide derivatives into polyphenolic compounds six intracellular metabolism modules have been reported to be involved in intracellular polyphenol biosynthesis cheng and breen 1991 wu et al 2021 glycolysis the embden meyerhof pathway m00001 the pentose phosphate pathway the pentose phosphate cycle m00004 the shikimate pathway m00022 phenylalanine biosynthesis m00024 monolignol biosynthesis m00039 and flavonoid biosynthesis m00138 the relative abundance ra of genes assigned to the enzymes involved was examined and 160 and and 180 respectively showed trends of gene upregulation and downregulation compared with and 0 the ra distribution of the genes assigned to enzymes not shown in fig 9b is presented in table s3 the ra of genes assigned to most enzymes did not fluctuate significantly in and 0 and 160 and and 180 p 0 01 because the changes in the ra of genes associated with phenylalanine conversion into polyphenols were not significant phenylalanine synthesis would directly affect polyphenol accumulation for the conversion of d glucose into phenylalanine changes in the ra of genes assigned to enzymes associated with m00001 m00004 m00022 and m00024 suggest that phenylalanine synthesis was promoted in and 160 and inhibited in and 180 therefore high temperature thp may alter intracellular polyphenol biosynthesis by affecting the production of intermediates such as 2 dehydro 3 deoxy d arabino heptonate 7 phosphate and phenylalanine cui et al 2012 yun et al 2015 the initial substrates for the synthesis of these intermediates were polysaccharide derivatives absorbed from extracellular sources in rs 160 the polysaccharides were solubilized and hydrolyzed into small molecules that were more easily transferred into the cell by microorganisms while in rs 180 the polysaccharides were hydrolyzed and then heterocyclized to form melanoidins that were difficult to be utilized m00001 and m00004 belong to glycolysis gluconeogenesis ko00010 m00022 and m00024 belong to phenylalanine and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis ko00400 m00039 and m00138 belong to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ko00940 fig 10 a shows the shifted ra of genes assigned to these three pathways among the three metabolic pathways associated with intracellular polyphenol synthesis glycolysis gluconeogenesis ko00010 was the most active accounting for 14 92 16 93 followed by aromatic amino acid biosynthesis ko00400 5 8 6 6 and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ko00940 1 7 1 9 compared with the and 0 group and 160 and and 180 respectively exhibited upregulation and downregulation of the ra of genes assigned to all three pathways which further explains the results of intensified and reduced sludge humification during ad with thp at 160 and 180 c respectively 3 3 2 effects on the condensation of extracellular humus the intracellularly synthesized polyphenols and enzymes were excreted extracellularly polyphenols quinones and amino acids were extracellularly condensed by polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductase to form humus building blocks the humus building blocks would condense into fa and ha under the action of enzymes fig 9a varadachari and ghosh 1984 there is no significant difference between ha and fa in terms of the building blocks the main difference is that ha has a greater degree of polymerization which tends to make it less soluble than fa chin et al 1994 therefore the condensation degree of humus derived from the extracellular conversion of polyphenols was highly dependent on the enzymes involved in the condensation reaction furthermore the ras of genes assigned to polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductases in sludge samples subjected to ad were compared fig 10b the ra of genes assigned to polyphenol oxidase increased by 5 3 in and 160 18 2 and decreased by 4 6 in and 180 16 5 compared with and 0 17 3 for the four quinone oxidoreductases the ras of the assigned genes increased by 19 1 in and 160 4 1 and decreased by 25 1 in and 180 2 6 compared with and 0 3 5 this trend substantiates the higher polymerization degree in and 160 than in both and 0 and and 180 consistent with the changes in the distributions of the ha content fig 6 and the ai value fig 8 in summary the effects of high temperature thp on the metabolism involved in ha formation during ad were reflected in both intracellular polyphenol synthesis and extracellular humus condensation and 160 exhibited greater polysaccharide availability than the other samples and thus more active intracellular polyphenol metabolism of microorganisms polyphenol accumulation stimulated the synthesis of related condensation enzymes polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductases which eventually promoted extracellular ha production in contrast polysaccharide heterocyclization in the and 180 group inhibited intracellular polyphenol synthesis generating negative feedback which impeded the supply of condensation enzymes and further increased the difficulty of humus condensation 3 4 the effect of high temperature thp on sludge humification during ad mechanism based on polysaccharide metabolism fig 11 summarizes the polysaccharide metabolism based mechanism through which high temperature thp affects sludge humification during ad first the polysaccharides in sludge were dissolved and hydrolyzed into reducing sugars e g glucose during high temperature thp and the highest sps concentration was obtained at 160 c with increasing thp temperature up to 180 c the c o and ch sites of reducing sugars underwent the maillard reaction with amino compounds to produce heterocyclic melanoidins containing co c the solubilization and hydrolysis of polysaccharides during thp at 160 c facilitated their entrance into microbial cells thereby increasing polysaccharide availability rs 160 in contrast the heterocyclization of polysaccharides subjected to thp at 180 c inhibited their uptake by microbial cells reducing polysaccharide availability rs 180 the upgrade and downgrade of polysaccharide availability increased and reduced the ra of genes associated with intracellular polyphenol synthesis during ad respectively enhancing and inhibiting glycolysis ko00010 phenylalanine biosynthesis ko00400 and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ko00940 consequently the intracellular polyphenol biosynthesis process was inhibited in and 180 and facilitated in and 160 as polyphenols were substrates for extracellular humus condensation reaction the upregulation and downregulation of the intracellular synthesis of polyphenols increased and 160 and reduced and 180 the ra of genes attributed to condensation polyphenol oxidase quinone oxidoreductase thus ha was intensively enriched in and 160 and fa was accumulated in and 180 the mechanism highlighted the crucial but neglected role of polysaccharides in the humification of sludge during ad namely the bio accessibility of polysaccharides influenced by thp in terms of their occurrence state and molecular structure could determine the humification of sludge during ad which can be regulated by thp at different temperature future studies on the effects of other pretreatments on polysaccharide metabolism and humus production during ad of sludge maybe also important for the humus investigation 4 conclusion this study investigated the regulatory mechanisms of humification in sludge during ad by high temperature thp based on polysaccharide metabolism the main findings are as follows 1 the sludge with thp under 160 c and 160 showed a significant up regulation in total humus and total ha contents after ad compared to that without thp while and 180 showed a significant down regulation namely appropriate thp temperature would promote the humification during ad while the too high temperature would inhibit it 2 thp affected humification of sludge during ad through both intracellular polyphenol synthesis and extracellular humus condensation pathways related to polysaccharides metabolism determined by the bio accessibility of polysaccharides 3 after thp under 160 c the availability of polysaccharides in sludge was increased the highest soluble polysaccharides and reducing sugars and the intracellular polyphenol metabolism of the microorganisms was thus more active during ad the accumulation of polyphenols stimulated the synthesis of related extracellular condensation enzymes polyphenol oxidase and quinone oxidoreductases eventually leading to the promotion of extracellular ha production during ad 4 while after thp under 180 c the availability of polysaccharides in sludge was decreased due to heterocyclization the highest production of melanoidin with co c heterocycles from 193 87 r u nm2 ml g without thp to 778 46 r u nm2 ml g through c o ch sites of sps and amino acids this led to inhibition of intracellular polyphenol synthesis generating negative feedback of blocked supply of condensing enzymes and further deepening the difficulty of extracellular humus formation and condensation during ad this study expands the theoretical research of anaerobic humification in sludge and provides a data basis and mechanism support for the process design of ad based sludge

15394,solar driven interfacial evaporation is a breakthrough water treatment method because it harvests solar energy for producing clean water however evaporated volatile organic compounds vocs in distilled water are the greatest barrier to this technology herein a bionic solar driven interfacial evaporation system integrating photothermal and photocatalysis technology was developed based on a new combined material tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 pva ttcp hydrogel as an evaporator phenol contaminated water especially actual water seawater lake water and reclaimed water is used to evaluate the water evaporation and voc photocatalytic degradation performance the results show that the evaporation rate of ttcp hydrogel was 1 54 kg m 2 h 1 under 1 kw m 2 and the removal efficiency of phenol ranged from 69 4 to 100 at different concentrations 1 50 mg l in source water particularly the capacity of the bionic evaporator was first evaluated for different types of actual water despite the initial toc 38 12 57 93 mg l and total dissolved solids tds 1 35 103 8 78 104 mg l for seawater lake water and reclaimed water being very different the tds was decreased by more than two orders of magnitude below the us epa drinking water standard 500 mg l the maximum toc removal efficiency reached 80 under simulated sunlight 1 kw m 2 which is comparable to the efficiency of the ultrafiltration technique previously reported except for seawater furthermore real sunlight average solar irradiation 0 82 kw m 2 was used to assess the practicability the bionic evaporator can produce 0 72 kg m 2 h 1 of vapor from reclaimed water and run with steadily efficient tds and toc removals reaching 99 and 74 respectively this technology as a small decentralized water treatment method is a good choice for remote and off grid areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photothermal photocatalysis water evaporation voc removal bionic system 1 introduction owing to the rapidly growing population immoderate resource consumption and climate change water scarcity has become one of the most urgent global challenges to be addressed chen et al 2020b the current water purification strategies are energy intensive including reverse osmosis distillation electrodialysis electrocatalysis and so on which will not only create an energy crisis but also increase the greenhouse gas emissions of some technologies ahdab et al 2021 shi et al 2020 therefore a novel water purification method with low energy consumption is urgently needed in this context solar driven interfacial evaporation is emerging as a promising approach for water purification chen et al 2019 xia et al 2019 this approach can produce clean distilled water that meets the criteria for drinking water by removing salts heavy metals microorganisms and most organic pollutants from raw water deng et al 2018 2019 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 however solar driven interfacial evaporation lacks the ability to remove volatile organic compounds vocs from water vocs in the source water will be evaporated with the water and even become concentrated in the distilled water during the process of interfacial evaporation threatening human health and fundamentally restricting the practicability of solar driven interfacial evaporation wang 2018 thus it is necessary to explore a simple and efficient way to improve solar driven interfacial evaporation with the ability to simultaneously produce clean vapor and remove vocs recently despite an increasing number of studies on solar driven interfacial evaporation only a few have been conducted on the simultaneous production of clean vapor and the removal of vocs to date some studies have focused on constructing a combined interfacial evaporation and advanced oxidation process such as the fenton reaction to simultaneously produce clean vapor and remove vocs gan et al 2021 shi et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 in these processes voc removal relied on the assistance of additional oxidants h2o2 persulfate bai et al 2022 he et al 2022 which may result in an increase in cost subsequently song et al 2020 prepared a novel photothermal photocatalytic membrane for voc removal during solar distillation deng et al 2020 developed tio2 loaded carbonized flammulina method for simultaneously solar evaporation and voc removal although the vapor generation and voc removal performance was gradually improved in their work several problems remain unsolved first the solar absorption of photocatalysts is still relatively narrow so solar energy cannot be fully utilized second the photocarriers of the photocatalyst recombine quickly resulting in low photocatalytic activity third the practicability of evaporation systems for practical water applications is questionable as most of them have failed practical water testing plants show the potential to simultaneously produce clean steam and remove vocs specifically polluted water flows from the roots to the leaves through the vessels under the catalysis of enzymes organic matter is converted into water and carbon dioxide which are discharged from the plants therefore driven by sunlight the three processes of water transportation water evaporation and enzyme catalysis realize the transformation of polluted water to clean vapor based on the process utilized by plants we realized that photocatalysis as a photo driven interfacial process could be tightly inherently combined with solar driven interfacial evaporation to achieve this goal considering that the hydraulic retention time of polluted water at the interface is too short vocs should be efficiently removed in this short time thus improving the rate of the photocatalytic reaction is necessary it can be improved from the following three aspects 1 light absorption 2 separation of photogenerated carriers and 3 mass transfer to the catalyst materials as a narrow band gap photocatalyst c3n4 owns several advantages including eco friendliness and nontoxicity escudero et al 2019 liu et al 2018 however the photocatalytic efficiency of pure c3n4 is low due to its insufficient visible light absorption and the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers chen et al 2018 ti3c2 is a material with excellent light absorption properties in the visible and infrared regions and has been used as a photothermal material for solar distillation chen et al 2020a li et al 2017 although ti3c2 has no photocatalytic activity a great deal of work has been reported to significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors by using ti3c2 as a cocatalyst huang et al 2019 sharma et al 2020 yuan et al 2018 ti3c2 has excellent photothermal conversion performance and its thermal effect enhances the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor furthermore ti3c2 exhibits better electronic conductivity and has a better electronic structure kim et al 2019 which when loaded with c3n4 not only improves the light absorption but also enhances the separation of photogenerated carriers in addition the hydrogel with a porous structure formed by pva helps to promote water transportation and reduce mass transfer resistance and the functional group of pva provides more hydration capacity thus reducing the enthalpy of evaporation given the above it is reasonable to think that the combination of c3n4 ti3c2 and pva can be used to degrade vocs during the solar distillation process promoted by the above demands and inspired by water transportation enzyme catalysis and water evaporation a bionic solar driven interfacial evaporation system was designed in this system tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 pva ttcp hydrogel composed of c3n4 ti3c2 and pva was used as an evaporator which concurrently realized the coupling of solar vapor generation and photocatalytic degradation phenol was selected as a model voc pollutant to study the contaminant removal performance of the ttcp hydrogel and the degradation mechanism was further discussed finally to assess the potential for practical applicability the bionic solar driven interfacial evaporation system based on ttcp hydrogel was used to purify actual water that contained complex vocs using simulated and actual sunlight this work will provide an effective strategy for generating clean vapor from voc contaminated water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyvinyl alcohol pva 124 lithium fluoride lif hydrochloric acid hcl thiourea glutaraldehyde and phenol were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china ti3alc2 was purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai ultrapure water was supplied by a milli q purifier millipore billerica ma usa analytical grade chemicals and ultrapure water were used throughout the experiments 2 2 methods 2 2 1 preparation of ti3c2 ti3c2 was prepared by etching commercial ti3alc2 ghidiu et al 2014 specifically 1 6 g of lif was immersed in 20 ml of 9 m hydrochloric acid and stirred in a teflon flask for 15 min then 1 g of ti3alc2 was added followed by stirring for 48 h at 25 c the etched product was separated and washed with deionized water by centrifugation 3500 rpm several times until the ph of the supernatant reached 6 the as prepared material was sonicated for 2 h under nitrogen protection and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min finally the centrifuged supernatant was freeze dried in vacuum to obtain a black powder of ti3c2 the powder was stored in a vacuum and dry environment for use in the next step 2 2 2 preparation of tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 according to previous studies han et al 2020 bulk c3n4 was fabricated by calcining thiourea powders at 550 for 5 h with a heating rate of 2 5 min in a muffle furnace for a typical synthesis of tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 photocatalysts a composite with a mass ratio of ti3c2 to c3n4 of 1 to 10 was added to an agate mortar containing a certain amount of alcohol and was fully ground subsequently the composite was calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 5 min when cooled to room temperature the composite was obtained and stored in the dark 2 2 3 preparation of pva hydrogel and tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 pva ttcp hydrogel in a typical synthesis process tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 0 175 g glutaraldehyde 125 μl 50 wt aqueous solution and hcl 250 μl 2 m were added to 5 ml of 7 5 wt pva solution and gelation was performed for 24 h afterward the hydrogel was immersed in di water for 24 h to remove impurities the pure hydrogel was frozen in a refrigerator at a temperature of 20 and thawed in di water at room temperature the cycle of freezing and thawing was repeated 10 times in addition to compare the evaporation rates and voc degradation abilities of different composite hydrogels pure pva hydrogel pure tio2 ti3c2 pva hydrogel and pure c3n4 pva hydrogel were prepared by the same method and labeled pva hydrogel tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel and c3n4 hydrogel respectively 2 2 4 characterization the details of characterization are shown in s1 supplementary materials 2 3 solar evaporation experiment the solar evaporation experiments were performed by a solar simulator pls sxe300d perfect light technology co ltd china with an am 1 5 g optical filter the solar radiation was recorded by irradiatometer fa z photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university unless otherwise specified each solar evaporation experiment was measured under an intensity of 1 kw m 2 corresponding to 1 sun illumination thermal images were captured by an infrared camera e4 flir the bulk water temperature was measured by digital temperature measuring instrument ut320 uni t all experiments were carried out under ambient conditions with a humidity of approximately 30 and a room temperature of approximately 25 c in addition the calculation method of water evaporation rate is shown in s2 supplementary materials and the details of outdoor evaporation experiment are shown in s3 supplementary materials 2 4 voc removal experiment simulated voc removal tests were carried out in a laboratory made device as shown in fig 1 vapor was easily condensed onto the quartz wall of the device and transformed into a liquid which was collected for further study phenol was used as a model voc to evaluate the photocatalysis efficiency because it is relatively common in the environment after 2 h of adsorption desorption equilibrium in the dark the degradation efficiencies of all samples were measured in this study three different kinds of water sea water lake water and reclaimed water from the bohai sea baiyang lake and the water treatment station of the school respectively were used as the source water and a series of experiments were conducted under the illumination of simulated sunlight to assess the potential of ttcp hydrogels to be translated into practical applications 3 results and discussion 3 1 design strategy of the bionic system this study was inspired by water transportation enzyme catalysis and water evaporation and a bionic solar driven interfacial evaporation system based on ttcp hydrogel was developed fig 1 which has the dual functions of water evaporation and photocatalysis in this system the porous network structure of the hydrogel imitated vessels in plants which not only realized the function of water transportation but also increased exposure between contaminants and catalysts thus reducing the mass transfer limitation ti3c2 realized the function of water evaporation due to its excellent light absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency surprisingly the calcined ti3c2 formed tio2 ti3c2 which formed a heterojunction with c3n4 enhancing the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers furthermore the combination of ti3c2 and c3n4 enhances the light absorption of photocatalysis and the thermal conversion by ti3c2 promotes photocatalytic activity so the combination of ti3c2 and c3n4 effectively realizes the enzyme catalysis function in addition instead of direct contact between the evaporator ttcp hydrogel and bulk water polystyrene foam was used as an insulation layer to enhance the localized thermal effect which limits the thermal properties around the ttcp hydrogel to promote water evaporation performance and photocatalytic activity with the cotton core as the root water is continuously transported to the ttcp hydrogel through capillary action to provide sufficient water while reducing heat conduction loss 3 2 characterization of photothermal photocatalytic materials 3 2 1 morphology and composition of photothermal photocatalytic materials benefitting from the highly branched micron sized vessels of plants water and salts can be efficiently transported into plants fig 1 undoubtedly plants provide useful guidance regarding the construction of bionic micropores which may bring remarkable water transport enhancement reduce the mass transfer resistance and utilize photogenerated charges pva clusters are formed when dispersed in water after gelation the clusters formed the skeleton of the ttcp hydrogel with micron channels and the spacing among these clusters formed the internal gaps zhou et al 2019 the prepared hydrogel was black fig 2 d scanning electron microscopy sem showed that the ttcp hydrogel had wide pores with diameters of 5 μm fig 2 a the pores enhanced water evaporation by facilitating water transportation via capillary flow in addition the hydrogel porous network structure of simulated water transportation not only provides micron pores for the rapid mass transfer of pollutants but also abundant active sites for degradation zhang et al 2022 to simulate the enzyme catalysis and water evaporation processes of plants photocatalyst c3n4 and photothermal conversion material ti3c2 were calcined together to form a compound as shown in fig 2 b c3n4 contains two characteristic peaks at 2θ 13 1 and 27 5 the peaks at 8 5 18 6 28 0 41 9 and 60 7 were attributed to ti3c2 naguib et al 2011 which were indexed as 0 0 2 0 0 4 0 0 6 2 2 0 and 1 1 0 respectively interestingly some of the ti3c2 diffraction peaks disappeared and new peaks appeared after calcination the peaks at 2θ 25 3 37 7 48 0 53 9 55 1 and 62 7 were indexed as 1 0 1 0 0 4 2 0 0 1 0 5 2 1 1 and 2 0 4 respectively corresponding to the characteristic peaks of anatase tio2 jcpds no 21 1272 this result indicated that ti3c2 partially converted into tio2 wang et al 2013 in addition no other xrd peaks were found in the ttcp hydrogel sample except the specific peaks of c3n4 ti3c2 and tio2 as depicted in fig 2 c in the ftir spectrum of the pva hydrogel the peak at 1093 cm 1 is caused by the stretching vibration of co and is a characteristic peak of pva for c3n4 hydrogel the peaks at approximately 790 cm 1 correspond to the stretching of the triazine ring in c3n4 and the peaks range from 1200 to 1700 are mainly caused by the heptazine heterocyclic ring stretching vibration the peak at 3140 cm 1 may be attributed to the stretching vibration of oh of the adsorbing water molecules on the sample surface the ttcp hydrogel spectrum still appeared the same as the spectrum of the c3n4 hydrogel demonstrating that c3n4 was successfully loaded in the ttcp hydrogel the above results indicated that tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 were successfully loaded onto the pva hydrogel and these results are consistent with those of eds in conclusion we successfully prepared a bionic ttcp hydrogel with water transportation enzyme catalysis and water evaporation 3 2 2 solar absorption and photothermal conversion properties of photothermal photocatalytic materials in the process of solar vapor generation broadband solar absorption is a prerequisite for efficient solar to vapor conversion fig 2 g depicts the solar absorption spectra of ttcp tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 and pva hydrogels in the wavelength range of 200 2500 nm across the solar spectrum the absorption of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel was 90 6 while that of the ttcp hydrogel was 86 8 however the solar absorption rates of the tio2 ti3c2 and ttcp hydrogels were much higher than those of pva hydrogels 12 1 and c3n4 hydrogels 9 33 these results indicated that the addition of tio2 ti3c2 improved the light absorption of c3n4 which was attributed not only to the excellent solar absorption of tio2 ti3c2 but also to the porous structure of the hydrogel when incident light reached the hydrogel it was trapped in the porous channels of the hydrogel and then absorbed through multiple internal reflections resulting in broadband solar absorption such excellent broadband solar absorption makes ttcp hydrogels promising candidate materials for solar vapor generation in addition to broadband solar absorption materials also need to have efficient photothermal conversion properties to achieve efficient solar vapor generation the photothermal conversion performance of hydrogels was investigated using an infrared ir camera fig 2 f shows the temperature change of the sample surface with time under illumination the ttcp hydrogel surface temperature rose rapidly from room temperature to 39 4 in 10 min and ultimately fluctuated at 39 for comparison the thermal responses of the tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 and pva hydrogels were examined under the same conditions the stable state temperature 41 c on the surface of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel is very close to that of the ttcp hydrogel 39 4 c which indicates that the photothermal conversion capabilities of both are very similar in addition the average surface temperature of the pva hydrogel under simulated sunlight decreased to 20 c which may be caused by the heat dissipation caused by water evaporation these results are consistent with those of the uv vis drs experiment although the broadband solar absorption capability of the ttcp hydrogel is not as good as that of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel the small temperature difference between the two indicates that the ttcp hydrogel can still efficiently absorb solar energy and convert it into thermal energy therefore more water could be evaporated to generate vapor not only owing to the excellent broadband solar absorption capability but also due to the outstanding photothermal conversion ability of the ttcp hydrogel 3 2 3 high electron transfer performance for voc degradation the separation performance of photocarriers could reflect the performance of the photocatalysts that is the higher the separation efficiency of photocarriers is the better the photocatalytic performance we studied the separation performance of photocarriers in samples by transient photocurrent response electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and photoluminescence pl tests as shown in fig 2 h the photocurrent value of the ttcp hydrogel was 2 92 times higher than that of the c3n4 hydrogel and 9 61 times higher than that of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel the lower the recombination of photocarriers is the higher the photocurrent the photocurrent results indicated that the ttcp hydrogel has a strong photocarrier separation efficiency wu et al 2020 eis was also used to evaluate the interfacial charge transfer resistance the smaller the semicircle radius is the lower the charge transfer resistance and the higher the charge transfer efficiency liu et al 2019 as shown in fig 2 i the radius of the ttcp hydrogel is significantly smaller than those of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel and c3n4 hydrogel indicating that the ttcp hydrogel has the lowest charge transfer resistance and the highest separation efficiency of photocarriers to gain further insight into the separation of photocarriers pl spectroscopy was performed under excitation light at 420 nm in general the weaker the emission intensity is the higher the photogenerated electron hole pair separation efficiency as shown in fig 2 j the fluorescence emission intensity of the ttcp hydrogel was weaker than those of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel and c3n4 hydrogel indicating that the ttcp hydrogel effectively suppressed the recombination rate of the higher photogenerated electron hole pairs xu et al 2018 combining the above results it can be concluded that the ttcp hydrogel has a high electron hole pair separation efficiency indicating that the coupling of tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated carriers thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 3 3 simulated solar water evaporation and voc removal 3 3 1 simulated solar water evaporation to study the solar water evaporation performance of the ttcp hydrogel experiments were performed under the irradiation of simulated sunlight 1 kw m 2 the mass change of water was recorded in situ to obtain the mass change of vapor fig 3 a it was observed that a low vapor generation amount 0 27 kg m 2 was obtained when water was under light in the presence of the ttcp hydrogel the vapor generation amount 1 54 kg m 2 was greatly enhanced under the same conditions which was 1 1 and 2 0 fold higher than those of the c3n4 and pva hydrogels respectively it should be pointed out that the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel presented the highest water evaporation amount 1 80 kg m 2 among all the materials these results can be attributed to the light absorption ability of materials in the wavelength range from 200 to 2500 nm across the solar spectrum and their photothermal conversion ability in addition the evaporation efficiency ηsolar was calculated by the following equation eq 1 li et al 2020 1 η s o l a r m e v a p h l v c o p t q i where mevap is the net mass flux per unit area hl v is the total enthalpy change of the liquid vapor change of water copt qi is the power density of solar illumination 1 kw m 2 for the ttcp system the vapor temperature is 32 2 the bulk water temperature is 26 and its corresponding total enthalpy is approximately 2575 kj kg 1 thus the practical solar evaporation efficiency was calculated as 84 1 fig 3 b indicating high efficiency solar driven interfacial evaporation of ttcp an energy balance analysis of ttcp was conducted more details regarding the heat loss calculation are available in s4 supplementary materials the theoretical evaporation efficiency is 83 6 fig 3 c the practical and theoretical evaporation efficiencies are very close confirming that a solar evaporation efficiency of 84 1 can be achieved in addition the thermal conductivity of ttcp hydrogel was 0 364 w m k details were shown in s6 supplementary materials 3 3 2 voc removal performance and mechanism with simulated sunlight 3 3 2 1 voc degradation performance and contribution of active species the photothermal photocatalytic material possessed excellent photocatalytic activity and therefore could remove vocs effectively during evaporation to demonstrate the photocatalytic performance of the ttcp hydrogel under different voc concentrations phenol at different concentrations 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l was used as the source water the green column of fig 4 a shows that the toc concentrations in distilled water directly evaporated without photothermal photocatalysis material ttcp hydrogel were 106 108 117 121 and 116 of the source water with concentrations of 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l respectively all of these results showed that vocs cannot be directly removed during the solar evaporation but are instead easily concentrated and collected in distilled water which demonstrated that vocs could be a potential problem for solar water evaporation if source water is contaminated by vocs fig 4 a shows that the toc concentrations in distilled water evaporated by photothermal photocatalysis material ttcp hydrogel are much lower than those in the source water the removal efficiencies were approximately 100 83 4 84 1 78 6 and 69 4 under source water phenol concentrations of 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l respectively these results indicated that the ttcp hydrogel can remove vocs efficiently even at high concentrations shi et al 2019 fig 4 b shows the toc concentrations of distilled water for pva tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 and ttcp hydrogels with a phenol concentration of 10 mg l in the source water the toc concentration 9 4 mg l of distilled water with pva is higher than that of the source water 7 7 mg l indicating that vocs were concentrated in distilled water because pva hydrogel cannot remove vocs the toc concentrations of distilled water with tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 and ttcp hydrogels are 6 7 2 1 and 1 2 mg l respectively which are lower than that of the source water proving that vocs are removed by photocatalysis obviously the ttcp hydrogel showed the highest removal capacity 84 4 after 1 h light illumination for illustrating the stability of evaporator ten cycle experiments on the ttcp hydrogel were carried out after ten cycles the evaporation rate and voc degradation efficiency toward 10 mg l phenol source water stayed over 1 47 kg m 2 h 1 and 77 respectively indicating the good recyclability and long term stability of the ttcp hydrogel fig s2 supplementary materials in addition increasing the amount of ti3c2 resulted in a lower degradation efficiency indicating that the optimal ratio of tio2 ti3c2 to c3n4 was 1 10 fig s6 supplementary materials to determine the active species during the photocatalysis degradation process radical scavenging experiments were carried out by adding an h scavenger ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta 2na radical oh scavenger tertiary butyl alcohol tba radical o2 scavenger p benzoquinone p bq and 1o2 scavenger sodium azide nan3 as presented in fig 4 c the photocatalysis degradation efficiency significantly decreased after the addition of p bq and nan3 which suggests that radical o2 and 1o2 are the main oxidizing species for the ttcp hydrogel the addition of edta 2na and tba had little effect on the photocatalysis degradation efficiency implying that h and oh were involved in the voc degradation process and played auxiliary roles therefore the results show that four active species contribute to voc degradation and the contribution order of the four active species is o2 1o2 oh h fig 4 d to further confirm the presence of four active species during the photocatalysis degradation process esr spin trapping with dmpo temp and tpmpo was implemented under 1 kw m 2 illumination fig 4 e shows that ttcp has an obvious tempo h peak under dark conditions and the intensity of this peak decreases significantly after 10 min of illumination this result implies that h directly participated in the voc degradation reaction no obvious peaks of dmpoo2 dmpooh and temp 1o2 were captured under dark conditions but the signals of characteristic peak were captured after 10 min of illumination all these results confirm that the radicals 1o2 o2 h and oh are the main species involved in the voc degradation which supports with the radical scavenging experiments in addition under an illumination of 1 kw m 2 the decay rate of h in ttcp was faster than that in tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 and ttcp displayed a higher intensities of dmop oh and temp 1o2 signals than tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 signals these results indicate that ttcp owns better separation of photogenerated charges efficiency under the same illumination conditions in addition it was clear that c3n4 showed a greater dmop o2 peak intensity than ttcp under illumination the reason for the decrease in radical o2 could be ascribed to radical o2 being oxidized by h to generate radical 1o2 fig s7 supplementary materials pan et al 2019 3 3 2 2 proposed mechanism for enhancing voc removal band structure matching plays an important role in smooth photocarrier separation a suitable band structure can promote the catalytic activity of the photocatalyst to reveal the mechanism for enhancing voc removal of the ttcp hydrogel we conducted mott schottky m s tests to determine the band structure of the ttcp hydrogel as presented in fig 5 a and b the c3n4 and tio2 ti3c2 hydrogels were both confirmed to be n type semiconductors because of the positive slope of capacitance to voltage xu et al 2018 the flat band potentials efb value of tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 can be calculated from the x axis intercepts as depicted in the fig 5 a and b the results were 0 47 ev vs ag agcl for tio2 ti3c2 and 0 94 ev vs ag agcl for c3n4 which correspond to ca 0 67 v vs nhe for tio2 and 1 14 v vs nhe for c3n4 based on the uv vis diffused reflectance spectra fig 5 c the bandgap energy eg value of the composite can be obtained by extrapolating the straight line of the curve slope to the x axis and the results were 3 0 ev vs nhe for tio2 ti3c2 and 2 88 ev vs nhe for c3n4 the conduction band potential ecb value of the n type semiconductor can be replaced by the value of efb value since the two are very closed therefore the valence bands evb of tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 are evaluated to be 2 33 ev vs nhe and 1 74 ev vs nhe respectively according to the equation evb ecb eg yang and wang 2021 these results are similar to numerous previous studies based on the relative positions of ecb and evb in tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 the photogenerated carriers could be easily transferred between tio2 and c3n4by the z scheme given the process for photogenerated carriers in the heterojunction the electrons e of tio2 and c3n4 can both be excited to conduction band cb and thus form equivalent holes h on valence band vb in addition ti3c2 can improve the separation efficiency of e h pairs and enhance the light absorption ability of photocatalysts due to its high specific surface area if the tio2 ti3c2 form a type ⅱ heterojunction then the e in the cb of c3n4 would transfer to the cb of tio2 and the h in the vb of tio2 would transfer to the vb of c3n4 under this circumstance radical oh will not be produced by the system because the standard redox potential of radical oh oh 1 99 v vs nhe is more positive than the vb potential of c3n4 1 74 ev vs nhe pan et al 2019 this result does not match the results of the radical scavenging experiment and esr therefore it is more logical for tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 to form the z scheme heterojunction rather than the type ⅱ heterojunction it is reported that the fermi energy level of ti3c2 is approximately 0 04 ev which is between the cb of tio2 and the vb of c3n4 liao et al 2020 therefore the suitable potential difference provides sufficient power to drive the electron transition from tio2 to c3n4 significantly improving the separation efficiencies of the e in cb of c3n4 and the h in vb of tio2 wang et al 2016 in addition because the cb potential of c3n4 is more negative than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 v vs nhe the photogenerated e in the cb of c3n4 will react with o2 in water to generate o2 similarly photogenerated h in the vb of tio2 will react with oh in water and then generate oh 1 99 ev vs nhe the radical o2 can be oxidized by h to generate radical singlet oxygen all the active species migrate to the surface of the catalyst to degrade organic pollutants thus the tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 heterojunction follows the z scheme fig 5 d which improves the transport and separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and higher photocatalytic activity is realized furthermore the temperature of the surroundings increases because of the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of ti3c2 the average energy of electrons increases as the temperature increases for the electrons not participating in molecular oxygen activation moa the probability of these electrons taking part in the moa will be increased that is the potential of generating more o2 radicals will be enhanced yang et al 2021 for the electrons that are on the verge of participating in the moa the growing energy of the electrons can improve the interaction between the catalyst and the surface adsorbed o2 and reduce the energy barrier for moa thus improving the ability of the heterojunction to activate molecular oxygen to produce o2 radicals zhang et al 2021 therefore the photothermal effect will further improve the efficiency of the moa to produce o2 radicals and the efficient removal of vocs is realized based on the above analysis it can be concluded that the photocatalytic activity of the ttcp hydrogel is improved not only because the z type heterojunction greatly improves the separation and transmission efficiency of photogenerated carriers but also because the photothermal effect improves the efficiency of generating o2 radicals for comparison table s1 supplementary materials summarizes some reported works of photothermal evaporation combined with photocatalysis and the water evaporation rate and pollutant removal efficiency in this work are superior to most of these works in addition compared with relevant works under the same pollutant concentration and solar radiation the evaporation rate in this study is the highest 3 4 application potential 3 4 1 evaporation of actual water under simulated sunlight to assess the effect of the bionic solar driven interface evaporation system on treating actual water three different types of actual water seawater lake water and reclaimed water were used as the source water fig 6 a shows that the total dissolved solid tds concentration of the three types of water decreased by more than two orders of magnitude which was below the us epa drinking water standard the organic compound compositions in the three types of water are very complex mixing natural and artificial compounds thus the concentration of organic compounds in source and distilled water is characterized by the total organic carbon toc fig 6 b shows that the toc of sea water lake water and reclaimed water decreased by 23 6 60 3 and 80 1 respectively after solar distillation this result indicates that the performance of ttcp is comparable with that of the ultrafiltration technique uf light blue background in fig 6 b for water purification except for sea water li et al 2006 the decrease in the toc removal efficiency in the bohai sea may be due to the inorganic salts at the surface of the photocatalyst which inhibited the approach of organics and thus reduced the photocatalytic activity li et al 2016 to further characterize the types of organic compounds three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra of source water and distilled water were measured fig s8 supplementary materials tryptophan like substances section ii fulvic acid like substances section iii and soluble microbial byproduct substances section iv are the major groups of chemical compounds in the three types of water song et al 2020 after ttcp purification the fluorescence intensity significantly decreased these results indicate that ttcp can efficiently remove organic pollutants such as tryptophan like substances fulvic acid like substances and soluble microbial byproduct substances simultaneously in addition the concentrations of cations na mg2 k ca2 and anions cl so4 2 and no3 were reduced 10 fold to 1000 fold after solar distillation which are levels lower than the salinity levels defined by the u s environmental protection agency epa fig 6 c indicating the excellent desalination ability of ttcp hydrogel in addition ttcp hydrogel has self cleaning performance s5 fig s3 and s4 supplementary materials 3 4 2 evaporation of the reclaimed water under actual sunlight to evaluate the application potential in actual settings an outdoor distillation experiment was conducted in beijing china north latitude of 39 in september 28 2022 reclaimed water was used as the source water fig 7 a shows the outdoor evaporator the solar intensity temperature humidity and evaporation rate are recorded in fig 7 b and c as presented in fig 7 c the evaporation rate basically consistent with the change in the light intensity trend the average evaporation rate was 0 72 kg m 2 h 1 this record was lower than that under simulated sunlight 1 54 kg m 2 h 1 probably because water droplets formed by the vapor get attached to the undersurface of the glass and thus block the sunlight from passing through fig 7 a the toc concentration in the source water was 43 50 mg l after distillation under actual sunlight without ttcp hydrogel distilled without photocatalysis a toc of 18 64 mg l was detected in the distilled water however only 11 21 mg l of vocs were present in the distilled water when using the ttcp hydrogel fig 7 d compared with the toc and tds removal efficiency under simulated sunlight under actual sunlight the toc removal efficiency fig 7 d blue bar slightly decreased by 6 74 while the tds removal efficiency fig 7 d green bar remained almost unchanged 99 in addition as shown in fig 7 e f distillation without the ttcp hydrogel without photocatalysis could remove some of the chemical compounds from the source water but not most of them indicating that some organic matter in reclaimed water is volatile when the ttcp hydrogel was applied distilled with photocatalysis distillation could remove most of the chemical components identified in regions i v which also suggested that the ttcp hydrogel can effectively remove vocs by solar distillation all the above results confirm that bionic solar driven interface evaporation with ttcp is an ideal evaporator that shows great performance not only in desalination but also in voc removal this technology as a small decentralized water treatment method is a good choice for remote and off line areas where access to clean water is difficult to obtain and solar energy is sufficient 4 conclusion by imitating the water transportation enzyme catalysis and water evaporation processes of plants a bionic solar driven interface evaporation system integrating catalysis and photothermal materials with ttcp hydrogel as an evaporator was successfully developed which was used to remove vocs during solar distillation the evaporation rate of the ttcp hydrogel was 1 54 kg m 2 h 1 under 1 kw m 2 which benefited from the high absorption efficiency 86 8 from ultraviolet to near infrared light and the excellent photothermal conversion ability of the ttcp hydrogel the removal efficiencies of phenol voc model pollutant at different concentrations 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l ranged from 69 4 to 100 the reasons for the high photocatalytic activity of the ttcp hydrogel may be as follows 1 the heterojunction improved the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers 2 the addition of ti3c2 enhanced the overall solar absorption performance 3 the porous network structure of the hydrogel accelerated mass transfer and provided abundant active sites and 4 the photothermal effect promoted photocatalytic performance in particular when the system was used to purify three actual water types seawater lake water and reclaimed water with different levels of pollution and salinity under simulated sunlight 1 kw m 2 the total dissolved solids tds decreased by more than two orders of magnitude the maximum toc removal efficiency is up to 80 which is similar to the efficiency of uf technology previously reported and the concentrations of seven ions na k mg2 ca2 cl no3 so4 2 decreased by more than one order of magnitude furthermore the ttcp hydrogel even produced 0 72 kg m 2 h 1 vapor from reclaimed water under actual sunlight average solar radiation of 0 82 kw m 2 although the actual solar radiation significantly decreased by 71 compared with that of the simulated sunlight the toc removal efficiency only slightly decreased by 6 and the tds removal efficiency remained almost unchanged 98

15394,solar driven interfacial evaporation is a breakthrough water treatment method because it harvests solar energy for producing clean water however evaporated volatile organic compounds vocs in distilled water are the greatest barrier to this technology herein a bionic solar driven interfacial evaporation system integrating photothermal and photocatalysis technology was developed based on a new combined material tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 pva ttcp hydrogel as an evaporator phenol contaminated water especially actual water seawater lake water and reclaimed water is used to evaluate the water evaporation and voc photocatalytic degradation performance the results show that the evaporation rate of ttcp hydrogel was 1 54 kg m 2 h 1 under 1 kw m 2 and the removal efficiency of phenol ranged from 69 4 to 100 at different concentrations 1 50 mg l in source water particularly the capacity of the bionic evaporator was first evaluated for different types of actual water despite the initial toc 38 12 57 93 mg l and total dissolved solids tds 1 35 103 8 78 104 mg l for seawater lake water and reclaimed water being very different the tds was decreased by more than two orders of magnitude below the us epa drinking water standard 500 mg l the maximum toc removal efficiency reached 80 under simulated sunlight 1 kw m 2 which is comparable to the efficiency of the ultrafiltration technique previously reported except for seawater furthermore real sunlight average solar irradiation 0 82 kw m 2 was used to assess the practicability the bionic evaporator can produce 0 72 kg m 2 h 1 of vapor from reclaimed water and run with steadily efficient tds and toc removals reaching 99 and 74 respectively this technology as a small decentralized water treatment method is a good choice for remote and off grid areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photothermal photocatalysis water evaporation voc removal bionic system 1 introduction owing to the rapidly growing population immoderate resource consumption and climate change water scarcity has become one of the most urgent global challenges to be addressed chen et al 2020b the current water purification strategies are energy intensive including reverse osmosis distillation electrodialysis electrocatalysis and so on which will not only create an energy crisis but also increase the greenhouse gas emissions of some technologies ahdab et al 2021 shi et al 2020 therefore a novel water purification method with low energy consumption is urgently needed in this context solar driven interfacial evaporation is emerging as a promising approach for water purification chen et al 2019 xia et al 2019 this approach can produce clean distilled water that meets the criteria for drinking water by removing salts heavy metals microorganisms and most organic pollutants from raw water deng et al 2018 2019 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 however solar driven interfacial evaporation lacks the ability to remove volatile organic compounds vocs from water vocs in the source water will be evaporated with the water and even become concentrated in the distilled water during the process of interfacial evaporation threatening human health and fundamentally restricting the practicability of solar driven interfacial evaporation wang 2018 thus it is necessary to explore a simple and efficient way to improve solar driven interfacial evaporation with the ability to simultaneously produce clean vapor and remove vocs recently despite an increasing number of studies on solar driven interfacial evaporation only a few have been conducted on the simultaneous production of clean vapor and the removal of vocs to date some studies have focused on constructing a combined interfacial evaporation and advanced oxidation process such as the fenton reaction to simultaneously produce clean vapor and remove vocs gan et al 2021 shi et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 in these processes voc removal relied on the assistance of additional oxidants h2o2 persulfate bai et al 2022 he et al 2022 which may result in an increase in cost subsequently song et al 2020 prepared a novel photothermal photocatalytic membrane for voc removal during solar distillation deng et al 2020 developed tio2 loaded carbonized flammulina method for simultaneously solar evaporation and voc removal although the vapor generation and voc removal performance was gradually improved in their work several problems remain unsolved first the solar absorption of photocatalysts is still relatively narrow so solar energy cannot be fully utilized second the photocarriers of the photocatalyst recombine quickly resulting in low photocatalytic activity third the practicability of evaporation systems for practical water applications is questionable as most of them have failed practical water testing plants show the potential to simultaneously produce clean steam and remove vocs specifically polluted water flows from the roots to the leaves through the vessels under the catalysis of enzymes organic matter is converted into water and carbon dioxide which are discharged from the plants therefore driven by sunlight the three processes of water transportation water evaporation and enzyme catalysis realize the transformation of polluted water to clean vapor based on the process utilized by plants we realized that photocatalysis as a photo driven interfacial process could be tightly inherently combined with solar driven interfacial evaporation to achieve this goal considering that the hydraulic retention time of polluted water at the interface is too short vocs should be efficiently removed in this short time thus improving the rate of the photocatalytic reaction is necessary it can be improved from the following three aspects 1 light absorption 2 separation of photogenerated carriers and 3 mass transfer to the catalyst materials as a narrow band gap photocatalyst c3n4 owns several advantages including eco friendliness and nontoxicity escudero et al 2019 liu et al 2018 however the photocatalytic efficiency of pure c3n4 is low due to its insufficient visible light absorption and the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers chen et al 2018 ti3c2 is a material with excellent light absorption properties in the visible and infrared regions and has been used as a photothermal material for solar distillation chen et al 2020a li et al 2017 although ti3c2 has no photocatalytic activity a great deal of work has been reported to significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors by using ti3c2 as a cocatalyst huang et al 2019 sharma et al 2020 yuan et al 2018 ti3c2 has excellent photothermal conversion performance and its thermal effect enhances the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor furthermore ti3c2 exhibits better electronic conductivity and has a better electronic structure kim et al 2019 which when loaded with c3n4 not only improves the light absorption but also enhances the separation of photogenerated carriers in addition the hydrogel with a porous structure formed by pva helps to promote water transportation and reduce mass transfer resistance and the functional group of pva provides more hydration capacity thus reducing the enthalpy of evaporation given the above it is reasonable to think that the combination of c3n4 ti3c2 and pva can be used to degrade vocs during the solar distillation process promoted by the above demands and inspired by water transportation enzyme catalysis and water evaporation a bionic solar driven interfacial evaporation system was designed in this system tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 pva ttcp hydrogel composed of c3n4 ti3c2 and pva was used as an evaporator which concurrently realized the coupling of solar vapor generation and photocatalytic degradation phenol was selected as a model voc pollutant to study the contaminant removal performance of the ttcp hydrogel and the degradation mechanism was further discussed finally to assess the potential for practical applicability the bionic solar driven interfacial evaporation system based on ttcp hydrogel was used to purify actual water that contained complex vocs using simulated and actual sunlight this work will provide an effective strategy for generating clean vapor from voc contaminated water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyvinyl alcohol pva 124 lithium fluoride lif hydrochloric acid hcl thiourea glutaraldehyde and phenol were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china ti3alc2 was purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai ultrapure water was supplied by a milli q purifier millipore billerica ma usa analytical grade chemicals and ultrapure water were used throughout the experiments 2 2 methods 2 2 1 preparation of ti3c2 ti3c2 was prepared by etching commercial ti3alc2 ghidiu et al 2014 specifically 1 6 g of lif was immersed in 20 ml of 9 m hydrochloric acid and stirred in a teflon flask for 15 min then 1 g of ti3alc2 was added followed by stirring for 48 h at 25 c the etched product was separated and washed with deionized water by centrifugation 3500 rpm several times until the ph of the supernatant reached 6 the as prepared material was sonicated for 2 h under nitrogen protection and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min finally the centrifuged supernatant was freeze dried in vacuum to obtain a black powder of ti3c2 the powder was stored in a vacuum and dry environment for use in the next step 2 2 2 preparation of tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 according to previous studies han et al 2020 bulk c3n4 was fabricated by calcining thiourea powders at 550 for 5 h with a heating rate of 2 5 min in a muffle furnace for a typical synthesis of tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 photocatalysts a composite with a mass ratio of ti3c2 to c3n4 of 1 to 10 was added to an agate mortar containing a certain amount of alcohol and was fully ground subsequently the composite was calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 5 min when cooled to room temperature the composite was obtained and stored in the dark 2 2 3 preparation of pva hydrogel and tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 pva ttcp hydrogel in a typical synthesis process tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 0 175 g glutaraldehyde 125 μl 50 wt aqueous solution and hcl 250 μl 2 m were added to 5 ml of 7 5 wt pva solution and gelation was performed for 24 h afterward the hydrogel was immersed in di water for 24 h to remove impurities the pure hydrogel was frozen in a refrigerator at a temperature of 20 and thawed in di water at room temperature the cycle of freezing and thawing was repeated 10 times in addition to compare the evaporation rates and voc degradation abilities of different composite hydrogels pure pva hydrogel pure tio2 ti3c2 pva hydrogel and pure c3n4 pva hydrogel were prepared by the same method and labeled pva hydrogel tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel and c3n4 hydrogel respectively 2 2 4 characterization the details of characterization are shown in s1 supplementary materials 2 3 solar evaporation experiment the solar evaporation experiments were performed by a solar simulator pls sxe300d perfect light technology co ltd china with an am 1 5 g optical filter the solar radiation was recorded by irradiatometer fa z photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university unless otherwise specified each solar evaporation experiment was measured under an intensity of 1 kw m 2 corresponding to 1 sun illumination thermal images were captured by an infrared camera e4 flir the bulk water temperature was measured by digital temperature measuring instrument ut320 uni t all experiments were carried out under ambient conditions with a humidity of approximately 30 and a room temperature of approximately 25 c in addition the calculation method of water evaporation rate is shown in s2 supplementary materials and the details of outdoor evaporation experiment are shown in s3 supplementary materials 2 4 voc removal experiment simulated voc removal tests were carried out in a laboratory made device as shown in fig 1 vapor was easily condensed onto the quartz wall of the device and transformed into a liquid which was collected for further study phenol was used as a model voc to evaluate the photocatalysis efficiency because it is relatively common in the environment after 2 h of adsorption desorption equilibrium in the dark the degradation efficiencies of all samples were measured in this study three different kinds of water sea water lake water and reclaimed water from the bohai sea baiyang lake and the water treatment station of the school respectively were used as the source water and a series of experiments were conducted under the illumination of simulated sunlight to assess the potential of ttcp hydrogels to be translated into practical applications 3 results and discussion 3 1 design strategy of the bionic system this study was inspired by water transportation enzyme catalysis and water evaporation and a bionic solar driven interfacial evaporation system based on ttcp hydrogel was developed fig 1 which has the dual functions of water evaporation and photocatalysis in this system the porous network structure of the hydrogel imitated vessels in plants which not only realized the function of water transportation but also increased exposure between contaminants and catalysts thus reducing the mass transfer limitation ti3c2 realized the function of water evaporation due to its excellent light absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency surprisingly the calcined ti3c2 formed tio2 ti3c2 which formed a heterojunction with c3n4 enhancing the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers furthermore the combination of ti3c2 and c3n4 enhances the light absorption of photocatalysis and the thermal conversion by ti3c2 promotes photocatalytic activity so the combination of ti3c2 and c3n4 effectively realizes the enzyme catalysis function in addition instead of direct contact between the evaporator ttcp hydrogel and bulk water polystyrene foam was used as an insulation layer to enhance the localized thermal effect which limits the thermal properties around the ttcp hydrogel to promote water evaporation performance and photocatalytic activity with the cotton core as the root water is continuously transported to the ttcp hydrogel through capillary action to provide sufficient water while reducing heat conduction loss 3 2 characterization of photothermal photocatalytic materials 3 2 1 morphology and composition of photothermal photocatalytic materials benefitting from the highly branched micron sized vessels of plants water and salts can be efficiently transported into plants fig 1 undoubtedly plants provide useful guidance regarding the construction of bionic micropores which may bring remarkable water transport enhancement reduce the mass transfer resistance and utilize photogenerated charges pva clusters are formed when dispersed in water after gelation the clusters formed the skeleton of the ttcp hydrogel with micron channels and the spacing among these clusters formed the internal gaps zhou et al 2019 the prepared hydrogel was black fig 2 d scanning electron microscopy sem showed that the ttcp hydrogel had wide pores with diameters of 5 μm fig 2 a the pores enhanced water evaporation by facilitating water transportation via capillary flow in addition the hydrogel porous network structure of simulated water transportation not only provides micron pores for the rapid mass transfer of pollutants but also abundant active sites for degradation zhang et al 2022 to simulate the enzyme catalysis and water evaporation processes of plants photocatalyst c3n4 and photothermal conversion material ti3c2 were calcined together to form a compound as shown in fig 2 b c3n4 contains two characteristic peaks at 2θ 13 1 and 27 5 the peaks at 8 5 18 6 28 0 41 9 and 60 7 were attributed to ti3c2 naguib et al 2011 which were indexed as 0 0 2 0 0 4 0 0 6 2 2 0 and 1 1 0 respectively interestingly some of the ti3c2 diffraction peaks disappeared and new peaks appeared after calcination the peaks at 2θ 25 3 37 7 48 0 53 9 55 1 and 62 7 were indexed as 1 0 1 0 0 4 2 0 0 1 0 5 2 1 1 and 2 0 4 respectively corresponding to the characteristic peaks of anatase tio2 jcpds no 21 1272 this result indicated that ti3c2 partially converted into tio2 wang et al 2013 in addition no other xrd peaks were found in the ttcp hydrogel sample except the specific peaks of c3n4 ti3c2 and tio2 as depicted in fig 2 c in the ftir spectrum of the pva hydrogel the peak at 1093 cm 1 is caused by the stretching vibration of co and is a characteristic peak of pva for c3n4 hydrogel the peaks at approximately 790 cm 1 correspond to the stretching of the triazine ring in c3n4 and the peaks range from 1200 to 1700 are mainly caused by the heptazine heterocyclic ring stretching vibration the peak at 3140 cm 1 may be attributed to the stretching vibration of oh of the adsorbing water molecules on the sample surface the ttcp hydrogel spectrum still appeared the same as the spectrum of the c3n4 hydrogel demonstrating that c3n4 was successfully loaded in the ttcp hydrogel the above results indicated that tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 were successfully loaded onto the pva hydrogel and these results are consistent with those of eds in conclusion we successfully prepared a bionic ttcp hydrogel with water transportation enzyme catalysis and water evaporation 3 2 2 solar absorption and photothermal conversion properties of photothermal photocatalytic materials in the process of solar vapor generation broadband solar absorption is a prerequisite for efficient solar to vapor conversion fig 2 g depicts the solar absorption spectra of ttcp tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 and pva hydrogels in the wavelength range of 200 2500 nm across the solar spectrum the absorption of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel was 90 6 while that of the ttcp hydrogel was 86 8 however the solar absorption rates of the tio2 ti3c2 and ttcp hydrogels were much higher than those of pva hydrogels 12 1 and c3n4 hydrogels 9 33 these results indicated that the addition of tio2 ti3c2 improved the light absorption of c3n4 which was attributed not only to the excellent solar absorption of tio2 ti3c2 but also to the porous structure of the hydrogel when incident light reached the hydrogel it was trapped in the porous channels of the hydrogel and then absorbed through multiple internal reflections resulting in broadband solar absorption such excellent broadband solar absorption makes ttcp hydrogels promising candidate materials for solar vapor generation in addition to broadband solar absorption materials also need to have efficient photothermal conversion properties to achieve efficient solar vapor generation the photothermal conversion performance of hydrogels was investigated using an infrared ir camera fig 2 f shows the temperature change of the sample surface with time under illumination the ttcp hydrogel surface temperature rose rapidly from room temperature to 39 4 in 10 min and ultimately fluctuated at 39 for comparison the thermal responses of the tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 and pva hydrogels were examined under the same conditions the stable state temperature 41 c on the surface of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel is very close to that of the ttcp hydrogel 39 4 c which indicates that the photothermal conversion capabilities of both are very similar in addition the average surface temperature of the pva hydrogel under simulated sunlight decreased to 20 c which may be caused by the heat dissipation caused by water evaporation these results are consistent with those of the uv vis drs experiment although the broadband solar absorption capability of the ttcp hydrogel is not as good as that of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel the small temperature difference between the two indicates that the ttcp hydrogel can still efficiently absorb solar energy and convert it into thermal energy therefore more water could be evaporated to generate vapor not only owing to the excellent broadband solar absorption capability but also due to the outstanding photothermal conversion ability of the ttcp hydrogel 3 2 3 high electron transfer performance for voc degradation the separation performance of photocarriers could reflect the performance of the photocatalysts that is the higher the separation efficiency of photocarriers is the better the photocatalytic performance we studied the separation performance of photocarriers in samples by transient photocurrent response electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and photoluminescence pl tests as shown in fig 2 h the photocurrent value of the ttcp hydrogel was 2 92 times higher than that of the c3n4 hydrogel and 9 61 times higher than that of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel the lower the recombination of photocarriers is the higher the photocurrent the photocurrent results indicated that the ttcp hydrogel has a strong photocarrier separation efficiency wu et al 2020 eis was also used to evaluate the interfacial charge transfer resistance the smaller the semicircle radius is the lower the charge transfer resistance and the higher the charge transfer efficiency liu et al 2019 as shown in fig 2 i the radius of the ttcp hydrogel is significantly smaller than those of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel and c3n4 hydrogel indicating that the ttcp hydrogel has the lowest charge transfer resistance and the highest separation efficiency of photocarriers to gain further insight into the separation of photocarriers pl spectroscopy was performed under excitation light at 420 nm in general the weaker the emission intensity is the higher the photogenerated electron hole pair separation efficiency as shown in fig 2 j the fluorescence emission intensity of the ttcp hydrogel was weaker than those of the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel and c3n4 hydrogel indicating that the ttcp hydrogel effectively suppressed the recombination rate of the higher photogenerated electron hole pairs xu et al 2018 combining the above results it can be concluded that the ttcp hydrogel has a high electron hole pair separation efficiency indicating that the coupling of tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated carriers thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity 3 3 simulated solar water evaporation and voc removal 3 3 1 simulated solar water evaporation to study the solar water evaporation performance of the ttcp hydrogel experiments were performed under the irradiation of simulated sunlight 1 kw m 2 the mass change of water was recorded in situ to obtain the mass change of vapor fig 3 a it was observed that a low vapor generation amount 0 27 kg m 2 was obtained when water was under light in the presence of the ttcp hydrogel the vapor generation amount 1 54 kg m 2 was greatly enhanced under the same conditions which was 1 1 and 2 0 fold higher than those of the c3n4 and pva hydrogels respectively it should be pointed out that the tio2 ti3c2 hydrogel presented the highest water evaporation amount 1 80 kg m 2 among all the materials these results can be attributed to the light absorption ability of materials in the wavelength range from 200 to 2500 nm across the solar spectrum and their photothermal conversion ability in addition the evaporation efficiency ηsolar was calculated by the following equation eq 1 li et al 2020 1 η s o l a r m e v a p h l v c o p t q i where mevap is the net mass flux per unit area hl v is the total enthalpy change of the liquid vapor change of water copt qi is the power density of solar illumination 1 kw m 2 for the ttcp system the vapor temperature is 32 2 the bulk water temperature is 26 and its corresponding total enthalpy is approximately 2575 kj kg 1 thus the practical solar evaporation efficiency was calculated as 84 1 fig 3 b indicating high efficiency solar driven interfacial evaporation of ttcp an energy balance analysis of ttcp was conducted more details regarding the heat loss calculation are available in s4 supplementary materials the theoretical evaporation efficiency is 83 6 fig 3 c the practical and theoretical evaporation efficiencies are very close confirming that a solar evaporation efficiency of 84 1 can be achieved in addition the thermal conductivity of ttcp hydrogel was 0 364 w m k details were shown in s6 supplementary materials 3 3 2 voc removal performance and mechanism with simulated sunlight 3 3 2 1 voc degradation performance and contribution of active species the photothermal photocatalytic material possessed excellent photocatalytic activity and therefore could remove vocs effectively during evaporation to demonstrate the photocatalytic performance of the ttcp hydrogel under different voc concentrations phenol at different concentrations 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l was used as the source water the green column of fig 4 a shows that the toc concentrations in distilled water directly evaporated without photothermal photocatalysis material ttcp hydrogel were 106 108 117 121 and 116 of the source water with concentrations of 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l respectively all of these results showed that vocs cannot be directly removed during the solar evaporation but are instead easily concentrated and collected in distilled water which demonstrated that vocs could be a potential problem for solar water evaporation if source water is contaminated by vocs fig 4 a shows that the toc concentrations in distilled water evaporated by photothermal photocatalysis material ttcp hydrogel are much lower than those in the source water the removal efficiencies were approximately 100 83 4 84 1 78 6 and 69 4 under source water phenol concentrations of 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l respectively these results indicated that the ttcp hydrogel can remove vocs efficiently even at high concentrations shi et al 2019 fig 4 b shows the toc concentrations of distilled water for pva tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 and ttcp hydrogels with a phenol concentration of 10 mg l in the source water the toc concentration 9 4 mg l of distilled water with pva is higher than that of the source water 7 7 mg l indicating that vocs were concentrated in distilled water because pva hydrogel cannot remove vocs the toc concentrations of distilled water with tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 and ttcp hydrogels are 6 7 2 1 and 1 2 mg l respectively which are lower than that of the source water proving that vocs are removed by photocatalysis obviously the ttcp hydrogel showed the highest removal capacity 84 4 after 1 h light illumination for illustrating the stability of evaporator ten cycle experiments on the ttcp hydrogel were carried out after ten cycles the evaporation rate and voc degradation efficiency toward 10 mg l phenol source water stayed over 1 47 kg m 2 h 1 and 77 respectively indicating the good recyclability and long term stability of the ttcp hydrogel fig s2 supplementary materials in addition increasing the amount of ti3c2 resulted in a lower degradation efficiency indicating that the optimal ratio of tio2 ti3c2 to c3n4 was 1 10 fig s6 supplementary materials to determine the active species during the photocatalysis degradation process radical scavenging experiments were carried out by adding an h scavenger ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta 2na radical oh scavenger tertiary butyl alcohol tba radical o2 scavenger p benzoquinone p bq and 1o2 scavenger sodium azide nan3 as presented in fig 4 c the photocatalysis degradation efficiency significantly decreased after the addition of p bq and nan3 which suggests that radical o2 and 1o2 are the main oxidizing species for the ttcp hydrogel the addition of edta 2na and tba had little effect on the photocatalysis degradation efficiency implying that h and oh were involved in the voc degradation process and played auxiliary roles therefore the results show that four active species contribute to voc degradation and the contribution order of the four active species is o2 1o2 oh h fig 4 d to further confirm the presence of four active species during the photocatalysis degradation process esr spin trapping with dmpo temp and tpmpo was implemented under 1 kw m 2 illumination fig 4 e shows that ttcp has an obvious tempo h peak under dark conditions and the intensity of this peak decreases significantly after 10 min of illumination this result implies that h directly participated in the voc degradation reaction no obvious peaks of dmpoo2 dmpooh and temp 1o2 were captured under dark conditions but the signals of characteristic peak were captured after 10 min of illumination all these results confirm that the radicals 1o2 o2 h and oh are the main species involved in the voc degradation which supports with the radical scavenging experiments in addition under an illumination of 1 kw m 2 the decay rate of h in ttcp was faster than that in tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 and ttcp displayed a higher intensities of dmop oh and temp 1o2 signals than tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 signals these results indicate that ttcp owns better separation of photogenerated charges efficiency under the same illumination conditions in addition it was clear that c3n4 showed a greater dmop o2 peak intensity than ttcp under illumination the reason for the decrease in radical o2 could be ascribed to radical o2 being oxidized by h to generate radical 1o2 fig s7 supplementary materials pan et al 2019 3 3 2 2 proposed mechanism for enhancing voc removal band structure matching plays an important role in smooth photocarrier separation a suitable band structure can promote the catalytic activity of the photocatalyst to reveal the mechanism for enhancing voc removal of the ttcp hydrogel we conducted mott schottky m s tests to determine the band structure of the ttcp hydrogel as presented in fig 5 a and b the c3n4 and tio2 ti3c2 hydrogels were both confirmed to be n type semiconductors because of the positive slope of capacitance to voltage xu et al 2018 the flat band potentials efb value of tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 can be calculated from the x axis intercepts as depicted in the fig 5 a and b the results were 0 47 ev vs ag agcl for tio2 ti3c2 and 0 94 ev vs ag agcl for c3n4 which correspond to ca 0 67 v vs nhe for tio2 and 1 14 v vs nhe for c3n4 based on the uv vis diffused reflectance spectra fig 5 c the bandgap energy eg value of the composite can be obtained by extrapolating the straight line of the curve slope to the x axis and the results were 3 0 ev vs nhe for tio2 ti3c2 and 2 88 ev vs nhe for c3n4 the conduction band potential ecb value of the n type semiconductor can be replaced by the value of efb value since the two are very closed therefore the valence bands evb of tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 are evaluated to be 2 33 ev vs nhe and 1 74 ev vs nhe respectively according to the equation evb ecb eg yang and wang 2021 these results are similar to numerous previous studies based on the relative positions of ecb and evb in tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 the photogenerated carriers could be easily transferred between tio2 and c3n4by the z scheme given the process for photogenerated carriers in the heterojunction the electrons e of tio2 and c3n4 can both be excited to conduction band cb and thus form equivalent holes h on valence band vb in addition ti3c2 can improve the separation efficiency of e h pairs and enhance the light absorption ability of photocatalysts due to its high specific surface area if the tio2 ti3c2 form a type ⅱ heterojunction then the e in the cb of c3n4 would transfer to the cb of tio2 and the h in the vb of tio2 would transfer to the vb of c3n4 under this circumstance radical oh will not be produced by the system because the standard redox potential of radical oh oh 1 99 v vs nhe is more positive than the vb potential of c3n4 1 74 ev vs nhe pan et al 2019 this result does not match the results of the radical scavenging experiment and esr therefore it is more logical for tio2 ti3c2 and c3n4 to form the z scheme heterojunction rather than the type ⅱ heterojunction it is reported that the fermi energy level of ti3c2 is approximately 0 04 ev which is between the cb of tio2 and the vb of c3n4 liao et al 2020 therefore the suitable potential difference provides sufficient power to drive the electron transition from tio2 to c3n4 significantly improving the separation efficiencies of the e in cb of c3n4 and the h in vb of tio2 wang et al 2016 in addition because the cb potential of c3n4 is more negative than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 v vs nhe the photogenerated e in the cb of c3n4 will react with o2 in water to generate o2 similarly photogenerated h in the vb of tio2 will react with oh in water and then generate oh 1 99 ev vs nhe the radical o2 can be oxidized by h to generate radical singlet oxygen all the active species migrate to the surface of the catalyst to degrade organic pollutants thus the tio2 ti3c2 c3n4 heterojunction follows the z scheme fig 5 d which improves the transport and separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and higher photocatalytic activity is realized furthermore the temperature of the surroundings increases because of the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of ti3c2 the average energy of electrons increases as the temperature increases for the electrons not participating in molecular oxygen activation moa the probability of these electrons taking part in the moa will be increased that is the potential of generating more o2 radicals will be enhanced yang et al 2021 for the electrons that are on the verge of participating in the moa the growing energy of the electrons can improve the interaction between the catalyst and the surface adsorbed o2 and reduce the energy barrier for moa thus improving the ability of the heterojunction to activate molecular oxygen to produce o2 radicals zhang et al 2021 therefore the photothermal effect will further improve the efficiency of the moa to produce o2 radicals and the efficient removal of vocs is realized based on the above analysis it can be concluded that the photocatalytic activity of the ttcp hydrogel is improved not only because the z type heterojunction greatly improves the separation and transmission efficiency of photogenerated carriers but also because the photothermal effect improves the efficiency of generating o2 radicals for comparison table s1 supplementary materials summarizes some reported works of photothermal evaporation combined with photocatalysis and the water evaporation rate and pollutant removal efficiency in this work are superior to most of these works in addition compared with relevant works under the same pollutant concentration and solar radiation the evaporation rate in this study is the highest 3 4 application potential 3 4 1 evaporation of actual water under simulated sunlight to assess the effect of the bionic solar driven interface evaporation system on treating actual water three different types of actual water seawater lake water and reclaimed water were used as the source water fig 6 a shows that the total dissolved solid tds concentration of the three types of water decreased by more than two orders of magnitude which was below the us epa drinking water standard the organic compound compositions in the three types of water are very complex mixing natural and artificial compounds thus the concentration of organic compounds in source and distilled water is characterized by the total organic carbon toc fig 6 b shows that the toc of sea water lake water and reclaimed water decreased by 23 6 60 3 and 80 1 respectively after solar distillation this result indicates that the performance of ttcp is comparable with that of the ultrafiltration technique uf light blue background in fig 6 b for water purification except for sea water li et al 2006 the decrease in the toc removal efficiency in the bohai sea may be due to the inorganic salts at the surface of the photocatalyst which inhibited the approach of organics and thus reduced the photocatalytic activity li et al 2016 to further characterize the types of organic compounds three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra of source water and distilled water were measured fig s8 supplementary materials tryptophan like substances section ii fulvic acid like substances section iii and soluble microbial byproduct substances section iv are the major groups of chemical compounds in the three types of water song et al 2020 after ttcp purification the fluorescence intensity significantly decreased these results indicate that ttcp can efficiently remove organic pollutants such as tryptophan like substances fulvic acid like substances and soluble microbial byproduct substances simultaneously in addition the concentrations of cations na mg2 k ca2 and anions cl so4 2 and no3 were reduced 10 fold to 1000 fold after solar distillation which are levels lower than the salinity levels defined by the u s environmental protection agency epa fig 6 c indicating the excellent desalination ability of ttcp hydrogel in addition ttcp hydrogel has self cleaning performance s5 fig s3 and s4 supplementary materials 3 4 2 evaporation of the reclaimed water under actual sunlight to evaluate the application potential in actual settings an outdoor distillation experiment was conducted in beijing china north latitude of 39 in september 28 2022 reclaimed water was used as the source water fig 7 a shows the outdoor evaporator the solar intensity temperature humidity and evaporation rate are recorded in fig 7 b and c as presented in fig 7 c the evaporation rate basically consistent with the change in the light intensity trend the average evaporation rate was 0 72 kg m 2 h 1 this record was lower than that under simulated sunlight 1 54 kg m 2 h 1 probably because water droplets formed by the vapor get attached to the undersurface of the glass and thus block the sunlight from passing through fig 7 a the toc concentration in the source water was 43 50 mg l after distillation under actual sunlight without ttcp hydrogel distilled without photocatalysis a toc of 18 64 mg l was detected in the distilled water however only 11 21 mg l of vocs were present in the distilled water when using the ttcp hydrogel fig 7 d compared with the toc and tds removal efficiency under simulated sunlight under actual sunlight the toc removal efficiency fig 7 d blue bar slightly decreased by 6 74 while the tds removal efficiency fig 7 d green bar remained almost unchanged 99 in addition as shown in fig 7 e f distillation without the ttcp hydrogel without photocatalysis could remove some of the chemical compounds from the source water but not most of them indicating that some organic matter in reclaimed water is volatile when the ttcp hydrogel was applied distilled with photocatalysis distillation could remove most of the chemical components identified in regions i v which also suggested that the ttcp hydrogel can effectively remove vocs by solar distillation all the above results confirm that bionic solar driven interface evaporation with ttcp is an ideal evaporator that shows great performance not only in desalination but also in voc removal this technology as a small decentralized water treatment method is a good choice for remote and off line areas where access to clean water is difficult to obtain and solar energy is sufficient 4 conclusion by imitating the water transportation enzyme catalysis and water evaporation processes of plants a bionic solar driven interface evaporation system integrating catalysis and photothermal materials with ttcp hydrogel as an evaporator was successfully developed which was used to remove vocs during solar distillation the evaporation rate of the ttcp hydrogel was 1 54 kg m 2 h 1 under 1 kw m 2 which benefited from the high absorption efficiency 86 8 from ultraviolet to near infrared light and the excellent photothermal conversion ability of the ttcp hydrogel the removal efficiencies of phenol voc model pollutant at different concentrations 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l ranged from 69 4 to 100 the reasons for the high photocatalytic activity of the ttcp hydrogel may be as follows 1 the heterojunction improved the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers 2 the addition of ti3c2 enhanced the overall solar absorption performance 3 the porous network structure of the hydrogel accelerated mass transfer and provided abundant active sites and 4 the photothermal effect promoted photocatalytic performance in particular when the system was used to purify three actual water types seawater lake water and reclaimed water with different levels of pollution and salinity under simulated sunlight 1 kw m 2 the total dissolved solids tds decreased by more than two orders of magnitude the maximum toc removal efficiency is up to 80 which is similar to the efficiency of uf technology previously reported and the concentrations of seven ions na k mg2 ca2 cl no3 so4 2 decreased by more than one order of magnitude furthermore the ttcp hydrogel even produced 0 72 kg m 2 h 1 vapor from reclaimed water under actual sunlight average solar radiation of 0 82 kw m 2 although the actual solar radiation significantly decreased by 71 compared with that of the simulated sunlight the toc removal efficiency only slightly decreased by 6 and the tds removal efficiency remained almost unchanged 98
