3415,identification of groups of watersheds with similar flood generation mechanisms and the same hydrological responses is an important step of regional flood frequency analysis which is called regionalization of watersheds a group of watersheds with similar flood generation mechanisms and the same hydrological responses is called a homogeneous region theoretically the homogeneity of regions is a requirement to fit the regional frequency distribution and estimate flood quantiles however it may be observed in some real world cases that a regionalization with a more appropriate homogeneity condition results in less accurate estimates in comparison with a regionalization with lesszappropriate homogeneity in this study a ranking method is proposed to compare various regionalizations and select more suitable ones for regional flood frequency analysis the proposed method is used to identify a suitable regionalization for regional flood frequency analysis by considering the homogeneity quantile estimation accuracy and average region size the method was applied to karun e bozorg basin in the southwest of iran as a case study the results show that the method has an acceptable performance in identifying a regionalization that provides suitable homogeneity quantile estimation accuracy and average region size also the study results indicate that the ranking based on the homogeneity ratio is relatively compatible with the ranking based on the quantile estimation accuracy in addition according to the results the most appropriate regionalization of 41 watersheds in the study area includes 3 regions provided by the combination of the clustering algorithms average linkage and k means keywords clustering flood quantile estimation homogeneity regionalization regional flood frequency analysis 1 introduction understanding hydrological extreme events such as floods can improve the management of extreme events statistical methods play an important role in understanding the behavior of past extreme events and estimating the attributes of future events frequency analysis methods are a type of statistical methods to analyze understand and estimate statistical attributes of extreme hydrological events several researchers have studied the development and application of flood frequency analysis ffa methods e g stedinger 1983 greis 1983 stedinger and cohn 1986 cunnane 1987 potter 1987 stedinger et al 1993 bobée and rasmussen 1995 stedinger and lu 1995 robson and reed 1999 ramachandra rao and hamed 2000 reis and stedinger 2005 merz and blöschl 2008 viglione et al 2013 ffa methods are used to estimate the flood quantiles corresponding to the specified return periods also they can be used to determine the return period of a flood with a specific magnitude regional flood frequency analysis rffa methods can provide more reliable flood estimates corresponding to desirable return periods when the flood data record is not long enough in one or more sites watersheds hosking and wallis 1997 by gathering flood data from several watersheds rffa methods compensate for the short length of the flood data record of watersheds burn 1990 the index flood method dalrymple 1960 is one of the most widely used rffa methods in the index flood method for a homogeneous region a frequency distribution is identified as the regional frequency distribution which is transformed into the site specific frequency distribution of each site of the region by a site specific factor named index flood the index flood is usually a flood statistic such as the mean e g dalrymple 1960 hosking and wallis 1997 or median e g robson and reed 1999 kjeldsen jones 2006 of the flood data record of the site hosking and wallis 1997 hosking and wallis 1993 hosking and wallis 1997 developed a rffa algorithm based on l moments in the index flood framework l moments provide some statistical benefits such as the bias reduction of estimates in addition the l moment based rffa algorithm provides more candidates for the regional frequency distribution because it is not limited to textbook distributions such as gumbel and log pearson type iii and so it has been used in several hydrological studies e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a srinivas et al 2008 viglione et al 2007 sadri and burn 2011 farsadnia et al 2014 basu and srinivas 2014 asong et al 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 rffa methods usually include two main steps the regionalization of watersheds and flood quantile estimation regionalization of watersheds is the procedure of grouping similar watersheds based on their flood generation mechanism and hydrological responses each group is called a homogeneous region and a regional frequency distribution can be fitted to its rescaled flood data according to the studies about the regionalization of watersheds there are two main approaches to implement regionalization of watersheds identification of fixed homogeneous regions and identification of regions of influence or hydrological neighborhoods in the first approach some groups of watersheds are identified as the regions each of them includes some fixed specific watersheds a regional frequency distribution is fitted to the flood data of the region the flood frequency distribution of each watershed is equal to the regional frequency distribution multiplied by the index flood of the watershed in the second approach for each watershed a group of hydrologically similar watersheds is identified as the region of influence e g burn 1990 or hydrological neighborhood e g cavadias 1990 cavadias et al 2001 ouarda et al 2001 of the watershed then the frequency distribution of the watershed of interest is identified based on the flood data of its corresponding hydrological neighborhood cluster analysis methods have been used to identify fixed regions for rffa in several studies because of their abilities in pattern recognition and dealing with different types of multivariate data e g acreman and sinclair 1986 bhaskar and o connor 1989 burn 1989 hall and minns 1999 jingyi and hall 2004 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a srinivas et al 2008 sadri and burn 2011 basu and srinivas 2014 asong et al 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 abdi et al 2017 every clustering method or algorithm has somel advantages and disadvantages which affect the results of regionalization or rffa in some studies researchers applied hybrid clustering methods and algorithms to take benefit of different methods simultaneously and improve performances of cluster analysis methods in the regionalization of watersheds e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a srinivas et al 2008 viglione et al 2007 sadri and burn 2011 farsadnia et al 2014 basu and srinivas 2014 asong et al 2015 ahani et al 2018 ahani et al 2019 while in most rffa studies hard clustering was utilized to regionalize watersheds e g mosley 1981 wiltshire 1986 bhaskar and o connor 1989 burn 1989 burn and goel 2000 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b in some studies fuzzy clustering was applied for the regionalization of watersheds e g hall and minns 1999 jingyi and hall 2004 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a sadri and burn 2011 basu and srinivas 2014 basu and srinivas 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 applying different clustering methods or algorithms for the regionalization of watersheds in a study area may result in different regionalizations also applying a clustering method or algorithm to different regionalization features the features used to evaluate the similarity of watersheds and regionalize them may provide different regionalizations when cluster analysis methods are used for the regionalization of watersheds the cluster validity indices are useful to evaluate and compare the quality of the clusterings and also to determine the optimal number of clusters in a data set in the calculation of most cluster validity indices small intracluster distances the distances between the members of the same cluster and large intercluster distances the distances between different clusters result in the suitable indices values in other words in a good clustering the data points belonging to the same clusters are compacted and the data points belonging to different clusters are obviously separated ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 the distances are calculated by distance measures such as euclidean distance based on the features used in the clustering in many regionalization and rffa studies the clustering is implemented based on some watershed features while the objective of regionalization is identifying homogeneous regions to obtain accurate and reliable flood quantile estimates the homogeneity of regions is evaluated in terms of some regional flood statistics further the flood quantile estimates are calculated based on the regional and site specific frequency distributions and not based on watershed features so if the suitable values of cluster validity indices are not consistent with the homogeneity of regions they are not much useful in the assessment of regionalization of watersheds therefore in addition to the cluster validity indices the homogeneity of regions and the accuracy of quantile estimates have been used to evaluate and compare performances of the cluster analysis methods in some rffa studies e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a srinivas et al 2008 basu and srinivas 2014 basu and srinivas 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 ahani et al 2018 ahani et al 2019 in the common rffa methods such as the index flood method developed by dalrymple 1960 and the l moment based approach developed by hosking and wallis 1993 and hosking and wallis 1997 the homogeneity of regions is assessed according to the measures that are calculated based on the flood statistics of data records in watersheds langbein homogeneity test used in dalrymple index flood method entirely depends on flood data and is not related to the watershed features also hosking and wallis 1993 proposed three heterogeneity measures including h or h 1 h 2 and h 3 to determine the homogeneity of regions in a regionalization the heterogeneity measures are defined in terms of the regional average l moment ratios calculated based on the flood data a region can be identified as possibly homogeneous if h 1 a region can be considered as relatively heterogeneous if 1 h 2 and a region can be regarded as definitely heterogeneous if h 2 hosking and wallis 1997 according to hosking and wallis 1997 h or h 1 has better discriminatory power and usually outperforms h 2 and h 3 if the regionalization attributes such as the number of regions and watersheds assignments to the regions are different the heterogeneity measures h are not sufficient to compare the homogeneities provided by different regionalizations especially when the number of regions in two regionalizations is different and each regionalization is a mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous regions therefore an important issue in identifying the appropriate regionalization is to propose a measure or method to compare the homogeneities provided by different regionalizations ahani et al 2020 and ahani et al 2020 proposed the homogeneity ratio to compare such different regionalizations the homogeneity ratio is defined as the number of watersheds assigned to the homogeneous regions divided by the number of all the regionalized watersheds in a study area in addition inconsistency between the homogeneity and quantile estimation accuracy is another issue related to the regionalization of watersheds it is difficult to determine the best option between two different regionalizations where one regionalization is superior according to the homogeneity of regions and the other one is more suitable in terms of quantile estimation accuracy the objective of the current study is to propose a method to compare various regionalizations and select the most suitable one for rffa by considering different aspects such as homogeneity quantile estimation accuracy and reliability to reach this goal a ranking based method is proposed to identify more suitable regionalizations for rffa the method is applied to a dataset related to the watersheds of karun e bozorg basin in the southwest of iran as a case study 2 methods and data 2 1 a ranking based method to identify the appropriate regionalization in this study a four step ranking based method is proposed to choose an appropriate regionalization among several alternatives the identification of discordant sites or watersheds is a preliminary step that is implemented before starting the main steps in the preliminary step a measure such as the discordancy measure d developed by hosking and wallis 1993 is used to identify the watersheds that are statistically inconsistent with the group of selected watersheds in the study area as a whole for a group including more than 14 watersheds a watershed is identified as discordant if d 3 the flood data record and historical condition of the discordant watersheds must be accurately studied for errors in the recording or transcription of data or sources of unreliability in the data hosking and wallis 1997 there are some alternatives to the discordancy measure d such as the robust discordancy measures suggested by neykov et al 2007 alameddine et al 2010 saf 2010 and abdi et al 2017 2 1 1 homogeneity evaluation in the first step of the proposed method the homogeneity ratio ahani et al 2019 is applied to compare different regionalizations in terms of the homogeneity the homogeneity ratio is defined as eq 1 1 r hom n hom n where r hom represents the homogeneity ratio n hom denotes the number of watersheds assigned to the homogeneous regions and n is the number of all the regionalized watersheds in the study area a region is considered homogeneous if h 1 1 and h 2 1 and h 3 1 after that a column matrix named homogeneity condition matrix denoted by hom 1 is defined as eq 2 to compare m different regionalizations the matrix contains the homogeneity ratios of the m regionalizations 2 hom 1 r hom 1 r hom m r hom m where r hom m represents the homogeneity ratio of the m th regionalization then a matrix named homogeneity ranking matrix is defined based on the matrix hom 1 the homogeneity ranking matrix is denoted by hom 2 the rows of hom 2 are corresponding to those of hom 1 but the values of its elements represent the ranks of the watersheds based on the homogeneity ratio values the greater is the r hom for a watershed the higher is its rank lower value at this point the evaluation of regionalizations in terms of the homogeneity is finished and the evaluation of regionalizations based on the quantile estimation accuracy must be started 2 1 2 quantile estimation accuracy evaluation the second step begins by calculating one or more measures to evaluate the accuracy of flood quantile estimates and then the regionalizations are ranked based on each measure in the end a final accuracy rank is assigned to each regionalization by considering the ranks related to all the error measures in this step some measures are needed to evaluate the accuracy of the flood quantile estimates and compare the results provided by different regionalizations in many studies the differences between the estimates provided by rfa and at site true quantiles were calculated to measure the quantile estimation accuracy e g cunderlik and burn 2006 cunderlik and ouarda 2007 basu and srinivas 2013 basu and srinivas 2014 bharath and srinivas 2015 basu and srinivas 2015 the method is the simplest and most widely used method in the rffa studies in this method the estimation accuracy is evaluated by using some error measures the relative error measures are suitable for the accuracy evaluation because they are calculated over all the watersheds without any problem related to the magnitude and variance difference therefore the measures such as mean relative error mre mean absolute relative error mare and root mean square relative error rmsre are useful for this purpose it should be noted that if some error measures provide the same or too similar results some of them may be skipped to avoid redundancy for the estimates corresponding to the return period t in a study area containing n watersheds the aforementioned measures are calculated by eq 3 eq 4 and eq 5 3 mre i 1 n q i q i q i n 100 4 mare i 1 n q i q i q i n 100 5 rrmse i 1 n q i q i q i 2 n 100 where q i denotes the flood quantile for the watershed i provided by at site ffa and q i represents the flood quantile for the watershed i estimated by rffa when the objective is the comparison of the accuracy of quantile estimates provided by m different regionalizations if there are k measures to evaluate the accuracy given a set of return periods t 1 t v t v for each error measure an error matrix is defined as eq 6 6 e k e 1 1 e 1 v e 1 v e m 1 e m v e m v e m 1 e m v e m v k 1 k where e k is the error matrix related to the k th error measure and e m v represents the value of k th error measure in m th regionalization for v th return period t v the matrix e k includes m rows the number of regionalizations and v columns the number of return periods for example if the error measures mre mare and rrmse are used to evaluate the accuracy of the quantile estimates provided by m regionalizations the number of matrices e k is 3 after calculation of the error matrices an error rank matrix is defined for each error measure which is denoted by er k for k th error measure the dimensions of the matrix er k are consistent with those of the matrix e k er k is defined as eq 7 7 er k r 1 1 r 1 v r 1 v r m 1 r m v r m v r m 1 r m v r m v k 1 k where r m v is the rank of m th regionalization according to the accuracy of the quantile estimate related to the return period t v in terms of k th measure error the higher ranks lower rank values are assigned to the regionalizations with the lower smaller measure errors the rank e k changes in a range from 1 to m then a matrix of the sum of error ranks represented by acc 1 with the dimensions m k is defined as eq 8 8 acc 1 v 1 v r 1 v 1 v 1 v r 1 v k v 1 v r 1 v k v 1 v r m v 1 v 1 v r m v k v 1 v r m v k v 1 v r m v 1 v 1 v r m v k v 1 v r m v k where r m v k is the value of k th error measure for the flood quantile estimate corresponding to the return period t v in m th regionalization for each matrix acc 1 an accuracy rank matrix denoted by acc 2 is defined with the number of dimensions similar to the matrix acc 1 in the matrix acc 2 the element in m th row and k th column represents the final rank of m th regionalization based on the elements of k th error measure in the matrix acc 1 a lower value related to a regionalization in acc 1 results in a higher rank smaller value in acc 2 the ranks change in a range from 1 to m after that the matrix of the sum of accuracy ranks represented by acc 3 is defined according to all the error measures as eq 9 9 acc 3 acc 2 1 acc 2 k acc 2 k which is a m 1 matrix the final part of this step is the calculation of the final accuracy rank matrix denoted by acc 4 which is similar to the matrix acc 3 in terms of the number of rows and columns and the element seats the value of each element of acc 4 represents the rank of the corresponding element of acc 3 in a way that the rank 1 is assigned to the element corresponding to the lowest smallest value of acc 3 and the rank m is assigned to the element corresponding to the greatest value of acc 3 2 1 3 region size evaluation in addition to the homogeneity and quantile estimation accuracy the region size is an important factor in rffa robson and reed 1999 reed et al 1999 burn and goel 2000 the region size is defined as the total number of flood data collected from all the watersheds belonging to a region if a region keeps its homogeneity the reliability of flood estimates increases as the region size increases in other words a bigger homogeneous region makes it possible to provide reliable flood estimates corresponding to the longer return periods burn 2003 westerberg et al 2016 in fact in a regionalization the average region size increases when the number of regions decreases and so the lower number of regions is considered as a positive factor for rffa in the third step of the proposed method for m different regionalizations a column matrix named region size matrix represented by siz 1 is defined as eq 10 where the m th element rs m represents the average region size of the m th regionalization or the number of regions of the m th regionalization 10 siz 1 rs 1 rs m rs m then the region size rank matrix denoted by siz 2 is defined in which the rank 1 first row is assigned to the regionalization s with the lowest number of regions and the rank m is assigned to the regionalization s with the greatest number of regions if there are some regionalizations with the same number of regions their ranks are the same 2 1 4 final ranking after determination of the final homogeneity ranks the final estimation accuracy ranks and the region size ranks the results must be summed up in the final step of the proposed method first the matrix of the sum of ranks denoted by sr is defined as eq 11 11 sr hom 2 acc 4 siz 2 where the element located in m th row is equal to the sum of the corresponding elements in m th rows of the matrices hom 2 acc 4 and siz 2 it is a m 1 matrix see fig 1 then the final rank matrix represented by fr is defined based on the matrix sr in a way that the element located in m th row of the matrix fr denotes the rank of the element located in m th row of the matrix sr in other words the rank 1 in fr is corresponding to the smallest element lower value in sr and the rank m is assigned to the element with the greatest value in sr the regionalization corresponding to the rank 1 is identified as the final appropriate regionalization in the end an overview of the proposed method shows that it is a multi step ranking and minimization method fig 2 shows a schematic flowchart of the proposed method after the four main steps of the proposed method the watersheds assigned to each region in the regionalizations identified as the top ranks are assessed by the discordancy measure d the watersheds identified as discordant may be removed from the regions or moved from one region to another to improve the homogeneity of the regions however it depends on subjective judgment and is not considered as a formal step of the proposed method in this study eight clustering algorithms denoted by al cl sl wa alkm clkm slkm and wakm were used for the regionalization of watersheds the proposed method was applied to all the regionalizations provided by the clustering algorithms al cl sl and wa represent four agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms named average linkage complete linkage single linkage and ward s algorithm respectively alkm clkm slkm and wakm denote four hybrid clustering algorithms including combinations of the four mentioned hierarchical algorithms with the partitional clustering algorithm k means the results provided by the algorithms are analyzed and compared in the section results and discussion for a set of n data points at the beginning of an agglomerative algorithm each data point is considered as a cluster first the two clusters identified as the most similar or nearest are merged to form a cluster including two data points the similarity or distance between any two data points is measured based on a dissimilarity or distance measure such as euclidean distance the process of finding and merging two nearest clusters in each step progresses until reaching a specified number of clusters the difference between the three hierarchical clustering algorithms single linkage complete linkage average linkage is related to the way that they use to measure the between clusters intercluster distance in the single linkage algorithm sneath 1957 the distance between the nearest pair of data points in two different clusters is considered as the distance between the two clusters on the other hand in the complete linkage algorithm sørenson 1948 the distance between the furthest pair of data points in two different clusters is considered as the distance between the two clusters in the average linkage algorithm sokal and michener 1958 the average distance between all the possible pairs of data points in two different clusters is considered as the distance between the two clusters ward s algorithm ward 1963 murtagh and legendre 2014 operates through minimizing an objective function defined as the sum of squares of deviations of the data points from the centers of their clusters in each step of the finding and merging process k means algorithm hartigan and wong 1979 is a partitional clustering algorithm that assigns the data points to the clusters in an iterative process based on the minimization of an objective function more details about the four hierarchical clustering algorithms k means algorithm and the four hybrid clustering algorithms can be found in ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 2 2 study area and datasets karun e bozorg basin in the southwest of iran was the study area of the current research 2 the basin is located between the longitudes 46 47 e and 51 20 e and the latitudes 34 98 n and 37 95 n the total area of the basin is about 59200 km 2 there are two main rivers in the basin named karun and dez which join together in the north of the city of ahvaz and form a river that is called karun e bozorg and flows to the south 42 hydrometry stations and their watersheds in the study area were selected for this study and their annual peak flow discharge data records were extracted from the database of iran water resources management company the average length of the flood data record in the selected stations is about 27 years the value of the discordancy measure was calculated for all the watersheds and one watershed was identified as discordant the discordant watershed and its flood data were not used in the next steps of the study and so the study continued with 41 watersheds in this study eight watershed features including the longitude latitude elevation above the sea level drainage area mean annual precipitation main stream length main stream slope and gravelius coefficient were used as regionalization features the features were selected based on the availability of data and their effectiveness on the flood generation mechanism and hydrological response the particular geographical situation of the study area was an essential factor in choosing the features longitude latitude and elevation from the sea level as the candidate regionalization features the considerable variability of the mentioned features in the study area may have significant effects on the climatological and meteorological conditions of the watersheds and their flood generation mechanisms and hydrological responses in several studies related to rffa the drainage area main stream length main stream slope and mean annual precipitation have been used as the regionalization features because of their important role in the flood generation mechanism e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b srinivas et al 2008 farsadnia et al 2014 precipitation is often the main factor generating floods srinivas et al 2008 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 and so the mean annual precipitation of watersheds was selected as one of the candidate regionalization features additionally the drainage area is known as an important factor in estimating the flood magnitude in some hydrological studies and models hosking and wallis 1997 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 so it is logical to use these physiographic attributes as the candidate regionalization features also the gravelius coefficient gravelius 1914 was selected to consider the effect of the shape of the watersheds on their flood generation mechanisms and hydrological responses in the regionalization the gravelius coefficient is calculated by dividing the watershed perimeter into the perimeter of a circle with an area equal to the watershed area the summary of descriptive statistics of the regionalization feature data is seen in table 1 the logarithmic transform was applied to the data related to the features drainage area main stream length main stream slope and gravelius coefficient to modify their skewness and asymmetry in addition the values of every feature were standardized by applying eq 12 to neutralize the effect of variance difference in eq 12 y ij is the value of the feature j in the watershed i x ij represents the standardized value of the feature j in the watershed i and y j and s j denote the mean value and standard deviation of the feature j respectively 12 x ij y ij y j s j all of the possible combinations of the watershed features with 1 to 8 members were utilized for regionalization watersheds so the number of regionalization feature combinations is r 1 8 8 r 255 the number of regions was changed from 2 to 8 since there were 8 clustering algorithms and 255 regionalization feature combinations for each number of regions the total number of implemented regionalizations was equal to 8 1 8 255 14280 3 results and discussion by applying the proposed method to the datasets of the study area 14280 regionalizations were ranked based on their homogeneity condition estimation accuracy and the average size of regions respectively after that the final ranks were calculated by considering the sum of the ranks provided in the last three steps in table 2 ten best regionalizations based on the homogeneity ratio r hom are presented also their ranks based on estimation accuracy average region size and final ranking can be seen in the table as seen in table 2 cl and clkm are the most successful algorithms in providing the regionalizations with the highest homogeneity ratios in addition it is worth noting that the regionalizations implemented by the single linkage sl algorithm and its combination with k means slkm are not seen among the ten best regionalizations based on the homogeneity ratio this is reasonable because according to ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b and ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 sl algorithm tends to form one large region and some small regions it is rarely observed that a too large region satisfies the homogeneity conditions the large region formed by sl algorithm is usually identified as heterogeneous and decreases the homogeneity ratio because it contains a lot of watersheds the minimum number of regions in the ten best regionalizations is 4 furthermore according to the results related to the feature combinations in table 2 the features drainage area a and main stream slope s are included in all of the ten best regionalizations based on r hom it shows the considerable effect of the mentioned features on the homogeneity of regions the three regionalizations with the hr rank 1 satisfy the complete homogeneity condition r hom 1 since the three error measures mre mare and rrmse provided different results and rankings in this study all of them were used to evaluate the quantile estimation accuracy and rank the regionalizations as seen in table 3 the regionalizations provided by applying the single linkage sl algorithm and its combination with k means slkm are not observed among the ten best regionalizations based on the flood quantile estimation accuracy also the lowest number of regions in table 3 is equal to 5 in addition as shown in table 3 the feature main stream slope s is common in all of the ten best regionalizations based on the estimation accuracy this indicates its important role in improving the accuracy of flood quantile estimates eight regionalizations of the ten best regionalizations include only s as the regionalization feature according to the results presented in table 4 wakm is the most frequent regionalization algorithm in the ten highest ranked regionalizations in the final ranking this is consistent with the findings of some studies such as ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b and ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 which suggested the use of wakm as an efficient clustering algorithm for regionalization of watersheds moreover contrary to the results shown in tables 2 3 slkm can be seen as the clustering algorithm of one of the ten highest ranked regionalizations in table 4 further it is found by assessment of the feature combinations in table 4 that each of the two features elevation above the sea level and main stream slope s are observed among the regionalization features of nine highest ranked regionalizations in the final ranking as seen in table 4 the hr rank of the regionalization which achieves the rank 9 is 1 and so it can be considered as an appropriate choice if there is a great interest in the high homogeneity ratio because it provides the complete homogeneity r hom 1 as presented in table 5 there are considerable positive correlations between the homogeneity rank estimation accuracy rank and final rank of regionalizations whereas the values of the spearman correlation coefficient between the region size rank and other ranks are negative the results confirm the general findings presented in hosking and wallis 1997 it indicates that although the lower number of regions is more desirable to provide more reliable flood quantile estimates corresponding to the longer return periods it usually implies lower homogeneity of the regions and flood quantile estimation accuracy considering the positive correlation between the homogeneity rank and the flood estimation accuracy rank and their greater effect on the final rank the correlation between the region size rank and the final rank will be negative figs 3 a b and c show the three regionalizations that achieve the homogeneity rank 1 and the complete homogeneity r hom 1 as seen in the figures it is not possible to separate the regions by crisp geographical borders because the number of physiographic features was usually greater than the geographical features among the regionalization features and so the regions were mostly identified based on the physiographic similarity only in the regionalization shown in fig 3 a the regionalization features include the geographical feature latitude lat as indicated in fig 3 b the regions 6 and 7 contain only 2 and 1 watersheds respectively it is one of the downsides of the increase in the number of regions which results in the decrease in the number of watersheds assigned to the regions the smaller regions contain fewer flood data which is not suitable for regional flood frequency analysis the regionalization with rank 1 in terms of the flood quantile estimation accuracy is shown in fig 3 d there are 8 regions in the regionalization which is expected because the smaller regions are the quantile estimates provided by rffa are closer to those provided by the at site ffa which means higher accuracy however as shown in fig 3 d the greater number of regions results in the identification of smaller regions in a way that region 3 contains only 3 watersheds and region 8 contains only 1 watershed which stands in contrast with the logic behind the regionalization and rffa in addition the homogeneity ratio r hom for this regionalization is equal to 0 71 it means that 29 watersheds belong to the homogeneous regions and 12 watersheds belong to the heterogeneous watersheds it is 0 29 lower than r hom 1 calculated for the three highest ranked regionalizations in terms of the homogeneity complete homogeneity on the other hand this regionalization provides more accurate flood quantile estimates in comparison with any other regionalization the highest ranked regionalization in the final ranking can be seen in fig 3 e the regionalization includes only 3 regions this low number of regions is appropriate to provide more reliable flood estimates corresponding to the longer return periods by rffa further since 30 watersheds belong to the homogeneous regions and 11 watersheds belong to the heterogeneous regions the homogeneity ratio r hom is equal to 0 73 for this regionalization the r hom value is lower than that of the three rank 1 regionalizations in terms of the homogeneity whereas it is greater than that of the rank 1 regionalizations in terms of the estimation accuracy while the regionalizations that achieve the highest ranks based on the homogeneity estimation accuracy or average region size consider only one aspect of regionalization and rffa the regionalizations that achieve the highest ranks in the final ranking make a balance between different aspects of the regionalization and rffa it allows experts to identify several reasonable regionalization alternatives and choose the best one based on their needs and the objective of their studies also they can obtain more appropriate regionalizations by modifying some high ranked regionalizations in the final ranking by spending less time and effort in addition an expert can change the effect of each factor homogeneity estimation accuracy and region size by using a weighting method in the final ranking which assigns the different weights to the different ranks according to their importance if it is not required to consider one of the three mentioned aspects steps in the final ranking based on the objectives of a study the related ranking can be ignored and omitted from the calculations related to the final ranking 4 conclusions in this study a method was developed to compare and rank various regionalizations and choose the most appropriate one the method consists of four main steps including three separate steps to rank the regionalizations based on the homogeneity quantile estimation accuracy and average region size and one final step to form a final ranking each main step consists of some substeps to calculate the ranks the homogeneity ranking is implemented based on the homogeneity ratio r hom while the quantile estimation accuracy ranks are calculated based on some error measures such as mre mare and rrmse for some return periods the average region size ranking is implemented according to the number of regions the method was applied to the data related to 42 watersheds in the basin karun e bozorg in the southwest of iran a dataset of eight watershed features including longitude lon latitude lat elevation above the sea level e drainage area a mean annual precipitation p main stream length l main stream slope s and gravelius coefficient g was used to form 255 different feature combinations with 1 to 8 members as regionalization features also four hierarchical clustering algorithms single linkage sl complete linkage cl average linkage al and ward s algorithm wa and their combinations with k means algorithm slkm clkm alkm and wakm were utilized to identify the regions the number of regions was changed from 2 to 8 14280 different regionalizations were ranked by the proposed method according to the results while cl and clkm algorithms were the most frequent algorithms among the ten highest ranked regionalizations based on the homogeneity the clustering algorithm wakm was the most frequent algorithm in the ten highest ranked regionalizations in the final ranking the features drainage area a and main stream slope s were observed in all feature vectors of the ten highest ranked regionalizations based on the homogeneity the main stream slope s was the common feature in the ten highest ranked regionalizations based on the quantile estimation accuracy in the final ranking elevation above the sea level e and main stream slope s were the most frequent regionalization features in the feature vectors of the ten highest ranked regionalizations three regionalizations with clustering algorithms clkm clkm and wakm and the number of regions 4 5 and 7 provided complete homogeneity r hom 1 and achieved the rank 1 in the homogeneity ranking a regionalization by alkm clustering algorithm including 8 regions was identified as the rank 1 of the quantile estimation accuracy ranking the first regionalization in the final ranking was a regionalization using alkm clustering algorithm and including 3 regions there is a considerable correlation between the homogeneity ranking and quantile estimation ranking consequently a considerable correlation is observed between the final ranking and the two aforementioned rankings in general the proposed method facilitates comparison between various regionalizations and selecting the most appropriate alternative based on the objectives of a regionalization and rffa study it makes it possible to identify and choose a more suitable regionalization by considering different aspects of the regionalization and rffa such as the homogeneity of regions quantile estimation accuracy and average region size also depending on the objectives of a regionalization or rffa study it is possible to add or remove the different factors steps contributing to the final ranking in addition experts can decide to change the type or number of measures such as r hom and mre mare and rrmse used to rank regionalizations based on the homogeneity estimation accuracy and average region size developing some methods to assign suitable weights to the different aspects or factors contributing to the regionalization ranking can be an important topic for future studies in addition the effects of the use of the flood related features and flood seasonality descriptors as the regionalization

3415,identification of groups of watersheds with similar flood generation mechanisms and the same hydrological responses is an important step of regional flood frequency analysis which is called regionalization of watersheds a group of watersheds with similar flood generation mechanisms and the same hydrological responses is called a homogeneous region theoretically the homogeneity of regions is a requirement to fit the regional frequency distribution and estimate flood quantiles however it may be observed in some real world cases that a regionalization with a more appropriate homogeneity condition results in less accurate estimates in comparison with a regionalization with lesszappropriate homogeneity in this study a ranking method is proposed to compare various regionalizations and select more suitable ones for regional flood frequency analysis the proposed method is used to identify a suitable regionalization for regional flood frequency analysis by considering the homogeneity quantile estimation accuracy and average region size the method was applied to karun e bozorg basin in the southwest of iran as a case study the results show that the method has an acceptable performance in identifying a regionalization that provides suitable homogeneity quantile estimation accuracy and average region size also the study results indicate that the ranking based on the homogeneity ratio is relatively compatible with the ranking based on the quantile estimation accuracy in addition according to the results the most appropriate regionalization of 41 watersheds in the study area includes 3 regions provided by the combination of the clustering algorithms average linkage and k means keywords clustering flood quantile estimation homogeneity regionalization regional flood frequency analysis 1 introduction understanding hydrological extreme events such as floods can improve the management of extreme events statistical methods play an important role in understanding the behavior of past extreme events and estimating the attributes of future events frequency analysis methods are a type of statistical methods to analyze understand and estimate statistical attributes of extreme hydrological events several researchers have studied the development and application of flood frequency analysis ffa methods e g stedinger 1983 greis 1983 stedinger and cohn 1986 cunnane 1987 potter 1987 stedinger et al 1993 bobée and rasmussen 1995 stedinger and lu 1995 robson and reed 1999 ramachandra rao and hamed 2000 reis and stedinger 2005 merz and blöschl 2008 viglione et al 2013 ffa methods are used to estimate the flood quantiles corresponding to the specified return periods also they can be used to determine the return period of a flood with a specific magnitude regional flood frequency analysis rffa methods can provide more reliable flood estimates corresponding to desirable return periods when the flood data record is not long enough in one or more sites watersheds hosking and wallis 1997 by gathering flood data from several watersheds rffa methods compensate for the short length of the flood data record of watersheds burn 1990 the index flood method dalrymple 1960 is one of the most widely used rffa methods in the index flood method for a homogeneous region a frequency distribution is identified as the regional frequency distribution which is transformed into the site specific frequency distribution of each site of the region by a site specific factor named index flood the index flood is usually a flood statistic such as the mean e g dalrymple 1960 hosking and wallis 1997 or median e g robson and reed 1999 kjeldsen jones 2006 of the flood data record of the site hosking and wallis 1997 hosking and wallis 1993 hosking and wallis 1997 developed a rffa algorithm based on l moments in the index flood framework l moments provide some statistical benefits such as the bias reduction of estimates in addition the l moment based rffa algorithm provides more candidates for the regional frequency distribution because it is not limited to textbook distributions such as gumbel and log pearson type iii and so it has been used in several hydrological studies e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a srinivas et al 2008 viglione et al 2007 sadri and burn 2011 farsadnia et al 2014 basu and srinivas 2014 asong et al 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 rffa methods usually include two main steps the regionalization of watersheds and flood quantile estimation regionalization of watersheds is the procedure of grouping similar watersheds based on their flood generation mechanism and hydrological responses each group is called a homogeneous region and a regional frequency distribution can be fitted to its rescaled flood data according to the studies about the regionalization of watersheds there are two main approaches to implement regionalization of watersheds identification of fixed homogeneous regions and identification of regions of influence or hydrological neighborhoods in the first approach some groups of watersheds are identified as the regions each of them includes some fixed specific watersheds a regional frequency distribution is fitted to the flood data of the region the flood frequency distribution of each watershed is equal to the regional frequency distribution multiplied by the index flood of the watershed in the second approach for each watershed a group of hydrologically similar watersheds is identified as the region of influence e g burn 1990 or hydrological neighborhood e g cavadias 1990 cavadias et al 2001 ouarda et al 2001 of the watershed then the frequency distribution of the watershed of interest is identified based on the flood data of its corresponding hydrological neighborhood cluster analysis methods have been used to identify fixed regions for rffa in several studies because of their abilities in pattern recognition and dealing with different types of multivariate data e g acreman and sinclair 1986 bhaskar and o connor 1989 burn 1989 hall and minns 1999 jingyi and hall 2004 ramachandra rao and

method or algorithm has somel advantages and disadvantages which affect the results of regionalization or rffa in some studies researchers applied hybrid clustering methods and algorithms to take benefit of different methods simultaneously and improve performances of cluster analysis methods in the regionalization of watersheds e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a srinivas et al 2008 viglione et al 2007 sadri and burn 2011 farsadnia et al 2014 basu and srinivas 2014 asong et al 2015 ahani et al 2018 ahani et al 2019 while in most rffa studies hard clustering was utilized to regionalize watersheds e g mosley 1981 wiltshire 1986 bhaskar and o connor 1989 burn 1989 burn and goel 2000 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b in some studies fuzzy clustering was applied for the regionalization of watersheds e g hall and minns 1999 jingyi and hall 2004 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a sadri and burn 2011 basu and srinivas 2014 basu and srinivas 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 applying different clustering methods or algorithms for the regionalization of watersheds in a study area may result in different regionalizations also applying a clustering method or algorithm to different regionalization features the features used to evaluate the similarity of watersheds and regionalize them may provide different regionalizations when cluster analysis methods are used for the regionalization of watersheds the cluster validity indices are useful to evaluate and compare the quality of the clusterings and also to determine the optimal number of clusters in a data set in the calculation of most cluster validity indices small intracluster distances the distances between the members of the same cluster and large intercluster distances the distances between different clusters result in the suitable indices values in other words in a good clustering the data points belonging to the same clusters are compacted and the data points belonging to different clusters are obviously separated ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 the distances are calculated by distance measures such as euclidean distance based on the features used in the clustering in many regionalization and rffa studies the clustering is implemented based on some watershed features while the objective of regionalization is identifying homogeneous regions to obtain accurate and reliable flood quantile estimates the homogeneity of regions is evaluated in terms of some regional flood statistics further the flood quantile estimates are calculated based on the regional and site specific frequency distributions and not based on watershed features so if the suitable values of cluster validity indices are not consistent with the homogeneity of regions they are not much useful in the assessment of regionalization of watersheds therefore in addition to the cluster validity indices the homogeneity of regions and the accuracy of quantile estimates have been used to evaluate and compare performances of the cluster analysis methods in some rffa studies e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a srinivas et al 2008 basu and srinivas 2014 basu and srinivas 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 ahani et al 2018 ahani et al 2019 in the common rffa methods such as the index flood method developed by dalrymple 1960 and the l moment based approach developed by hosking and wallis 1993 and hosking and wallis 1997 the homogeneity of regions is assessed according to the measures that are calculated based on the flood statistics of data records in watersheds langbein homogeneity test used in dalrymple index flood method entirely depends on flood data and is not related to the watershed features also hosking and wallis 1993 proposed three heterogeneity measures including h or h 1 h 2 and h 3 to determine the homogeneity of regions in a regionalization the heterogeneity measures are defined in terms of the regional average l moment ratios calculated based on the flood data a region can be identified as possibly homogeneous if h 1 a region can be considered as relatively heterogeneous if 1 h 2 and a region can be regarded as definitely heterogeneous if h 2 hosking and wallis 1997 according to hosking and wallis 1997 h or h 1 has better discriminatory power and usually outperforms h 2 and h 3 if the regionalization attributes such as the number of regions and watersheds assignments to the regions are different the heterogeneity measures h are not sufficient to compare the homogeneities provided by different regionalizations especially when the number of regions in two regionalizations is different and each regionalization is a mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous regions therefore an important issue in identifying the appropriate regionalization is to propose a measure or method to compare the homogeneities provided by different regionalizations ahani et al 2020 and ahani et al 2020 proposed the homogeneity ratio to compare such different regionalizations the homogeneity ratio is defined as the number of watersheds assigned to the homogeneous regions divided by the number of all the regionalized watersheds in a study area in addition inconsistency between the homogeneity and quantile estimation accuracy is another issue related to the regionalization of watersheds it is difficult to determine the best option between two different regionalizations where one regionalization is superior according to the homogeneity of regions and the other one is more suitable in terms of quantile estimation accuracy the objective of the current study is to propose a method to compare various regionalizations and select the most suitable one for rffa by considering different aspects such as homogeneity quantile estimation accuracy and reliability to reach this goal a ranking based method is proposed to identify more suitable regionalizations for rffa the method is applied to a dataset related to the watersheds of karun e bozorg basin in the southwest of iran as a case study 2 methods and data 2 1 a ranking based method to identify the appropriate regionalization in this study a four step ranking based method is proposed to choose an appropriate regionalization among several alternatives the identification of discordant sites or watersheds is a preliminary step that is implemented before starting the main steps in the preliminary step a measure such as the discordancy measure d developed by hosking and wallis 1993 is used to identify the watersheds that are statistically inconsistent with the group of selected watersheds in the study area as a whole for a group including more than 14 watersheds a watershed is identified as discordant if d 3 the flood data record and historical condition of the discordant watersheds must be accurately studied for errors in the recording or transcription of data or sources of unreliability in the data hosking and wallis 1997 there are some alternatives to the discordancy measure d such as the robust discordancy measures suggested by neykov et al 2007 alameddine et al 2010 saf 2010 and abdi et al 2017 2 1 1 homogeneity evaluation in the first step of the proposed method the homogeneity ratio ahani et al 2019 is applied to compare different regionalizations in terms of the homogeneity the homogeneity ratio is defined as eq 1 1 r hom n hom n where r hom represents the homogeneity ratio n hom denotes the number of watersheds assigned to the homogeneous regions and n is the number of all the regionalized watersheds in the study area a region is considered homogeneous if h 1 1 and h 2 1 and h 3 1 after that a column matrix named homogeneity condition matrix denoted by hom 1 is defined as eq 2 to compare m different regionalizations the matrix contains the homogeneity ratios of the m regionalizations 2 hom 1 r hom 1 r hom m r hom m where r hom m represents the homogeneity ratio of the m th regionalization then a matrix named homogeneity ranking matrix is defined based on the matrix hom 1 the homogeneity ranking matrix is denoted by hom 2 the rows of hom 2 are corresponding to those of hom 1 but the values of its elements represent the ranks of the watersheds based on the homogeneity ratio values the greater is the r hom for a watershed the higher is its rank lower value at this point the evaluation of regionalizations in terms of the homogeneity is finished and the evaluation of regionalizations based on the quantile estimation accuracy must be started 2 1 2 quantile estimation accuracy evaluation the second step begins by calculating one or more measures to evaluate the accuracy of flood quantile estimates and then the regionalizations are ranked based on each measure in the end a final accuracy rank is assigned to each regionalization by considering the ranks related to all the error measures in this step some measures are needed to evaluate the accuracy of the flood quantile estimates and compare the results provided by different regionalizations in many studies the differences between the estimates provided by rfa and at site true quantiles were calculated to measure the quantile estimation accuracy e g cunderlik and burn 2006 cunderlik and ouarda 2007 basu and srinivas 2013 basu and srinivas 2014 bharath and srinivas 2015 basu and srinivas 2015 the method is the simplest and most widely used method in the rffa studies in this method the estimation accuracy is evaluated by using some error measures the relative error measures are suitable for the accuracy evaluation because they are calculated over all the watersheds without any problem related to the magnitude and variance difference therefore the measures such as mean relative error mre mean absolute relative error mare and root mean square relative error rmsre are useful for this purpose it should be noted that if some error measures provide the same or too similar results some of them may be skipped to avoid redundancy for the estimates corresponding to the return period t in a study area containing n watersheds the aforementioned measures are calculated by eq 3 eq 4 and eq 5 3 mre i 1 n q i q i q i n 100 4 mare i 1 n q i q i q i n 100 5 rrmse i 1 n q i q i q i 2 n 100 where q i denotes the flood quantile for the watershed i provided by at site ffa and q i represents the flood quantile for the watershed i estimated by rffa when the objective is the comparison of the accuracy of quantile estimates provided by m different regionalizations if there are k measures to evaluate the accuracy given a set of return periods t 1 t v t v for each error measure an error matrix is defined as eq 6 6 e k e 1 1 e 1 v e 1 v e m 1 e m v e m v e m 1 e m v e m v k 1 k where e k is the error matrix related to the k th error measure and e m v represents the value of k th error measure in m th regionalization for v th return period t v the matrix e k includes m rows the number of regionalizations and v columns the number of return periods for example if the error measures mre mare and rrmse are used to evaluate the accuracy of the quantile estimates provided by m regionalizations the number of matrices e k is 3 after calculation of the error matrices an error rank matrix is defined for each error measure which is denoted by er k for k th error measure the dimensions of the matrix er k are consistent with those of the matrix e k er k is defined as eq 7 7 er k r 1 1 r 1 v r 1 v r m 1 r m v r m v r m 1 r m v r m v k 1 k where r m v is the rank of m th regionalization according to the accuracy of the quantile estimate related to the return period t v in terms of k th measure error the higher ranks lower rank values are assigned to the regionalizations with the lower smaller measure errors the rank e k changes in a range from 1 to m then a matrix of the sum of error ranks represented by acc 1 with the dimensions m k is defined as eq 8 8 acc 1 v 1 v r 1 v 1 v 1 v r 1 v k v 1 v r 1 v k v 1 v r m v 1 v 1 v r m v k v 1 v r m v k v 1 v r m v 1 v 1 v r m v k v 1 v r m v k where r m v k is the value of k th error measure for the flood quantile estimate corresponding to the return period t v in m th regionalization for each matrix acc 1 an accuracy rank matrix denoted by acc 2 is defined with the number of dimensions similar to the matrix acc 1 in the matrix acc 2 the element in m th row and k th column represents the final rank of m th regionalization based on the elements of k th error measure in the matrix acc 1 a lower value related to a regionalization in acc 1 results in a higher rank smaller value in acc 2 the ranks change in a range from 1 to m after that the matrix of the sum of accuracy ranks represented by acc 3 is defined according to all the error measures as eq 9 9 acc 3 acc 2 1 acc 2 k acc 2 k which is a m 1 matrix the final part of this step is the calculation of the final accuracy rank matrix denoted by acc 4 which is similar to the matrix acc 3 in terms of the number of rows and columns and the element seats the value of each element of acc 4 represents the rank of the corresponding element of acc 3 in a way that the rank 1 is assigned to the element corresponding to the lowest smallest value of acc 3 and the rank m is assigned to the element corresponding to the greatest value of acc 3 2 1 3 region size evaluation in addition to the homogeneity and quantile estimation accuracy the region size is an important factor in rffa robson and reed 1999 reed et al 1999 burn and goel 2000 the region size is defined as the total number of flood data collected from all the watersheds belonging to a region if a region keeps its homogeneity the reliability of flood estimates increases as the region size increases in other words a bigger homogeneous region makes it possible to provide reliable flood estimates corresponding to the longer return periods burn 2003 westerberg et al 2016 in fact in a regionalization the average region size increases when the number of regions decreases and so the lower number of regions is considered as a positive factor for rffa in the third step of the proposed method for m different regionalizations a column matrix named region size matrix represented by siz 1 is defined as eq 10 where the m th element rs m represents the average region size of the m th regionalization or the number of regions of the m th regionalization 10 siz 1 rs 1 rs m rs m then the region size rank matrix denoted by siz 2 is defined in which the rank 1 first row is assigned to the regionalization s with the lowest number of regions and the rank m is assigned to the regionalization s with the greatest number of regions if there are some regionalizations with the same number of regions their ranks are the same 2 1 4 final ranking after determination of the final homogeneity ranks the final estimation accuracy ranks and the region size ranks the results must be summed up in the final step of the proposed method first the matrix of the sum of ranks denoted by sr is defined as eq 11 11 sr hom 2 acc 4 siz 2 where the element located in m th row is equal to the sum of the corresponding elements in m th rows of the matrices hom 2 acc 4 and siz 2 it is a m 1 matrix see fig 1 then the final rank matrix represented by fr is defined based on the matrix sr in a way that the element located in m th row of the matrix fr denotes the rank of the element located in m th row of the matrix sr in other words the rank 1 in fr is corresponding to the smallest element lower value in sr and the rank m is assigned to the element with the greatest value in sr the regionalization corresponding to the rank 1 is identified as the final appropriate regionalization in the end an overview of the proposed method shows that it is a multi step ranking and minimization method fig 2 shows a schematic flowchart of the proposed method after the four main steps of the proposed method the watersheds assigned to each region in the regionalizations identified as the top ranks are assessed by the discordancy measure d the watersheds identified as discordant may be removed from the regions or moved from one region to another to improve the homogeneity of the regions however it depends on subjective judgment and is not considered as a formal step of the proposed method in this study eight clustering algorithms denoted by al cl sl wa alkm clkm slkm and wakm were used for the regionalization of watersheds the proposed method was applied to all the regionalizations provided by the clustering algorithms al cl sl and wa represent four agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms named average linkage complete linkage single linkage and ward s algorithm respectively alkm clkm slkm and wakm denote four hybrid clustering algorithms including combinations of the four mentioned hierarchical algorithms with the partitional clustering algorithm k means the results provided by the algorithms are analyzed and compared in the section results and discussion for a set of n data points at the beginning of an agglomerative algorithm each data point is considered as a cluster first the two clusters identified as the most similar or nearest are merged to form a cluster including two data points the similarity or distance between any two data points is measured based on a dissimilarity or distance measure such as euclidean distance the process of finding and merging two nearest clusters in each step progresses until reaching a specified number of clusters the difference between the three hierarchical clustering algorithms single linkage complete linkage average linkage is related to the way that they use to measure the between clusters intercluster distance in the single linkage algorithm sneath 1957 the distance between the nearest pair of data points in two different clusters is considered as the distance between the two clusters on the other hand in the complete linkage algorithm sørenson 1948 the distance between the furthest pair of data points in two different clusters is considered as the distance between the two clusters in the average linkage algorithm sokal and michener 1958 the average distance between all the possible pairs of data points in two different clusters is considered as the distance between the two clusters ward s algorithm ward 1963 murtagh and legendre 2014 operates through minimizing an objective function defined as the sum of squares of deviations of the data points from the centers of their clusters in each step of the finding and merging process k means algorithm hartigan and wong 1979 is a partitional clustering algorithm that assigns the data points to the clusters in an iterative process based on the minimization of an objective function more details about the four hierarchical clustering algorithms k means algorithm and the four hybrid clustering algorithms can be found in ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 2 2 study area and datasets karun e bozorg basin in the southwest of iran was the study area of the current research 2 the basin is located between the longitudes 46 47 e and 51 20 e and the latitudes 34 98 n and 37 95 n the total area of the basin is about 59200 km 2 there are two main rivers in the basin named karun and dez which join together in the north of the city of ahvaz and form a river that is called karun e bozorg and flows to the south 42 hydrometry stations and their watersheds in the study area were selected for this study and their annual peak flow discharge data records were extracted from the database of iran water resources management company the average length of the flood data record in the selected stations is about 27 years the value of the discordancy measure was calculated for all the watersheds and one watershed was identified as discordant the discordant watershed and its flood data were not used in the next steps of the study and so the study continued with 41 watersheds in this study eight watershed features including the longitude latitude elevation above the sea level drainage area mean annual precipitation main stream length main stream slope and gravelius coefficient were used as regionalization features the features were selected based on the availability of data and their effectiveness on the flood generation mechanism and hydrological response the particular geographical situation of the study area was an essential factor in choosing the features longitude latitude and elevation from the sea level as the candidate regionalization features the considerable variability of the mentioned features in the study area may have significant effects on the climatological and meteorological conditions of the watersheds and their flood generation mechanisms and hydrological responses in several studies related to rffa the drainage area main stream length main stream slope and mean annual precipitation have been used as the regionalization features because of their important role in the flood generation mechanism e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006a ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b srinivas et al 2008 farsadnia et al 2014 precipitation is often the main factor generating floods srinivas et al 2008 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 and so the mean annual precipitation of watersheds was selected as one of the candidate regionalization features additionally the drainage area is known as an important factor in estimating the flood magnitude in some hydrological studies and models hosking and wallis 1997 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 so it is logical to use these physiographic attributes as the candidate regionalization features also the gravelius coefficient gravelius 1914 was selected to consider the effect of the shape of the watersheds on their flood generation mechanisms and hydrological responses in the regionalization the gravelius coefficient is calculated by dividing the watershed perimeter into the perimeter of a circle with an area equal to the watershed area the summary of descriptive statistics of the regionalization feature data is seen in table 1 the logarithmic transform was applied to the data related to the features drainage area main stream length main stream slope and gravelius coefficient to modify their skewness and asymmetry in addition the values of every feature were standardized by applying eq 12 to neutralize the effect of variance difference in eq 12 y ij is the value of the feature j in the watershed i x ij represents the standardized value of the feature j in the watershed i and y j and s j denote the mean value and standard deviation of the feature j respectively 12 x ij y ij y j s j all of the possible combinations of the watershed features with 1 to 8 members were utilized for regionalization watersheds so the number of regionalization feature combinations is r 1 8 8 r 255 the number of regions was changed from 2 to 8 since there were 8 clustering algorithms and 255 regionalization feature combinations for each number of regions the total number of implemented regionalizations was equal to 8 1 8 255 14280 3 results and discussion by applying the proposed method to the datasets of the study area 14280 regionalizations were ranked based on their homogeneity condition estimation accuracy and the average size of regions respectively after that the final ranks were calculated by considering the sum of the ranks provided in the last three steps in table 2 ten best regionalizations based on the homogeneity ratio r hom are presented also their ranks based on estimation accuracy average region size and final ranking can be seen in the table as seen in table 2 cl and clkm are the most successful algorithms in providing the regionalizations with the highest homogeneity ratios in addition it is worth noting that the regionalizations implemented by the single linkage sl algorithm and its combination with k means slkm are not seen among the ten best regionalizations based on the homogeneity ratio this is reasonable because according to ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b and ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 sl algorithm tends to form one large region and some small regions it is rarely observed that a too large region satisfies the homogeneity conditions the large region formed by sl algorithm is usually identified as heterogeneous and decreases the homogeneity ratio because it contains a lot of watersheds the minimum number of regions in the ten best regionalizations is 4 furthermore according to the results related to the feature combinations in table 2 the features drainage area a and main stream slope s are included in all of the ten best regionalizations based on r hom it shows the considerable effect of the mentioned features on the homogeneity of regions the three regionalizations with the hr rank 1 satisfy the complete homogeneity condition r hom 1 since the three error measures mre mare and rrmse provided different results and rankings in this study all of them were used to evaluate the quantile estimation accuracy and rank the regionalizations as seen in table 3 the regionalizations provided by applying the single linkage sl algorithm and its combination with k means slkm are not observed among the ten best regionalizations based on the flood quantile estimation accuracy also the lowest number of regions in table 3 is equal to 5 in addition as shown in table 3 the feature main stream slope s is common in all of the ten best regionalizations based on the estimation accuracy this indicates its important role in improving the accuracy of flood quantile estimates eight regionalizations of the ten best regionalizations include only s as the regionalization feature according to the results presented in table 4 wakm is the most frequent regionalization algorithm in the ten highest ranked regionalizations in the final ranking this is consistent with the findings of some studies such as ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006b and ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 which suggested the use of wakm as an efficient clustering algorithm for regionalization of watersheds moreover contrary to the results shown in tables 2 3 slkm can be seen as the clustering algorithm of one of the ten highest ranked regionalizations in table 4 further it is found by assessment of the feature combinations in table 4 that each of the two features elevation above the sea level and main stream slope s are observed among the regionalization features of nine highest ranked regionalizations in the final ranking as seen in table 4 the hr rank of the regionalization which achieves the rank 9 is 1 and so it can be considered as an appropriate choice if there is a great interest in the high homogeneity ratio because it provides the complete homogeneity r hom 1 as presented in table 5 there are considerable positive correlations between the homogeneity rank estimation accuracy rank and final rank of regionalizations whereas the values of the spearman correlation coefficient between the region size rank and other ranks are negative the results confirm the general findings presented in hosking and wallis 1997 it indicates that although the lower number of regions is more desirable to provide more reliable flood quantile estimates corresponding to the longer return periods it usually implies lower homogeneity of the regions and flood quantile estimation accuracy considering the positive correlation between the homogeneity rank and the flood estimation accuracy rank and their greater effect on the final rank the correlation between the region size rank and the final rank will be negative figs 3 a b and c show the three regionalizations that achieve the homogeneity rank 1 and the complete homogeneity r hom 1 as seen in the figures it is not possible to separate the regions by crisp geographical borders because the number of physiographic features was usually greater than the geographical features among the regionalization features and so the regions were mostly identified based on the physiographic similarity only in the regionalization shown in fig 3 a the regionalization features include the geographical feature latitude lat as indicated in fig 3 b the regions 6 and 7 contain only 2 and 1 watersheds respectively it is one of the downsides of the increase in the number of regions which results in the decrease in the number of watersheds assigned to the regions the smaller regions contain fewer flood data which is not suitable for regional flood frequency analysis the regionalization with rank 1 in terms of the flood quantile estimation accuracy is shown in fig 3 d there are 8 regions in the regionalization which is expected because the smaller regions are the quantile estimates provided by rffa are closer to those provided by the at site ffa which means higher accuracy however as shown in fig 3 d the greater number of regions results in the identification of smaller regions in a way that region 3 contains only 3 watersheds and region 8 contains only 1 watershed which stands in contrast with the logic behind the regionalization and rffa in addition the homogeneity ratio r hom for this regionalization is equal to 0 71 it means that 29 watersheds belong to the homogeneous regions and 12 watersheds belong to the heterogeneous watersheds it is 0 29 lower than r hom 1 calculated for the three highest ranked regionalizations in terms of the homogeneity complete homogeneity on the other hand this regionalization provides more accurate flood quantile estimates in comparison with any other regionalization the highest ranked regionalization in the final ranking can be seen in fig 3 e the regionalization includes only 3 regions this low number of regions is appropriate to provide more reliable flood estimates corresponding to the longer return periods by rffa further since 30 watersheds belong to the homogeneous regions and 11 watersheds belong to the heterogeneous regions the homogeneity ratio r hom is equal to 0 73 for this regionalization the r hom value is lower than that of the three rank 1 regionalizations in terms of the homogeneity whereas it is greater than that of the rank 1 regionalizations in terms of the estimation accuracy while the regionalizations that achieve the highest ranks based on the homogeneity estimation accuracy or average region size consider only one aspect of regionalization and rffa the regionalizations that achieve the highest ranks in the final ranking make a balance between different aspects of the regionalization and rffa it allows experts to identify several reasonable regionalization alternatives and choose the best one based on their needs and the objective of their studies also they can obtain more appropriate regionalizations by modifying some high ranked regionalizations in the final ranking by spending less time and effort in addition an expert can change the effect of each factor homogeneity estimation accuracy and region size by using a weighting method in the final ranking which assigns the different weights to the different ranks according to their importance if it is not required to consider one of the three mentioned aspects steps in the final ranking based on the objectives of a study the related ranking can be ignored and omitted from the calculations related to the final ranking 4 conclusions in this study a method was developed to compare and rank various regionalizations and choose the most appropriate one the method consists of four main steps including three separate steps to rank the regionalizations based on the homogeneity quantile estimation accuracy and average region size and one final step to form a final ranking each main step consists of some substeps to calculate the ranks the homogeneity ranking is implemented based on the homogeneity ratio r hom while the quantile estimation accuracy ranks are calculated based on some error measures such as mre mare and rrmse for some return periods the average region size ranking is implemented according to the number of regions the method was applied to the data related to 42 watersheds in the basin karun e bozorg in the southwest of iran a dataset of eight watershed features including longitude lon latitude lat elevation above the sea level e drainage area a mean annual precipitation p main stream length l main stream slope s and gravelius coefficient g was used to form 255 different feature combinations with 1 to 8 members as regionalization features also four hierarchical clustering algorithms single linkage sl complete linkage cl average linkage al and ward s algorithm wa and their combinations with k means algorithm slkm clkm alkm and wakm were utilized to identify the regions the number of regions was changed from 2 to 8 14280 different regionalizations were ranked by the proposed method according to the results while cl and clkm algorithms were the most frequent algorithms among the ten highest ranked regionalizations based on the homogeneity the clustering algorithm wakm was the most frequent algorithm in the ten highest ranked regionalizations in the final ranking the features drainage area a and main stream slope s were observed in all feature vectors of the ten highest ranked regionalizations based on the homogeneity the main stream slope s was the common feature in the ten highest ranked regionalizations based on the quantile estimation accuracy in the final ranking elevation above the sea level e and main stream slope s were the most frequent regionalization features in the feature vectors of the ten highest ranked regionalizations three regionalizations with clustering algorithms clkm clkm and wakm and the number of regions 4 5 and 7 provided complete homogeneity r hom 1 and achieved the rank 1 in the homogeneity ranking a regionalization by alkm clustering algorithm including 8 regions was identified as the rank 1 of the quantile estimation accuracy ranking the first regionalization in the final ranking was a regionalization using alkm clustering algorithm and including 3 regions there is a considerable correlation between the homogeneity ranking and quantile estimation ranking consequently a considerable correlation is observed between the final ranking and the two aforementioned rankings in general the proposed method facilitates comparison between various regionalizations and selecting the most appropriate alternative based on the objectives of a regionalization and rffa study it makes it possible to identify and choose a more suitable regionalization by considering different aspects of the regionalization and rffa such as the homogeneity of regions quantile estimation accuracy and average region size also depending on the objectives of a regionalization or rffa study it is possible to add or remove the different factors steps contributing to the final ranking in addition experts can decide to change the type or number of measures such as r hom and mre mare and rrmse used to rank regionalizations based on the homogeneity estimation accuracy and average region size developing some methods to assign suitable weights to the different aspects or factors contributing to the regionalization ranking can be an important topic for future studies in addition the effects of the use of the flood related features and flood seasonality descriptors as the regionalization features on the performance of the proposed method can be evaluated in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

3416,quantifying suspended sediment transport capacity sstc in submerged vegetation flow is vital to predicting the topographical changes of a river channel with vegetation and the effect of ecological restoration projects based on the definition of suspended sediment transport rate sstr and the assumption that the energy maintaining sediment suspension suspension work comes from the turbulence kinetic energy tke of flow two models for estimating sstc in submerged vegetation flow were proposed in this study the sstr based model calculated sstr by taking the depth integral average of the product of local velocity and suspended sediment concentration and dividing it by discharge per unit width the energy based model introduced suspension work to the double averaging tke budget equation as a sink term that is to say the production of tke is used for sediment suspension and viscous dissipation in the open channel without vegetation a fixed proportion of the tke production term is used to maintain the sediment suspension but the proportion falls and is no longer a constant for the reason that the presence of submerged vegetation raises the viscous dissipation term to represent this influence an equivalent ratio coefficient was introduced thus the sstc model was derived then a series of experiments in suspension capacity flow through submerged vegetation were carried out to verify the two models results showed that the two models could estimate the sstc in flow with submerged vegetation well moreover it was found that the suspended sediment is mostly transported by the water flow above the vegetation layer and the proportion of which rises as discharge and vegetation density increase furthermore compared with the bared bed channel the increase of tke dissipation term in submerged vegetation flow leads to the decrease of sstc which is why submerged vegetation promotes sediment deposition keywords submerged vegetation suspended sediment transport capacity sstc suspended sediment transport rate sstr suspension work turbulence kinetic energy tke 1 introduction vegetation is a significant part of river ecosystems and it has multiple ecological impacts such as stabilising river banks lowering water turbidity removing water pollutants and enriching species diversity follett and nepf 2018 liu et al 2021a b liu et al 2020 nepf 2012a yang and nepf 2018 thus vegetation is widely used for river ecological restoration nepf 2012a to ensure the effect of the restoration understanding the influence of plants on sediment transport is necessary katwijk et al 2016 yang and nepf 2018 sediment carrying capacity is an important parameter for quantifying sediment transport which refers to the maximum amount of sediment that can be transported under certain flow and boundary conditions including bed load rolling sliding and saltating close to the bed and suspended load chien and wan 1983 and it can inform erosion and deposition regimes cellino and graf 1999 zhang 1998 this paper studies the suspended sediment transport capacity sstc which is crucial in determining the total sediment transport capacity and the evolution of riverbeds cao et al 2019 li et al 2014 yang 2005 previous research results on the sstc in bare open channels are extensive which can be divided into two types according to their predictor variables one requires local sediment concentration and velocity specifically it is based on the definition of sediment transport rate sstr which is computed as the depth integration of the product of the local concentration and flow velocity such as the approaches of einstein chien and wan 1983 and van rijn 1984 the other requires only flow characteristics to calculate energy such as the approaches of bagnold 1967 and velikanov 1954 celik and rodi 1991 introduced the sediment suspension work term into the budget equation for the turbulent kinetic energy tke according to the viewpoint that a fixed proportion of the production term of tke is responsible for the suspension energy and proposed the formula for quantifying the sstc in open channels without vegetation the two approaches are defined as sstr based and energy based model respectively both the results of the sstr based and energy based models can be uniformly expressed through the depth averaged suspended sediment concentration s vm which is also adopted in this paper presently the relevant research on suspended sediment transport in submerged vegetation flow mainly focuses on the concentration profile and sediment deposition pattern studies focusing on sstc are relatively few the vertical concentration distribution of suspended sediment has been studied from diffusion li et al 2018 li et al 2020b energy li et al 2020a and stochastic theories huai et al 2019a which provide avenues for calculating the sstr huai et al 2021 research on suspended sediment deposition pattern showed that tke plays a decisive role in the suspended sediment deposition or resuspension as the flow evolves through the vegetated region specifically damped tke results in decreasing resuspension and favouring deposition tinoco and coco 2018 2016 zhang et al 2020 two scales of vortices contribute to the tke production which are the shear scaled k h vortex and the stem scaled wake vortex huai et al 2019b nepf and ghisalberti 2008 zhang et al 2020 moreover given the decrease in the turbulence characteristic length scale the dissipation term of tke will increase finnigan 2000 impacting the sstc by changing the fraction of sediment suspension work in tke production in this paper two sstc calculation models based on sstr and energy respectively were derived a series of experiments in submerged vegetated flow under sedimentary and erosional equilibrium conditions were conducted to verify and analyze the two proposed models 2 theory in this part the sstr based and energy based model which are in the form of s vm are derived to remove the element scale spatial heterogeneity with canopies a double averaging method raupach 1982 is used for an instantaneous variable c it is first decomposed into a time average c and deviations from the time average c then c is further decomposed into a spatial mean average c and deviations from the spatial mean c that is c c c c c c we let streamwise and vertical coordinates be x z and the corresponding velocity instantaneous vector is u u w with z 0 at the bed and positive away from the bed 2 1 sstr based model sstr refers to the quantity volume or weight per unit time and width at which the suspended sediment is transported dey 2014 usually it is computed by integration as 1 g s γ s b h u s v d z where g s is sstr in weight γ s ρ s g is bulk density ρ s is the density of sediment g 9 81 m s 2 is the gravity constant h is the flow depth b 0 05 h is the reference level yang and choi 2010 and u and s v are the double averaging local flow velocity and sediment concentration respectively the sstr in submerged vegetation flow can be obtained if the vertical distribution profiles of u and s v in submerged canopy flow are known many related research results on u and s v exist nepf 2012b proposed a three zone velocity model based on her work li et al 2018 simplified it as a two layer model as 2 u u κ l n z z m z 0 z h u u 1 u h u 1 e β l z h z h where κ 0 4

drag coefficient calculated as proposed by etminan et al 2017 a is the frontal area per canopy volume nepf and ghisalberti 2008 z 0 l κ exp κ β is roughness height katul et al 2011 β u u h u h is the double averaging longitudinal velocity at the height of vegetation l 2 β 3 c d a u 1 2 g s c d a nepf 2012b and the concentration profile was derived by li et al 2018 based on diffusion concept as 3 s v s vh z z m h z h h h z m ω s η g s u κ 1 h z m z h s v s vh e ω s η g s β β θ l u h u 1 h h 1 e β l θ z h z h where s vh is the double averaging sediment concentration at a the height of vegetation ω s 13 95 ν d s 2 1 09 ρ s ρ ρ g d s 13 95 ν d s is the settling velocity of sediment in still water zhang 1998 d s is the size of sediment particle and it is the median particle size d 50 for non uniform sediment ρ is the density of water ν is the kinematic viscosity of water η 1 1 56 ω s u 2 is the ratio of sediment diffusion coefficient to turbulence exchange coefficient tsujimoto 2010 and θ c d a 0 03 h h is a parameter related to water flow and vegetation characteristics huai et al 2013 in fact eq 3 reflects the equilibrium concentration by balancing the upward rate of sediment motion due to turbulent diffusion and the downward volumetric rate of sediment settling per unit area parallel to the bed due to gravity and the influence of vegetation on turbulence and thus on sediment exchange is considered by the sediment diffusivity which is expressed as the product of η and the ratio of the reynold stress to the gradient of velocity the detailed derivation can be referred in li et al 2018 therefore the sstr above and below the canopy height represented by g ss and g sv can be calculated by the depth integration of the product of eq 2 and eq 3 as follows 4 g ss γ s s vh u κ h

integration celik and rodi 1991 pointed out that s vm 1 13 g s γ s q where q is discharge per unit width and it is assumed that this equation still holds in submerged vegetated flow thus 5 s vm 1 13 g

energy based model 2 2 1 tke budget for 2d sediment laden flow with submerged vegetation based on the assumption that the energy to maintain sediment suspension comes from tke bakhmeteff and allan 1946 suspension work e is introduced as a sink term into the tke budget in a fully developed steady 2d submerged vegetation flow as celik and rodi 1991 did the rate of work done per unit volume responsible for keeping sediment suspension is celik and rodi 1991 6 e ρ s ρ g ω s s v the tke budget in submerged vegetation flow is raupach et al 1986 7 0 ρ u w u z p shear ρ u w u z p stem z ρ w k

produced by wake vortices which stands for the work done against canopy form drag finnigan 2000 estimated that viscous drag is about 20 of the total drag throughout the canopy thus p stem 0 8 ρ c d a 2 1 ϕ u 3 ϕ π a d 4 is the canopy solid volume fraction d is the tke transport term by turbulent pressure and velocity fluctuations dispersion and viscous stresses which merely redistribute energy inside the control volume and ε is the tke dissipation term if we introduce eq 6 as a sink term into eq 7 there follows for 2d sediment laden flow through submerged vegetation 8 0 ρ u w u z p shear 0 8 ρ c d a 2 1 ϕ u 3 p stem z ρ w k t p ρ ρ w k t μ k t z d μ u z u z ε ρ s ρ g ω s s v e as d merely redistributes energy the integration over the entire depth will be 0 moreover p stem is 0 above the canopy height because wake vortices exist inside the canopy layer as a result the integration of p stem throughout the entire depth equals the integration from z 0 to z h and ε is integrated separately because of the different characteristic length scales of eddies within and above the canopy layer therefore integrating eq 8 over the whole depth and dividing by flow depth gives 9 0 0 h ρ u w u z d z 0 h 0 8 ρ c d 2 1 ϕ u 3 d z 0 h ε d z h h ε d z h ρ s ρ g ω s s vm that is 0 p shear p stem ε e in which means depth averaged value and 10 ε h ε down h h ε up h where ε down and ε up mean the average dissipation term within and above the canopy layer thus we obtain 11 p ε e eq 11 means that the production of tke is divided into two parts which are used for viscous dissipation and maintaining sediment suspension in the studied line respectively 2 2 2 quantifying of depth averaged tke production term as mentioned above the depth averaged tke production in flow through submerged vegetation is 12 p p shear p stem 0 h ρ u w u z d z 0 h 0 8 ρ c d 2 1 ϕ u 3 d z h where the longitudinal velocity profile is still expressed by eq 2 and the reynolds stress decreases linearly above the canopy and exponentially below the canopy this is given by eq 13 li et al 2018 shimizu et al 1991 and is verified by the experiments 13 ρ u w τ wh h z h h z h τ wh e θ z h z h introducing eq 2 and eq 13 into eq 12 p can be obtained as follows 14 p τ wh u s u h τ wh u h u 1 β θ l β 1 e θ β l h 0 8 ρ c d 2 1 ϕ 0 h u 1 u h u 1 e β l z h 3 d z h p shear p stem where u s h h u κ ln z z m z 0 d z h is the depth averaged velocity above the vegetation layer p shear is the sum of the first two terms and p stem is the last term when no vegetation exists eq 14 is p τ w 0 u s 0 h which is commonly used in bared bed channels celik and rodi 1991 τ w 0 and u s 0 are τ wh and u s in eq 14 when h 0 respectively which stand for bed shear stress and the depth averaged velocity in open channel without vegetation 2 2 3 the sstc model in submerged vegetated flow the proportion of energy used to retain the particles in suspension is m i e 15 e m p according to eq 11 we can obtain 16 ε 1 m p combining eq 9 eq 14 and eq 15 the formula of sstc in submerged vegetation flow can be derived as 17 s vm m τ wh u s u h τ wh u h u 1 β θ l β 1 e θ β l h 0 8 ρ c d 2 1 ϕ 0 h u 1 u h u 1 e β l z h 3 d z ρ s ρ g ω s h celik and rodi 1991 suggested that the proportion m was a constant in open channels without vegetation represented by m 0 as a differentiator however finnigan 2000 proposed that the tke dissipation term increases in submerged canopy flow because the characteristic length scale of turbulence decreases when compared to bare bed flow resultantly the ratio 1 m of the dissipation term ε to the tke production term p rises and hence m should decrease when compared with m 0 in the absence of vegetation the dissipation term is 18 ε ρ k t 3 2 l t where k t is averaged tke and l t is the characteristic length scale of turbulence representing the size of the largest eddies or the width of the flow tennekes and lumley 1972 zhang et al 2020b therefore l t 0 h for open channel without vegetation nepf 1999 for the channels covered with submerged canopies a region of strong shear at the top of the canopy generates canopy scale turbulence and the shear vortices penetrate into the canopy layer at a distance of δ e nepf 2012b which means the characteristic length scale of turbulence within the canopy layer l tdown is δ e the characteristic length scale of turbulence above the canopy layer l tup is h h because the shear vortices are limited by the free surface like in non plants channels as a result the depth averaged dissipation term in submerged vegetation flow eq 10 is 19 ε ρ h k tvdown 3 2 l tdown h h k tvup 3 2 l tup h ρ h k tvdown 3 2 δ e k tvup 3 2 h where k tvdown and k tvup are depth averaged tke within and above the canopy layer respectively the depth averaged tke k tv and characteristic length scale of turbulence l tv are respectively expressed as 20 k tv h k tvdown h h k tvup h 21 l tv h δ e h h 2 h the depth averaged dissipation term is expressed mechanically according to eq 18 as 22 ε def ρ k tv 3 2 l tv substituting eq 20 and eq 21 into eq 22 eq 22 becomes 23 ε def ρ h k tvdown h h k tvup 3 2 h δ e h h 2 h as mentioned above the characteristic length scales of eddies are different within and above the canopy layer and the dissipation term is not linear calculating ε by eq 23 can t represent the real tke dissipation and the ratio of the real tke dissipation eq 19 to it eq 23 is 24 a ε ε def h δ e k 3 2 h δ e h h 2 h h k h h 3 2 where k is the ratio of k tvup to k tvdown if there is no vegetation h 0 a will be 1 that s to say tke is basically uniform in no plants channels therefore m is not only affected by l tv but also by a k tv specifically m is positively and negatively correlated with l tv and a k tv respectively it was postulated that m is proportional to l tv a k tv x where x is a constant determined by experimental data to reflect the influence of submerged vegetation on the proportion m an equivalent ratio coefficient n was defined as the ratio of l tv a k tv x in submerged vegetation flow to that in the flow without vegetation which could be described as 25 m m 0 n 26 n l tv a k tv l t 0 k t 0 x h δ e h h 2 h 2 k t 0 a k tv x where m is the actual proportion of e to p in submerged vegetated flow k t 0 and k tv are the depth averaged tke with and without submerged canopies under the same flow conditions respectively if no vegetation exists h 0 a 1 k tv k t 0 resulting in n 1 m m 0 substituting eq 24 eq 25 and eq 26 into eq 17 the sstc model in submerged vegetated flow is 27 s vm m 0 h k h

be calibrated in the following part specially if no vegetation exists in the open channel eq 27 could be simplified as 28 s vm m 0 τ w 0 u s 0 ρ s ρ g ω s h which is the formula of sstc in the open channel without vegetation as derived by celik and rodi 1991 2 3 conceptual diagrams of the process to explain clearly conceptual diagrams of the process of the two models are summarized in fig 1 3 material and methods 3 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out in a glass flume with a rectangular cross section of 30 m long 1 m wide and 0 7 m high the slope of this recirculating flume s f was set at 0 0001 and the opening of the tailgate was adjustable to maintain quasi uniform flow moreover mixers were set up in the reservoir and along the corridor to ensure that the water flow carries sediment evenly into the inlet the model canopy area was 10 m long spanning the whole width of the flume and its leading edge was 10 m from the flow inlet the experiment and coordinate system are shown in fig 2 the origin in the coordinate system was located at the intersection of the leading edge of canopies area and the streamwise centre line of the flume bottom the submerged vegetation was simulated by rigid circular rods and the rods were arranged in a staggered array in perforated acrylic boards with a 1 cm thickness the rod diameter is 0 5 cm and its height is 9 cm but actually the exposed height h sticking out of the sandy bed was variable during each experimental case and the water depth to vegetation height ratio is in the range of 3 5 to 5 to simulate submerged canopies with shallow submergence h h 5 which occur commonly in aquatic environments because of the limitation of light penetration nepf 2012b the canopy density was characterised using the frontal area per canopy volume a and changed from 0 to 2 83 m 1 by changing the spacing between the rods moreover we changed the flow discharge under each vegetation density a total of 13 conditions were constructed and the detailed parameters are listed in table 1 the fine suspended sediments were modelled as plastic model sands whose median size d 50 is 0 238 mm and density is 1 05 g cm 3 in addition the maximum suspension index φ is 0 16 in all cases less than the critical value of 5 for the conversion of the suspended load into the bed load thus sediments were mainly transported as suspended loads chien and wan 1983 3 2 observation methods the flow velocity and suspended sediment concentration were measured using acoustic doppler velocimetry adv 50 hz sontek the sampling and averaging time was 300 s which is long enough to ensure the stability of measurement results based on stable turbulence intensity fig 3 a so we only measured them once and they were all taken at the midway between adjacent cylinders fig 3b labelled as which is the position where the local time mean and turbulent velocity are close to the lateral average chen et al 2013 the velocities and sediment concentration were observed along vertical lines at particular x intervals fig 2 denoted as x 4 6 8 9 8 m respectively and the measured lines extended from 1 cm above the flow bed to 1 cm below the water surface the spacing between two vertically neighbouring measurement points was 0 5 cm in 2 cm above and below the canopy and 1 cm in the rest range along each vertical line the streamwise x lateral y and vertical z velocities were u v w respectively and the instantaneous velocity was decomposed into time averaged u v w and fluctuating u v w components tke was calculated by k t 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 the suspended sediment concentration s v was estimated by using backscatter signals the so called adv amplitude amp in counts by three receiving transducers which is an acoustic method there are also other techniques to measure s v such as bottle and pump sampling optical method and so on and each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages as wren et al 2000 summarized for example bottle and pump sampling measure s v accurately but have the poor temporal resolution optical method is simple and has good temporal resolution but exhibits strong particle size dependency given the acceptable accuracy and good temporal resolution of the acoustic method when compared with the sampling and optical methods the acoustic method was adopted in this study the principle of this acoustic method is that a very short pulse of high frequency sound is emitted from a transducer and sediment in suspension scatters some of the acoustic energy back to the transducer the magnitude of the backscattered signal e g amp is related to the concentration and size of the suspended sediment thorne et al 1991 therefore the key to using this method is the translation of amp into sediment concentration and size wren et al 2000 with known sediment size there are some relations between amp and s v summarized by chanson et al 2008 as li et al 2019 did we calibrated the relation carefully specifically s v is related to the acoustic backscatter intensity hereafter bsi in decibels db and bsi 1 3 10 6 10 0 043 a m p 1 10 0 043 a m p 2 10 0 043 a m p 3 for s v 0 7 kg m 3 log b s i increases linearly with the increase of log s v which could be described as log b s i c log s v f where c and f are constants needed to be calibrated accordingly s v can be calculated in reverse as long as amp is known the relations between bsi and s v of upward a1108 and downward a1111 probe were obtained in fig 4 and the linear relationship was fitted eq 29 to calculate s v in the subsequent formal experiments 29 a 1111 log b s i 1 68 log s v 1 13 r 2 0 99 a 1108 log b s i 1 98 log s v 0 87 r 2 0 98 a pre experiment was carried out a 0 78 m 1 q 30 l s to determine the equilibrium state of sediment transport and the position of the measured section the s v profile was monitored at the same vertical line in x 4 m until the vertical profile of s v barely varied with time the mean relative error of measurements on day 8 and day 9 was about 5 53 indicating that the dynamic equilibrium state of the suspended sediment transport both the concentration profile and the erosion and deposition of the riverbed was obtained after nine days fig 5 which means that the concentration we measured is the maximum amount that the flow can carry then four measured vertical lines of s v were measured at x 4 6 8 9 8 m to determine the position of the measured section fig 6 exhibits that the s v profiles at x 6 8 9 8 m overlap basically indicating the spatial equilibrium state which means the flow is fully developed finally x 8 m was selected as the measurement section in formal experiments ultimately only the temporal equilibrium at x 8 m for each case was monitored which lasted from three days to six days in different cases it lasted more days for a case with new canopy density because that means a total riverbed adjustment from a bared perforated acrylic board to a sandy bed in dynamic equilibrium e g a000q35 the duration was shorter for cases with only changed flow discharge e g a000q40 a000q70 once the equilibrium state had been achieved we measured s v profile and the measured data was used to verify the above sstc model 4 validation and analysis 4 1 validation of velocity reynolds stress and suspended sediment concentration profile model in this section the adopted velocity eq 2 reynolds stress eq 13 and suspended sediment concentration distribution eq 3 models were verified by the cases with submerged vegetation a078q35 a283q50 the mean relative error mre and pearson correlation coefficient cor were used to elucidate the quantitative error between measured data and model results 30 mre i 1 n q i p i p i 100 n 31 cor p q p q n p 2 p 2 n q 2 q 2 n in which q i is the model result p i is the measured result and n is the number of data points cor ranges from 1 to 1 with a positive and negative value representing positive and negative correlations respectively and the closer the absolute value is to 1 the stronger the correlation is 4 1 1 verification of the velocity profile model fig 7 shows the comparisons of the velocity profiles predicted by eq 2 with measured values it is seen that eq 2 can predict the velocity distribution well on the whole with mre varying from 1 71 to 6 14 and cor varying from 0 9927 to 0 9973 table 2 therefore it can be applied to the two derived sstc model 4 1 2 verification of the reynolds stress profile model fig 8 compares the modeled reynolds stress by eq 13 with θ determined by huai et al 2013 with the measured value in the dot dash line it is shown that the model can predict the reynolds stress distribution trend that the reynolds stress reaches its peak at the top of the canopy and both decreases above and below this height however there are large deviations within the vegetation layer which is because the calibration of θ by their data is unsuitable for ours thus θ was calibrated again by the least error squares method using the first five cases with submerged vegetation a078q35 a156q40 it was found that θ 1 67 c d a 0 03 h h in our experiment cases the value of θ by calibration and comparison with measured reynolds stress is shown in table 3 and fig 8 a e in the solid line respectively then the reynolds stress distribution of the rest validation group can be obtained in fig 8 f i in the solid line mre and cor of the validation group are listed in table 4 it is shown that mre varies from 11 68 to 22 10 and cor varies from 0 9720 to 0 9814 indicating that eq 13 can be applied to the two derived sstc models 4 1 3 verification of the suspended sediment concentration profile model during the derivation of the sstr based model the suspended sediment concentration distribution model eq 3 deduced by li et al 2018 was adopted based on fig 9 denoted with dot dash lines eq 3 can describe the trend that the concentration reaches its maximum near the bed and decreases away from the bed however its accuracy is not enough that s because they use the equation η 1 1 56 ω s u 2 1 00 which means that the grain movement generally follows the turbulent current that is basically considered to be correct in non vegetated fine sandy flow wenxin huai et al 2019 and it can also be applied to our cases without vegetation fig 10 because the influence of fine particles greater inertia compared to water may be neglected however the turbulence of water enhances for cases with vegetation table 1 as a result the effect of sediment movement falling behind water particle due to the greater inertia of fine particles becomes apparent chien and wan 1983 therefore it is found that η is less than 1 table 5 in our cases through the calibration of a078q35 a156q40 we adopt the average value of η estimated by the calibration of the first five cases η 0 39 in the validation group the validation results are shown in fig 9 f i and table 6 mre ranges from 4 11 to 21 86 and cor ranges from 0 9898 to 0 9959 which shows eq 3 with η 0 39 can moderately agree with the experimental data therefore it can be used in the derivation of sstr based model 4 2 validation of the derived sstc model 4 2 1 validation of sstr based model the sstr based model eq 5 was verified by comparing the predicted depth averaged sediment concentration with observations across all cases with submerged vegetation a078q35 a283q50 and the calculation results and mre are listed in table 7 according to table 7 it is found that the suspended sediment is mainly transported by the water flow above the vegetation layer with the proportion of the sstr above canopies in the whole vertical line g ss g s being 69 83 86 45 in addition the value of g ss g s goes up with the increase in flow discharge and canopy density which was shown by pies in fig 11 the average mre of the sstr based model is 10 05 and the average cor is 0 9328 the deviation from the measured s vm in table 1 could be attributed to the experiment error or the error of the adopted velocity reynolds stress and concentration profile moreover fig 11 shows that sstr increases with the increase in flow discharge monotonically in all cases nevertheless sstr increases and subsequently drops with the growth of the density of vegetation a and its threshold is 1 56 m 1 c d a h 0 12 as discovered by lawson et al 2012 besides g sv reduces faster than g ss as a increases 4 2 2 validation of energy based model given that the proportion coefficient m 0 in open channels without vegetation is unknown we used cases without vegetation a000q35 a000q70 and data from nordin and dempster cellino 1998 and tinoco and coco 2016 which are summarized in table 8 to calibrate it through linear fitting fig 12 it was obtained that m 0 0 11 r 2 0 99 therefore the energy based model is 32 s vm 0 11 h k h h 3 2 h 3 2 h δ e k 3 2 k t o k tv x τ wh u s u h τ wh u h u 1 β θ l β 1 e θ β l h 0 8 ρ c d 2 1 ϕ 0 h u 1 u h u 1 e β l z h 3 d z ρ s ρ g ω s h where x 1 36 r 2 0 90 which was calibrated by all cases with submerged vegetation a078q35 a283q50 through fig 13 the mre and cor are 9 31 and 0 9053 respectively the mre of modelled sstc by eq 32 is listed in table 9 indicating that eq 32 can predict sstc in submerged vegetated flow well with mre varying from 0 31 to 15 51 in our experiments the tke production p v varies from 0 164 to 0 304 in the submerged vegetated flow whereas p 0 varies from 0 157 to 0 172 when no vegetation exists which shows the tke production with submerged vegetation is more than that without vegetation under the same inflow condition however the measured sstc s vm in submerged vegetated flow is far less than that in cases without vegetation table 1 according to eq 11 the dissipation term with submerged vegetation should rise compared to that without vegetation which is consistent with finnigan s conclusion 2000 therefore the assumption that tke production is used for maintaining sediment suspension and viscous dissipation is reasonable as a result it is concluded that compared with flows without canopies the presence of submerged vegetation increases the dissipative term of tke under the same inflow condition leaving lesser energy to keep to sediment suspended in other words sstc decreases in submerged vegetated flow which is conducive to sediment deposition 5 discussions two sstc models were proposed for low suspended sediment concentration submerged vegetated unidirectional flow in this manuscript the same velocity model eq 2 is used in the derivation of both models and eq 2 is only applied to cases with not very shallow submergence 1 5 h h 5 because the roughness sublayer extends to the surface and a logarithmic structure is not observed above the canopy nepf 2012b it is thought that the two models may be proper only for the depth of submergence being in the range of 1 5 to 5 and all the parameters that occur in the two models are summarized in table 10 for clarity the sstr based model is explicit in the physical sense but not only requires the relevant parameters of flow velocity eq 2 and the reynold stress eq 13 but also the known ratio of sediment exchange coefficient to momentum exchange coefficient η which has not yielded uniform research results at present huai et al 2021 li et al 2022 li et al 2020b yang and choi 2010 and η varies with different sediment particles flow conditions chien and wan 1983 sediment concentration umeyaina 1992 and bedform graf and cellino 2002 liu et al 2021b we obtained η 0 39 through experimental calibration which may not be universal although the hypothesis that the tke is used to carry suspended sediment is introduced in the energy based model sstc can be calculated only with the known flow velocity eq 2 and turbulence characteristics eq 13 and the measured k tvup k tvdown and k t moreover the above models were developed without taking flexibility and the influence of branches and leaves into consideration in our experiment utilizing cylindrical sticks to represent submerged plants it was discovered that the largest concentration of suspended sediment is still near the riverbed but li et al 2020b found that this location is near the top of submerged vegetation whose experiment used plastic plants with multiple branches and leaves therefore ignoring the bending deflection and the influence of branches and leaves may make a great difference to the results by our models the bending of the stem can be reflected by the bending height but how to consider the realistic morphology of submerged vegetation need to be explored further 6 conclusions in this paper models based on sstr and energy concept were derived to calculate sstc in submerged vegetated flow then a series of laboratory experiments on sediment carrying flow with submerged vegetation in their full capacity were carried out the experimental data obtained were used to validate the two models the mre of the two models is 10 05 and 9 31 and the cor of them is 0 9328 and 0 9053 indicating that the derived two models can estimate sstc well moreover the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the suspended sediment is mainly transported by the water flow above the vegetation layer and the proportion of the sstc above canopies in the entire vertical line increases with the increase in flow discharge and canopy density 2 the increased dissipative term of tke due to submerged canopies can promote suspended sediment deposition when compared with an open channel without vegetation the proposed models and experimental results could be helpful to the investigation of sediment transport in channels with submerged vegetation which has fundamental significance for riverbed evolution and ecological revitalization however both the flow and vegetation conditions in natural rivers are complicated owing to non uniform flow and canopy distribution and the real vegetation form which should be studied further additionally the ratio of sediment diffusion coefficient to turbulence exchange coefficient η needs to be explored in the future credit authorship contribution statement zhonghua yang

3416,quantifying suspended sediment transport capacity sstc in submerged vegetation flow is vital to predicting the topographical changes of a river channel with vegetation and the effect of ecological restoration projects based on the definition of suspended sediment transport rate sstr and the assumption that the energy maintaining sediment suspension suspension work comes from the turbulence kinetic energy tke of flow two models for estimating sstc in submerged vegetation flow were proposed in this study the sstr based model calculated sstr by taking the depth integral average of the product of local velocity and suspended sediment concentration and dividing it by discharge per unit width the energy based model introduced suspension work to the double averaging tke budget equation as a sink term that is to say the production of tke is used for sediment suspension and viscous dissipation in the open channel without vegetation a fixed proportion of the tke production term is used to maintain the sediment suspension but the proportion falls and is no longer a constant for the reason that the presence of submerged vegetation raises the viscous dissipation term to represent this influence an equivalent ratio coefficient was introduced thus the sstc model was derived then a series of experiments in suspension capacity flow through submerged vegetation were carried out to verify the two models results showed that the two models could estimate the sstc in flow with submerged vegetation well moreover it was found that the suspended sediment is mostly transported by the water flow above the vegetation layer and the proportion of which rises as discharge and vegetation density increase furthermore compared with the bared bed channel the increase of tke dissipation term in submerged vegetation flow leads to the decrease of sstc which is why submerged vegetation promotes sediment deposition keywords submerged vegetation suspended sediment transport capacity sstc suspended sediment transport rate sstr suspension work turbulence kinetic energy tke 1 introduction vegetation is a significant part of river ecosystems and it has multiple ecological impacts such as stabilising river banks lowering water turbidity removing water pollutants and enriching species diversity follett and nepf 2018 liu et al 2021a b liu et al 2020 nepf 2012a yang and nepf 2018 thus vegetation is widely used for river ecological restoration nepf 2012a to ensure the effect of the restoration understanding the influence of plants on sediment transport is necessary katwijk et al 2016 yang and nepf 2018 sediment carrying capacity is an important parameter for quantifying sediment transport which refers to the maximum amount of sediment that can be transported under certain flow and boundary conditions including bed load rolling sliding and saltating close to the bed and suspended load chien and wan 1983 and it can inform erosion and deposition regimes cellino and graf 1999 zhang 1998 this paper studies the suspended sediment transport capacity sstc which is crucial in determining the total sediment transport capacity and the evolution of riverbeds cao et al 2019 li et al 2014 yang 2005 previous research results on the sstc in bare open channels are extensive which can be divided into two types according to their predictor variables one requires local sediment concentration and velocity specifically it is based on the definition of sediment transport rate sstr which is computed as the depth integration of the product of the local concentration and flow velocity such as the approaches of einstein chien and wan 1983 and van rijn 1984 the other requires only flow characteristics to calculate energy such as the approaches of bagnold 1967 and velikanov 1954 celik and rodi 1991 introduced the sediment suspension work term into the budget equation for the turbulent kinetic energy tke according to the viewpoint that a fixed proportion of the production term of tke is responsible for the suspension energy and proposed the formula for quantifying the sstc in open channels without vegetation the two approaches are defined as sstr based and energy based model respectively both the results of the sstr based and energy based models can be uniformly expressed through the depth averaged suspended sediment concentration s vm which is also adopted in this paper presently the relevant research on suspended sediment transport in submerged vegetation flow mainly focuses on the concentration profile and sediment deposition pattern studies focusing on sstc are relatively few the vertical concentration distribution of suspended sediment has been studied from diffusion li et al 2018 li et al 2020b energy li et al 2020a and stochastic theories huai et al 2019a which provide avenues for calculating the sstr huai et al 2021 research on suspended sediment deposition pattern showed that tke plays a decisive role in the suspended sediment deposition or resuspension as the flow evolves through the vegetated region specifically damped tke results in decreasing resuspension and favouring deposition tinoco and coco 2018 2016 zhang et al 2020 two scales of vortices contribute to the tke production which are the shear scaled k h vortex and the stem scaled wake vortex huai et al 2019b nepf and ghisalberti 2008 zhang et al 2020 moreover given the decrease in the turbulence characteristic length scale the dissipation term of tke will increase finnigan 2000 impacting the sstc by changing the fraction of sediment suspension work in tke production in this paper two sstc calculation models based on sstr and energy respectively were derived a series of experiments in submerged vegetated flow under sedimentary and erosional equilibrium conditions were conducted to verify and analyze the two proposed models 2 theory in this part the sstr based and energy based model which are in the form of s vm are derived to remove the element scale spatial heterogeneity with canopies a double averaging method raupach 1982 is used for an instantaneous variable c it is first decomposed into a time average c and deviations from the time average c then c is further decomposed into a spatial mean average c and deviations from the spatial mean c that is c c c c c c we let streamwise and vertical coordinates be x z and the corresponding velocity instantaneous vector is u u w with z 0 at the bed and positive away from the bed 2 1 sstr based model sstr refers to the quantity volume or weight per unit time and width at which the suspended sediment is transported dey 2014 usually it is computed by integration as 1 g s γ s b h u s v d z where g s is sstr in weight γ s ρ s g is bulk density ρ s is the density of sediment g 9 81 m s 2 is the gravity constant h is the flow depth b 0 05 h is the reference level yang and choi 2010 and u and s v are the double averaging local flow velocity and sediment concentration respectively the sstr in submerged vegetation flow can be obtained if the vertical distribution profiles of u and s v in submerged canopy flow are known many related research results on u and s v exist nepf 2012b proposed a three zone velocity model based on her work li et al 2018 simplified it as a two layer model as 2 u u κ l n z z m z 0 z h u u 1 u h u 1 e β l z h z h where κ 0 4

drag coefficient calculated as proposed by etminan et al 2017 a is the frontal area per canopy volume nepf and ghisalberti 2008 z 0 l κ exp κ β is roughness height katul et al 2011 β u u h u h is the double averaging longitudinal velocity at the height of vegetation l 2 β 3 c d a u 1 2 g s c d a nepf 2012b and the concentration profile was derived by li et al 2018 based on diffusion concept as 3 s v s vh z z m h z h h h z m ω s η g s u κ 1 h z m z h s v s vh e ω s η g s β β θ l u h u 1 h h 1 e β l θ z h z h where s vh is the double averaging sediment concentration at a the height of vegetation ω s 13 95 ν d s 2 1 09 ρ s ρ ρ g d s 13 95 ν d s is the settling velocity of sediment in still water zhang 1998 d s is the size of sediment particle and it is the median particle size d 50 for non uniform sediment ρ is the density of water ν is the kinematic viscosity of water η 1 1 56 ω s u 2 is the ratio of sediment diffusion coefficient to turbulence exchange coefficient tsujimoto 2010 and θ c d a 0 03 h h is a parameter related to water flow and vegetation characteristics huai et al 2013 in fact eq 3 reflects the equilibrium concentration by balancing the upward rate of sediment motion due to turbulent diffusion and the downward volumetric rate of sediment settling per unit area parallel to the bed due to gravity and the influence of vegetation on turbulence and thus on sediment exchange is considered by the sediment diffusivity which is expressed as the product of η and the ratio of the reynold stress to the gradient of velocity the detailed derivation can be referred in li et al 2018 therefore the sstr above and below the canopy height represented by g ss and g sv can be calculated by the depth integration of the product of eq 2 and eq 3 as follows 4 g ss γ s s vh u κ h

integration celik and rodi 1991 pointed out that s vm 1 13 g s γ s q where q is discharge per unit width and it is assumed that this equation still holds in submerged vegetated flow thus 5 s vm 1 13 g

energy based model 2 2 1 tke budget for 2d sediment laden flow with submerged vegetation based on the assumption that the energy to maintain sediment suspension comes from tke bakhmeteff and allan 1946 suspension work e is introduced as a sink term into the tke budget in a fully developed steady 2d submerged vegetation flow as celik and rodi 1991 did the rate of work done per unit volume responsible for keeping sediment suspension is celik and rodi 1991 6 e ρ s ρ g ω s s v the tke budget in submerged vegetation flow is raupach et al 1986 7 0 ρ u w u z p shear ρ u w u z p stem z ρ w k

produced by wake vortices which stands for the work done against canopy form drag finnigan 2000 estimated that viscous drag is about 20 of the total drag throughout the canopy thus p stem 0 8 ρ c d a 2 1 ϕ u 3 ϕ π a d 4 is the canopy solid volume fraction d is the tke transport term by turbulent pressure and velocity fluctuations dispersion and viscous stresses which merely redistribute energy inside the control volume and ε is the tke dissipation term if we introduce eq 6 as a sink term into eq 7 there follows for 2d sediment laden flow through submerged vegetation 8 0 ρ u w u z p shear 0 8 ρ c d a 2 1 ϕ u 3 p stem z ρ w k t p ρ ρ w k t μ k t z d μ u z u z ε ρ s ρ g ω s s v e as d merely redistributes energy the integration over the entire depth will be 0 moreover p stem is 0 above the canopy height because wake vortices exist inside the canopy layer as a result the integration of p stem throughout the entire depth equals the integration from z 0 to z h and ε is integrated separately because of the different characteristic length scales of eddies within and above the canopy layer therefore integrating eq 8 over the whole depth and dividing by flow depth gives 9 0 0 h ρ

the average dissipation term within and above the canopy layer thus we obtain 11 p ε e eq 11 means that the production of tke is divided into two parts which are used for viscous dissipation and maintaining sediment suspension in the studied line respectively 2 2 2 quantifying of depth averaged tke production term as mentioned above the depth averaged tke production in flow through submerged vegetation is 12 p p shear p stem 0 h ρ u w u z d z 0 h 0 8 ρ c d 2 1 ϕ u 3 d z h where the longitudinal velocity profile is still expressed by eq 2 and the reynolds stress decreases linearly above the canopy and exponentially below the canopy this is given by eq 13 li et al 2018 shimizu et al 1991 and is verified by the experiments 13 ρ u w τ wh h z h h z h τ wh e θ z h z h introducing eq 2 and eq 13 into eq 12 p can be obtained as follows 14 p τ wh u s u h τ wh u h u 1 β θ l β 1 e θ β l h 0 8 ρ c d 2 1 ϕ 0 h u 1 u h u 1 e β l z h 3 d z h p shear p stem where u s h h u κ ln z z m z 0 d z h is the depth averaged velocity above the vegetation layer p shear is the sum of the first two terms and p stem is the last term when no vegetation exists eq 14 is p τ w 0 u s 0 h which is commonly used in bared bed channels celik and rodi 1991 τ w 0 and u s 0 are τ wh and u s in eq 14 when h 0 respectively which stand for bed shear stress and the depth averaged velocity in open channel without vegetation 2 2 3 the sstc model in submerged vegetated flow the proportion of energy used to retain the particles in suspension is m i e 15 e m p according to eq 11 we can obtain 16 ε 1 m p combining eq 9 eq 14 and eq 15 the formula of sstc in submerged vegetation flow can be derived as 17 s vm m τ wh u s u h τ wh u h u 1 β θ l β 1 e θ β l h 0 8 ρ c d 2 1 ϕ 0 h u 1 u h u 1 e β l z h 3 d z ρ s ρ g ω s h celik and rodi 1991 suggested that the proportion m was a constant in open channels without vegetation represented by m 0 as a differentiator however finnigan 2000 proposed that the tke dissipation term increases in submerged canopy flow because the characteristic length scale of turbulence decreases when compared to bare bed flow resultantly the ratio 1 m of the dissipation term ε to the tke production term p rises and hence m should decrease when compared with m 0 in the absence of vegetation the dissipation term is 18 ε ρ k t 3 2 l t where k t is averaged tke and l t is the characteristic length scale of turbulence representing the size of the largest eddies or the width of the flow tennekes and lumley 1972 zhang et al 2020b therefore l t 0 h for open channel without vegetation nepf 1999 for the channels covered with submerged canopies a region of strong shear at the top of the canopy generates canopy scale turbulence and the shear vortices penetrate into the canopy layer at a distance of δ e nepf 2012b which means the characteristic length scale of turbulence within the canopy layer l tdown is δ e the characteristic length scale of turbulence above the canopy layer l tup is h h because the shear vortices are limited by the free surface like in non plants channels as a result the depth averaged dissipation term in submerged vegetation flow eq 10 is 19 ε ρ h k tvdown 3 2 l tdown h h k tvup 3 2 l tup h ρ h k tvdown 3 2 δ e k tvup 3 2 h where k tvdown and k tvup are depth averaged tke within and above the canopy layer respectively the depth averaged tke k tv and characteristic length scale of turbulence l tv are respectively expressed as 20 k tv h k tvdown h h k tvup h 21 l tv h δ e h h 2 h the depth averaged dissipation term is expressed mechanically according to eq 18 as 22 ε def ρ k tv 3 2 l tv substituting eq 20 and eq 21 into eq 22 eq 22 becomes 23 ε def ρ h k tvdown h h k tvup 3 2 h δ e h h 2 h as mentioned above the characteristic length scales of eddies are different within and above the canopy layer and the dissipation term is not linear calculating ε by eq 23 can t represent the real tke dissipation and the ratio of the real tke dissipation eq 19 to it eq 23 is 24 a ε ε def h δ e k 3 2 h δ e h h 2 h h k h h 3 2 where k is the ratio of k tvup to k tvdown if there is no vegetation h 0 a will be 1 that s to say tke is basically uniform in no plants channels therefore m is not only affected by l tv but also by a k tv specifically m is positively and negatively correlated with l tv and a k tv respectively it was postulated that m is proportional to l tv a k tv x where x is a constant determined by experimental data to reflect the influence of submerged vegetation on the proportion m an equivalent ratio coefficient n was defined as the ratio of l tv a k tv x in submerged vegetation flow to that in the flow without vegetation which could be described as 25 m m 0 n 26 n l tv a k tv l t 0 k t 0 x h δ e h h 2 h 2 k t 0 a k tv x where m is the actual proportion of e to p in submerged vegetated flow k t 0 and k tv are the depth averaged tke with and without submerged canopies under the same flow conditions respectively if no vegetation exists h 0 a 1 k tv k t 0 resulting in n 1 m m 0 substituting eq 24 eq 25 and eq 26 into eq 17 the sstc model in submerged vegetated flow is 27 s vm m 0 h k h

be calibrated in the following part specially if no vegetation exists in the open channel eq 27 could be simplified as 28 s vm m 0 τ w 0 u s 0 ρ s ρ g ω s h which is the formula of sstc in the open channel without vegetation as derived by celik and rodi 1991 2 3 conceptual diagrams of the process to explain clearly conceptual diagrams of the process of the two models are summarized in fig 1 3 material and methods 3 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out in a glass flume with a rectangular cross section of 30 m long 1 m wide and 0 7 m high the slope of this recirculating flume s f was set at 0 0001 and the opening of the tailgate was adjustable to maintain quasi uniform flow moreover mixers were set up in the reservoir and along the corridor to ensure that the water flow carries sediment evenly into the inlet the model canopy area was 10 m long spanning the whole width of the flume and its leading edge was 10 m from the flow inlet the experiment and coordinate system are shown in fig 2 the origin in the coordinate system was located at the intersection of the leading edge of canopies area and the streamwise centre line of the flume bottom the submerged vegetation was simulated by rigid circular rods and the rods were arranged in a staggered array in perforated acrylic boards with a 1 cm thickness the rod diameter is 0 5 cm and its height is 9 cm but actually the exposed height h sticking out of the sandy bed was variable during each experimental case and the water depth to vegetation height ratio is in the range of 3 5 to 5 to simulate submerged canopies with shallow submergence h h 5 which occur commonly in aquatic environments because of the limitation of light penetration nepf 2012b the canopy density was characterised using the frontal area per canopy volume a and changed from 0 to 2 83 m 1 by changing the spacing between the rods moreover we changed the flow discharge under each vegetation density a total of 13 conditions were constructed and the detailed parameters are listed in table 1 the fine suspended sediments were modelled as plastic model sands whose median size d 50 is 0 238 mm and density is 1 05 g cm 3 in addition the maximum suspension index φ is 0 16 in all cases less than the critical value of 5 for the conversion of the suspended load into the bed load thus sediments were mainly transported as suspended loads chien and wan 1983 3 2 observation methods the flow velocity and suspended sediment concentration were measured using acoustic doppler velocimetry adv 50 hz sontek the sampling and averaging time was 300 s which is long enough to ensure the stability of measurement results based on stable turbulence intensity fig 3 a so we only measured them once and they were all taken at the midway between adjacent cylinders fig 3b labelled as which is the position where the local time mean and turbulent velocity are close to the lateral average chen et al 2013 the velocities and sediment concentration were observed along vertical lines at particular x intervals fig 2 denoted as x 4 6 8 9 8 m respectively and the measured lines extended from 1 cm above the flow bed to 1 cm below the water surface the spacing between two vertically neighbouring measurement points was 0 5 cm in 2 cm above and below the canopy and 1 cm in the rest range along each vertical line the streamwise x lateral y and vertical z velocities were u v w respectively and the instantaneous velocity was decomposed into time averaged u v w and fluctuating u v w components tke was calculated by k t 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 the suspended sediment concentration s v was estimated by using backscatter signals the so called adv amplitude amp in counts by three receiving transducers which is an acoustic method there are also other techniques to measure s v such as bottle and pump sampling optical method and so on and each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages as wren et al 2000 summarized for example bottle and pump sampling measure s v accurately but have the poor temporal resolution optical method is simple and has good temporal resolution but exhibits strong particle size dependency given the acceptable accuracy and good temporal resolution of the acoustic method when compared with the sampling and optical methods the acoustic method was adopted in this study the principle of this acoustic method is that a very short pulse of high frequency sound is emitted from a transducer and sediment in suspension scatters some of the acoustic energy back to the transducer the magnitude of the backscattered signal e g amp is related to the concentration and size of the suspended sediment thorne et al 1991 therefore the key to using this method is the translation of amp into sediment concentration and size wren et al 2000 with known sediment size there are some relations between amp and s v summarized by chanson et al 2008 as li et al 2019 did we calibrated the relation carefully specifically s v is related to the acoustic backscatter intensity hereafter bsi in decibels db and bsi 1 3 10 6 10 0 043 a m p 1 10 0 043 a m p 2 10 0 043 a m p 3 for s v 0 7 kg m 3 log b s i increases linearly with the increase of log s v which could be described as log b s i c log s v f where c and f are constants needed to be calibrated accordingly s v can be calculated in reverse as long as amp is known the relations between bsi and s v of upward a1108 and downward a1111 probe were obtained in fig 4 and the linear relationship was fitted eq 29 to calculate s v in the subsequent formal experiments 29 a 1111 log b s i 1 68 log s v 1 13 r 2 0 99 a 1108 log b s i 1 98 log s v 0 87 r 2 0 98 a pre experiment was carried out a 0 78 m 1 q 30 l s to determine the equilibrium state of sediment transport and the position of the measured section the s v profile was monitored at the same vertical line in x 4 m until the vertical profile of s v barely varied with time the mean relative error of measurements on day 8 and day 9 was about 5 53 indicating that the dynamic equilibrium state of the suspended sediment transport both the concentration profile and the erosion and deposition of the riverbed was obtained after nine days fig 5 which means that the concentration we measured is the maximum amount that the flow can carry then four measured vertical lines of s v were measured at x 4 6 8 9 8 m to determine the position of the measured section fig 6 exhibits that the s v profiles at x 6 8 9 8 m overlap basically indicating the spatial equilibrium state which means the flow is fully developed finally x 8 m was selected as the measurement section in formal experiments ultimately only the temporal equilibrium at x 8 m for each case was monitored which lasted from three days to six days in different cases it lasted more days for a case with new canopy density because that means a total riverbed adjustment from a bared perforated acrylic board to a sandy bed in dynamic equilibrium e g a000q35 the duration was shorter for cases with only changed flow discharge e g a000q40 a000q70 once the equilibrium state had been achieved we measured s v profile and the measured data was used to verify the above sstc model 4 validation and analysis 4 1 validation of velocity reynolds stress and suspended sediment concentration profile model in this section the adopted velocity eq 2 reynolds stress eq 13 and suspended sediment concentration distribution eq 3 models were verified by the cases with submerged vegetation a078q35 a283q50 the mean relative error mre and pearson correlation coefficient cor were used to elucidate the quantitative error between measured data and model results 30 mre i 1 n q i p i p i 100 n 31 cor p q p q n p 2 p 2 n q 2 q 2 n in which q i is the model result p i is the measured result and n is the number of data points cor ranges from 1 to 1 with a positive and negative value representing positive and negative correlations respectively and the closer the absolute value is to 1 the stronger the correlation is 4 1 1 verification of the velocity profile model fig 7 shows the comparisons of the velocity profiles predicted by eq 2 with measured values it is seen that eq 2 can predict the velocity distribution well on the whole with mre varying from 1 71 to 6 14 and cor varying from 0 9927 to 0 9973 table 2 therefore it can be applied to the two derived sstc model 4 1 2 verification of the reynolds stress profile model fig 8 compares the modeled reynolds stress by eq 13 with θ determined by huai et al 2013 with the measured value in the dot dash line it is shown that the model can predict the reynolds stress distribution trend that the reynolds stress reaches its peak at the top of the canopy and both decreases above and below this height however there are large deviations within the vegetation layer which is because the calibration of θ by their data is unsuitable for ours thus θ was calibrated again by the least error squares method using the first five cases with submerged vegetation a078q35 a156q40 it was found that θ 1 67 c d a 0 03 h h in our experiment cases the value of θ by calibration and comparison with measured reynolds stress is shown in table 3 and fig 8 a e in the solid line respectively then the reynolds stress distribution of the rest validation group can be obtained in fig 8 f i in the solid line mre and cor of the validation group are listed in table 4 it is shown that mre varies from 11 68 to 22 10 and cor varies from 0 9720 to 0 9814 indicating that eq 13 can be applied to the two derived sstc models 4 1 3 verification of the suspended sediment concentration profile model during the derivation of the sstr based model the suspended sediment concentration distribution model eq 3 deduced by li et al 2018 was adopted based on fig 9 denoted with dot dash lines eq 3 can describe the trend that the concentration reaches its maximum near the bed and decreases away from the bed however its accuracy is not enough that s because they use the equation η 1 1 56 ω s u 2 1 00 which means that the grain movement generally follows the turbulent current that is basically considered to be correct in non vegetated fine sandy flow wenxin huai et al 2019 and it can also be applied to our cases without vegetation fig 10 because the influence of fine particles greater inertia compared to water may be neglected however the turbulence of water enhances for cases with vegetation table 1 as a result the effect of sediment movement falling behind water particle due to the greater inertia of fine particles becomes apparent chien and wan 1983 therefore it is found that η is less than 1 table 5 in our cases through the calibration of a078q35 a156q40 we adopt the average value of η estimated by the calibration of the first five cases η 0 39 in the validation group the validation results are shown in fig 9 f i and table 6 mre ranges from 4 11 to 21 86 and cor ranges from 0 9898 to 0 9959 which shows eq 3 with η 0 39 can moderately agree with the experimental data therefore it can be used in the derivation of sstr based model 4 2 validation of the derived sstc model 4 2 1 validation of sstr based model the sstr based model eq 5 was verified by comparing the predicted depth averaged sediment concentration with observations across all cases with submerged vegetation a078q35 a283q50 and the calculation results and mre are listed in table 7 according to table 7 it is found that the suspended sediment is mainly transported by the water flow above the vegetation layer with the proportion of the sstr above canopies in the whole vertical line g ss g s being 69 83 86 45 in addition the value of g ss g s goes up with the increase in flow discharge and canopy density which was shown by pies in fig 11 the average mre of the sstr based model is 10 05 and the average cor is 0 9328 the deviation from the measured s vm in table 1 could be attributed to the experiment error or the error of the adopted velocity reynolds stress and concentration profile moreover fig 11 shows that sstr increases with the increase in flow discharge monotonically in all cases nevertheless sstr increases and subsequently drops with the growth of the density of vegetation a and its threshold is 1 56 m 1 c d a h 0 12 as discovered by lawson et al 2012 besides g sv reduces faster than g ss as a increases 4 2 2 validation of energy based model given that the proportion coefficient m 0 in open channels without vegetation is unknown we used cases without vegetation a000q35 a000q70 and data from nordin and dempster cellino 1998 and tinoco and coco 2016 which are summarized in table 8 to calibrate it through linear fitting fig 12 it was obtained that m 0 0 11 r 2 0 99 therefore the energy based model is 32 s vm 0 11 h k h h 3 2 h 3 2 h δ e k 3 2 k t o k tv x τ wh u s u h τ wh u h u 1 β θ l β 1 e θ β l h 0 8 ρ c d 2 1 ϕ 0 h u 1 u h u 1 e β l z h 3 d z ρ s ρ g ω s h where x 1 36 r 2 0 90 which was calibrated by all cases with submerged vegetation a078q35 a283q50 through fig 13 the mre and cor are 9 31 and 0 9053 respectively the mre of modelled sstc by eq 32 is listed in table 9 indicating that eq 32 can predict sstc in submerged vegetated flow well with mre varying from 0 31 to 15 51 in our experiments the tke production p v varies from 0 164 to 0 304 in the submerged vegetated flow whereas p 0 varies from 0 157 to 0 172 when no vegetation exists which shows the tke production with submerged vegetation is more than that without vegetation under the same inflow condition however the measured sstc s vm in submerged vegetated flow is far less than that in cases without vegetation table 1 according to eq 11 the dissipation term with submerged vegetation should rise compared to that without vegetation which is consistent with finnigan s conclusion 2000 therefore the assumption that tke production is used for maintaining sediment suspension and viscous dissipation is reasonable as a result it is concluded that compared with flows without canopies the presence of submerged vegetation increases the dissipative term of tke under the same inflow condition leaving lesser energy to keep to sediment suspended in other words sstc decreases in submerged vegetated flow which is conducive to sediment deposition 5 discussions two sstc models were proposed for low suspended sediment concentration submerged vegetated unidirectional flow in this manuscript the same velocity model eq 2 is used in the derivation of both models and eq 2 is only applied to cases with not very shallow submergence 1 5 h h 5 because the roughness sublayer extends to the surface and a logarithmic structure is not observed above the canopy nepf 2012b it is thought that the two models may be proper only for the depth of submergence being in the range of 1 5 to 5 and all the parameters that occur in the two models are summarized in table 10 for clarity the sstr based model is explicit in the physical sense but not only requires the relevant parameters of flow velocity eq 2 and the reynold stress eq 13 but also the known ratio of sediment exchange coefficient to momentum exchange coefficient η which has not yielded uniform research results at present huai et al 2021 li et al 2022 li et al 2020b yang and choi 2010 and η varies with different sediment particles flow conditions chien and wan 1983 sediment concentration umeyaina 1992 and bedform graf and cellino 2002 liu et al 2021b we obtained η 0 39 through experimental calibration which may not be universal although the hypothesis that the tke is used to carry suspended sediment is introduced in the energy based model sstc can be calculated only with the known flow velocity eq 2 and turbulence characteristics eq 13 and the measured k tvup k tvdown and k t moreover the above models were developed without taking flexibility and the influence of branches and leaves into consideration in our experiment utilizing cylindrical sticks to represent submerged plants it was discovered that the largest concentration of suspended sediment is still near the riverbed but li et al 2020b found that this location is near the top of submerged vegetation whose experiment used plastic plants with multiple branches and leaves therefore ignoring the bending deflection and the influence of branches and leaves may make a great difference to the results by our models the bending of the stem can be reflected by the bending height but how to consider the realistic morphology of submerged vegetation need to be explored further 6 conclusions in this paper models based on sstr and energy concept were derived to calculate sstc in submerged vegetated flow then a series of laboratory experiments on sediment carrying flow with submerged vegetation in their full capacity were carried out the experimental data obtained were used to validate the two models the mre of the two models is 10 05 and 9 31 and the cor of them is 0 9328 and 0 9053 indicating that the derived two models can estimate sstc well moreover the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the suspended sediment is mainly transported by the water flow above the vegetation layer and the proportion of the sstc above canopies in the entire vertical line increases with the increase in flow discharge and canopy density 2 the increased dissipative term of tke due to submerged canopies can promote suspended sediment deposition when compared with an open channel without vegetation the proposed models and experimental results could be helpful to the investigation of sediment transport in channels with submerged vegetation which has fundamental significance for riverbed evolution and ecological revitalization however both the flow and vegetation conditions in natural rivers are complicated owing to non uniform flow and canopy distribution and the real vegetation form which should be studied further additionally the ratio of sediment diffusion coefficient to turbulence exchange coefficient η needs to be explored in the future credit authorship contribution statement zhonghua yang

3417,to calculate the effect of rainfall in detaching particles and initiating soil erosion or in eroding wind turbine leading edge it is important to measure recorded drop size distributions dsd and fall velocity over long period commonly used relationships between kinetic energy ke and rainfall rate r exhibit strong dependence on the temporal resolution at which the analysis is carried out here we aim at developing a new scale invariant relationship relying on the framework of universal multifractals um which is widely used to analyze and characterize geophysical fields that exhibit extreme variability across wide range of scales rainfall data is collected using three optical disdrometers working on different underlying technologies one campbell scientific pws100 and two ott parsivel2 instruments and operated by the hydrology meteorology and complexity laboratory of école des ponts paristech in paris area france they provide access to the size and velocity of drops falling through sampling areas of few tens of cm2 such data enables estimation of rainfall dsd r and ke at various resolutions the temporal variations of this geophysical data over wide range of scales are then characterized in the um framework which was never done for ke a new power law relation is developed and tested against the theoretical framework assuming gamma dsd for describing the dependence between ke and r the developed equation using scale invariant features of um does not rely on gamma dsd assumption performs as well as the existing tools and is valid not only at a single scale but also across scales keywords rainfall intensity rainfall kinetic energy disdrometer multifractal scale invariance gamma dsd 1 introduction 1 1 on the importance of rainfall and kinetic energy understanding the relation between rainfall rate r and kinetic energy ke is essential for accurate determination of various rainfall parameters and understanding their after effects on surrounding ecosystem karlen et al 2003 it has been well established that onsite erosion of soil splash and runoff depends on drop size distribution dsd and fall velocity of the spectrum ellison 1944 fernández raga et al 2017 hence ke and r are primarily used to quantify rainfall erosivity and to estimate erosion rates in universal models towards sustainable land use planning angulo martínez et al 2012 shojaei et al 2020 mohamadi and kavian 2015 erosion heavily affects agricultural sector on on site level it impoverishes the top soil off nutrients and organic matter along with their water holding capacity this in turn increases the use of fertilizers and hence causes pollution at the recipient end of off site erosion further on off site level soil transport by erosion can trigger flood events through silting up of basins and rivers pimentel 2006 enne et al 2000 rainfall erosivity is a key parameter in various erosion models such as us based universal soil loss equation usle smith et al 1962 and its revised version rusle renard 1997 south korean based semma models for calculating soil loss deog park et al 2012 and in european models such as eurosem watem etc that account for sediment transportation along soil loss morgan et al 1998 van oost et al 2000 2008 an advance on usle most of these frameworks use ke as the major quantifying factor for estimating erosivity at spatial scales as rainfall ke represents the total energy available for detachment and transport of soil on surface of impact as direct measurement of ke is limited to specific geographical locations possessing required instrumental capabilities understanding the relationship between ke and the more commonly available rainfall parameter r is important in estimating the former in more places accurate estimation of rainfall ke is also important in understanding and mitigating leading edge erosion lee on wind turbine blades erosion damage reduces aerodynamic performance of blades resulting in reduced annual energy production and increased downtime keegan et al 2013 though lee involves a multitude of atmospheric factors impact velocity and amount of precipitation have been established as some of the major external factors in erosion herring et al 2019 as in soil erosion larger drops with greater mass and vertical terminal velocity causes a disproportionate amount of erosion in lee also rainfall ke helps to quantify the impact of droplets hitting perpendicular to the surface and hence rainfall erosion on blades which is the accumulated aggregate of multiple impacts stochastically distributed over the surface of the coated laminate bech et al 2018 in whirling arm rain erosion test wa ret astm g73 10 2017 liersch et al 2014 dnvgl rp 0171 2014 the industrial standard for measuring durability of leading edge structures specimens are subjected in controlled velocity and rain conditions to assess the damage caused by droplet impacts bech et al 2018 considering the rapid growth of offshore wind industry as sustainable clean energy solution in the americas and asia with monsoon seasons proper representation of ke and r is important in quantifying lee in wind turbines 1 2 review of existing relations and need for a scale invariant representation application of erosion frameworks such as usle or rusle poses uncertainties because of their empirical basis which has single or limited measurement locations and specific methods of data collection these frameworks take ke as the major quantifying factor for erosivity and employ various corrections to mitigate overestimation at low intensity rainfall as smaller droplets are less effective in soil detachment van dijk et al 2002 another commonly used erosivity index is rainfall momentum but it has been shown that for natural rainfall they exhibit similar relationship with rainfall intensity hudson 1971 these models are based on traditional two parameter exponential rain drop size distribution models developed from smaller sample collection methods such as flour pellets or stain paper laws and parsons 1943 marshall and palmer 1948 later studies using multi parameter radiometry and disdrometers have shown improvements in measurement if dsd is assumed to be a three parameter gamma distribution ulbrich 1983 gamma distribution assumes fewer large drops in rain and represents a narrower dsd than the exponential one and thereby reduces the overestimation of ke by the latter for recording dsd and in turn obtaining empirical ke disdrometers are commonly used in meteorological campaigns where fall velocity is either directly measured or estimated from empirical relations gunn and kinzer 1949 atlas et al 1973 there has been various studies towards accurate representation of ke r relationship fox 2004 demonstrates the impact of formulation of dsd in calculation of ke and hence on erosion smith et al 1962 proposed a logarithmic function based on dsd formulation by laws and parsons 1943 and terminal velocity by gunn and kinzer 1949 it was used in modelling erosion in usle which was later replaced by continuous exponential functions in revised usle approach renard 1997 brown and foster 1987 other proposed forms of ke r equations were linear kinnell 1981 sempere torres et al 1998 polynomial carter 1979 and power law park et al 1982 critical literature appraisal by van dijk et al 2002 on various ke r relations lists measurement techniques and procedures sampling biases interpretation methods and storm types as reasons for discrepancies and suggests another exponential based predictive equation more recent reviews such as angulo martínez et al 2015 wilken et al 2018 mineo et al 2019 shows lack of universality among various ke r relationships logarithmic linear power law and exponential using disdrometer measurements and modelling at different geographic stations meteorologic conditions and time aggregation used for calibration most of the empirical formulations express ke as volume specific kinetic energy per unit area and mm of rainfall or ke mm jm 2 mm 1 due to prevalence of non automated measurements and lack of accuracy in determining exposure time but expression of volume specific kinetic energy creates a statistical artefact spurious ratio correlation in ke r relationship due to the inclusion of r mm h 1 in the ke mm expression salles et al 2002 suggests usage of more consistent time specific ke or ke time j m 2 h 1 that has been shown to produce less heteroscedasticity than corresponding ke mm r scatter plots for representing erosion ke time has been expressed as the rate of expenditure of rainfall kinetic energy kinnell 1981 rainfall or kinetic power smith and de veaux 1992 and rainfall kinetic energy flux density steiner and smith 2000 the two expressions are related to each other through rain intensity and hydrological studies usually harmonize ke r relationships with ke time 1 ke time r ke mm in this paper the expressions for ke are derived and analyzed in the form of ke time unless otherwise specified due to variations in methodologies used and dsd characteristics during measurement different functional forms show different behaviour towards ke r estimation though commonly preferred exponential relations have been shown to underestimate ke time for lower intensities of rainfall carollo et al 2015 power laws that predict kinetic energy well at lower intensities tend to overestimate the same for higher intensities logarithmic curves are limited in their usage though they fit low and high intensity ke rather decently van dijk et al 2002 further due to the empirical formulation when it comes to expressing ke time vs r most of these mathematical equations fail to have much physical justification using generalized scaling formulation that expresses various existing dsd models as it s special cases torres et al 1994 sempere torres et al 1998 salles et al 2002 found that power law is the most suitable function to relate ke time and r from a microphysical point of view the parameters prefactor and exponent of power law are related to rain type geographical location and measuring technique shin et al 2016 has proposed a representative power law based on the ideal assumption that the drop size is uniformly distributed under the constant rainfall intensity 1 3 purpose of paper current literature on ke and r lacks a common consensus on the usage of expression that is valid across various scales of measurement hydro meteorological regimes or observation techniques there is an increased focus on research characterizing rainfall microphysics at local and regional scales petan et al 2010 here we examine the variation of ke and r for over 7 years in paris region using continuous data from three disdrometers from two different manufacturers using the framework of universal multifractals um schertzer and lovejoy 1987 efforts were made to characterize the variability of ke time and r on event based and year based analysis and to formulate a scale invariant relation based on power law relationships multifractals allow characterization of complex geophysical fields with a limited number of scale invariant exponents see schertzer and tchiguirinskaia 2020 for a recent review multifractal behaviour of measured rainfall has been abundantly studied previously see gupta and waymire 1990 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1993 deidda et al 1999 olsson et al 1996 garcía marín et al 2008 langousis et al 2009 emmanouil et al 2020 for some examples among others wolfensberger et al 2017 schertzer and lovejoy 2011 used um in climatological analysis of precipitation modelled and actual in relation to external geographical and meteorological descriptors checking the validity of um framework on ke which was never done to the knowledge of the authors is a first goal of the paper the main goal of this paper is to explore the possibility of establishing a physically based scale invariant power law relationship between ke and r using the um framework without having to rely on strong assumptions on dsd shape and compare its performance with more classical approach this article is structured as follows in section 2 the methodology used is detailed first the commonly used framework of gamma distributed dsd which yields a power law relation is reminded along with the associated parameters estimation techniques then the process to identify power law relation in the um framework is explained after a required reminder on the theoretical underlying basis similarly the associated parameters estimation techniques which will be implemented are described section 3 includes details of data collection and quality control results are discussed in section 4 where validity of formulated relation is tested and contrasted over different types of rain events the final section section 5 concludes the study and summarizes the main observations 2 methodology 2 1 theoretical relation assuming gamma distributed dsd 2 1 1 rainfall microstructure and commonly used gamma distribution rainfall is measured and represented as distribution of raindrops in different diameter classes or drop size distribution dsd and their corresponding terminal fall velocity in stable air for meteorological purposes size distribution of raindrops is represented as mean number of drops per unit volume in a particular diameter more precisely equivolumic diameter i e the diameter of a drop with the same volume but a spherical shape range between d and d dd n v d m 3 mm 1 however in hydrological studies dsd measured by ground based devices such as disdrometers or optical spectrometers are represented as mean number of raindrops in a particular diameter range arriving at a surface per unit area per unit time n a d m 2 mm 1 s 1 if effects of wind turbulence and raindrop interactions are neglected n v d and n a d are related as follows uijlenhoet et al 1999 2 n a d v d n v d where v d represents the terminal fall velocity m s 1 as a function of the equivalent spherical diameter of raindrop d mm traditional mathematical expressions describing n v d such as exponential marshall and palmer 1948 weibull best 1950 gamma ulbrich 1983 and lognormal feingold et al 1986 can be expressed as particular case of general formulation proposed by sempere torres et al 1998 for the scope of this paper gamma distribution of dsd which has been recognized to better represent natural rain will be considered ulbrich 1983 in this framework 3 n v d n 0 d μ e λ d where n v d is in m 3 mm 1 d in mm n 0 in m 3 mm 1 μ μ and λ in mm 1 are distribution parameters measuring raindrop concentration mean size and shape of spectrum respectively λ is usually expressed with the help of the median volume diameter d 0 as λ 3 67 μ d 0 2 1 2 theoretical power law relation between r and ke rainfall intensity or rain rate r in mm h 1 can be calculated from n a d using following expression steiner and smith 2000 4 r 3 6 10 3 π 6 0 d 3 n a d dd kinetic energy per unit area per unit time ke time in j m 2 h 1 of falling drops can also be expressed in terms of measured n a d as follows steiner and smith 2000 5 ke 3 6 10 6 π ρ 12 0 d 3 v 2 d n a d dd where ρ is density of water in standard conditions in kg m 3 though there are more sophisticated equations proposed in the literature for v d for simplicity in calculation here we are following the widely used power law formulation by atlas and ulbrich 1977 uijlenhoet 2001 demonstrated it has the only functional form consistent with power law relationship between rainfall related parameters 6 v d c d g c 3 78 m s 1 mm g and g 0 67 with v in m s 1 and d in mm most of the rainfall parameters can be approximated as moments of the dsd and when dsd follows gamma model the n th moment m n can be computed as atlas and ulbrich 1977 7 m n 0 d n n d d d n 0 λ μ n 1 γ μ n 1 where γ α is the complete gamma function 8 γ α 0 x α 1 e x dx where α 0 substituting eqs 2 3 6 and 7 and solving the integral gives reduced expressions for ke and r in terms of gamma function 9 r 6 10 4 π cn 0 γ 4 g μ λ 4 g μ 10 ke 3 6 10 6 ρ π c 3 12 n 0 γ 4 3 g μ λ 4 3 g μ this reduction using gamma function enables representation of ke and r in the form of a power law as follows 11 ke br a where 12 a 4 3 g μ 4 g μ b 5 10 4 ρ c 2 6 π c n 0 10 4 1 a γ 4 3 g μ γ 4 g μ a the final expression follows the same pattern as that by salles et al 2002 based on generalized dsd and that of uijlenhoet et al 1999 based on exponential dsd when μ 0 gamma distribution for dsd becomes a simple marshall and palmer negative exponential parameterization representation of dsd marshall and palmer 1948 with eq 11 becoming ke 8 539 r 1 287 same values were obtained for exponent a and pre factor b using the general function proposed by salles et al 2002 for marshall and palmer approximation closer value of exponential coefficient were also reported by uijlenhoet et al 1999 in a power law formulation based on marshall and palmer 1948 approximation of dsd and power law dependence of rain drop terminal velocity eq 6 atlas and ulbrich 1977 many simplifications were followed in this formulation of ke r relation as a power law eq 11 gamma dsd is notably assumed as well as a power law form for terminal fall velocity as function of diameter this approximation shows limitations at higher values of diameter d 5 mm and doesn t account for atmospheric turbulence or updrafts and downdrafts adirosi et al 2016 effect of truncation errors in measurement is not considered the formulation also ignores the effect of horizontal wind velocity and surface impact angle of rain drops some authors tend to consider normalized spectra of dsd testud 2001 that requires only two parameters to describe the dsd it was also not considered here for the sake of simplicity in deriving a theoretical relation between ke and r it should be noted that although widely accepted as the best representation of natural dsd gamma function also has associated errors that exists outside experimental methodology and sampling adirosi et al 2014 2 1 3 estimation of power law coefficients from gamma dsd parameters as mentioned before most rainfall parameters can be expressed as moments of the dsd according to eq 7 the right hand side of the equation is specific to the non normalized three parameter gamma distribution considered here as shown in eq 3 in practice dsd is not measured continuously but for discrete diameters d i as a consequence the estimated moments m n of order n are computed thanks to the following discrete sum rather than previous integral 13 m n i 1 n class d i n n i d i δ d i mm n m 3 where d i is the diameter of droplet in class i n i d i is the drop size distribution estimation discussed later in eq 26 δ d i is the width of diameter class i and n class the total number of diameter classes investigation of various dsd parameter estimating methods by cao and zhang 2009 highlighted the risk in usage of maximum likelihood and l moment estimators for processing data with truncation in lower end of dsd spectra as all disdrometers are limited by some minimum value of measurable diameter d min 0 it is advisable to use traditional method of moments brawn et al 2008 although the choice of moments for proper parameters estimation with the method of moments is a relevant topic it is outside the scope of this paper hence authors relied on the existing literature more precisely although higher dsd moments are considered to be associated with higher errors the tendency of lower errors with middle order moments was shown later in smith et al 2009 using radar measurements and cao et al 2008 using joint disdrometer radar observations cao and zhang 2009 evaluated the performance of various moment estimators using simulations of gamma dsd with a more realistic estimation of errors and found that second third and fourth moments m234 as the best overall performer for estimating r konwar et al 2014 m234 and huang et al 2021 even higher order moments 2 3 and 6 are some recent examples of using middle order moments while analysing data from same disdrometer make as the one in current study ott parsivel2 hence it was chosen to employ these moments for computing gamma dsd parameters μ n 0 and λ refer eq 7 specific moment equations are provided in the appendix appendix b these parameters are then introduced in eq 12 to derive the expected power law parameters assuming a gamma dsd variation of a and b with dsd parameters is examined with available data set in section 4 for different type of rainfall events 2 2 theoretical relation between multifractal fields in um framework 2 2 1 overview of the theoretical framework the framework of universal multifractals um enables to characterize the extreme variability of geophysical fields across scales with the help of a limited number of parameters with physical meaning schertzer and lovejoy 1987 it relies on the assumption that these fields are generated through an underlying multiplicative cascade such behaviour is assumed to be inherited from the scale invariant features of the navier stokes equations but has not yet been formally showed consequently statistical properties of fields are conserved in all scales in this study time specific kinetic energy and rainfall intensity from disdrometer measurements are analyzed using um review by schertzer and lovejoy 2011 discusses the techniques and methodologies employed in more detail for analysis in um framework the field in consideration is normalized divided by its mean value and its total size in terms of numerical values is restricted to be a power of two the field can be one or two dimensional since current study involves only time series we will be limiting our discussion to single dimension let us consider a normalized conservative field an additional parameter for non conservative fields is introduced later λ at resolution λ resolution λ is the ratio of l the outer scale to l the observational scale let us first consider the occurrence pattern of the field i e the same field with 1 for strictly positive values and 0 otherwise if the field is fractal then the probability p that a segment of length l intersects the field p is the probability of occurrence of non zero elements in the total binary field scales with resolution as follows 14 p λ d f λ d λ c f where c f d d f the fractal co dimension of the field the fractal dimension d f indicates how the binary field rain and no rain in this case fills the available space in a scale invariant way as d is constant in order to fully characterize the field a value of d f for each threshold is required this is the intuitive notion of multifractality in order to be mathematically consistent this characterization should actually be done with the help not of a direct threshold at the maximum resolution but with a scale invariant threshold called singularity γ and their corresponding codimension function c γ as 15 p λ λ γ λ c γ above equation implies that statistical moments q of the field scale with resolution schertzer and lovejoy 1987 schertzer and lovejoy 1988 are 16 λ q λ k q where k q is the moment scaling function related to c γ by legendre transform parisi et al 1985 for a conservative field in um framework k c q can be fully characterized with only two parameters multi fractality index α and mean intermittency codimension c 1 17 k c q c 1 α 1 q α q c 1 measures clustering of average intensity across scales when the field is homogeneous c 1 is equal to zero α measures how this clustering changes with respect to intensity levels α 0 2 larger values of both corresponds to stronger extremes simulations of such fields can be obtained by generating a levy noise with parameter α coloring it to introduce c 1 and then taking the exponential which yields solely non negative values for a non conservative field ϕ λ i e a field whose average ϕ λ changes with scales a non conservative parameter h is used in expression of scaling 18 ϕ λ λ λ h where is a conservative field characterized with c 1 and α positive h represents a smoother field which needs to be fractionally differentiated for obtaining a conservative field conversely negative h represents a field in need of fractional integration for retrieving conservative field h is related to the spectral slope β which gives a measurement of the correlation range larger β means higher contribution of large scale phenomenon in variability of data 19 β 1 2 h k c 2 2 2 2 estimation of scaling behaviour and um parameters the quality of scaling of multifractal fields can be examined using trace moment tm where log log plot of upscaled fields against resolution λ is taken for each moment q eq 16 for multifractal fields the plot is a straight line with moment scaling function k q as slope quality of the scaling is given by the estimate r 2 of the linear regression the value for q 1 5 is used as reference double trace moment dtm is a more robust version of tm tailored for um fields where the moment scaling function k q η of the field λ η obtained in practice by raising to power η at the maximum resolution and then upscaling it is expressed as a function of multifractality index α lavallée et al 1993 20 λ η q λ k q η λ η α k q from the above equation value of α can be obtained as the slope of the linear part when k q η is represented for a given q as a function of η in log log plot 2 2 3 power law relations in um framework and practical implementation if a field is um then a power law relation of it is also a um field with coefficients depending upon initial um parameters the reasoning for power law comes from the dtm analysis in um framework tessier et al 1993 lovejoy et al 2008 consider two multifractal fields ε 1 and ε 2 that are power law related by an exponent a and a prefactor b as below 21 ε 1 b ε 2 a from exponents in eq 20 k q of ε 1 can be expressed as follows 22 ε 1 q ε 2 a q λ k ε 2 q a k ε 1 q k ε 2 q a a α ε 2 k ε 2 q expanding k q with um parameters as in eq 20 23 c 1 ε 1 α ε 1 1 q α ε 1 q a α ε 2 c 1 ε 2 α ε 2 1 q α ε 2 q from above equation we can deduce that for if a power relation exists the um parameters are related as follow 24 α ε 1 α ε 2 α c 1 ε 1 a α c 1 ε 2 in this study both ke and r time series were analysed using um framework as the um model discussed here is solely non negative it removes all possibility of having non negative values for both fields in analysis using their um parameters in eq 24 it is possible to formulate power law relationship in the format of eq 21 it has the same shape as the theoretical power law obtained using moments of the dsd in section 2 1 in eq 11 details of disdrometer data collection and subsequent multifractal analysis are covered in upcoming sections 3 data collection and instrumentation 3 1 measurement campaigns for this study continuously monitored data in natural conditions was obtained from three optical disdrometers operating with two different principles the devices are part of the taranis observatory extreme and multi scale raindrop paris observatory gires et al 2018 of the fresnel platform of école des ponts paristech https hmco enpc fr page fresnel platform en and are operated by hydrology meteorology and complexity laboratory of école des ponts paristech hm co enpc table 1 gives a brief outline of measurement campaigns locations are shown in fig 1 from november 2016 to september 2017 the instruments were moved to école polytechnique ep on sirta site instrumenté de recherche par télédétection atmosphérique for a joint intensive measurement campaign over the ile de france region the aforementioned location is about 38 km away from enpc towards south west of paris to summarise the measurements presented in the following sections involve two different types of optical disdrometers and data collected from two different locations of paris region 3 2 overview of instrument functioning and outputs the three optical disdrometers used here are two ott parsivel2 see battaglia et al 2010 or the device documentation ott 2014 and one pws 100 see ellis et al 2006 or the device documentation campbell scientific ltd 2012 the ott parsivel2 are occlusion based devices with a transmitter that creates laser sheet and an intercepting receiver directly aligned with it the size equivolumic diameter and fall velocity are assessed from changes decrease in amplitude of intensity and duration of the decrease in received laser intensity due to the passing of rainfall drops through a sampling area of 54 cm2 an ellipsoidal shape model with a standard relation between the axis ratio and the equivolumic diameter are assumed for drops in the process the pws100 consists of a transmitter that generates four horizontal parallel laser sheets and two receptors which are not aligned with the transmitter the signal received by each receptor corresponds to the light refracted by drops and contains four consecutive peaks associated with each laser sheet from the delay between those peaks fall velocity and diameter of the drops are estimated pws100 has a sampling area of 40 cm2 computations assuming spherical shape of droplets are performed here with a later correction for oblateness before final result generation gires et al 2017 both disdrometers have a collection time step of 30 s and provide main output as a matrix containing the number of drops n i j recorded during the time step δ t according to classes of equivolumic diameter index i defined by a centre d i and a width δ d i both expressed in mm and fall velocity index j and defined by a centre v j and a width δ v j both expressed in m s 1 for parsivel2 there are 32 classes of δ d i from 0 062 mm to 24 5 mm and δ v j from 0 05 m s 1 to 20 8 m s 1 and for pws the same ranges from 0 05 to 27 2 δ d i mm and 0 05 to 27 2 δ v j m s 1 in 34 classes width of diameter and velocity classes are not similar for all classes as they are designed to be more and more refined towards smaller values from the raw matrix the studied rainfall parameters rain rate drop size distribution and time specific kinetic energy were obtained using following expression for each time steps 25 r π 6 δ t i j n i j d i 3 s eff d i 26 n d i 1 s eff d i δ d i δ t j n i j v j 27 ke ρ wat π 6 δ t i j n i j d i 3 v j 2 s eff d i where s eff d i is the sampling area of disdrometer in mm2 δ t is the time step duration in hr and ρ wat is the volumic mass of water 10 3 kg m 3 n d i δ d i gives the number of drops with a diameter in the class i per unit volume in m 3 details of the devices their functioning and data collection can be found in gires et al 2018 3 3 data quality and filtering for the data presented in this paper filters suggested by various authors kruger and krajewski 2002 thurai and bringi 2005 jaffrain and berne 2012 gires et al 2018 were used to remove possible non meteorological measurements from environmental factors such as splashing horizontal wind etc on the basis of size and velocity of drops using the disdrometer data set two series of multifractal analysis were performed event based and year based for event based analysis individual rainfall events were identified with following criteria in rain intensity time series rainfall events with a cumulative depth greater than 0 7 mm and separated by at least 15 min of dry weather before and after from all measured events with this condition rain rate r drop size distribution dsd and kinetic energy ke were calculated for the three disdrometers denoted pars 1 pars 2 and pws hereafter from the results further filtering was done to remove events having a percentage of nan values not a number blank missing data 1 and r 2 value 0 9 for both ke and r remaining nans were then replaced with 0 in year based methodology continuous time series from jan 2016 to dec 2019 including rain and no rain conditions were used for multifractal analysis and results were compiled according to the year of measurement there were minor lapses in continuity of data measurement from jun 2013 to dec 2015 for that reason those time periods were not considered in continuous year based analysis to avoid possible measurement biases however since selection of individual events are not affected by that event based analysis involves data from jun 2013 to dec 2019 lesser number of events can be observed in the excluded years for year based analysis in table 2 between 2016 and 2019 there were also a few days of maintenance where data was not recorded 27 sep 2017 to 26 dec 2017 01 to 07 jan 2018 and 12 to 14 apr 2019 after quality control for each disdrometer a total of 214 665 time steps were analysed in 556 rain events total 1610 events counting all three disdrometers data was not always available for all the disdrometers hence the lesser number from 2013 to 2019 for event based analysis in year based analysis a total of 3 919 680 time steps were considered from 2016 to 2019 percentages of rainy time steps were about 7 6 6 and 5 7 for pars 1 pars 2 and pws respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 overview of analysis for analysing the ke and r time series using um framework as explained in previous sections two strategies were followed event based analysis and year based analysis for event based analysis we identified a total of 556 rainfall events between 28 sep 2013 and 31 dec 2019 of which 493 events were common among all three disdrometers for um analysis each time series was resized to the highest power of two in such a way that the trimmed series accommodated maximum rainfall cumulative depth and then the field was normalized after resizing for um analysis length of individual events ranged from 64 to 2048 time steps where each time step corresponds to 30 s i e the recording time step of disdrometers used ke and r from each events were analyzed as separate fields in um framework for year based methodology similar procedure was followed for um analysis on year long continuous time series for the years from 2016 to 2019 in coming subsections estimation of um parameters and power law relations are illustrated using one event data for event based analysis and one year data for year based analysis power law coefficients were also estimated using theoretical framework with dsd parameters as mentioned in section 2 1 variation and correspondence among coefficients determined by um and dsd parameters are discussed thereafter and validated with data 4 2 multifractal analysis of events for illustration of the analysis carried out one event from 2017 for pars 1 disdrometer that occurred on 16 september between 11 35 00 and 13 00 00 local time is presented here fig 2 a displays the time series of r and ke for this event as well as ke vs r plots the latter also shows power law fits with coefficients from um analysis and dsd parameters explained later in this section for this event 171 time steps were trimmed to 128 time steps along region of maximum rain occurrence of which 124 were rainy data points trimmed and normalized ke and r were then subjected to analysis using um framework discussed in section 2 2 initial analysis indicated values of non conservative parameter h greater than 0 5 among many events hence to retrieve a conservative field on which the um analysis can be implemented without bias fluctuations of ke and r time series were used lavallée et al 1993 characterization of variability in ke field for the event considered here can be seen in fig 2b with tm eq 16 in log log plot dtm graphs eq 20 in log log plot and um parameter values as shown in tm and dtm graphs the field exhibits a very good multifractal behaviour with a single scaling regime from 30 s to 64 min for example tm coefficient of determination r 2 for q 1 5 was greater than 0 99 values of um parameters α c 1 and h for ke of this particular event were 1 820 0 311 and 0 547 respectively it should be mentioned that h computed on the fluctuations of ke was found to be equal to 0 189 meaning the taking the fluctuations indeed enabled retrieval of a conservative field from the original smoother field r also exhibited excellent scaling behavior and corresponding values of um parameters α c 1 and h for this event were 1 655 0 229 and 0 100 respectively ke and r analyzed from every event exhibited similar multifractal characteristics with a unique scaling regime the quality of scaling was examined using coefficient of determination r 2 for q 1 5 in tm analysis and as previously mentioned events with values 0 9 were discarded 9 8 percentage of total events were rejected on this basis for the events with good scaling behaviour robust retrieval of multifractal parameters α c 1 β and h was possible for example the assessed values of α and c 1 for both ke and r time series exhibited a maximum standard deviation using various values of q in dtm analysis of 0 0584 and 0 0670 for measurement at ep sirta and 0 0446 and 0 0443 for measurements at enpc fig 3 displays the values of multifractality index α and mean intermittency c 1 for all the studied events for both fields it appears that the values of α for ke and r are rather well distributed along the bisector this pattern suggests a power law relation between these two quantities as discussed in section 2 2 eq 21 where ε 1 and ε 2 are ke and r respectively i e ke br a as in eq 11 the exponent of the power law a was deduced from corresponding α and c 1 values of um fields ke and r for every event subjected to um analysis using the expected relations for power law related um fields i e eq 24 the α used is the average of α ke and α r which were anyway similar value of prefactor b was estimated by fitting eq 11 at maximum resolution with estimated values of a on event s ke r graph for the event used as illustration we found a 1 083 and b 11 493 this power law fit from um parameters is displayed in fig 2a as ke um in the ke vs r graph variation of computed power law exponent a and prefactor b are also shown in fig 3 as time series of events for each year graphs of remaining years are provided in appendix a for 3 5 of total events filtered estimates of α was found to be greater than the theoretical maximum 2 however a values for those events were found to be consistent with the overall average despite appreciable variability in um parameters across events values of a and b showed overall stability in the short range of values specified in graphs suggesting robustness of the estimates year wise average values over the events for a and b and number of events for all three disdrometers are given in table 2 average values of power law parameters from the events that were common between the three disdrometers are also shown in the same table comparable values of a and b were observed in both cases a clear range of variation can be observed between the two types of disdrometers for both parsivel2 the average a and b were similar and around 1 22 and 8 17 respectively while for pws100 a values were consistently lower than that of parsivel2 at around 1 17 and b values greater at 13 02 pws generally registered slightly higher intensities than pars 1 and pars 2 it should be mentioned that a and b seem to show a very rough correlation where values of b decreases with increase in values of a but between make of instruments irrespective of the type and number of events values of a remains rather constant differences in values obtained between parsivel2 and pws is expected due to operational differences between disdrometers such effects are also reported in johannsen et al 2020 who showed biases in measurement and subsequent r ke relation due to difference in type of sensors used three optical disdrometer were used angulo martínez et al 2015 also highlighted some differences among various parsivel2 4 3 multifractal analysis of continuous data year based analysis to illustrate year based analysis continuous time series and um analysis for pars 1 disdrometer for the year 2017 is shown in fig 4 both ke and r fields showed similar multifractal features scaling behaviour of ke is shown in fig 4b a unique scaling regime from 30 s to 311 days was considered variation of um parameters α and c 1 between ke and r fields as well as values of power law exponent a and prefactor b computed by fitting the relation at maximum resolution are displayed in fig 5 precise values of a and b according to the year of measurement are given in table 3 the curve ke um in the ke vs r graph of fig 4a shows the power law fit using um parameters for continuous data of 2016 for pars 1 values and trend of variation are similar to that observed for the event based analysis this confirms the robustness of the discussed power law which is valid and retrieved not only at the event scale but also at the year scale 4 4 power law coefficients from dsd parameters to understand previous findings further values of a and b were computed from theoretical framework discussed in section 2 1 rainfall dsd was assumed to follow gamma distribution eq 3 and theoretical values of a and b denoted as a dsd and b dsd from here on for clarity were computed as per eq 12 after estimating values of gamma dsd parameters μ n 0 and λ with the help of method of moments the variation of rain rate r was accurately reproduced using m234 moment estimators fig 8d for example theoretical power law relation ke dsd b dsd r a dsd was then compared with the one estimated using um analysis represented from here on as ke um with coefficients a um and b um for clarity for every events average values of dsd parameters estimation error and corresponding a dsd and b dsd for pars 1 events are given in table 4 according to event s rain type definition introduced later rmse dsd is the root mean square error rmse between empirical dsd and theoretical gamma dsd with fitted parameters using the value for the center of each diameter class d i it is used here as an indicator of the quality of fit of the assumed gamma dsd distribution and the empirical one for rmse estimation only the portion of dsd above 0 5 mm diameter class was considered as smaller drops have lesser contribution in overall ke and r and are associated with greater uncertainties in measurement also higher size drops above 9 mm diameter class were not observed during the events and are hence not shown in dsd figures discussed after fig 6 and fig 8 fig 6 represents two extremes cases among events from year 2019 for pars 1 one event fig 6a where empirical dsd corresponds with a gamma distribution and one event fig 6b where it does not the dsd fitting as well as the ke vs r plots fitted with power law relation from um analysis and dsd extraction are also displayed for the event with empirical dsd closer to estimated gamma dsd both power law relations ke um ke dsd are similar and show good fit for the other event power law relation from dsd approach shows a considerable deviation from actual values of ke with a strong overestimation power law from um analysis on the other hand still provides a close fit to see if there is such a trend through all the events coefficient of determination of both ke r fits were plotted against each other r um 2 vs r dsd 2 and compared using corresponding values of rmse dsd fig 7 a negative value of coefficient of determination for dsd r dsd 2 is due to the high difference between ke dsd and empirical ke in certain events from the plot it is evident that a generalized conclusion theoretical values of a and b a dsd b dsd works well in cases where empirical dsd coincides with gamma dsd is not possible however there were many events with good dsd correspondence with gamma where ke dsd fitted data better to investigate further this issue and given that the dsd is available for all time steps a dsd and b dsd were computed for each time step to study their variations within a rainfall event fig 8 displays their temporal evolution for the event in fig 2 values of parameters especially b dsd shows considerable variation within an event these variations basically come from variations in dsd parameters μ an n 0 as it can be seen on fig 8c and 8f also evident from eq 12 which are reflecting physical variations in the rainfall process it should be mentioned that during this event and other events gamma dsd parameters were able to properly reproduce observed rain rate fig 8d meaning that the assumption of gamma dsd distribution and the m234 moment estimator approach remains valid throughout the event s this suggests that the variability of a dsd and b dsd observed at event scale is also valid within events at much smaller scales this could explain some of the bias previously observed with dsd approach developed in this paper as there were still considerable variation in r 2 values of r ke dsd 2 fig 7a especially if we compare with ke um which shows better r ke um 2 regardless the type of event a question of possible bias arises due to difference in methods of estimation of power law coefficients unlike ke dsd for which both coefficients are obtained from theoretical relation involving dsd parameters for ke um only coefficient a is fully estimated from um analysis prefactor b um is obtained by fitting the data at highest available resolution 30 s using um estimated a um such discrepency may introduce a bias in the comparison between dsd and um approach to retrieving a power law hence to understand this further and to make a fair comparison a new power law was considered where only a dsd is obtained using eq 12 while b dsd is calculated from fitting of data denoted hereafter b dsdfit ke dsdfit fig 7b shows r 2 between ke dsdfit and ke um and it can be seen that comparable fits are obtained between um and dsd power laws regardless the nature of dsd thus illustrating the presence of bias this can also be observed in previous ke r plots fig 2a fig 4a fig 6a and fig 6b 4 5 comparison between ke r relations though the power law obtained is similar from um and dsd analysis they fit the data differently due to difference in values of corresponding parameters ke dsd in ke vs r graph of fig 2a and fig 4a shows the power law fit using theoretical a and b a dsd b dsd from dsd parameters for illustrated examples in event based and year based analysis the difference in fit between two calculations of power law ke um and ke dsd can be observed there it can be seen from fig 7a that ke um gives rather good fit regardless the event specific dsd shape while r 2 value of ke dsd fluctuates however there is a limited tendency for good fit towards empirical dsd following gamma distribution for few events like fig 6 fig 9 shows variation of a and b estimates from dsd and um for pars 1 pars 2 and pws for all events in year 2019 values of a um and a dsd are mostly clustered around the approx 1 2 for all three disdrometers with no clear relation between them on the other hand values of b um and b dsd are more spread out ranging approximately from 2 to 25 such spreading for b dsd is not caused by the computation issues previously mentioned since it is visible on both b dsd and b dsdfit this observed scattering which is comparable regardless the estimation techniques and device suggests that even if the power relation between ke and r remains relevant for all events its parameters exhibit strong variability between events the constants of the power law relations in literature between ke and r are not universal in application and need tweaking as per the rainfall type measurement location as well as techniques based on assumed dependence between dsd parameters and rain rate in formulation exponents salles et al 2002 suggest four range of values for exponent values of the universal power law and uijlenhoet et al 1999 propose six different relationships in their research hence in order to refine the analysis of this observed variability between events and to examine possible dependence of a and b on type of rain events were sorted according to rain types table 4 shows for pars 1 averaged values of gamma dsd parameters indicator of the quality of the fitting and power law coefficients from both dsd and um estimations across events sorted according to type of rainfall tables for pars 2 and pws are given in appendix table b 1 for defining types of rainfall from light to extreme a classification based on intensity tokay and short 1996 was employed μ λ and n 0 tend to decrease with heavier events with a stronger trend for n 0 it should be mentioned that an opposite trend is reported in reference used this could be due to instrumental bias in dsd measurement as the impact disdrometer used in reference is known to under represents smaller drops in intense rainfall it should also be noticed that the capacity of the gamma distribution to model observed dsd diminishes with heavier rainfall this is more visible on rmse estimation over whole range of dsd and less prominent in displayed estimate here involving only higher drop sizes suggesting a limit in validity for gamma distribution assumption also an increase in mean diameter is noticed not shown here these findings are in agreement with previous studies reported in literature giuseppe and vito et al 2015 when it comes to power law coefficients both a dsd and b dsd show increase with increasing rain rate and this is more pronounced for b dsd given the observed decrease in validity of gamma distribution of dsd these trends should be taken carefully because they are likely to be mere artifacts and not representative of the actual process at stake in the case of um estimated parameters b um follows similar trend with stronger magnitude going from 8 to 33 while a um shows slight reduction in value with increasing rain rate from 1 25 to 1 05 since the average rainfall criteria used for classification here is a somehow arbitrary and more biased towards lesser rainfalls another classification relying on the maximum of 10 min moving average was also employed the results are tabulated in table b 2 appendix b with this criteria which is more biased towards larger rainfall events consistent and similar results are retrieved when it comes to values and variation of power law coefficients a and b from dsd as well as um suggesting robustness of obtained trends to evaluate the performance of established power law relationship across scales of measurement ke was calculated from empirical r using ke br a with average values of a and b and compared with existing relations in literature for this purpose exponential equation used in rusle ke bf 29 1 0 72 exp 0 05 r brown and foster 1987 exponential equation used in rusle2 ke mg 29 1 0 72 exp 0 082 r c mcgregor et al 1995 universal exponential law proposed by van dijk et al 2002 ke vd 28 3 1 0 52 exp 0 0421 r and ideal power law proposed by shin et al 2016 ke shin 10 3 r 11 9 were used alongside ke um and ke dsd derived here power law where fitted values of b were used ke dsdfit is also included for um and dsd power laws in this paper average values among all calculated events were used for representation according to make of disdrometers average values of coefficient a and prefactor b were close for both pars 1 and pars 2 disdrometers and were taken common for the parsivel2 make for both um and dsd it is also logical to keep values of power law coefficients separate between different disdrometers as varying ke and r estimation has been reported across types of disdrometers used angulo martínez et al 2015 angulo martínez et al 2018 johannsen et al 2020 fig 10 shows ke and r variation fitted with above mentioned equations for maximum resolution 30 s as expected ke um provides better fit than ke dsd and ke dsdfit shows closer fits with respect to empirical data um power laws exhibit for all three devices slightly better or comparable coefficient of determination r 2 with regards to commonly used relations the exponential equations from literature appear very close to each other the relatively lower values of coefficient of determination than that during event based fits are likely to be due to the effect of using average values instead of event specific values of a and b to understand the performance of various equations further r 2 was examined across various time periods and also across different type of rains results are displayed in fig 11 it appears that regardless of the duration as well as type of rainfall considered tuned relations ke dsdfit and ke um perform significantly better than the other fixed ones yielding r 2 values greater than 0 9 in most cases ke um exhibits slightly better performances with a difference not significant the analysis also confirmed the poor performance of ke dsd i e the inability of the dsd approach to properly fit the prefactor b it should be stated that the power law obtained using um analysis is not providing significant performance enhancement compared to that obtained from gamma dsd while the prefactor b is estimated from fitting of the data ke dsdfit however with um analysis it is possible to discard all assumptions of dsd following a gamma distribution thus eliminating the known inadequacy of gamma model and its sensitivity to sampling resolution adirosi et al 2013 adirosi et al 2014 ignaccolo and de michele 2014 adirosi et al 2016 gatidis et al 2020 the inadequacy was observed in current analysis as well as previously discussed and illustrated in fig 6 and fig 7 5 conclusion we examined the relationship between rainfall intensity r and time specific kinetic energy ke using high resolution 30 s optical disdrometer data from the past 7 years in paris region the variability across scales of both parameters was characterized using the framework of universal multifractals analyzed ke and r times series were found to convey excellent multifractal behaviour which is novel for ke with multifractality index α and mean intermittency c 1 suggesting power law relation between them it can be written as ke br a such power law was found to be valid across analyzed data i e independent of the event on whether they are computed on event or yearly basis and of the underlying corresponding drop size distribution some variability in the value of the exponent a and prefactor b is reported according the event and disdrometer type as shown by previous results similar power law can be theoretically obtained when relying on the common assumption of a gamma distribution for the dsd and a power law relation between fall velocity and equivolumic drop diameter ke r relation obtained through um analysis was compared with results found using this common framework and biases were acknowledged despite some exceptions in most cases when a gamma dsd approximation was relevant estimations of power law parameters from the two approaches were found to be consistent when not um approach provided slightly better fit in general but not in a significant manner keeping in mind that the pre factor needs to fitted to data in both cases to ensure a fair comparison thus the newly discussed power law relationship between ke and r retrieved with the help of um framework generalizes previous results and theoretical formulations without having to rely on the ad hoc assumption of a gamma dsd the main underlying assumption of um framework i e that there is an underlying multiplicative process is actually physically based in the sense that comes from the scale invariance features of the navier stockes equations here a um analysis confirmed the validity of this assumption deriving the power law relation in a multifractal framework opens the path to new approaches for simulating ke from simple r measurements given that complete ke measurement is much less available than r one this impact will be investigated further in future work for the future it would hence be interesting to expand the data set across geographical and meteorological conditions to reduce the biases that might have

3417,to calculate the effect of rainfall in detaching particles and initiating soil erosion or in eroding wind turbine leading edge it is important to measure recorded drop size distributions dsd and fall velocity over long period commonly used relationships between kinetic energy ke and rainfall rate r exhibit strong dependence on the temporal resolution at which the analysis is carried out here we aim at developing a new scale invariant relationship relying on the framework of universal multifractals um which is widely used to analyze and characterize geophysical fields that exhibit extreme variability across wide range of scales rainfall data is collected using three optical disdrometers working on different underlying technologies one campbell scientific pws100 and two ott parsivel2 instruments and operated by the hydrology meteorology and complexity laboratory of école des ponts paristech in paris area france they provide access to the size and velocity of drops falling through sampling areas of few tens of cm2 such data enables estimation of rainfall dsd r and ke at various resolutions the temporal variations of this geophysical data over wide range of scales are then characterized in the um framework which was never done for ke a new power law relation is developed and tested against the theoretical framework assuming gamma dsd for describing the dependence between ke and r the developed equation using scale invariant features of um does not rely on gamma dsd assumption performs as well as the existing tools and is valid not only at a single scale but also across scales keywords rainfall intensity rainfall kinetic energy disdrometer multifractal scale invariance gamma dsd 1 introduction 1 1 on the importance of rainfall and kinetic energy understanding the relation between rainfall rate r and kinetic energy ke is essential for accurate determination of various rainfall parameters and understanding their after effects on surrounding ecosystem karlen et al 2003 it has been well established that onsite erosion of soil splash and runoff depends on drop size distribution dsd and fall velocity of the spectrum ellison 1944 fernández raga et al 2017 hence ke and r are primarily used to quantify rainfall erosivity and to estimate erosion rates in universal models towards sustainable land use planning angulo martínez et al 2012 shojaei et al 2020 mohamadi and kavian 2015 erosion heavily affects agricultural sector on on site level it impoverishes the top soil off nutrients and organic matter along with their water holding capacity this in turn increases the use of fertilizers and hence causes pollution at the recipient end of off site erosion further on off site level soil transport by erosion can trigger flood events through silting up of basins and rivers pimentel 2006 enne et al 2000 rainfall erosivity is a key parameter in various erosion models such as us based universal soil loss equation usle smith et al 1962 and its revised version rusle renard 1997 south korean based semma models for calculating soil loss deog park et al 2012 and in european models such as eurosem watem etc that account for sediment transportation along soil loss morgan et al 1998 van oost et al 2000 2008 an advance on usle most of these frameworks use ke as the major quantifying factor for estimating erosivity at spatial scales as rainfall ke represents the total energy available for detachment and transport of soil on surface of impact as direct measurement of ke is limited to specific geographical locations possessing required instrumental capabilities understanding the relationship between ke and the more commonly available rainfall parameter r is important in estimating the former in more places accurate estimation of rainfall ke is also important in understanding and mitigating leading edge erosion lee on wind turbine blades erosion damage reduces aerodynamic performance of blades resulting in reduced annual energy production and increased downtime keegan et al 2013 though lee involves a multitude of atmospheric factors impact velocity and amount of precipitation have been established as some of the major external factors in erosion herring et al 2019 as in soil erosion larger drops with greater mass and vertical terminal velocity causes a disproportionate amount of erosion in lee also rainfall ke helps to quantify the impact of droplets hitting perpendicular to the surface and hence rainfall erosion on blades which is the accumulated aggregate of multiple impacts stochastically distributed over the surface of the coated laminate bech et al 2018 in whirling arm rain erosion test wa ret astm g73 10 2017 liersch et al 2014 dnvgl rp 0171 2014 the industrial standard for measuring durability of leading edge structures specimens are subjected in controlled velocity and rain conditions to assess the damage caused by droplet impacts bech et al 2018 considering the rapid growth of offshore wind industry as sustainable clean energy solution in the americas and asia with monsoon seasons proper representation of ke and r is important in quantifying lee in wind turbines 1 2 review of existing relations and need for a scale invariant representation application of erosion frameworks such as usle or rusle poses uncertainties because of their empirical basis which has single or limited measurement locations and specific methods of data collection these frameworks take ke as the major quantifying factor for erosivity and employ various corrections to mitigate overestimation at low intensity rainfall as smaller droplets are less effective in soil detachment van dijk et al 2002 another commonly used erosivity index is rainfall momentum but it has been shown that for natural rainfall they exhibit similar relationship with rainfall intensity hudson 1971 these models are based on traditional two parameter exponential rain drop size distribution models developed from smaller sample collection methods such as flour pellets or stain paper laws and parsons 1943 marshall and palmer 1948 later studies using multi parameter radiometry and disdrometers have shown improvements in measurement if dsd is assumed to be a three parameter gamma distribution ulbrich 1983 gamma distribution assumes fewer large drops in rain and represents a narrower dsd than the exponential one and thereby reduces the overestimation of ke by the latter for recording dsd and in turn obtaining empirical ke disdrometers are commonly used in meteorological campaigns where fall velocity is either directly measured or estimated from empirical relations gunn and kinzer 1949 atlas et al 1973 there has been various studies towards accurate representation of ke r relationship fox 2004 demonstrates the impact of formulation of dsd in calculation of ke and hence on erosion smith et al 1962 proposed a logarithmic function based on dsd formulation by laws and parsons 1943 and terminal velocity by gunn and kinzer 1949 it was used in modelling erosion in usle which was later replaced by continuous exponential functions in revised usle approach renard 1997 brown and foster 1987 other proposed forms of ke r equations were linear kinnell 1981 sempere torres et al 1998 polynomial carter 1979 and power law park et al 1982 critical literature appraisal by van dijk et al 2002 on various ke r relations lists measurement techniques and procedures sampling biases interpretation methods and storm types as reasons for discrepancies and suggests another exponential based predictive equation more recent reviews such as angulo martínez et al 2015 wilken et al 2018 mineo et al 2019 shows lack of universality among various ke r relationships logarithmic linear power law and exponential using disdrometer measurements and modelling at different geographic stations meteorologic conditions and time aggregation used for calibration most of the empirical formulations express ke as volume specific kinetic energy per unit area and mm of rainfall or ke mm jm 2 mm 1 due to prevalence of non automated measurements and lack of accuracy in determining exposure time but expression of volume specific kinetic energy creates a statistical artefact spurious ratio correlation in ke r relationship due to the inclusion of r mm h 1 in the ke mm expression salles et al 2002 suggests usage of more consistent time specific ke or ke time j m 2 h 1 that has been shown to produce less heteroscedasticity than corresponding ke mm r scatter plots for representing erosion ke time has been expressed as the rate of expenditure of rainfall kinetic energy kinnell 1981 rainfall or kinetic power smith and de veaux 1992 and rainfall kinetic energy flux density steiner and smith 2000 the two expressions are related to each other through rain intensity and hydrological studies usually harmonize ke r relationships with ke time 1 ke time r ke mm in this paper the expressions for ke are derived and analyzed in the form of ke time unless otherwise specified due to variations in methodologies used and dsd characteristics during measurement different functional forms show different behaviour towards ke r estimation though commonly preferred exponential relations have been shown to underestimate ke time for lower intensities of rainfall carollo et al 2015 power laws that predict kinetic energy well at lower intensities tend to overestimate the same for higher intensities logarithmic curves are limited in their usage though they fit low and high intensity ke rather decently van dijk et al 2002 further due to the empirical formulation when it comes to expressing ke time vs r most of these mathematical equations fail to have much physical justification using generalized scaling formulation that expresses various existing dsd models as it s special cases torres et al 1994 sempere torres et al 1998 salles et al 2002 found that power law is the most suitable function to relate ke time and r from a microphysical point of view the parameters prefactor and exponent of power law are related to rain type geographical location and measuring technique shin et al 2016 has proposed a representative power law based on the ideal assumption that the drop size is uniformly distributed under the constant rainfall intensity 1 3 purpose of paper current literature on ke and r lacks a common consensus on the usage of expression that is valid across various scales of measurement hydro meteorological regimes or observation techniques there is an increased focus on research characterizing rainfall microphysics at local and regional scales petan et al 2010 here we examine the variation of ke and r for over 7 years in paris region using continuous data from three disdrometers from two different manufacturers using the framework of universal multifractals um schertzer and lovejoy 1987 efforts were made to characterize the variability of ke time and r on event based and year based analysis and to formulate a scale invariant relation based on power law relationships multifractals allow characterization of complex geophysical fields with a limited number of scale invariant exponents see schertzer and tchiguirinskaia 2020 for a recent review multifractal behaviour of measured rainfall has been abundantly studied previously see gupta and waymire 1990 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1993 deidda et al 1999 olsson et al 1996 garcía marín et al 2008 langousis et al 2009 emmanouil et al 2020 for some examples among others wolfensberger et al 2017 schertzer and lovejoy 2011 used um in climatological analysis of precipitation modelled and actual in relation to external geographical and meteorological descriptors checking the validity of um framework on ke which was never done to the knowledge of the authors is a first goal of the paper the main goal of this paper is to explore the possibility of establishing a physically based scale invariant power law relationship between ke and r using the um framework without having to rely on strong assumptions on dsd shape and compare its performance with more classical approach this article is structured as follows in section 2 the methodology used is detailed first the commonly used framework of gamma distributed dsd which yields a power law relation is reminded along with the associated parameters estimation techniques then the process to identify power law relation in the um framework is explained after a required reminder on the theoretical underlying basis similarly the associated parameters estimation techniques which will be implemented are described section 3 includes details of data collection and quality control results are discussed in section 4 where validity of formulated relation is tested and contrasted over different types of rain events the final section section 5 concludes the study and summarizes the main observations 2 methodology 2 1 theoretical relation assuming gamma distributed dsd 2 1 1 rainfall microstructure and commonly used gamma distribution rainfall is measured and represented as distribution of raindrops in different diameter classes or drop size distribution dsd and their corresponding terminal fall velocity in stable air for meteorological purposes size distribution of raindrops is represented as mean number of drops per unit volume in a particular diameter more precisely equivolumic diameter i e the diameter of a drop with the same volume but a spherical shape range between d and d dd n v d m 3 mm 1 however in hydrological studies dsd measured by ground based devices such as disdrometers or optical spectrometers are represented as mean number of raindrops in a particular diameter range arriving at a surface per unit area per unit time n a d m 2 mm 1 s 1 if effects of wind turbulence and raindrop interactions are neglected n v d and n a d are related as follows uijlenhoet et al 1999 2 n a d v d n v d where v d represents the terminal fall velocity m s 1 as a function of the equivalent spherical diameter of raindrop d mm traditional mathematical expressions describing n v d such as exponential marshall and palmer 1948 weibull best 1950 gamma ulbrich 1983 and lognormal feingold et al 1986 can be expressed as particular case of general formulation proposed by sempere torres et al 1998 for the scope of this paper gamma distribution of dsd which has been recognized to better represent natural rain will be considered ulbrich 1983 in this framework 3 n v d n 0 d μ e λ d where n v d is in m 3 mm 1 d in mm n 0 in m 3 mm 1 μ μ and λ in mm 1 are distribution parameters measuring raindrop concentration mean size and shape of spectrum respectively λ is usually expressed with the help of the median volume diameter d 0 as λ 3 67 μ d 0 2 1 2 theoretical power law relation between r and ke rainfall intensity or rain rate r in mm h 1 can be calculated from n a d using following expression steiner and smith 2000 4 r 3 6 10 3 π 6 0 d 3 n a d dd kinetic energy per unit area per unit time ke time in j m 2 h 1 of falling drops can also be expressed in terms of measured n a d as follows steiner and smith 2000 5 ke 3 6 10 6 π ρ 12 0 d 3 v 2 d n a d dd where ρ is density of water in standard conditions in kg m 3 though there are more sophisticated equations proposed in the literature for v d for simplicity in calculation here we are following the widely used power law formulation by atlas and ulbrich 1977 uijlenhoet 2001 demonstrated it has the only functional form consistent with power law relationship between rainfall related parameters 6 v d c d g c 3 78 m s 1 mm g and g 0 67 with v in m s 1 and d in mm most of the rainfall parameters can be approximated as moments of the dsd and when dsd follows gamma model the n th moment m n can be computed as atlas and ulbrich 1977 7 m n 0 d n n d d d n 0 λ μ n 1 γ μ n 1 where γ α is the complete gamma function 8 γ α 0 x α 1 e x dx where α 0 substituting eqs 2 3 6 and 7 and solving the integral gives reduced expressions for ke and r in terms of gamma function 9 r 6 10 4 π cn 0 γ 4 g μ λ 4 g μ 10 ke 3 6 10 6 ρ π c 3 12 n 0 γ 4 3 g μ λ 4 3 g μ this reduction using gamma function enables representation of ke and r in the form of a power law as follows 11 ke br a where 12 a 4 3 g μ 4 g μ b 5 10 4 ρ c 2 6 π c n 0 10 4 1 a γ 4 3 g μ γ 4 g μ a the final expression follows the same pattern as that by salles et al 2002 based on generalized dsd and that of uijlenhoet et al 1999 based on exponential dsd when μ 0 gamma distribution for dsd becomes a simple marshall and palmer negative exponential parameterization representation of dsd marshall and palmer 1948 with eq 11 becoming ke 8 539 r 1 287 same values were obtained for exponent a and pre factor b using the general function proposed by salles et al 2002 for marshall and palmer approximation closer value of exponential coefficient were also reported by uijlenhoet et al 1999 in a power law formulation based on marshall and palmer 1948 approximation of dsd and power law dependence of rain drop terminal velocity eq 6 atlas and ulbrich 1977 many simplifications were followed in this formulation of ke r relation as a power law eq 11 gamma dsd is notably assumed as well as a power law form for terminal fall velocity as function of diameter this approximation shows limitations at higher values of diameter d 5 mm and doesn t account for atmospheric turbulence or updrafts and downdrafts adirosi et al 2016 effect of truncation errors in measurement is not considered the formulation also ignores the effect of horizontal wind velocity and surface impact angle of rain drops some authors tend to consider normalized spectra of dsd testud 2001 that requires only two parameters to describe the dsd it was also not considered here for the sake of simplicity in deriving a theoretical relation between ke and r it should be noted that although widely accepted as the best representation of natural dsd gamma function also has associated errors that exists outside experimental methodology and sampling adirosi et al 2014 2 1 3 estimation of power law coefficients from gamma dsd parameters as mentioned before most rainfall parameters can be expressed as moments of the dsd according to eq 7 the right hand side of the equation is specific to the non normalized three parameter gamma distribution considered here as shown in eq 3 in practice dsd is not measured continuously but for discrete diameters d i as a consequence the estimated moments m n of order n are computed thanks to the following discrete sum rather than previous integral 13 m n i 1 n class d i n n i d i δ d i mm n m 3 where d i is the diameter of droplet in class i n i d i is the drop size distribution estimation discussed later in eq 26 δ d i is the width of diameter class i and n class the total number of diameter classes investigation of various dsd parameter estimating methods by cao and zhang 2009 highlighted the risk in usage of maximum likelihood and l moment estimators for processing data with truncation in lower end of dsd spectra as all disdrometers are limited by some minimum value of measurable diameter d min 0 it is advisable to use traditional method of moments brawn et al 2008 although the choice of moments for proper parameters estimation with the method of moments is a relevant topic it is outside the scope of this paper hence authors relied on the existing literature more precisely although higher dsd moments are considered to be associated with higher errors the tendency of lower errors with middle order moments was shown later in smith et al 2009 using radar measurements and cao et al 2008 using joint disdrometer radar observations cao and zhang 2009 evaluated the performance of various moment estimators using simulations of gamma dsd with a more realistic estimation of errors and found that second third and fourth moments m234 as the best overall performer for estimating r konwar et al 2014 m234 and huang et al 2021 even higher order moments 2 3 and 6 are some recent examples of using middle order moments while analysing data from same disdrometer make as the one in current study ott parsivel2 hence it was chosen to employ these moments for computing gamma dsd parameters μ n 0 and λ refer eq 7 specific moment equations are provided in the appendix appendix b these parameters are then introduced in eq 12 to derive the expected power law parameters assuming a gamma dsd variation of a and b with dsd parameters is examined with available data set in section 4 for different type of rainfall events 2 2 theoretical relation between multifractal fields in um framework 2 2 1 overview of the theoretical framework the framework of universal multifractals um enables to characterize the extreme variability of geophysical fields across scales with the help of a limited number of parameters with physical meaning schertzer and lovejoy 1987 it relies on the assumption that these fields are generated through an underlying multiplicative cascade such behaviour is assumed to be inherited from the scale invariant features of the navier stokes equations but has not yet been formally showed consequently statistical properties of fields are conserved in all scales in this study time specific kinetic energy and rainfall intensity from disdrometer measurements are analyzed using um review by schertzer and lovejoy 2011 discusses the techniques and methodologies employed in more detail for analysis in um framework the field in consideration is normalized divided by its mean value and its total size in terms of numerical values is restricted to be a power of two the field can be one or two dimensional since current study involves only time series we will be limiting our discussion to single dimension let us consider a normalized conservative field an additional parameter for non conservative fields is introduced later λ at resolution λ resolution λ is the ratio of l the outer scale to l the observational scale let us first consider the occurrence pattern of the field i e the same field with 1 for strictly positive values and 0 otherwise if the field is fractal then the probability p that a segment of length l intersects the field p is the probability of occurrence of non zero elements in the total binary field scales with resolution as follows 14 p λ d f λ d λ c f where c f d d f the fractal co dimension of the field the fractal dimension d f indicates how the binary field rain and no rain in this case fills the available space in a scale invariant way as d is constant in order to fully characterize the field a value of d f for each threshold is required this is the intuitive notion of multifractality in order to be mathematically consistent this characterization should actually be done with the help not of a direct threshold at the maximum resolution but with a scale invariant threshold called singularity γ and their corresponding codimension function c γ as 15 p λ λ γ λ c γ above equation implies that statistical moments q of the field scale with resolution schertzer and lovejoy 1987 schertzer and lovejoy 1988 are 16 λ q λ k q where k q is the moment scaling function related to c γ by legendre transform parisi et al 1985 for a conservative field in um framework k c q can be fully characterized with only two parameters multi fractality index α and mean intermittency codimension c 1 17 k c q c 1 α 1 q α q c 1 measures clustering of average intensity across scales when the field is homogeneous c 1 is equal to zero α measures how this clustering changes with respect to intensity levels α 0 2 larger values of both corresponds to stronger extremes simulations of such fields can be obtained by generating a levy noise with parameter α coloring it to introduce c 1 and then taking the exponential which yields solely non negative values for a non conservative field ϕ λ i e a field whose average ϕ λ changes with scales a non conservative parameter h is used in expression of scaling 18 ϕ λ λ λ h where is a conservative field characterized with c 1 and α positive h represents a smoother field which needs to be fractionally differentiated for obtaining a conservative field conversely negative h represents a field in need of fractional integration for retrieving conservative field h is related to the spectral slope β which gives a measurement of the correlation range larger β means higher contribution of large scale phenomenon in variability of data 19 β 1 2 h k c 2 2 2 2 estimation of scaling behaviour and um parameters the quality of scaling of multifractal fields can be examined using trace moment tm where log log plot of upscaled fields against resolution λ is taken for each moment q eq 16 for multifractal fields the plot is a straight line with moment scaling function k q as slope quality of the scaling is given by the estimate r 2 of the linear regression the value for q 1 5 is used as reference double trace moment dtm is a more robust version of tm tailored for um fields where the moment scaling function k q η of the field λ η obtained in practice by raising to power η at the maximum resolution and then upscaling it is expressed as a function of multifractality index α lavallée et al 1993 20 λ η q λ k q η λ η α k q from the above equation value of α can be obtained as the slope of the linear part when k q η is represented for a given q as a function of η in log log plot 2 2 3 power law relations in um framework and practical implementation if a field is um then a power law relation of it is also a um field with coefficients depending upon initial um parameters the reasoning for power law comes from the dtm analysis in um framework tessier et al 1993 lovejoy et al 2008 consider two multifractal fields ε 1 and ε 2 that are power law related by an exponent a and a prefactor b as below 21 ε 1 b ε 2 a from exponents in eq 20 k q of ε 1 can be expressed as follows 22 ε 1 q ε 2 a q λ k ε 2 q a k ε 1 q k ε 2 q a a α ε 2 k ε 2 q expanding k q with um parameters as in eq 20 23 c 1 ε 1 α ε 1 1 q α ε 1 q a α ε 2 c 1 ε 2 α ε 2 1 q α ε 2 q from above equation we can deduce that for if a power relation exists the um parameters are related as follow 24 α ε 1 α ε 2 α c 1 ε 1 a α c 1 ε 2 in this study both ke and r time series were analysed using um framework as the um model discussed here is solely non negative it removes all possibility of having non negative values for both fields in analysis using their um parameters in eq 24 it is possible to formulate power law relationship in the format of eq 21 it has the same shape as the theoretical power law obtained using moments of the dsd in section 2 1 in eq 11 details of disdrometer data collection and subsequent multifractal analysis are covered in upcoming sections 3 data collection and instrumentation 3 1 measurement campaigns for this study continuously monitored data in natural conditions was obtained from three optical disdrometers operating with two different principles the devices are part of the taranis observatory extreme and multi scale raindrop paris observatory gires et al 2018 of the fresnel platform of école des ponts paristech https hmco enpc fr page fresnel platform en and are operated by hydrology meteorology and complexity laboratory of école des ponts paristech hm co enpc table 1 gives a brief outline of measurement campaigns locations are shown in fig 1 from november 2016 to september 2017 the instruments were moved to école polytechnique ep on sirta site instrumenté de recherche par télédétection atmosphérique for a joint intensive measurement campaign over the ile de france region the aforementioned location is about 38 km away from enpc towards south west of paris to summarise the measurements presented in the following sections involve two different types of optical disdrometers and data collected from two different locations of paris region 3 2 overview of instrument functioning and outputs the three optical disdrometers used here are two ott parsivel2 see battaglia et al 2010 or the device documentation ott 2014 and one pws 100 see ellis et al 2006 or the device documentation campbell scientific ltd 2012 the ott parsivel2 are occlusion based devices with a transmitter that creates laser sheet and an intercepting receiver directly aligned with it the size equivolumic diameter and fall velocity are assessed from changes decrease in amplitude of intensity and duration of the decrease in received laser intensity due to the passing of rainfall drops through a sampling area of 54 cm2 an ellipsoidal shape model with a standard relation between the axis ratio and the equivolumic diameter are assumed for drops in the process the pws100 consists of a transmitter that generates four horizontal parallel laser sheets and two receptors which are not aligned with the transmitter the signal received by each receptor corresponds to the light refracted by drops and contains four consecutive peaks associated with each laser sheet from the delay between those peaks fall velocity and diameter of the drops are estimated pws100 has a sampling area of 40 cm2 computations assuming spherical shape of droplets are performed here with a later correction for oblateness before final result generation gires et al 2017 both disdrometers have a collection time step of 30 s and provide main output as a matrix containing the number of drops n i j recorded during the time step δ t according to classes of equivolumic diameter index i defined by a centre d i and a width δ d i both expressed in mm and fall velocity index j and defined by a centre v j and a width δ v j both expressed in m s 1 for parsivel2 there are 32 classes of δ d i from 0 062 mm to 24 5 mm and δ v j from 0 05 m s 1 to 20 8 m s 1 and for pws the same ranges from 0 05 to 27 2 δ d i mm and 0 05 to 27 2 δ v j m s 1 in 34 classes width of diameter and velocity classes are not similar for all classes as they are designed to be more and more refined towards smaller values from the raw matrix the studied rainfall parameters rain rate drop size distribution and time specific kinetic energy were obtained using following expression for each time steps 25 r π 6 δ t i j n i j d i 3 s eff d i 26 n d i 1 s eff d i δ d i δ t j n i j v j 27 ke ρ wat π 6 δ t i j n i j d i 3 v j 2 s eff d i where s eff d i is the sampling area of disdrometer in mm2 δ t is the time step duration in hr and ρ wat is the volumic mass of water 10 3 kg m 3 n d i δ d i gives the number of drops with a diameter in the class i per unit volume in m 3 details of the devices their functioning and data collection can be found in gires et al 2018 3 3 data quality and filtering for the data presented in this paper filters suggested by various authors kruger and krajewski 2002 thurai and bringi 2005 jaffrain and berne 2012 gires et al 2018 were used to remove possible non meteorological measurements from environmental factors such as splashing horizontal wind etc on the basis of size and velocity of drops using the disdrometer data set two series of multifractal analysis were performed event based and year based for event based analysis individual rainfall events were identified with following criteria in rain intensity time series rainfall events with a cumulative depth greater than 0 7 mm and separated by at least 15 min of dry weather before and after from all measured events with this condition rain rate r drop size distribution dsd and kinetic energy ke were calculated for the three disdrometers denoted pars 1 pars 2 and pws hereafter from the results further filtering was done to remove events having a percentage of nan values not a number blank missing data 1 and r 2 value 0 9 for both ke and r remaining nans were then replaced with 0 in year based methodology continuous time series from jan 2016 to dec 2019 including rain and no rain conditions were used for multifractal analysis and results were compiled according to the year of measurement there were minor lapses in continuity of data measurement from jun 2013 to dec 2015 for that reason those time periods were not considered in continuous year based analysis to avoid possible measurement biases however since selection of individual events are not affected by that event based analysis involves data from jun 2013 to dec 2019 lesser number of events can be observed in the excluded years for year based analysis in table 2 between 2016 and 2019 there were also a few days of maintenance where data was not recorded 27 sep 2017 to 26 dec 2017 01 to 07 jan 2018 and 12 to 14 apr 2019 after quality control for each disdrometer a total of 214 665 time steps were analysed in 556 rain events total 1610 events counting all three disdrometers data was not always available for all the disdrometers hence the lesser number from 2013 to 2019 for event based analysis in year based analysis a total of 3 919 680 time steps were considered from 2016 to 2019 percentages of rainy time steps were about 7 6 6 and 5 7 for pars 1 pars 2 and pws respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 overview of analysis for analysing the ke and r time series using um framework as explained in previous sections two strategies were followed event based analysis and year based analysis for event based analysis we identified a total of 556 rainfall events between 28 sep 2013 and 31 dec 2019 of which 493 events were common among all three disdrometers for um analysis each time series was resized to the highest power of two in such a way that the trimmed series accommodated maximum rainfall cumulative depth and then the field was normalized after resizing for um analysis length of individual events ranged from 64 to 2048 time steps where each time step corresponds to 30 s i e the recording time step of disdrometers used ke and r from each events were analyzed as separate fields in um framework for year based methodology similar procedure was followed for um analysis on year long continuous time series for the years from 2016 to 2019 in coming subsections estimation of um parameters and power law relations are illustrated using one event data for event based analysis and one year data for year based analysis power law coefficients were also estimated using theoretical framework with dsd parameters as mentioned in section 2 1 variation and correspondence among coefficients determined by um and dsd parameters are discussed thereafter and validated with data 4 2 multifractal analysis of events for illustration of the analysis carried out one event from 2017 for pars 1 disdrometer that occurred on 16 september between 11 35 00 and 13 00 00 local time is presented here fig 2 a displays the time series of r and ke for this event as well as ke vs r plots the latter also shows power law fits with coefficients from um analysis and dsd parameters explained later in this section for this event 171 time steps were trimmed to 128 time steps along region of maximum rain occurrence of which 124 were rainy data points trimmed and normalized ke and r were then subjected to analysis using um framework discussed in section 2 2 initial analysis indicated values of non conservative parameter h greater than 0 5 among many events hence to retrieve a conservative field on which the um analysis can be implemented without bias fluctuations of ke and r time series were used lavallée et al 1993 characterization of variability in ke field for the event considered here can be seen in fig 2b with tm eq 16 in log log plot dtm graphs eq 20 in log log plot and um parameter values as shown in tm and dtm graphs the field exhibits a very good multifractal behaviour with a single scaling regime from 30 s to 64 min for example tm coefficient of determination r 2 for q 1 5 was greater than 0 99 values of um parameters α c 1 and h for ke of this particular event were 1 820 0 311 and 0 547 respectively it should be mentioned that h computed on the fluctuations of ke was found to be equal to 0 189 meaning the taking the fluctuations indeed enabled retrieval of a conservative field from the original smoother field r also exhibited excellent scaling behavior and corresponding values of um parameters α c 1 and h for this event were 1 655 0 229 and 0 100 respectively ke and r analyzed from every event exhibited similar multifractal characteristics with a unique scaling regime the quality of scaling was examined using coefficient of determination r 2 for q 1 5 in tm analysis and as previously mentioned events with values 0 9 were discarded 9 8 percentage of total events were rejected on this basis for the events with good scaling behaviour robust retrieval of multifractal parameters α c 1 β and h was possible for example the assessed values of α and c 1 for both ke and r time series exhibited a maximum standard deviation using various values of q in dtm analysis of 0 0584 and 0 0670 for measurement at ep sirta and 0 0446 and 0 0443 for measurements at enpc fig 3 displays the values of multifractality index α and mean intermittency c 1 for all the studied events for both fields it appears that the values of α for ke and r are rather well distributed along the bisector this pattern suggests a power law relation between these two quantities as discussed in section 2 2 eq 21 where ε 1 and ε 2 are ke and r respectively i e ke br a as in eq 11 the exponent of the power law a was deduced from corresponding α and c 1 values of um fields ke and r for every event subjected to um analysis using the expected relations for power law related um fields i e eq 24 the α used is the average of α ke and α r which were anyway similar value of prefactor b was estimated by fitting eq 11 at maximum resolution with estimated values of a on event s ke r graph for the event used as illustration we found a 1 083 and b 11 493 this power law fit from um parameters is displayed in fig 2a as ke um in the ke vs r graph variation of computed power law exponent a and prefactor b are also shown in fig 3 as time series of events for each year graphs of remaining years are provided in appendix a for 3 5 of total events filtered estimates of α was found to be greater than the theoretical maximum 2 however a values for those events were found to be consistent with the overall average despite appreciable variability in um parameters across events values of a and b showed overall stability in the short range of values specified in graphs suggesting robustness of the estimates year wise average values over the events for a and b and number of events for all three disdrometers are given in table 2 average values of power law parameters from the events that were common between the three disdrometers are also shown in the same table comparable values of a and b were observed in both cases a clear range of variation can be observed between the two types of disdrometers for both parsivel2 the average a and b were similar and around 1 22 and 8 17 respectively while for pws100 a values were consistently lower than that of parsivel2 at around 1 17 and b values greater at 13 02 pws generally registered slightly higher intensities than pars 1 and pars 2 it should be mentioned that a and b seem to show a very rough correlation where values of b decreases with increase in values of a but between make of instruments irrespective of the type and number of events values of a remains rather constant differences in values obtained between parsivel2 and pws is expected due to operational differences between disdrometers such effects are also reported in johannsen et al 2020 who showed biases in measurement and subsequent r ke relation due to difference in type of sensors used three optical disdrometer were used angulo martínez et al 2015 also highlighted some differences among various parsivel2 4 3 multifractal analysis of continuous data year based analysis to illustrate year based analysis continuous time series and um analysis for pars 1 disdrometer for the year 2017 is shown in fig 4 both ke and r fields showed similar multifractal features scaling behaviour of ke is shown in fig 4b a unique scaling regime from 30 s to 311 days was considered variation of um parameters α and c 1 between ke and r fields as well as values of power law exponent a and prefactor b computed by fitting the relation at maximum resolution are displayed in fig 5 precise values of a and b according to the year of measurement are given in table 3 the curve ke um in the ke vs r graph of fig 4a shows the power law fit using um parameters for continuous data of 2016 for pars 1 values and trend of variation are similar to that observed for the event based analysis this confirms the robustness of the discussed power law which is valid and retrieved not only at the event scale but also at the year scale 4 4 power law coefficients from dsd parameters to understand previous findings further values of a and b were computed from theoretical framework discussed in section 2 1 rainfall dsd was assumed to follow gamma distribution eq 3 and theoretical values of a and b denoted as a dsd and b dsd from here on for clarity were computed as per eq 12 after estimating values of gamma dsd parameters μ n 0 and λ with the help of method of moments the variation of rain rate r was accurately reproduced using m234 moment estimators fig 8d for example theoretical power law relation ke dsd b dsd r a dsd was then compared with the one estimated using um analysis represented from here on as ke um with coefficients a um and b um for clarity for every events average values of dsd parameters estimation error and corresponding a dsd and b dsd for pars 1 events are given in table 4 according to event s rain type definition introduced later rmse dsd is the root mean square error rmse between empirical dsd and theoretical gamma dsd with fitted parameters using the value for the center of each diameter class d i it is used here as an indicator of the quality of fit of the assumed gamma dsd distribution and the empirical one for rmse estimation only the portion of dsd above 0 5 mm diameter class was considered as smaller drops have lesser contribution in overall ke and r and are associated with greater uncertainties in measurement also higher size drops above 9 mm diameter class were not observed during the events and are hence not shown in dsd figures discussed after fig 6 and fig 8 fig 6 represents two extremes cases among events from year 2019 for pars 1 one event fig 6a where empirical dsd corresponds with a gamma distribution and one event fig 6b where it does not the dsd fitting as well as the ke vs r plots fitted with power law relation from um analysis and dsd extraction are also displayed for the event with empirical dsd closer to estimated gamma dsd both power law relations ke um ke dsd are similar and show good fit for the other event power law relation from dsd approach shows a considerable deviation from actual values of ke with a strong overestimation power law from um analysis on the other hand still provides a close fit to see if there is such a trend through all the events coefficient of determination of both ke r fits were plotted against each other r um 2 vs r dsd 2 and compared using corresponding values of rmse dsd fig 7 a negative value of coefficient of determination for dsd r dsd 2 is due to the high difference between ke dsd and empirical ke in certain events from the plot it is evident that a generalized conclusion theoretical values of a and b a dsd b dsd works well in cases where empirical dsd coincides with gamma dsd is not possible however there were many events with good dsd correspondence with gamma where ke dsd fitted data better to investigate further this issue and given that the dsd is available for all time steps a dsd and b dsd were computed for each time step to study their variations within a rainfall event fig 8 displays their temporal evolution for the event in fig 2 values of parameters especially b dsd shows considerable variation within an event these variations basically come from variations in dsd parameters μ an n 0 as it can be seen on fig 8c and 8f also evident from eq 12 which are reflecting physical variations in the rainfall process it should be mentioned that during this event and other events gamma dsd parameters were able to properly reproduce observed rain rate fig 8d meaning that the assumption of gamma dsd distribution and the m234 moment estimator approach remains valid throughout the event s this suggests that the variability of a dsd and b dsd observed at event scale is also valid within events at much smaller scales this could explain some of the bias previously observed with dsd approach developed in this paper as there were still considerable variation in r 2 values of r ke dsd 2 fig 7a especially if we compare with ke um which shows better r ke um 2 regardless the type of event a question of possible bias arises due to difference in methods of estimation of power law coefficients unlike ke dsd for which both coefficients are obtained from theoretical relation involving dsd parameters for ke um only coefficient a is fully estimated from um analysis prefactor b um is obtained by fitting the data at highest available resolution 30 s using um estimated a um such discrepency may introduce a bias in the comparison between dsd and um approach to retrieving a power law hence to understand this further and to make a fair comparison a new power law was considered where only a dsd is obtained using eq 12 while b dsd is calculated from fitting of data denoted hereafter b dsdfit ke dsdfit fig 7b shows r 2 between ke dsdfit and ke um and it can be seen that comparable fits are obtained between um and dsd power laws regardless the nature of dsd thus illustrating the presence of bias this can also be observed in previous ke r plots fig 2a fig 4a fig 6a and fig 6b 4 5 comparison between ke r relations though the power law obtained is similar from um and dsd analysis they fit the data differently due to difference in values of corresponding parameters ke dsd in ke vs r graph of fig 2a and fig 4a shows the power law fit using theoretical a and b a dsd b dsd from dsd parameters for illustrated examples in event based and year based analysis the difference in fit between two calculations of power law ke um and ke dsd can be observed there it can be seen from fig 7a that ke um gives rather good fit regardless the event specific dsd shape while r 2 value of ke dsd fluctuates however there is a limited tendency for good fit towards empirical dsd following gamma distribution for few events like fig 6 fig 9 shows variation of a and b estimates from dsd and um for pars 1 pars 2 and pws for all events in year 2019 values of a um and a dsd are mostly clustered around the approx 1 2 for all three disdrometers with no clear relation between them on the other hand values of b um and b dsd are more spread out ranging approximately from 2 to 25 such spreading for b dsd is not caused by the computation issues previously mentioned since it is visible on both b dsd and b dsdfit this observed scattering which is comparable regardless the estimation techniques and device suggests that even if the power relation between ke and r remains relevant for all events its parameters exhibit strong variability between events the constants of the power law relations in literature between ke and r are not universal in application and need tweaking as per the rainfall type measurement location as well as techniques based on assumed dependence between dsd parameters and rain rate in formulation exponents salles et al 2002 suggest four range of values for exponent values of the universal power law and uijlenhoet et al 1999 propose six different relationships in their research hence in order to refine the analysis of this observed variability between events and to examine possible dependence of a and b on type of rain events were sorted according to rain types table 4 shows for pars 1 averaged values of gamma dsd parameters indicator of the quality of the fitting and power law coefficients from both dsd and um estimations across events sorted according to type of rainfall tables for pars 2 and pws are given in appendix table b 1 for defining types of rainfall from light to extreme a classification based on intensity tokay and short 1996 was employed μ λ and n 0 tend to decrease with heavier events with a stronger trend for n 0 it should be mentioned that an opposite trend is reported in reference used this could be due to instrumental bias in dsd measurement as the impact disdrometer used in reference is known to under represents smaller drops in intense rainfall it should also be noticed that the capacity of the gamma distribution to model observed dsd diminishes with heavier rainfall this is more visible on rmse estimation over whole range of dsd and less prominent in displayed estimate here involving only higher drop sizes suggesting a limit in validity for gamma distribution assumption also an increase in mean diameter is noticed not shown here these findings are in agreement with previous studies reported in literature giuseppe and vito et al 2015 when it comes to power law coefficients both a dsd and b dsd show increase with increasing rain rate and this is more pronounced for b dsd given the observed decrease in validity of gamma distribution of dsd these trends should be taken carefully because they are likely to be mere artifacts and not representative of the actual process at stake in the case of um estimated parameters b um follows similar trend with stronger magnitude going from 8 to 33 while a um shows slight reduction in value with increasing rain rate from 1 25 to 1 05 since the average rainfall criteria used for classification here is a somehow arbitrary and more biased towards lesser rainfalls another classification relying on the maximum of 10 min moving average was also employed the results are tabulated in table b 2 appendix b with this criteria which is more biased towards larger rainfall events consistent and similar results are retrieved when it comes to values and variation of power law coefficients a and b from dsd as well as um suggesting robustness of obtained trends to evaluate the performance of established power law relationship across scales of measurement ke was calculated from empirical r using ke br a with average values of a and b and compared with existing relations in literature for this purpose exponential equation used in rusle ke bf 29 1 0 72 exp 0 05 r brown and foster 1987 exponential equation used in rusle2 ke mg 29 1 0 72 exp 0 082 r c mcgregor et al 1995 universal exponential law proposed by van dijk et al 2002 ke vd 28 3 1 0 52 exp 0 0421 r and ideal power law proposed by shin et al 2016 ke shin 10 3 r 11 9 were used alongside ke um and ke dsd derived here power law where fitted values of b were used ke dsdfit is also included for um and dsd power laws in this paper average values among all calculated events were used for representation according to make of disdrometers average values of coefficient a and prefactor b were close for both pars 1 and pars 2 disdrometers and were taken common for the parsivel2 make for both um and dsd it is also logical to keep values of power law coefficients separate between different disdrometers as varying ke and r estimation has been reported across types of disdrometers used angulo martínez et al 2015 angulo martínez et al 2018 johannsen et al 2020 fig 10 shows ke and r variation fitted with above mentioned equations for maximum resolution 30 s as expected ke um provides better fit than ke dsd and ke dsdfit shows closer fits with respect to empirical data um power laws exhibit for all three devices slightly better or comparable coefficient of determination r 2 with regards to commonly used relations the exponential equations from literature appear very close to each other the relatively lower values of coefficient of determination than that during event based fits are likely to be due to the effect of using average values instead of event specific values of a and b to understand the performance of various equations further r 2 was examined across various time periods and also across different type of rains results are displayed in fig 11 it appears that regardless of the duration as well as type of rainfall considered tuned relations ke dsdfit and ke um perform significantly better than the other fixed ones yielding r 2 values greater than 0 9 in most cases ke um exhibits slightly better performances with a difference not significant the analysis also confirmed the poor performance of ke dsd i e the inability of the dsd approach to properly fit the prefactor b it should be stated that the power law obtained using um analysis is not providing significant performance enhancement compared to that obtained from gamma dsd while the prefactor b is estimated from fitting of the data ke dsdfit however with um analysis it is possible to discard all assumptions of dsd following a gamma distribution thus eliminating the known inadequacy of gamma model and its sensitivity to sampling resolution adirosi et al 2013 adirosi et al 2014 ignaccolo and de michele 2014 adirosi et al 2016 gatidis et al 2020 the inadequacy was observed in current analysis as well as previously discussed and illustrated in fig 6 and fig 7 5 conclusion we examined the relationship between rainfall intensity r and time specific kinetic energy ke using high resolution 30 s optical disdrometer data from the past 7 years in paris region the variability across scales of both parameters was characterized using the framework of universal multifractals analyzed ke and r times series were found to convey excellent multifractal behaviour which is novel for ke with multifractality index α and mean intermittency c 1 suggesting power law relation between them it can be written as ke br a such power law was found to be valid across analyzed data i e independent of the event on whether they are computed on event or yearly basis and of the underlying corresponding drop size distribution some variability in the value of the exponent a and prefactor b is reported according the event and disdrometer type as shown by previous results similar power law can be theoretically obtained when relying on the common assumption of a gamma distribution for the dsd and a power law relation between fall velocity and equivolumic drop diameter ke r relation obtained through um analysis was compared with results found using this common framework and biases were acknowledged despite some exceptions in most cases when a gamma dsd approximation was relevant estimations of power law parameters from the two approaches were found to be consistent when not um approach provided slightly better fit in general but not in a significant manner keeping in mind that the pre factor needs to fitted to data in both cases to ensure a fair comparison thus the newly discussed power law relationship between ke and r retrieved with the help of um framework generalizes previous results and theoretical formulations without having to rely on the ad hoc assumption of a gamma dsd the main underlying assumption of um framework i e that there is an underlying multiplicative process is actually physically based in the sense that comes from the scale invariance features of the navier stockes equations here a um analysis confirmed the validity of this assumption deriving the power law relation in a multifractal framework opens the path to new approaches for simulating ke from simple r measurements given that complete ke measurement is much less available than r one this impact will be investigated further in future work for the future it would hence be interesting to expand the data set across geographical and meteorological conditions to reduce the biases that might have

3418,irrigation is one of the major adaptation strategies to combat the negative impacts of drought on crop yields however during droughts the water resources are limited and determining the exact irrigation amount and its response to crop yields are crucial existing crop yield simulation models are data intensive and a majority of these are point based therefore this study presents a novel integrated modeling framework by using two parsimonious models cropwat an irrigation water requirement simulation model and aquacrop gis a spatial crop yield simulation model to simulate corn and soybean yields under different irrigation application rates during drought years at a spatial scale in the mobile river basin mrb southeast u s to simulate crop yields for drought years first agricultural drought years are identified using an integrated drought index called the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture index spesmi the results indicate that a majority of the basin was affected by mild to extreme droughts during the years 2008 2011 2012 2016 the results of the integrated modeling framework illustrate the potential corn and soybean yields can be increased from 10 to 259 and 20 to 229 respectively under different irrigation water application rates 50 75 and 100 of irrigation water requirement relative to rainfed crop yields at the counties in the mrb during drought years these findings demonstrate the importance of overall irrigation and the integrated modeling framework in devising robust irrigation water management plans in drought affected areas at a spatial scale failure in integrating irrigation water requirement models in crop yield simulations will result in erroneous yield simulations especially during droughts this is salient given projections for frequent and intense droughts globally although the study is focused on mrb the framework developed is applicable for irrigation planners and water managers in any region that experiences mild to extreme droughts as long as the farmers have the ability to adapt the irrigation in their practice given socio economic constraints keywords droughts cropwat aquacrop gis mobile river basin corn soybean 1 introduction drought is a natural phenomenon characterized with below normal water availability and can occur in any region across the world van loon et al 2016 severe and prolonged droughts can have serious implications in agriculture and may result in significant crop yield reductions posing a serious threat to food security hameed et al 2020 park et al 2016 according to a global study by kim et al 2019 during the drought period of 1983 2009 75 of the harvested areas have experienced crop yield loss with an estimated value of 166 billion us dollars additionally lesk et al 2016 showed in a global study that cereal production was reduced by 9 10 due to high temperature and droughts during the period of 1964 2007 in another study in the united states us corn zea mays and soybean glycine max yields were found to be highly correlated with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei with significant yield reductions during intense drought periods peña gallardo et al 2019 similarly zipper et al 2016 analyzed us corn and soybean yield sensitivity to meteorological drought from 1958 to 2007 and concluded that overall droughts resulted in to 13 in crop yield variability especially the southeastern region which was becoming more sensitive over time furthermore ray et al 2018 identified that droughts negatively impacted not only crop yield but also cultivated areas hectarage in texas us where the cotton and corn hectarage declined to 21 and 18 respectively during drought years 2011 2013 compared to 30 year average crop hectarage these negative impacts of droughts on agricultural production have raised serious concerns regarding food security among the science and research community kim et al 2019 yu et al 2018 irrigation is an effective adaptation practice that supplements the additional water unmet from precipitation required by crops globally the irrigated areas have roughly doubled in the last five decades and contributed to a significantly increase in crop yields foley et al 2011 global land use based classification studies have confirmed that irrigated croplands account for 25 of the global cropped area yet it contributes to 43 of the global crop production portmann et al 2010 siebert and döll 2010 a worldwide study on 26 crops reported that if all the rainfed croplands were converted into irrigated lands the global crop production might rise by 20 under the current climate siebert and döll 2010 climate change projection studies have estimated the global irrigated croplands in the future to range from 240 to 800 mha in 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 puy et al 2020 and in the range of 4 5 21 9 mha alone in the us by 2090 mcdonald et al 2013 although these are either country scale or global studies at state scales these projection values are different for instance in alabama georgia and mississippi the rate of increase in the irrigated area is significantly lower than the major cropping belts in the us abbaszadeh et al 2022 gavahi et al 2021 schaible and aillery 2012 there are several factors contributing to this but two major causes are 1 the existence of riparian water rights in alabama and restriction in water use in georgia 100 000 gallons day and 2 high capital investment in irrigation equipment and lack of incentives from the government hollis 2011 several drought indices are developed across the us a few of them focusing on the southeast region specifically agclimate now agroclimate a climate forecast information system for agricultural risk management fraisse et al 2006 comprises of agricultural reference index for drought a drought index for estimating the water stress affecting crop growth woli et al 2012 additionally the us drought monitor and the palmer drought severity index pdsi were also specifically developed in the us all of these indices indicate that the southeast us region has experienced intense and frequent droughts in the past and recently as per us drought monitor in 2012 extreme to exceptional drought and in 2018 severe to extreme drought during cropping seasons gavahi et al 2020 also highlighted the same since droughts are identified to have a negative influence on corn and soybean yields in the us specifically during the crop development periods zipper et al 2016 the states in the southeast us plan to intensify irrigation in the future to avoid crop yield loss furthermore climate projection studies in the region suggest shortages of freshwater boretti and rosa 2019 sun et al 2013 therefore judicious use of irrigation water at regional scale at county level is critical for achieving the potential yield and regional food security especially during droughts evans and sadler 2008 while numerical modeling is an approach to calculating optimal irrigation amount and assessing yields the existing modeling studies are limited to stand alone application of irrigation water requirement iwr estimation models for calculating irrigation amounts and irrigation scheduling he et al 2013 mason et al 2019 additionally the existing crop yield model simulation studies are limited to simulating crop yield based on user defined iwr kephe et al 2021 mubeen et al 2020 yu et al 2018 simulating iwr separately and then forcing these into a crop yield simulation model is a two step process and is tedious although there is a gridded crop model intercomparison simulation dataset which comprises global crop yield data under both rainfed and irrigated conditions müller et al 2019 the spatial resolution of the dataset is too coarse 0 5 arc degree 55 km which limits its application in regional planning and management kim et al 2021 on the other hand a plethora of existing iwr and crop yield simulation studies are generally point scale i e studies are done at a specific location or an experimental station but at a spatial scale e g county level studies are limited since a national or a state scale agricultural planning including agricultural water allocation cannot be done based on point scale studies county scale studies are critical and their importance is undeniable generally crop models such as decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 can simulate the iwr using the water balance approach tsuji et al 1998 however these widely applied models were developed for point based studies and cannot simulate crop yield or iwr at a gridded scale recently alderman 2021 developed a parallel gridded simulation framework for dssat however the input dataset outputs are required generated in netcdf format which is not user friendly increasing its difficulty to use moreover the modeling framework requires several soil characteristic datasets at grid scale i e the infiltration rate and drainage which are available at very coarse spatial resolution 20 25 km limiting its application for county scale studies additionally since the gridded version of dssat simulations is done using message passing interface on high performance computing it requires high expertise to use the model in contrast iwr models such as cropwat smith 1992 are simple and can be shared within multiple cores of a single personal computer for parallel simulation additionally cropwat calculates the amount of irrigation based on the crop water requirement evapotranspiration demand from crops and soil which is primarily dependent on the climatic variables and simple soil characteristics including maximum rooting depth field capacity permanent wilting point and initial soil moisture all are specific for soil types which are readily available at a fine grid scale and can be aggregated at county scale therefore given that the available grid scale global national scale models are spatially coarse data intensive and require high technical expertise a simpler modeling approach that can simultaneously estimate crop yield under different iwr at county scale is paramount in order to address this issue a novel integrated modeling framework was developed in this study utilizing satellite and ground based information to assess the potential increase in crop yields under different levels of irrigation relative to rainfed agriculture the framework was employed for two major cultivated crops corn and soybean under droughts at mobile river basin mrb in the deep south us as a case study where rainfed agricultural practice is dominant additionally the developed framework was employed at county scale which is also another novelty of this study relative to the traditional iwr and crop yield estimation studies which are generally point scale studies the specific objectives are 1 identification of county scale agricultural drought at mrb 2 establishing relationships among drought and rainfed crop yields corn and soybean and 3 developing an integrated modeling framework of iwr and crop yield simulation models to assess the potential increase in crop yield under different irrigation application rates during droughts the findings of this study can be integrated with a robust weekly to seasonal weather prediction system in devising better irrigation water management policies in the region and the novel framework developed is also be applicable at any rainfed agriculture dominant region to combat yield losses encountered during droughts 2 study area and datasets fig 1 displays the study area mrb highlighted within the us the basin spans over four states including tennessee mississippi georgia and alabama comprising approximately 115 200 km2 roughly two thirds of the mrb is contained in alabama the flow in the basin is generated from the upper appalachian plateau located in the north and drains out in the mobile bay in the south forest is the predominant land use comprising approximately 60 of the basin while agriculture and urban areas comprise of 26 and 3 respectively additionally water bodies streams and reservoirs comprise the rest 11 in the basin warner et al 2005 corn is generally sown between mid march and early may and is harvested between mid july and early september usda 1997 similarly soybean is sown between mid may and mid june and harvested between early september and early october balkcom et al 2014 the predominant soil in the basin is sandy loam 20 plant available water paw however the central region of the basin is characterized by a predominant silty loam soil 15 8 paw deb et al 2019 mitchell et al 2004 the average annual discharge of the basin at the mobile bay is approximately 1760 m3s 1 and ranks as the fourth largest discharge in the us the basin is comprised by 101 counties which were considered in this analysis fig 1 the average annual precipitation and temperature range from 1270 to 1524 mm and 15 c in the north to 21 c in the south respectively 65 of the precipitation occurs during the cropping season of corn and soybean the major agricultural crops comprise corn soybean cotton and hay approximately 67 of the cropped area is rainfed while 27 is irrigated and concentrated in georgia 33 6 tennessee 3 5 and mississippi 44 4 states nrcs 2017 the most grown corn cultivar variety in mrb is pioneer 1319 glass et al 2016 whereas for soybean asgrow 46x6 is mostly grown in alabama and usda n8002 is grown in georgia tennessee and mississippi states glass et al 2018 in order to pursue the study several datasets were required including meteorological data soil characteristics groundwater data crop specific information and crop management data satellite based actual evapotranspiration etc and soil moisture data the details of the datasets used in the study are provided in table 1 in addition to the above mentioned datasets average county scale crop yield data was collected from the national agricultural statistics service nass united states department of agriculture usda this dataset comprises of the average crop yield from irrigated and rainfed cropping conditions since rainfed corn and soybean yields play a critical role in this study particularly in achieving objective two and calibration validation of the models discussed later additional crop yield datasets were also collected from the state agricultural research centers particularly auburn university alabama agricultural experiment station alabama mississippi state university agricultural and forestry experiment station mississippi university of georgia cooperative extension on crop and soil sciences georgia and university of tennessee institute of agriculture tennessee these research centers publish annual crop yield datasets for both irrigated and rainfed conditions for their several research stations where each research station corresponds to a few counties a simple arithmetic calculation eq 1 is done to estimate the rainfed corn and soybean yield under rainfed conditions for the unreported counties 1 z x y 2 where z is the average crop yield for a county retrieved from nass and is available for all the counties x and y are the irrigated and rainfed crop yields respectively retrieved from the research stations from eq 1 y rainfed crop yield can be calculated for the unreported county as in eq 2 2 y 2 z x it is to be noted that the irrigated crop yield is assumed to be the same as the crop yield reported in the nearby regional research station as per the suggestion of novak et al 2008 3 methods the methods employed in this study can be divided into two phases where phase 1 addresses the first and second objectives and phase 2 addresses the third objective fig 2 furthermore phase 1 can be classified into three stages 1 3 month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture index spesmi was calculated at a county scale within the river basin for the cropping season from march to october for each year 2008 2019 2 the rainfed crop yields were mapped at county scale and 3 relationships among spesmi and detrended crop yields were established at the county scale level where detrending was done by using simple linear regression model quiring and papakryiakou 2003 finally in phase 2 potential avoidance of drought affected rainfed crop yield loss under irrigation was estimated by employing a novel integrated framework of two models at the county scale all of these tasks are provided in detail in the following sections 3 1 calculation of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture index spesmi identifying agricultural drought years was a crucial step in this study and spesmi was used to identify those years spesmi is a non parametric multivariate drought index which was developed by combining the marginal probability distributions of root zone soil moisture and the differenced variable of precipitation and evapotranspiration xu et al 2020 time series of 3 month spesmi was calculated at a grid scale of 12 5 km spatial resolution using the 40 100 cm soil moisture information derived from the noah land surface model of the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 the noah outputs were used due to their superior performance over other model outputs in the deep southern states xia et al 2015 in this study the approach developed by xu et al 2020 was used to calculate grid scale spesmi the spesmi was developed based on the copula function as suggested by masud et al 2015 of the joint probability of root zone soil moisture and the differenced variable of precipitation and evapotranspiration the main merit of this approach is that it can be employed for two different variables with diverse marginal distributions madadgar moradkhani 2013 since xu et al 2020 gave a comprehensive description of the spesmi only a brief introduction is presented in this paper the joint cumulative distribution function cdf among precipitation and the differenced variable is expressed in eq 3 3 p x x y y c f 1 x f 2 y c u 1 u 2 where x and y are soil moisture and the differenced variable of precipitation and evapotranspiration respectively the copula is denoted by c f1 and f2 are the cdfs of x and y respectively prior to the cdf estimation x and y variables were calculated by subtracting the monthly averaged values for each grid for the cropping season since etc was available at a spatial resolution of 500 m it was aggregated at 4 km spatial resolution for consistency with the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism precipitation dataset because prism dataset accounts for physiographic features such as variability in terrain it is considered superior to other datasets molter et al 2021 and hence was used in this study the y variable the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration was further regridded to 12 5 km to match the spatial resolution of the root zone soil moisture all of these conversions were done using arcpy scripts the calculated spesmi outputs representing each grid of 12 5 km spatial resolution were averaged at county scale using the zonal statistics tool in arcpy programming to represent the county specific spesmi values additionally in order to determine agricultural drought year 3 month spesmi outputs march to october crop growing season for each county were calculated and then temporally averaged for the duration representing yearly mean spesmi from 2008 to 2019 similar to the drought classification of standardized soil moisture index ssmi and standardized precipitation index spi by mckee et al 1993 spesmi was classified into eight categories which are given in table 2 the agricultural drought year in this study was defined as the year with over 50 of counties experiencing any drought of intensity more than mild dry conditions table 2 in this study normal precipitation year was defined as the years when over 65 of counties comprised of spesmi values were within the range of 0 49 to 0 50 3 2 spatial and temporal mapping of rainfed crop yields before establishing the relationship between drought and crop yields identifying spatial and temporal variations of the crop yield was essential therefore county scale annual rainfed corn and soybean yields were extracted from the national agricultural statistics service nass united states department of agriculture usda and plotted to represent their spatial and temporal variability the time period considered to assess this variability was from 2008 to 2019 several county specific yield values of the nass dataset of 2008 and 2009 were missing and hence the multiple imputation approach rubin 1987 was employed to infill the missing values in the multiple imputation approach first the missing values were replaced by random imputed values which were sampled from the predictive distribution of the observed data these imputations were done to generate multiple datasets secondly standard statistical methods were used to fit a model regression to each imputed dataset finally outputs of the multiple models were combined to generate the single imputed value the multiple imputations were identified to be the most appropriate method in imputing missing crop yield data of nass and further details on this approach can be found in lokupitiya et al 2006 3 3 relationship among spesmi and detrended rainfed crop yield generally crop yields are associated with stochastic trends and climate variability schauberger et al 2018 the stochastic trend component reflects the contribution of several factors including management practices and technological advances whereas the climate variability component includes climate disasters can induce high frequency fluctuations such as droughts affecting the crop yield which is the focus of this study lu et al 2017 to establish the relationship between the drought index and crop yields it is crucial to remove the trend component from the yield values therefore based on the finding of yu et al 2018 the hodrick prescott hp filter was applied on time series of rainfed corn and soybean yield data the details of the hp filter algorithm can be found in harvey trimbur 2008 in this study hpfilter code within mfilter package in r programming language was run across all the counties to detrend the corn and soybean yields post detrending the yield values the pearson correlation coefficient was derived among time series of annual spesmi values and detrended corn and soybean yields at the county scale the correlation coefficient is a measure of the drought impacts on rainfed crop yields 3 4 modeling crop yield under irrigation during drought years since field experimental trials to assess water requirement are painstaking and time consuming in this study a coupled modeling approach of integrating a deterministic iwr model cropwat 8 0 fao 1992 and a water driven spatial crop yield simulation model aquacrop gis fao 2017 steduto et al 2009 was developed to assess the potential increase in crop yields under irrigation relative to rainfed yields during the drought years 3 4 1 models description to pursue this study the models chosen were cropwat 8 0 and aquacrop gis cropwat is one of the robust and widely used iwr estimation models and hence is used in this study moreover the aquacrop gis model was chosen for crop yield estimation since it is a water driven model and since this study deals with drought water stress it was the best fit more details on the model are given below 3 4 1 1 cropwat 8 0 cropwat is a microsoft windows based computer program developed by the food and agricultural organization fao for irrigation planning and management the specific applications of this model include calculating reference evapotranspiration eto crop specific actual evapotranspiration crop water requirement crop irrigation requirement and irrigation scheduling the model calculates reference evapotranspiration by employing the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 then eto is further used to calculate the etc in eq 4 4 e t c k c e t o where etc is actual crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 eto is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 and kc is crop coefficient daily root zone soil water balance is employed in the computation of the iwr and the outputs are calculated at 10 days intervals additionally the irrigation schedule accounting for the amount and irrigation timing is also stored separately for the cropping season the model requires daily climate data precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed soil data maximum rooting depth field capacity permanent wilting point and initial soil moisture and crop information crop type planting and harvesting dates and days of each crop stage the model also requires four parameters to be calibrated for optimal model performance these parameters are primarily the crop coefficients kc eq 4 during different crop growth stages which are initial kcini development kcdev middle kcmid and late kclat the model also allows users to couple with an external model parameterization software or algorithm for model optimization although the model has several outputs as mentioned above the main outputs used in this study were the iwr and irrigation scheduling further details on the model can be found in fao 1992 3 4 1 2 aquacrop gis aquacrop gis is a spatial scale user defined spatial information required either grid scale or administrative level crop yield simulation model that uses the widely used water driven aquacrop model in its core the model is a microsoft windows based program to simulate the crop yield at a user defined spatial scale seven classes of datasets are required for yield simulation these datasets include crop information details of the soil initial condition soil type data groundwater table data management details including planting weeding irrigation and harvesting dates weather data precipitation temperature and eto and study area map shp format file the versatility applicability deb et al 2015 shrestha et al 2014 and the lesser input data requirement babel et al 2019 of the aquacrop model is the primary reason for its selection in this study the model uses normalized water productivity and the ratio of transpiration to eto to calculate above ground biomass eq 5 also the yield is considered and calculated as a function of reference harvest index and above ground biomass eq 6 5 b k s b w p t r e t o 6 y f h i h i o b where b is above ground biomass kg m 2 ksb is air temperature stress coefficient wp is normalized water productivity kg m 2 mm 1 tr is transpiration mm day 1 eto is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 y is crop yield kg m 2 fhi is the adjustment factor for all stresses affecting crop yield hio is the reference harvest index and b is above ground biomass further details on the model can be found in steduto et al 2009 3 4 2 integrating irrigation water requirement iwr and crop yield simulation models the spatial estimation of crop yield under irrigation can be assessed by three approaches 1 using a crop yield simulation model with iwr as input either calculated or simulated by another model 2 integration of iwr model and crop yield simulation model and 3 developing a new model code while considering both components i e calculation of iwr and crop yield simulation while the first option is the simplest it is not feasible since the exact amount of iwr under droughts is unknown and manual calculation at a grid or county scale is simply impractical similarly the third option has its own disadvantages including data constraints and computational limitations associated with its testing and validation prior to its application on the other hand the second option provides the flexibility of choosing different models and is more robust since the chosen models are well developed and applied in diverse regions around the world therefore in this study the second option was selected using cropwat 8 0 and aquacrop gis models previously described although the traditional aquacrop model can simulate iwr the percentage of readily available water in the root zone data is not readily available at county scale and requires intensive field laboratory testing moreover scaling up this variable from field laboratory to county grid scale is impractical on the other hand cropwat uses simple soil characteristics particularly total available soil moisture which is constant for a particular soil type and fine resolution soil maps are available and climatic variables such as maximum minimum temperature relative humidity precipitation solar radiation and wind speed to simulate iwr and irrigation scheduling and therefore used in this study more importantly the integrated modeling framework is easy to implement and does not require much technical expertise or intense coding in the integrated modeling framework both the cropwat and aquacrop gis models are loosely coupled to diminish the model component interdependencies and increase the flexibility of the framework as it allows users to altercate the models basically it consists of three major steps 1 stand alone calibration and validation of cropwat and aquacrop gis for normal precipitation years 2 simulation of iwr and irrigation scheduling by cropwat under drought conditions 3 using the iwrs from cropwat as input in aquacrop gis to simulate the crop yield during drought years given that aquacrop gis is a spatial model the model setup within the study domain is relatively simple in terms of model setup compared to the cropwat model where the latter is required to be set for each county in this study 3 4 2 1 model calibration and validation both models were calibrated independently using a the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1994 duan et al 1993 a widely used stochastic global optimization algorithm in this approach first stochastically a sample of points is distributed over the parameter space within the lower and upper bounds every sample point is considered as a member of the population and each individual is characterized by its unique genetic information by altering the genetic information i e the parameter values the population tends to direct towards an optimum which is the optimum of the objective function corresponding to the model simulated values and the observed values the initial sample of the population is also divided into several sub samples also called complexes each combination of complexes produces offspring following the simplex procedure of nelder mead 1965 the likelihood of an individual in reproduction depends on its fitness the older points are then replaced by the offspring this proceeds towards a global optimum which is assisted by a a probability that new points are spontaneously created within the feasible parameter space and b a regular combination of the points into new complexes further details on the sce algorithm can be found in duan et al 1993 since this is a county scale study and the aquacrop gis model consists of over 40 conservative and non conservative model parameters sensitivity analysis is essential to avoid the computational burden first the most crucial parameters 12 in total were identified from the literature deb et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016 followed by a sensitivity analysis table 3 each parameter was adjusted by 15 deb and kiem 2020 uniyal et al 2019 relative to their default value and a model simulation was done for the year 2015 keeping other parameters to their default values based on the percentage change in yield the parameters were classified as high 10 moderate 5 10 and low 5 sensitive parameters based on the range of the absolute value of percent change in the simulated yields corresponding to the changed parameter value relative to the default parameter value the criteria used in this study was set by geerts et al 2009 in this study only the high and moderate sensitive parameters were selected for the model calibration it is to be noted for reducing computation burden the sensitivity analysis was done for only one corn and soybean growing county within the alabama state dallas where both the crops were grown intensively also the sensitivity analysis was done for the pioneer 1319 cultivar of corn grown in the entire mrb and the asgrow 46x6 cultivar of soybean grown in alabama the usda n8002 cultivar of soybean which is mostly grown in tennessee mississippi and georgia states was not used in the sensitivity analysis due to similarity in physiological characteristics with the asgrow 46x6 cultivar the cropwat model consists of four coefficients crop coefficients based on the crop growth stages which are initial development middle and late which were optimized by linking the model with the sce algorithm the aquacrop gis model was calibrated against the annual corn and soybean yield for normal precipitation years 2009 2010 2013 2014 2015 and 2019 and the time series of soil moisture at daily time step for the year 2015 since a majority of the counties received precipitation around the 30 year average rainfall against 1 km downscaled soil moisture 5 cm for conterminous united states conus developed by abbaszadeh et al 2019 since aquacrop gis simulates the soil moisture on a volumetric basis i e m3 m3 the moisture content for the top soil layer 5 cm simulated by aquacrop gis is calculated by multiplying 50 to the volumetric soil moisture simulated by aquacrop gis this results in soil moisture in mm water per 5 cm depth of soil per unit area which is compared against the 1 km downscaled soil moisture cropwat model was calibrated against the time series moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 500 m resolution etc data mod16a2 available at the 8 day interval for the year 2013 since the year was a normal precipitation year both models were calibrated at county scale and the spatially varying calibration parameters were stored with county ids in two data frames one for cropwat and another for aquacrop gis for use in simulation post calibration both models were also validated at the study basin since the time series of crop yield data was limited aquacrop gis model was validated against time series of volumetric soil moisture content derived from abbaszadeh et al 2019 for the year 2018 normal precipitation year and not to overlap the year for cropwat calibration at county scale similarly for cropwat validation at county scale the model simulated time series etc was compared against 8 day modis etc for the same year 2018 for evaluation of the model performance nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and correlation coefficient were used further details on these evaluation metrics can be found in moriasi et al 2007 3 4 2 2 simulating irrigation water requirement iwr and irrigation scheduling for drought years once the cropwat model was calibrated at each county for the year 2013 the model was used in simulating the iwr and irrigation scheduling for the drought years derived from the step described in section 3 1 over the entire basin the time variant input variables i e precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were used only for the cropping duration i e from march to october for each year in the simulation 3 4 2 3 integrating cropwat and aquacrop gis a schematic representation of the integration of both models is shown in fig 3 as mentioned earlier both models were loosely coupled in the integrated simulation phase where the outputs of the cropwat model were forced in the aquacrop gis model post calibration of the cropwat model the input variables climate soil and crop data were forced into the model for simulating the iwr of the crops for the drought years the model simulates iwr at 10 day intervals and the county scale 10 day period iwr was calculated additionally the model also simulates irrigation scheduling where the amount of irrigation water and the timing of irrigation are calculated based on the irrigation amount calculated in this step the irrigation water application rates were calculated for 50 75 and 100 full of the net irrigation requirement these irrigation water application rates were calculated for each county and values were stored into time series of ascii files for the cropping season corresponding to the irrigation timing it is worth mentioning that the cumulative irrigation water amount simulated from the irrigation scheduling step throughout the cropping season gives the total iwr in the following step the calibrated aquacrop gis model was forced with calibrated parameters stored in the data frame along with the input weather variables soil crop groundwater initial soil water crop management data the county shapefile and the time series of ascii files with irrigation information the final outputs from the model were county scale corn and soybean yield under 50 75 and 100 iwr for the drought years the simulated yields were then compared against the actual county scale rainfed yield calculated based on usda nass and regional agricultural research stations the findings are presented in spatial maps for ease of representation 4 results 4 1 identification of drought years fig 4 represents the spatial and temporal variation of the spesmi representing the agricultural drought in the mrb the results indicate that a significant part of the mrb experienced droughts in the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 the drought intensity ranged from mild spesmi 0 50 to severe spesmi 1 99 during the years 2008 and 2011 with severe droughts in the eastern and southern counties for the respective years similarly for 2012 the drought is noted to range from mild to extreme spesmi 2 00 with the eastern counties east alabama and georgia experiencing severe and extreme droughts the year 2016 is relatively milder with central alabama to western georgia experiencing mild to moderate spesmi 1 49 to 1 00 droughts these results are consistent with the findings of xu et al 2020 where droughts within the range of mild to moderate are noted for the states of alabama georgia mississippi and tennessee during 2016 few counties are also noted to experience mild droughts in the years 2009 2015 2017 and 2018 fig 4 however given that the area under drought is 20 of mrb and of mild drought intensity these years are not considered as the drought years in the preceding analysis 4 2 rainfed corn yield fig 5 displays the spatial and temporal variability of rainfed corn yield within mrb the rainfed corn yield is noted to range from 3 0 t ha to 12 9 t ha both spatially and temporally the lowest corn yields are noted for the drought affected counties in the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 overall in mrb the year 2012 is observed to have the lowest corn yield within the range of 3 0 to 6 9 t ha with the minimum values in the eastern counties in georgia state similarly in the year 2011 the lowest yield is also noted within the same range of 2012 but for the southern counties for the year 2016 the entire state of alabama except for a few counties in the western region and all georgia are noted to have an average yield ranging from 4 0 to 6 9 t ha during non drought years interestingly a lower yield is also noted for the state of alabama relative to mississippi western region and georgia for example in the case of 2013 normal precipitation year georgia and mississippi are noted to have an average yield ranging from 8 0 to 8 9 t ha and 7 0 8 9 t ha respectively whereas alabama consists of an average yield ranging from 6 0 to 6 9 t ha except 4 counties in the east similar lower yields in alabama can also be observed for the years 2010 2015 2018 and 2019 this poor yield can be attributed to the poor crop management strategies such as weeding fertigation pesticide application etc including hand weeding is practiced within the state of alabama molnar et al 2011 duzy et al 2016 nevertheless drought affected counties over the whole mrb experience reduced rainfed corn yield within the study period 4 3 rainfed soybean yield the areal average rainfed soybean yield for each county throughout the mrb ranges from 0 6 t ha to 4 0 t ha during 2008 to 2019 fig 6 the eastern counties of the basin lying in the state of georgia and few counties of alabama are noted to have an average yield ranging from 1 1 to 1 5 t ha for the year 2008 the eastern alabama region is also noted to have an average yield of 1 6 2 0 t ha for the corresponding year the lowest yields are observed for the counties in southern alabama and eastern georgia for the years 2011 and 2012 respectively with an absolute value of 0 6 to 1 0 t ha in contrast to the counties with lowest corn yields concentrated in the central and eastern region of the basin in 2016 the counties with lowest soybean yield 0 6 1 0 t ha for the same year are distributed throughout the central and eastern region of the basin it is worth mentioning that all of the counties with yields ranging from 0 6 to 1 5 t ha have experienced mild to extreme droughts over the study period 2008 2019 similar to the rainfed corn yield poor soybean yield is also observed for non drought years in alabama for example in the years 2010 2013 2018 and 2019 the average soybean yield in alabama ranges from 2 1 to 3 0 t ha whereas for mississippi and georgia the yield ranges from 3 1 to 4 0 t ha 4 4 relationship between drought and rainfed crop yields fig 7 represents the county scale pearson correlation coefficient among the agricultural drought index spesmi and the detrended rainfed crop yields corn and soybean from 2008 to 2019 the results indicate an overall positive correlation among the variables with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 30 to 0 69 for corn and 0 30 to 0 79 for soybean this indicates that a higher intensity of drought greater magnitude of spesmi negative value results in lower yield across the mrb for both crops it is important to note that majority of the counties are observed to have a poor to moderate pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0 30 to 0 59 among drought intensity higher negative value of spesmi and detrended rainfed corn yield this indicates that although a higher magnitude of the drought index hinders the crop yield yet the effect is not as intense as compared to the soybean yield where the correlation coefficient is much higher this potential weak correlation among the detrended corn yield and drought intensity can be attributed to the fact that corn is a c4 plant and has the ability to adapt under elevated carbon dioxide and hot dry environments to a certain extent lara and andreo 2011 this is because c4 plants alter the c3 photosynthesis pathway as in soybean by minimizing the water loss reducing photorespiration and increasing the photosynthetic efficiency edwards and walker 1983 therefore yield loss is likely to be reduced under mild and moderate droughts relative to soybean and leads to a poor correlation interestingly the relationship between drought intensity and detrended rainfed soybean yield reveals the highest pearson correlation values for alabama state fig 7 b with correlation coefficients between 0 5 and 0 8 majority values ranging from 0 6 to 0 8 this implies that the rainfed soybean yields are more impacted by severe droughts in alabama relative to other states and corn 4 5 standalone model calibration and validation this section provides the results of the standalone model calibration and validation including the calibration parameters for both cropwat and aquacrop gis models 4 5 1 cropwat fig 8 represents the stagewise cropwat model crop coefficients estimated by the sce algorithm over the mrb the initial stage crop coefficient varies widely across the mrb ranging from 0 561 to 0 720 for corn pioneer 1319 cultivar whereas it varies from 0 481 to 0 640 and 0 481 to 0 560 in the case of asgrow 46x6 and usda n8002 cultivars of soybean respectively in contrast a lower variation in the crop coefficient is observed for the development stage where it varies from 0 960 to 1 139 for corn and 1 020 to 1 139 for asgrow 46x6 cultivar of soybean and 0 990 to 1 109 for usda n8002 cultivar of soybean in the case of middle stage of corn the crop coefficient is observed to vary from 1 141 to 1 260 for corn and 1 081 to 1 200 1 061 to 1 160 for asgrow 46x6 usda n8002 cultivar of soybean similarly for the late stage the crop coefficient varies from 0 881 to 0 980 and 0 821 to 0 960 0 821 to 0 900 for soybean cultivar of asgrow 46x6 usda n8002 overall higher values of crop coefficient are noted for corn followed by the asgrow 46x6 cultivar of soybean and the lowest for the usda n8002 soybean cultivar based on the optimized values of the crop coefficients during model calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 56 to 0 90 with a median value ranging from 0 61 to 0 65 is observed for simulated and modis derived etc across the mrb in the case of corn fig s2 a for the same output variable etc a relatively higher value of median nse is noted for asgrow 46x6 and usda n8002 cultivars of soybean ranging from 0 71 to 0 75 and 0 66 to 0 70 respectively fig s2 b overall throughout the mrb for both soybean cultivars nse ranges from 0 61 to 0 85 the difference in the simulated cumulative etc and modis derived etc for corn ranges from 29 to 40 mm for the entire cropping season from may to october of 2013 similarly for asgrow 46x6 and usda n8002 cultivars of soybean the difference ranges from 49 to 40 mm for the whole cropping season overall both nse and difference in etc reflect a very good calibrated cropwat model throughout the entire mrb the cropwat model validation reflects nse ranging from 0 65 to 0 84 for corn across all counties with higher nse values ranging from 0 69 to 0 84 in the central and the western counties for the cropping season of 2018 the eastern counties display poor model performance with majority of the counties inheriting nse in the range of 0 65 to 0 72 fig s3 a a relatively slight poor performance is observed for the model validation results for soybean across the study area the nse for soybean ranges from 0 60 to 0 80 with lower nse values concentrated in the central and southern region of the basin fig s3 b the difference between 8 day accumulated cropwat simulated etc and 8 day modis etc also shows an analogous pattern with close to zero values in the central and western counties for corn fig s3 c in case of soybean the difference between modis and model simulated etc shows values ranging from 39 mm to 20 mm in most of the counties in the western and central region whereas higher positive values in the range of 21 mm to 40 mm in the eastern counties fig s3 d these results indicates the model performs slightly better for corn relative to soybean in the study area although the magnitude of both nse and difference in etc estimates indicates cropwat model performance is acceptable for both crops 4 5 2 aquacrop gis fig 9 represents the spatial variability of the calibrated aquacrop gis model parameters across mrb as identified in the sensitivity analysis seven model parameters are considered in the optimization tables s1 and s2 the parameters canopy growth coefficient cgc ranges between 5 0 and 22 0 coefficient harvest index increased by inhibition of leaf growth at anthesis hilf ranges between 0 0 and 3 0 and coefficient harvest index reduced by inhibition of leaf growth at anthesis hilbf ranges between 0 and 1 0 vary widely across the river basin for corn ranging from 11 00 to 19 99 fig 9 a 0 690 to 0 789 fig 9 f and 0 080 to 0 239 fig 9 g respectively on the contrary for soybean cultivars the variability of the corresponding model parameters are slender fig 9 h m n o t and u interestingly it can also be seen that the calibrated values of all model parameters are lower for soybean crop relative to corn moreover the calibrated values are noted to be lower for the usda n8002 cultivar compared to the asgrow 46x6 cultivar the spatial variation in the aquacrop gis model performance during model calibration is shown in fig s4 the coefficient of determination r2 of corn and soybean yields ranges from 0 70 to 0 87 and 0 79 to 0 93 respectively fig s4 a and b similarly the r2 among the aquacrop gis simulated shallow soil moisture 5 cm and 1 km soil moisture derived from abbaszadeh et al 2019 indicates variability from 0 70 to 0 87 and 0 73 to 0 90 for corn and soybean cropping seasons respectively since r2 0 70 throughout the mrb using the criteria set by moriasi et al 2007 the model is well calibrated for aquacrop gis model validation the correlation coefficient among model simulated and observed soil moisture is noted to range from 0 56 to 0 90 for corn and 0 56 to 0 85 for soybean across the mrb fig s5 a and b similarly the r2 ranges from 0 66 to 0 90 and 0 60 to 0 85 for the corresponding crops fig s5 c and d similar to cropwat model a slightly better performance in model simulations is observed for corn crop compared to soybean at the study area a lower correlation coefficient and r2 is observed in the central region for soybean nevertheless both correlation coefficient and r2 suggests aquacrop gis performs well for both crops 4 6 irrigated corn yield during drought years the result of the integrated modeling framework depicts a wide spectrum of yield change under irrigation relative to the rainfed yield at mrb during drought years the irrigated corn yield is noted to change from 10 to 259 with the highest yields observed for 100 irrigation of iwr in the year 2012 fig 10 k on the contrary the lowest increase in corn yields 10 29 is noted for the 50 irrigation of iwr particularly in the western region mississippi and northern region of the years 2008 and 2011 respectively this potential low increase in yields is obvious pertaining to the unmet crop water demand during droughts even under irrigated conditions although the eastern region georgia of the basin experienced severe to extreme droughts in the year 2012 a higher increase in the corn yield 70 109 is observed under 50 irrigation for the corresponding region relative to the central alabama and western mississippi regions fig 10 c in the case of 75 irrigation of iwr a hike in the simulated yield is observed relative to the 50 irrigation for all counties irrespective of the drought years overall the increase in corn yield ranges from 50 to 179 for all four drought years a majority of the counties are noted to have a yield increase within the range of 100 159 for the year 2012 fig 10 g this pattern of potential yield increase is consistent with that of the 50 irrigation of iwr for the eastern counties which experienced severe to extreme droughts for the year 2012 in case of the year 2016 the western counties including alabama and mississippi experienced a yield increase of 20 79 whereas the central alabama and eastern georgia and tennessee counties observed to have an increase in yield within the range of 120 179 this potential low yield increase in the western counties can be attributed to the near normal precipitation conditions in the region in 2016 reflecting that iwr is met by the precipitation on the other hand for the eastern counties persistent drought during the cropping period resulted in unmet iwr which is supplemented by 75 irrigation resulting in a higher yield increase the corn yield simulated for 100 irrigation of iwr illustrates that the yield increase ranges from 70 to 239 70 to 219 80 to 259 and 30 to 209 for the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 respectively across all the counties relative to the rainfed corn yield fig 10 i j k and l the maximum and minimum yield increases are observed for the years 2012 and 2016 which corresponds to the highest and lowest drought intensities respectively interestingly for three out of four years 2008 2012 and 2016 the peak increase in irrigated corn yield is observed for the eastern region state of georgia nevertheless compared to all three irrigation water application rates 100 irrigation results in the maximum potential increase in corn yield relative to the rainfed corn yield for all drought years 4 7 irrigated soybean yield during drought years the irrigated soybean yield results of the integrated cropwat aquacrop gis modeling framework illustrates an increase in potential yield relative to the rainfed soybean yield for all counties under all three irrigation water application rates the yield increase ranges from 20 to 229 throughout all counties under all three irrigation water application rates for all four drought years fig 11 for 50 irrigation water application of iwr the lowest potential increase in yield is noted for the year 2008 with a magnitude of 20 to 79 in the counties of central alabama and western mississippi region however the soybean yield increase is higher 90 119 for the eastern region counties georgia similar results are also noted for the potential yield increase in the case of the year 2012 while for 2011 counties in the middle and the northern region are observed to have a lower magnitude of the potential yield increase relative to the southern region the potential increase in yield is noted to range from 80 to 129 for central to eastern counties and 20 to 49 for western counties in the case of 75 of irrigation water application rate of iwr the potential increase in soybean yield ranges from 50 to 189 across all counties and all four years an analogous pattern of increase in yield is noted for the years 2008 and 2012 where the eastern counties are observed to have the highest potential increase in yield relative to the central and western counties fig 11 e and g the yield increase in the case of 2016 ranges from 130 to 169 in central alabama state and eastern georgia state counties whereas 50 to 99 in western counties mississippi state similar to the results of irrigated corn yield the maximum potential increase in yield is observed for the 100 irrigation of iwr for all years in georgia and tennessee states the yield increase ranges from 190 to 219 relative to rainfed yield in 2008 a relatively lower increase in yield is observed for alabama state 100 169 followed by mississippi 80 129 for the corresponding year the southern counties are observed to have the highest potential increase in soybean yield for the year 2011 fig 11 j a relatively low range of potential soybean yield increase 100 139 is observed for a majority of the counties in the year 2012 except for the eastern counties in alabama and georgia where the range is observed to be 140 229 for the corresponding year most of the counties in 2016 are noticed to have irrigated soybean yield in the range of 130 to 219 in alabama georgia and tennessee states whereas the yield increase is merely 100 to 139 in mississippi state fig 11 l 5 discussion droughts negatively impact crop yields by affecting the critical growth stages deb et al 2015 mcnider et al 2015 yu et al 2018 in this study first county scale agricultural drought was identified and the results indicate a majority of the counties are impacted by droughts during the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 with the most severe drought during 2012 this finding is consistent with the us drought monitor svoboda et al 2002 and the spesmi approach findings by xu et al 2020 by visual comparison of the drought severity derived from the spesmi fig 4 and rainfed corn and soybean yields figs 5 and 6 it can be clearly seen that the yield is a response to drought severity with lower yields noted for counties under severe to extreme droughts although in this study the effect of drought intensity severity at different stages of the crop life cycle is not investigated it would be interesting to further evaluate this in a future study a positive relationship between detrended crop yield and spesmi agricultural drought index is found among all counties within the mrb a positive correlation means a higher magnitude of the drought index higher negative value representing intense drought leading to a poor crop yield although a low intensity drought does not always guarantee a higher yield the study region has also experienced several low intensity and frequent flash droughts ranging from weeks to two months in the past christian et al 2019 mo and lettenmaier 2020 where the crop growth can be significantly reduced if droughts occur during the critical crop growth stages while this analysis considered 3 month spesmi the effects of short term droughts in crop yields are not accounted for since this is beyond the scope of this paper nevertheless a similar positive correlation among drought indices and crop yields was also reported by peña gallardo et al 2019 and zhou et al 2020 for different crops in the major cropping belts over the conus another significant finding of the correlation test is that higher correlation coefficient is noted for the state of alabama in case of soybean crop fig 7 the underlying cause for this is most likely due to the choice of soybean cultivar asgrow 46x6 although this cultivar is a high yielding indeterminate variety new leaves grow even after flowering the cultivar is drought intolerant ross 2019 since its high photosynthesis demand provokes high water stress during droughts leading to early plant death on the other hand farmers of georgia tennessee and mississippi choose a drought resistant cultivar usda n8002 over other traditional cultivars carter et al 2016 which exhibits delayed canopy wilting even under drought stress leading to higher yield relative to asgrow 46x6 cultivar as mentioned earlier the novel part of this study is integrating an iwr model and a spatial crop yield simulation model in the robust estimation of crop yields during drought years while accounting for the simulated iwr irrigation scheduling within the framework the initial step requires stand alone calibration of both models and the results of model performance are presented in figs s1 and s2 supporting information file and calibration parameters are presented in figs 8 and 9 it is worth noting that the poor cropwat model performance during validation for corn in the eastern counties is likely due to the underestimation of the plant available water by the model particularly in georgia this is because georgia has the highest number of farmland in the region leading to a significant amount of soil preparation tillage and since the model employs the usda soil conservation service approach of effective rainfall calculation which is empirical the model likely fails in the robust calculation of the water loss leading to inaccurate estimation of plant available water similar poor cropwat model performance in agriculture dominant regions were also reported by awad et al 2021 and babu et al 2015 overall these results indicate both models are in good agreement with the observed reported variables across all counties while the overall area under irrigation in the us continues to rise specifically in the major corn and soybean belts rainfed agricultural practices are dominant in the deep southern states portmann et al 2010 the results of this study indicate that iwr varies spatially and temporally at mrb for instance iwr ranges from 80 to 319 mm and 60 to 419 mm during the years 2008 and 2012 respectively for corn fig s6 a and c similarly iwr varies between 0 and 259 mm and 40 to 419 mm for the corresponding years respectively in the case of soybean fig s7 a and c this illustrates that a significant amount of water required by crops is unmet by precipitation during drought years another critical finding of the iwr simulation is that the severe to extreme drought impacted counties show higher iwr this is apparent since during droughts vapor pressure deficit is higher relative to the normal precipitation period and this results in higher transpiration from crops luo et al 2016 although it is also argued that during water stress crops either roll up or reduce intake of sunlight to reduce photosynthesis and thus the lowering water requirement however crop transpiration does not significantly reduce until the soil moisture falls below 50 of the available water capacity schneekloth and andales 2017 nevertheless this study indicates that the iwr is higher in the counties experiencing severe to extreme droughts the simulation of the integrated framework illustrates the maximum yield can be potentially achieved at the counties which experience the most intense droughts this is obvious since supplemental irrigation eliminates plant water stress fereres and soriano 2007 it is noteworthy that during intense droughts higher temperature leads to increased plant water use and this contributes to high plant mortality rate reduced yield since water is unavailable during droughts under rainfed agriculture will et al 2013 another important finding of the integrated modeling framework is that the maximum yield can be attained by 100 irrigation of iwr in the most intense drought affected counties for both crops figs 10 and 11 these findings highlight that in order to meet the water demands of increasing the corn and soybean yields irrigation is imperative and hence a change in the current agricultural practices is crucial to combat these negative impacts of droughts and make the region more self reliant moreover given the projected scarcity of water in the future judicious use of water is critical and integrated modeling approaches such as one suggested here can play a decisive role in increasing crop yield under droughts relative to the concurrent practices while global gridded crop models are also available in literature which can be forced with iwr datasets due to their coarse spatial resolution grid size often 70 km the results are unreliable and are not applicable for regional to county scale irrigation water planning and management moreover these models require high performance computing and high level coding skills whereas the integrated modeling framework employed here is widely applicable for regional scale studies and does not require high coding expertise and can be used by a water modeler for simulating robust county scale agricultural plans under droughts the authors acknowledge that a limitation of this study is lumping the spatial soil characteristics at county scale in the integrated modeling framework however this study intends to demonstrate the applicability of the novel framework at county scale for better agricultural planning and management under drought conditions in rainfed dominant regions of course with the availability of finer spatial information farm scale or micro basin scale crop yield weather dataset and soil information the outputs of the integrated modeling framework can be of further help for micro basin scale agricultural management it is also critical to note that although more irrigation water requires higher monetary investment including water cost installation and maintenance of the irrigation system analyzing this and identifying the optimal irrigation water application rate while accounting for the irrigation costs is beyond the scope of this paper a plethora of studies have coupled crop models with hydrological both surface water and groundwater and irrigation models in the past e g mcnider et al 2015 mcnider et al 2011 lopez et al 2017 rossetto et al 2019 roy et al 2019 sabzzadeh shourian 2020 while these studies are conducted with the primary objective of optimization of irrigation using subsurface water retention technology developing irrigation scheduling in a crop model and simulating conjunctive use of irrigation water resources none has applied a multi model integration framework in simulation of maximizing the potential crop yields using irrigation under droughts moreover although aquacrop the core component of the aquacrop gis model is a widely used model globally the application of the spatial version of the model i e aquacrop gis model employed in this study is limited therefore this study further reinforces the latter s applicability at the basin scale furthermore the model integration framework proposed in this study is simple and provides the flexibility of model selection since models used in this framework can be replaced by other models over other published studies hence it is a versatile framework and its further application is suggested at a continental country scale for robust irrigation planning and management 6 conclusion while crop yields under rainfed cultivation practices generally decline during droughts irrigation can play a critical role in reducing crop yield loss however given the constraint of water scarcity during droughts an accurate estimation of the iwr and irrigation scheduling is critical therefore this study presents a novel integrated modeling framework by using two parsimonious models namely cropwat an iwr simulation model and aquacrop gis a spatial crop yield simulation model to simulate corn and soybean yields at county scale under droughts in the mrb the calculation of spesmi agricultural drought index suggests mild to severe droughts varying spatially across the counties during the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 additionally a moderate to strong positive correlation is also noted among spesmi and detrended crop yields across the counties furthermore the integrated modeling approach reveals an increase in corn and soybean yields ranging from 10 to 259 and 20 to 229 respectively under different irrigation water application rates relative to rainfed crop yield for the four drought years within mrb although the integrated modeling framework presented in this study is time consuming it is essential in the deep south region and other similar regions where droughts are frequent and recurrent and farmers generally practice rainfed agriculture craig et al 2019 the integrated modeling framework simulates iwr and crop yield robustly and helps in devising better irrigation planning and management under drought conditions this is because the integrated modeling framework is capable of intaking the current operational weather prediction as input in calculating appropriate iwr and resulting potential increase in the crop yields especially during forecasted droughts furthermore the findings of this study can be used by state or local governments for capacity building and educating farmers to transition from rainfed to irrigated agriculture to avoid crop yield loss in the future it is worth noting that shifting from rainfed to irrigated agriculture may consume the regional surface or groundwater resources while some regions may be water limited and are not capable to attain the 100 irrigation level the irrigation should be based on water availability although the aim of this paper is not to evaluate how much water is realistically available for irrigation during droughts or whether is it economically viable the authors

3418,irrigation is one of the major adaptation strategies to combat the negative impacts of drought on crop yields however during droughts the water resources are limited and determining the exact irrigation amount and its response to crop yields are crucial existing crop yield simulation models are data intensive and a majority of these are point based therefore this study presents a novel integrated modeling framework by using two parsimonious models cropwat an irrigation water requirement simulation model and aquacrop gis a spatial crop yield simulation model to simulate corn and soybean yields under different irrigation application rates during drought years at a spatial scale in the mobile river basin mrb southeast u s to simulate crop yields for drought years first agricultural drought years are identified using an integrated drought index called the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture index spesmi the results indicate that a majority of the basin was affected by mild to extreme droughts during the years 2008 2011 2012 2016 the results of the integrated modeling framework illustrate the potential corn and soybean yields can be increased from 10 to 259 and 20 to 229 respectively under different irrigation water application rates 50 75 and 100 of irrigation water requirement relative to rainfed crop yields at the counties in the mrb during drought years these findings demonstrate the importance of overall irrigation and the integrated modeling framework in devising robust irrigation water management plans in drought affected areas at a spatial scale failure in integrating irrigation water requirement models in crop yield simulations will result in erroneous yield simulations especially during droughts this is salient given projections for frequent and intense droughts globally although the study is focused on mrb the framework developed is applicable for irrigation planners and water managers in any region that experiences mild to extreme droughts as long as the farmers have the ability to adapt the irrigation in their practice given socio economic constraints keywords droughts cropwat aquacrop gis mobile river basin corn soybean 1 introduction drought is a natural phenomenon characterized with below normal water availability and can occur in any region across the world van loon et al 2016 severe and prolonged droughts can have serious implications in agriculture and may result in significant crop yield reductions posing a serious threat to food security hameed et al 2020 park et al 2016 according to a global study by kim et al 2019 during the drought period of 1983 2009 75 of the harvested areas have experienced crop yield loss with an estimated value of 166 billion us dollars additionally lesk et al 2016 showed in a global study that cereal production was reduced by 9 10 due to high temperature and droughts during the period of 1964 2007 in another study in the united states us corn zea mays and soybean glycine max yields were found to be highly correlated with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei with significant yield reductions during intense drought periods peña gallardo et al 2019 similarly zipper et al 2016 analyzed us corn and soybean yield sensitivity to meteorological drought from 1958 to 2007 and concluded that overall droughts resulted in to 13 in crop yield variability especially the southeastern region which was becoming more sensitive over time furthermore ray et al 2018 identified that droughts negatively impacted not only crop yield but also cultivated areas hectarage in texas us where the cotton and corn hectarage declined to 21 and 18 respectively during drought years 2011 2013 compared to 30 year average crop hectarage these negative impacts of droughts on agricultural production have raised serious concerns regarding food security among the science and research community kim et al 2019 yu et al 2018 irrigation is an effective adaptation practice that supplements the additional water unmet from precipitation required by crops globally the irrigated areas have roughly doubled in the last five decades and contributed to a significantly increase in crop yields foley et al 2011 global land use based classification studies have confirmed that irrigated croplands account for 25 of the global cropped area yet it contributes to 43 of the global crop production portmann et al 2010 siebert and döll 2010 a worldwide study on 26 crops reported that if all the rainfed croplands were converted into irrigated lands the global crop production might rise by 20 under the current climate siebert and döll 2010 climate change projection studies have estimated the global irrigated croplands in the future to range from 240 to 800 mha in 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 puy et al 2020 and in the range of 4 5 21 9 mha alone in the us by 2090 mcdonald et al 2013 although these are either country scale or global studies at state scales these projection values are different for instance in alabama georgia and mississippi the rate of increase in the irrigated area is significantly lower than the major cropping belts in the us abbaszadeh et al 2022 gavahi et al 2021 schaible and aillery 2012 there are several factors contributing to this but two major causes are 1 the existence of riparian water rights in alabama and restriction in water use in georgia 100 000 gallons day and 2 high capital investment in irrigation equipment and lack of incentives from the government hollis 2011 several drought indices are developed across the us a few of them focusing on the southeast region specifically agclimate now agroclimate a climate forecast information system for agricultural risk management fraisse et al 2006 comprises of agricultural reference index for drought a drought index for estimating the water stress affecting crop growth woli et al 2012 additionally the us drought monitor and the palmer drought severity index pdsi were also specifically developed in the us all of these indices indicate that the southeast us region has experienced intense and frequent droughts in the past and recently as per us drought monitor in 2012 extreme to exceptional drought and in 2018 severe to extreme drought during cropping seasons gavahi et al 2020 also highlighted the same since droughts are identified to have a negative influence on corn and soybean yields in the us specifically during the crop development periods zipper et al 2016 the states in the southeast us plan to intensify irrigation in the future to avoid crop yield loss furthermore climate projection studies in the region suggest shortages of freshwater boretti and rosa 2019 sun et al 2013 therefore judicious use of irrigation water at regional scale at county level is critical for achieving the potential yield and regional food security especially during droughts evans and sadler 2008 while numerical modeling is an approach to calculating optimal irrigation amount and assessing yields the existing modeling studies are limited to stand alone application of irrigation water requirement iwr estimation models for calculating irrigation amounts and irrigation scheduling he et al 2013 mason et al 2019 additionally the existing crop yield model simulation studies are limited to simulating crop yield based on user defined iwr kephe et al 2021 mubeen et al 2020 yu et al 2018 simulating iwr separately and then forcing these into a crop yield simulation model is a two step process and is tedious although there is a gridded crop model intercomparison simulation dataset which comprises global crop yield data under both rainfed and irrigated conditions müller et al 2019 the spatial resolution of the dataset is too coarse 0 5 arc degree 55 km which limits its application in regional planning and management kim et al 2021 on the other hand a plethora of existing iwr and crop yield simulation studies are generally point scale i e studies are done at a specific location or an experimental station but at a spatial scale e g county level studies are limited since a national or a state scale agricultural planning including agricultural water allocation cannot be done based on point scale studies county scale studies are critical and their importance is undeniable generally crop models such as decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 can simulate the iwr using the water balance approach tsuji et al 1998 however these widely applied models were developed for point based studies and cannot simulate crop yield or iwr at a gridded scale recently alderman 2021 developed a parallel gridded simulation framework for dssat however the input dataset outputs are required generated in netcdf format which is not user friendly increasing its difficulty to use moreover the modeling framework requires several soil characteristic datasets at grid scale i e the infiltration rate and drainage which are available at very coarse spatial resolution 20 25 km limiting its application for county scale studies additionally since the gridded version of dssat simulations is done using message passing interface on high performance computing it requires high expertise to use the model in contrast iwr models such as cropwat smith 1992 are simple and can be shared within multiple cores of a single personal computer for parallel simulation additionally cropwat calculates the amount of irrigation based on the crop water requirement evapotranspiration demand from crops and soil which is primarily dependent on the climatic variables and simple soil characteristics including maximum rooting depth field capacity permanent wilting point and initial soil moisture all are specific for soil types which are readily available at a fine grid scale and can be aggregated at county scale therefore given that the available grid scale global national scale models are spatially coarse data intensive and require high technical expertise a simpler modeling approach that can simultaneously estimate crop yield under different iwr at county scale is paramount in order to address this issue a novel integrated modeling framework was developed in this study utilizing satellite and ground based information to assess the potential increase in crop yields under different levels of irrigation relative to rainfed agriculture the framework was employed for two major cultivated crops corn and soybean under droughts at mobile river basin mrb in the deep south us as a case study where rainfed agricultural practice is dominant additionally the developed framework was employed at county scale which is also another novelty of this study relative to the traditional iwr and crop yield estimation studies which are generally point scale studies the specific objectives are 1 identification of county scale agricultural drought at mrb 2 establishing relationships among drought and rainfed crop yields corn and soybean and 3 developing an integrated modeling framework of iwr and crop yield simulation models to assess the potential increase in crop yield under different irrigation application rates during droughts the findings of this study can be integrated with a robust weekly to seasonal weather prediction system in devising better irrigation water management policies in the region and the novel framework developed is also be applicable at any rainfed agriculture dominant region to combat yield losses encountered during droughts 2 study area and datasets fig 1 displays the study area mrb highlighted within the us the basin spans over four states including tennessee mississippi georgia and alabama comprising approximately 115 200 km2 roughly two thirds of the mrb is contained in alabama the flow in the basin is generated from the upper appalachian plateau located in the north and drains out in the mobile bay in the south forest is the predominant land use comprising approximately 60 of the basin while agriculture and urban areas comprise of 26 and 3 respectively additionally water bodies streams and reservoirs comprise the rest 11 in the basin warner et al 2005 corn is generally sown between mid march and early may and is harvested between mid july and early september usda 1997 similarly soybean is sown between mid may and mid june and harvested between early september and early october balkcom et al 2014 the predominant soil in the basin is sandy loam 20 plant available water paw however the central region of the basin is characterized by a predominant silty loam soil 15 8 paw deb et al 2019 mitchell et al 2004 the average annual discharge of the basin at the mobile bay is approximately 1760 m3s 1 and ranks as the fourth largest discharge in the us the basin is comprised by 101 counties which were considered in this analysis fig 1 the average annual precipitation and temperature range from 1270 to 1524 mm and 15 c in the north to 21 c in the south respectively 65 of the precipitation occurs during the cropping season of corn and soybean the major agricultural crops comprise corn soybean cotton and hay approximately 67 of the cropped area is rainfed while 27 is irrigated and concentrated in georgia 33 6 tennessee 3 5 and mississippi 44 4 states nrcs 2017 the most grown corn cultivar variety in mrb is pioneer 1319 glass et al 2016 whereas for soybean asgrow 46x6 is mostly grown in alabama and usda n8002 is grown in georgia tennessee and mississippi states glass et al 2018 in order to pursue the study several datasets were required including meteorological data soil characteristics groundwater data crop specific information and crop management data satellite based actual evapotranspiration etc and soil moisture data the details of the datasets used in the study are provided in table 1 in addition to the above mentioned datasets average county scale crop yield data was collected from the national agricultural statistics service nass united states department of agriculture usda this dataset comprises of the average crop yield from irrigated and rainfed cropping conditions since rainfed corn and soybean yields play a critical role in this study particularly in achieving objective two and calibration validation of the models discussed later additional crop yield datasets were also collected from the state agricultural research centers particularly auburn university alabama agricultural experiment station alabama mississippi state university agricultural and forestry experiment station mississippi university of georgia cooperative extension on crop and soil sciences georgia and university of tennessee institute of agriculture tennessee these research centers publish annual crop yield datasets for both irrigated and rainfed conditions for their several research stations where each research station corresponds to a few counties a simple arithmetic calculation eq 1 is done to estimate the rainfed corn and soybean yield under rainfed conditions for the unreported counties 1 z x y 2 where z is the average crop yield for a county retrieved from nass and is available for all the counties x and y are the irrigated and rainfed crop yields respectively retrieved from the research stations from eq 1 y rainfed crop yield can be calculated for the unreported county as in eq 2 2 y 2 z x it is to be noted that the irrigated crop yield is assumed to be the same as the crop yield reported in the nearby regional research station as per the suggestion of novak et al 2008 3 methods the methods employed in this study can be divided into two phases where phase 1 addresses the first and second objectives and phase 2 addresses the third objective fig 2 furthermore phase 1 can be classified into three stages 1 3 month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture index spesmi was calculated at a county scale within the river basin for the cropping season from march to october for each year 2008 2019 2 the rainfed crop yields were mapped at county scale and 3 relationships among spesmi and detrended crop yields were established at the county scale level where detrending was done by using simple linear regression model quiring and papakryiakou 2003 finally in phase 2 potential avoidance of drought affected rainfed crop yield loss under irrigation was estimated by employing a novel integrated framework of two models at the county scale all of these tasks are provided in detail in the following sections 3 1 calculation of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture index spesmi identifying agricultural drought years was a crucial step in this study and spesmi was used to identify those years spesmi is a non parametric multivariate drought index which was developed by combining the marginal probability distributions of root zone soil moisture and the differenced variable of precipitation and evapotranspiration xu et al 2020 time series of 3 month spesmi was calculated at a grid scale of 12 5 km spatial resolution using the 40 100 cm soil moisture information derived from the noah land surface model of the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 the noah outputs were used due to their superior performance over other model outputs in the deep southern states xia et al 2015 in this study the approach developed by xu et al 2020 was used to calculate grid scale spesmi the spesmi was developed based on the copula function as suggested by masud et al 2015 of the joint probability of root zone soil moisture and the differenced variable of precipitation and evapotranspiration the main merit of this approach is that it can be employed for two different variables with diverse marginal distributions madadgar moradkhani 2013 since xu et al 2020 gave a comprehensive description of the spesmi only a brief introduction is presented in this paper the joint cumulative distribution function cdf among precipitation and the differenced variable is expressed in eq 3 3 p x x y y c f 1 x f 2 y c u 1 u 2 where x and y are soil moisture and the differenced variable of precipitation and evapotranspiration respectively the copula is denoted by c f1 and f2 are the cdfs of x and y respectively prior to the cdf estimation x and y variables were calculated by subtracting the monthly averaged values for each grid for the cropping season since etc was available at a spatial resolution of 500 m it was aggregated at 4 km spatial resolution for consistency with the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism precipitation dataset because prism dataset accounts for physiographic features such as variability in terrain it is considered superior to other datasets molter et al 2021 and hence was used in this study the y variable the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration was further regridded to 12 5 km to match the spatial resolution of the root zone soil moisture all of these conversions were done using arcpy scripts the calculated spesmi outputs representing each grid of 12 5 km spatial resolution were averaged at county scale using the zonal statistics tool in arcpy programming to represent the county specific spesmi values additionally in order to determine agricultural drought year 3 month spesmi outputs march to october crop growing season for each county were calculated and then temporally averaged for the duration representing yearly mean spesmi from 2008 to 2019 similar to the drought classification of standardized soil moisture index ssmi and standardized precipitation index spi by mckee et al 1993 spesmi was classified into eight categories which are given in table 2 the agricultural drought year in this study was defined as the year with over 50 of counties experiencing any drought of intensity more than mild dry conditions table 2 in this study normal precipitation year was defined as the years when over 65 of counties comprised of spesmi values were within the range of 0 49 to 0 50 3 2 spatial and temporal mapping of rainfed crop yields before establishing the relationship between drought and crop yields identifying spatial and temporal variations of the crop yield was essential therefore county scale annual rainfed corn and soybean yields were extracted from the national agricultural statistics service nass united states department of agriculture usda and plotted to represent their spatial and temporal variability the time period considered to assess this variability was from 2008 to 2019 several county specific yield values of the nass dataset of 2008 and 2009 were missing and hence the multiple imputation approach rubin 1987 was employed to infill the missing values in the multiple imputation approach first the missing values were replaced by random imputed values which were sampled from the predictive distribution of the observed data these imputations were done to generate multiple datasets secondly standard statistical methods were used to fit a model regression to each imputed dataset finally outputs of the multiple models were combined to generate the single imputed value the multiple imputations were identified to be the most appropriate method in imputing missing crop yield data of nass and further details on this approach can be found in lokupitiya et al 2006 3 3 relationship among spesmi and detrended rainfed crop yield generally crop yields are associated with stochastic trends and climate variability schauberger et al 2018 the stochastic trend component reflects the contribution of several factors including management practices and technological advances whereas the climate variability component includes climate disasters can induce high frequency fluctuations such as droughts affecting the crop yield which is the focus of this study lu et al 2017 to establish the relationship between the drought index and crop yields it is crucial to remove the trend component from the yield values therefore based on the finding of yu et al 2018 the hodrick prescott hp filter was applied on time series of rainfed corn and soybean yield data the details of the hp filter algorithm can be found in harvey trimbur 2008 in this study hpfilter code within mfilter package in r programming language was run across all the counties to detrend the corn and soybean yields post detrending the yield values the pearson correlation coefficient was derived among time series of annual spesmi values and detrended corn and soybean yields at the county scale the correlation coefficient is a measure of the drought impacts on rainfed crop yields 3 4 modeling crop yield under irrigation during drought years since field experimental trials to assess water requirement are painstaking and time consuming in this study a coupled modeling approach of integrating a deterministic iwr model cropwat 8 0 fao 1992 and a water driven spatial crop yield simulation model aquacrop gis fao 2017 steduto et al 2009 was developed to assess the potential increase in crop yields under irrigation relative to rainfed yields during the drought years 3 4 1 models description to pursue this study the models chosen were cropwat 8 0 and aquacrop gis cropwat is one of the robust and widely used iwr estimation models and hence is used in this study moreover the aquacrop gis model was chosen for crop yield estimation since it is a water driven model and since this study deals with drought water stress it was the best fit more details on the model are given below 3 4 1 1 cropwat 8 0 cropwat is a microsoft windows based computer program developed by the food and agricultural organization fao for irrigation planning and management the specific applications of this model include calculating reference evapotranspiration eto crop specific actual evapotranspiration crop water requirement crop irrigation requirement and irrigation scheduling the model calculates reference evapotranspiration by employing the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 then eto is further used to calculate the etc in eq 4 4 e t c k c e t o where etc is actual crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 eto is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 and kc is crop coefficient daily root zone soil water balance is employed in the computation of the iwr and the outputs are calculated at 10 days intervals additionally the irrigation schedule accounting for the amount and irrigation timing is also stored separately for the cropping season the model requires daily climate data precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed soil data maximum rooting depth field capacity permanent wilting point and initial soil moisture and crop information crop type planting and harvesting dates and days of each crop stage the model also requires four parameters to be calibrated for optimal model performance these parameters are primarily the crop coefficients kc eq 4 during different crop growth stages which are initial kcini development kcdev middle kcmid and late kclat the model also allows users to couple with an external model parameterization software or algorithm for model optimization although the model has several outputs as mentioned above the main outputs used in this study were the iwr and irrigation scheduling further details on the model can be found in fao 1992 3 4 1 2 aquacrop gis aquacrop gis is a spatial scale user defined spatial information required either grid scale or administrative level crop yield simulation model that uses the widely used water driven aquacrop model in its core the model is a microsoft windows based program to simulate the crop yield at a user defined spatial scale seven classes of datasets are required for yield simulation these datasets include crop information details of the soil initial condition soil type data groundwater table data management details including planting weeding irrigation and harvesting dates weather data precipitation temperature and eto and study area map shp format file the versatility applicability deb et al 2015 shrestha et al 2014 and the lesser input data requirement babel et al 2019 of the aquacrop model is the primary reason for its selection in this study the model uses normalized water productivity and the ratio of transpiration to eto to calculate above ground biomass eq 5 also the yield is considered and calculated as a function of reference harvest index and above ground biomass eq 6 5 b k s b w p t r e t o 6 y f h i h i o b where b is above ground biomass kg m 2 ksb is air temperature stress coefficient wp is normalized water productivity kg m 2 mm 1 tr is transpiration mm day 1 eto is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 y is crop yield kg m 2 fhi is the adjustment factor for all stresses affecting crop yield hio is the reference harvest index and b is above ground biomass further details on the model can be found in steduto et al 2009 3 4 2 integrating irrigation water requirement iwr and crop yield simulation models the spatial estimation of crop yield under irrigation can be assessed by three approaches 1 using a crop yield simulation model with iwr as input either calculated or simulated by another model 2 integration of iwr model and crop yield simulation model and 3 developing a new model code while considering both components i e calculation of iwr and crop yield simulation while the first option is the simplest it is not feasible since the exact amount of iwr under droughts is unknown and manual calculation at a grid or county scale is simply impractical similarly the third option has its own disadvantages including data constraints and computational limitations associated with its testing and validation prior to its application on the other hand the second option provides the flexibility of choosing different models and is more robust since the chosen models are well developed and applied in diverse regions around the world therefore in this study the second option was selected using cropwat 8 0 and aquacrop gis models previously described although the traditional aquacrop model can simulate iwr the percentage of readily available water in the root zone data is not readily available at county scale and requires intensive field laboratory testing moreover scaling up this variable from field laboratory to county grid scale is impractical on the other hand cropwat uses simple soil characteristics particularly total available soil moisture which is constant for a particular soil type and fine resolution soil maps are available and climatic variables such as maximum minimum temperature relative humidity precipitation solar radiation and wind speed to simulate iwr and irrigation scheduling and therefore used in this study more importantly the integrated modeling framework is easy to implement and does not require much technical expertise or intense coding in the integrated modeling framework both the cropwat and aquacrop gis models are loosely coupled to diminish the model component interdependencies and increase the flexibility of the framework as it allows users to altercate the models basically it consists of three major steps 1 stand alone calibration and validation of cropwat and aquacrop gis for normal precipitation years 2 simulation of iwr and irrigation scheduling by cropwat under drought conditions 3 using the iwrs from cropwat as input in aquacrop gis to simulate the crop yield during drought years given that aquacrop gis is a spatial model the model setup within the study domain is relatively simple in terms of model setup compared to the cropwat model where the latter is required to be set for each county in this study 3 4 2 1 model calibration and validation both models were calibrated independently using a the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1994 duan et al 1993 a widely used stochastic global optimization algorithm in this approach first stochastically a sample of points is distributed over the parameter space within the lower and upper bounds every sample point is considered as a member of the population and each individual is characterized by its unique genetic information by altering the genetic information i e the parameter values the population tends to direct towards an optimum which is the optimum of the objective function corresponding to the model simulated values and the observed values the initial sample of the population is also divided into several sub samples also called complexes each combination of complexes produces offspring following the simplex procedure of nelder mead 1965 the likelihood of an individual in reproduction depends on its fitness the older points are then replaced by the offspring this proceeds towards a global optimum which is assisted by a a probability that new points are spontaneously created within the feasible parameter space and b a regular combination of the points into new complexes further details on the sce algorithm can be found in duan et al 1993 since this is a county scale study and the aquacrop gis model consists of over 40 conservative and non conservative model parameters sensitivity analysis is essential to avoid the computational burden first the most crucial parameters 12 in total were identified from the literature deb et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016 followed by a sensitivity analysis table 3 each parameter was adjusted by 15 deb and kiem 2020 uniyal et al 2019 relative to their default value and a model simulation was done for the year 2015 keeping other parameters to their default values based on the percentage change in yield the parameters were classified as high 10 moderate 5 10 and low 5 sensitive parameters based on the range of the absolute value of percent change in the simulated yields corresponding to the changed parameter value relative to the default parameter value the criteria used in this study was set by geerts et al 2009 in this study only the high and moderate sensitive parameters were selected for the model calibration it is to be noted for reducing computation burden the sensitivity analysis was done for only one corn and soybean growing county within the alabama state dallas where both the crops were grown intensively also the sensitivity analysis was done for the pioneer 1319 cultivar of corn grown in the entire mrb and the asgrow 46x6 cultivar of soybean grown in alabama the usda n8002 cultivar of soybean which is mostly grown in tennessee mississippi and georgia states was not used in the sensitivity analysis due to similarity in physiological characteristics with the asgrow 46x6 cultivar the cropwat model consists of four coefficients crop coefficients based on the crop growth stages which are initial development middle and late which were optimized by linking the model with the sce algorithm the aquacrop gis model was calibrated against the annual corn and soybean yield for normal precipitation years 2009 2010 2013 2014 2015 and 2019 and the time series of soil moisture at daily time step for the year 2015 since a majority of the counties received precipitation around the 30 year average rainfall against 1 km downscaled soil moisture 5 cm for conterminous united states conus developed by abbaszadeh et al 2019 since aquacrop gis simulates the soil moisture on a volumetric basis i e m3 m3 the moisture content for the top soil layer 5 cm simulated by aquacrop gis is calculated by multiplying 50 to the volumetric soil moisture simulated by aquacrop gis this results in soil moisture in mm water per 5 cm depth of soil per unit area which is compared against the 1 km downscaled soil moisture cropwat model was calibrated against the time series moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 500 m resolution etc data mod16a2 available at the 8 day interval for the year 2013 since the year was a normal precipitation year both models were calibrated at county scale and the spatially varying calibration parameters were stored with county ids in two data frames one for cropwat and another for aquacrop gis for use in simulation post calibration both models were also validated at the study basin since the time series of crop yield data was limited aquacrop gis model was validated against time series of volumetric soil moisture content derived from abbaszadeh et al 2019 for the year 2018 normal precipitation year and not to overlap the year for cropwat calibration at county scale similarly for cropwat validation at county scale the model simulated time series etc was compared against 8 day modis etc for the same year 2018 for evaluation of the model performance nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and correlation coefficient were used further details on these evaluation metrics can be found in moriasi et al 2007 3 4 2 2 simulating irrigation water requirement iwr and irrigation scheduling for drought years once the cropwat model was calibrated at each county for the year 2013 the model was used in simulating the iwr and irrigation scheduling for the drought years derived from the step described in section 3 1 over the entire basin the time variant input variables i e precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were used only for the cropping duration i e from march to october for each year in the simulation 3 4 2 3 integrating cropwat and aquacrop gis a schematic representation of the integration of both models is shown in fig 3 as mentioned earlier both models were loosely coupled in the integrated simulation phase where the outputs of the cropwat model were forced in the aquacrop gis model post calibration of the cropwat model the input variables climate soil and crop data were forced into the model for simulating the iwr of the crops for the drought years the model simulates iwr at 10 day intervals and the county scale 10 day period iwr was calculated additionally the model also simulates irrigation scheduling where the amount of irrigation water and the timing of irrigation are calculated based on the irrigation amount calculated in this step the irrigation water application rates were calculated for 50 75 and 100 full of the net irrigation requirement these irrigation water application rates were calculated for each county and values were stored into time series of ascii files for the cropping season corresponding to the irrigation timing it is worth mentioning that the cumulative irrigation water amount simulated from the irrigation scheduling step throughout the cropping season gives the total iwr in the following step the calibrated aquacrop gis model was forced with calibrated parameters stored in the data frame along with the input weather variables soil crop groundwater initial soil water crop management data the county shapefile and the time series of ascii files with irrigation information the final outputs from the model were county scale corn and soybean yield under 50 75 and 100 iwr for the drought years the simulated yields were then compared against the actual county scale rainfed yield calculated based on usda nass and regional agricultural research stations the findings are presented in spatial maps for ease of representation 4 results 4 1 identification of drought years fig 4 represents the spatial and temporal variation of the spesmi representing the agricultural drought in the mrb the results indicate that a significant part of the mrb experienced droughts in the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 the drought intensity ranged from mild spesmi 0 50 to severe spesmi 1 99 during the years 2008 and 2011 with severe droughts in the eastern and southern counties for the respective years similarly for 2012 the drought is noted to range from mild to extreme spesmi 2 00 with the eastern counties east alabama and georgia experiencing severe and extreme droughts the year 2016 is relatively milder with central alabama to western georgia experiencing mild to moderate spesmi 1 49 to 1 00 droughts these results are consistent with the findings of xu et al 2020 where droughts within the range of mild to moderate are noted for the states of alabama georgia mississippi and tennessee during 2016 few counties are also noted to experience mild droughts in the years 2009 2015 2017 and 2018 fig 4 however given that the area under drought is 20 of mrb and of mild drought intensity these years are not considered as the drought years in the preceding analysis 4 2 rainfed corn yield fig 5 displays the spatial and temporal variability of rainfed corn yield within mrb the rainfed corn yield is noted to range from 3 0 t ha to 12 9 t ha both spatially and temporally the lowest corn yields are noted for the drought affected counties in the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 overall in mrb the year 2012 is observed to have the lowest corn yield within the range of 3 0 to 6 9 t ha with the minimum values in the eastern counties in georgia state similarly in the year 2011 the lowest yield is also noted within the same range of 2012 but for the southern counties for the year 2016 the entire state of alabama except for a few counties in the western region and all georgia are noted to have an average yield ranging from 4 0 to 6 9 t ha during non drought years interestingly a lower yield is also noted for the state of alabama relative to mississippi western region and georgia for example in the case of 2013 normal precipitation year georgia and mississippi are noted to have an average yield ranging from 8 0 to 8 9 t ha and 7 0 8 9 t ha respectively whereas alabama consists of an average yield ranging from 6 0 to 6 9 t ha except 4 counties in the east similar lower yields in alabama can also be observed for the years 2010 2015 2018 and 2019 this poor yield can be attributed to the poor crop management strategies such as weeding fertigation pesticide application etc including hand weeding is practiced within the state of alabama molnar et al 2011 duzy et al 2016 nevertheless drought affected counties over the whole mrb experience reduced rainfed corn yield within the study period 4 3 rainfed soybean yield the areal average rainfed soybean yield for each county throughout the mrb ranges from 0 6 t ha to 4 0 t ha during 2008 to 2019 fig 6 the eastern counties of the basin lying in the state of georgia and few counties of alabama are noted to have an average yield ranging from 1 1 to 1 5 t ha for the year 2008 the eastern alabama region is also noted to have an average yield of 1 6 2 0 t ha for the corresponding year the lowest yields are observed for the counties in southern alabama and eastern georgia for the years 2011 and 2012 respectively with an absolute value of 0 6 to 1 0 t ha in contrast to the counties with lowest corn yields concentrated in the central and eastern region of the basin in 2016 the counties with lowest soybean yield 0 6 1 0 t ha for the same year are distributed throughout the central and eastern region of the basin it is worth mentioning that all of the counties with yields ranging from 0 6 to 1 5 t ha have experienced mild to extreme droughts over the study period 2008 2019 similar to the rainfed corn yield poor soybean yield is also observed for non drought years in alabama for example in the years 2010 2013 2018 and 2019 the average soybean yield in alabama ranges from 2 1 to 3 0 t ha whereas for mississippi and georgia the yield ranges from 3 1 to 4 0 t ha 4 4 relationship between drought and rainfed crop yields fig 7 represents the county scale pearson correlation coefficient among the agricultural drought index spesmi and the detrended rainfed crop yields corn and soybean from 2008 to 2019 the results indicate an overall positive correlation among the variables with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 30 to 0 69 for corn and 0 30 to 0 79 for soybean this indicates that a higher intensity of drought greater magnitude of spesmi negative value results in lower yield across the mrb for both crops it is important to note that majority of the counties are observed to have a poor to moderate pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0 30 to 0 59 among drought intensity higher negative value of spesmi and detrended rainfed corn yield this indicates that although a higher magnitude of the drought index hinders the crop yield yet the effect is not as intense as compared to the soybean yield where the correlation coefficient is much higher this potential weak correlation among the detrended corn yield and drought intensity can be attributed to the fact that corn is a c4 plant and has the ability to adapt under elevated carbon dioxide and hot dry environments to a certain extent lara and andreo 2011 this is because c4 plants alter the c3 photosynthesis pathway as in soybean by minimizing the water loss reducing photorespiration and increasing the photosynthetic efficiency edwards and walker 1983 therefore yield loss is likely to be reduced under mild and moderate droughts relative to soybean and leads to a poor correlation interestingly the relationship between drought intensity and detrended rainfed soybean yield reveals the highest pearson correlation values for alabama state fig 7 b with correlation coefficients between 0 5 and 0 8 majority values ranging from 0 6 to 0 8 this implies that the rainfed soybean yields are more impacted by severe droughts in alabama relative to other states and corn 4 5 standalone model calibration and validation this section provides the results of the standalone model calibration and validation including the calibration parameters for both cropwat and aquacrop gis models 4 5 1 cropwat fig 8 represents the stagewise cropwat model crop coefficients estimated by the sce algorithm over the mrb the initial stage crop coefficient varies widely across the mrb ranging from 0 561 to 0 720 for corn pioneer 1319 cultivar whereas it varies from 0 481 to 0 640 and 0 481 to 0 560 in the case of asgrow 46x6 and usda n8002 cultivars of soybean respectively in contrast a lower variation in the crop coefficient is observed for the development stage where it varies from 0 960 to 1 139 for corn and 1 020 to 1 139 for asgrow 46x6 cultivar of soybean and 0 990 to 1 109 for usda n8002 cultivar of soybean in the case of middle stage of corn the crop coefficient is observed to vary from 1 141 to 1 260 for corn and 1 081 to 1 200 1 061 to 1 160 for asgrow 46x6 usda n8002 cultivar of soybean similarly for the late stage the crop coefficient varies from 0 881 to 0 980 and 0 821 to 0 960 0 821 to 0 900 for soybean cultivar of asgrow 46x6 usda n8002 overall higher values of crop coefficient are noted for corn followed by the asgrow 46x6 cultivar of soybean and the lowest for the usda n8002 soybean cultivar based on the optimized values of the crop coefficients during model calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 56 to 0 90 with a median value ranging from 0 61 to 0 65 is observed for simulated and modis derived etc across the mrb in the case of corn fig s2 a for the same output variable etc a relatively higher value of median nse is noted for asgrow 46x6 and usda n8002 cultivars of soybean ranging from 0 71 to 0 75 and 0 66 to 0 70 respectively fig s2 b overall throughout the mrb for both soybean cultivars nse ranges from 0 61 to 0 85 the difference in the simulated cumulative etc and modis derived etc for corn ranges from 29 to 40 mm for the entire cropping season from may to october of 2013 similarly for asgrow 46x6 and usda n8002 cultivars of soybean the difference ranges from 49 to 40 mm for the whole cropping season overall both nse and difference in etc reflect a very good calibrated cropwat model throughout the entire mrb the cropwat model validation reflects nse ranging from 0 65 to 0 84 for corn across all counties with higher nse values ranging from 0 69 to 0 84 in the central and the western counties for the cropping season of 2018 the eastern counties display poor model performance with majority of the counties inheriting nse in the range of 0 65 to 0 72 fig s3 a a relatively slight poor performance is observed for the model validation results for soybean across the study area the nse for soybean ranges from 0 60 to 0 80 with lower nse values concentrated in the central and southern region of the basin fig s3 b the difference between 8 day accumulated cropwat simulated etc and 8 day modis etc also shows an analogous pattern with close to zero values in the central and western counties for corn fig s3 c in case of soybean the difference between modis and model simulated etc shows values ranging from 39 mm to 20 mm in most of the counties in the western and central region whereas higher positive values in the range of 21 mm to 40 mm in the eastern counties fig s3 d these results indicates the model performs slightly better for corn relative to soybean in the study area although the magnitude of both nse and difference in etc estimates indicates cropwat model performance is acceptable for both crops 4 5 2 aquacrop gis fig 9 represents the spatial variability of the calibrated aquacrop gis model parameters across mrb as identified in the sensitivity analysis seven model parameters are considered in the optimization tables s1 and s2 the parameters canopy growth coefficient cgc ranges between 5 0 and 22 0 coefficient harvest index increased by inhibition of leaf growth at anthesis hilf ranges between 0 0 and 3 0 and coefficient harvest index reduced by inhibition of leaf growth at anthesis hilbf ranges between 0 and 1 0 vary widely across the river basin for corn ranging from 11 00 to 19 99 fig 9 a 0 690 to 0 789 fig 9 f and 0 080 to 0 239 fig 9 g respectively on the contrary for soybean cultivars the variability of the corresponding model parameters are slender fig 9 h m n o t and u interestingly it can also be seen that the calibrated values of all model parameters are lower for soybean crop relative to corn moreover the calibrated values are noted to be lower for the usda n8002 cultivar compared to the asgrow 46x6 cultivar the spatial variation in the aquacrop gis model performance during model calibration is shown in fig s4 the coefficient of determination r2 of corn and soybean yields ranges from 0 70 to 0 87 and 0 79 to 0 93 respectively fig s4 a and b similarly the r2 among the aquacrop gis simulated shallow soil moisture 5 cm and 1 km soil moisture derived from abbaszadeh et al 2019 indicates variability from 0 70 to 0 87 and 0 73 to 0 90 for corn and soybean cropping seasons respectively since r2 0 70 throughout the mrb using the criteria set by moriasi et al 2007 the model is well calibrated for aquacrop gis model validation the correlation coefficient among model simulated and observed soil moisture is noted to range from 0 56 to 0 90 for corn and 0 56 to 0 85 for soybean across the mrb fig s5 a and b similarly the r2 ranges from 0 66 to 0 90 and 0 60 to 0 85 for the corresponding crops fig s5 c and d similar to cropwat model a slightly better performance in model simulations is observed for corn crop compared to soybean at the study area a lower correlation coefficient and r2 is observed in the central region for soybean nevertheless both correlation coefficient and r2 suggests aquacrop gis performs well for both crops 4 6 irrigated corn yield during drought years the result of the integrated modeling framework depicts a wide spectrum of yield change under irrigation relative to the rainfed yield at mrb during drought years the irrigated corn yield is noted to change from 10 to 259 with the highest yields observed for 100 irrigation of iwr in the year 2012 fig 10 k on the contrary the lowest increase in corn yields 10 29 is noted for the 50 irrigation of iwr particularly in the western region mississippi and northern region of the years 2008 and 2011 respectively this potential low increase in yields is obvious pertaining to the unmet crop water demand during droughts even under irrigated conditions although the eastern region georgia of the basin experienced severe to extreme droughts in the year 2012 a higher increase in the corn yield 70 109 is observed under 50 irrigation for the corresponding region relative to the central alabama and western mississippi regions fig 10 c in the case of 75 irrigation of iwr a hike in the simulated yield is observed relative to the 50 irrigation for all counties irrespective of the drought years overall the increase in corn yield ranges from 50 to 179 for all four drought years a majority of the counties are noted to have a yield increase within the range of 100 159 for the year 2012 fig 10 g this pattern of potential yield increase is consistent with that of the 50 irrigation of iwr for the eastern counties which experienced severe to extreme droughts for the year 2012 in case of the year 2016 the western counties including alabama and mississippi experienced a yield increase of 20 79 whereas the central alabama and eastern georgia and tennessee counties observed to have an increase in yield within the range of 120 179 this potential low yield increase in the western counties can be attributed to the near normal precipitation conditions in the region in 2016 reflecting that iwr is met by the precipitation on the other hand for the eastern counties persistent drought during the cropping period resulted in unmet iwr which is supplemented by 75 irrigation resulting in a higher yield increase the corn yield simulated for 100 irrigation of iwr illustrates that the yield increase ranges from 70 to 239 70 to 219 80 to 259 and 30 to 209 for the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 respectively across all the counties relative to the rainfed corn yield fig 10 i j k and l the maximum and minimum yield increases are observed for the years 2012 and 2016 which corresponds to the highest and lowest drought intensities respectively interestingly for three out of four years 2008 2012 and 2016 the peak increase in irrigated corn yield is observed for the eastern region state of georgia nevertheless compared to all three irrigation water application rates 100 irrigation results in the maximum potential increase in corn yield relative to the rainfed corn yield for all drought years 4 7 irrigated soybean yield during drought years the irrigated soybean yield results of the integrated cropwat aquacrop gis modeling framework illustrates an increase in potential yield relative to the rainfed soybean yield for all counties under all three irrigation water application rates the yield increase ranges from 20 to 229 throughout all counties under all three irrigation water application rates for all four drought years fig 11 for 50 irrigation water application of iwr the lowest potential increase in yield is noted for the year 2008 with a magnitude of 20 to 79 in the counties of central alabama and western mississippi region however the soybean yield increase is higher 90 119 for the eastern region counties georgia similar results are also noted for the potential yield increase in the case of the year 2012 while for 2011 counties in the middle and the northern region are observed to have a lower magnitude of the potential yield increase relative to the southern region the potential increase in yield is noted to range from 80 to 129 for central to eastern counties and 20 to 49 for western counties in the case of 75 of irrigation water application rate of iwr the potential increase in soybean yield ranges from 50 to 189 across all counties and all four years an analogous pattern of increase in yield is noted for the years 2008 and 2012 where the eastern counties are observed to have the highest potential increase in yield relative to the central and western counties fig 11 e and g the yield increase in the case of 2016 ranges from 130 to 169 in central alabama state and eastern georgia state counties whereas 50 to 99 in western counties mississippi state similar to the results of irrigated corn yield the maximum potential increase in yield is observed for the 100 irrigation of iwr for all years in georgia and tennessee states the yield increase ranges from 190 to 219 relative to rainfed yield in 2008 a relatively lower increase in yield is observed for alabama state 100 169 followed by mississippi 80 129 for the corresponding year the southern counties are observed to have the highest potential increase in soybean yield for the year 2011 fig 11 j a relatively low range of potential soybean yield increase 100 139 is observed for a majority of the counties in the year 2012 except for the eastern counties in alabama and georgia where the range is observed to be 140 229 for the corresponding year most of the counties in 2016 are noticed to have irrigated soybean yield in the range of 130 to 219 in alabama georgia and tennessee states whereas the yield increase is merely 100 to 139 in mississippi state fig 11 l 5 discussion droughts negatively impact crop yields by affecting the critical growth stages deb et al 2015 mcnider et al 2015 yu et al 2018 in this study first county scale agricultural drought was identified and the results indicate a majority of the counties are impacted by droughts during the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 with the most severe drought during 2012 this finding is consistent with the us drought monitor svoboda et al 2002 and the spesmi approach findings by xu et al 2020 by visual comparison of the drought severity derived from the spesmi fig 4 and rainfed corn and soybean yields figs 5 and 6 it can be clearly seen that the yield is a response to drought severity with lower yields noted for counties under severe to extreme droughts although in this study the effect of drought intensity severity at different stages of the crop life cycle is not investigated it would be interesting to further evaluate this in a future study a positive relationship between detrended crop yield and spesmi agricultural drought index is found among all counties within the mrb a positive correlation means a higher magnitude of the drought index higher negative value representing intense drought leading to a poor crop yield although a low intensity drought does not always guarantee a higher yield the study region has also experienced several low intensity and frequent flash droughts ranging from weeks to two months in the past christian et al 2019 mo and lettenmaier 2020 where the crop growth can be significantly reduced if droughts occur during the critical crop growth stages while this analysis considered 3 month spesmi the effects of short term droughts in crop yields are not accounted for since this is beyond the scope of this paper nevertheless a similar positive correlation among drought indices and crop yields was also reported by peña gallardo et al 2019 and zhou et al 2020 for different crops in the major cropping belts over the conus another significant finding of the correlation test is that higher correlation coefficient is noted for the state of alabama in case of soybean crop fig 7 the underlying cause for this is most likely due to the choice of soybean cultivar asgrow 46x6 although this cultivar is a high yielding indeterminate variety new leaves grow even after flowering the cultivar is drought intolerant ross 2019 since its high photosynthesis demand provokes high water stress during droughts leading to early plant death on the other hand farmers of georgia tennessee and mississippi choose a drought resistant cultivar usda n8002 over other traditional cultivars carter et al 2016 which exhibits delayed canopy wilting even under drought stress leading to higher yield relative to asgrow 46x6 cultivar as mentioned earlier the novel part of this study is integrating an iwr model and a spatial crop yield simulation model in the robust estimation of crop yields during drought years while accounting for the simulated iwr irrigation scheduling within the framework the initial step requires stand alone calibration of both models and the results of model performance are presented in figs s1 and s2 supporting information file and calibration parameters are presented in figs 8 and 9 it is worth noting that the poor cropwat model performance during validation for corn in the eastern counties is likely due to the underestimation of the plant available water by the model particularly in georgia this is because georgia has the highest number of farmland in the region leading to a significant amount of soil preparation tillage and since the model employs the usda soil conservation service approach of effective rainfall calculation which is empirical the model likely fails in the robust calculation of the water loss leading to inaccurate estimation of plant available water similar poor cropwat model performance in agriculture dominant regions were also reported by awad et al 2021 and babu et al 2015 overall these results indicate both models are in good agreement with the observed reported variables across all counties while the overall area under irrigation in the us continues to rise specifically in the major corn and soybean belts rainfed agricultural practices are dominant in the deep southern states portmann et al 2010 the results of this study indicate that iwr varies spatially and temporally at mrb for instance iwr ranges from 80 to 319 mm and 60 to 419 mm during the years 2008 and 2012 respectively for corn fig s6 a and c similarly iwr varies between 0 and 259 mm and 40 to 419 mm for the corresponding years respectively in the case of soybean fig s7 a and c this illustrates that a significant amount of water required by crops is unmet by precipitation during drought years another critical finding of the iwr simulation is that the severe to extreme drought impacted counties show higher iwr this is apparent since during droughts vapor pressure deficit is higher relative to the normal precipitation period and this results in higher transpiration from crops luo et al 2016 although it is also argued that during water stress crops either roll up or reduce intake of sunlight to reduce photosynthesis and thus the lowering water requirement however crop transpiration does not significantly reduce until the soil moisture falls below 50 of the available water capacity schneekloth and andales 2017 nevertheless this study indicates that the iwr is higher in the counties experiencing severe to extreme droughts the simulation of the integrated framework illustrates the maximum yield can be potentially achieved at the counties which experience the most intense droughts this is obvious since supplemental irrigation eliminates plant water stress fereres and soriano 2007 it is noteworthy that during intense droughts higher temperature leads to increased plant water use and this contributes to high plant mortality rate reduced yield since water is unavailable during droughts under rainfed agriculture will et al 2013 another important finding of the integrated modeling framework is that the maximum yield can be attained by 100 irrigation of iwr in the most intense drought affected counties for both crops figs 10 and 11 these findings highlight that in order to meet the water demands of increasing the corn and soybean yields irrigation is imperative and hence a change in the current agricultural practices is crucial to combat these negative impacts of droughts and make the region more self reliant moreover given the projected scarcity of water in the future judicious use of water is critical and integrated modeling approaches such as one suggested here can play a decisive role in increasing crop yield under droughts relative to the concurrent practices while global gridded crop models are also available in literature which can be forced with iwr datasets due to their coarse spatial resolution grid size often 70 km the results are unreliable and are not applicable for regional to county scale irrigation water planning and management moreover these models require high performance computing and high level coding skills whereas the integrated modeling framework employed here is widely applicable for regional scale studies and does not require high coding expertise and can be used by a water modeler for simulating robust county scale agricultural plans under droughts the authors acknowledge that a limitation of this study is lumping the spatial soil characteristics at county scale in the integrated modeling framework however this study intends to demonstrate the applicability of the novel framework at county scale for better agricultural planning and management under drought conditions in rainfed dominant regions of course with the availability of finer spatial information farm scale or micro basin scale crop yield weather dataset and soil information the outputs of the integrated modeling framework can be of further help for micro basin scale agricultural management it is also critical to note that although more irrigation water requires higher monetary investment including water cost installation and maintenance of the irrigation system analyzing this and identifying the optimal irrigation water application rate while accounting for the irrigation costs is beyond the scope of this paper a plethora of studies have coupled crop models with hydrological both surface water and groundwater and irrigation models in the past e g mcnider et al 2015 mcnider et al 2011 lopez et al 2017 rossetto et al 2019 roy et al 2019 sabzzadeh shourian 2020 while these studies are conducted with the primary objective of optimization of irrigation using subsurface water retention technology developing irrigation scheduling in a crop model and simulating conjunctive use of irrigation water resources none has applied a multi model integration framework in simulation of maximizing the potential crop yields using irrigation under droughts moreover although aquacrop the core component of the aquacrop gis model is a widely used model globally the application of the spatial version of the model i e aquacrop gis model employed in this study is limited therefore this study further reinforces the latter s applicability at the basin scale furthermore the model integration framework proposed in this study is simple and provides the flexibility of model selection since models used in this framework can be replaced by other models over other published studies hence it is a versatile framework and its further application is suggested at a continental country scale for robust irrigation planning and management 6 conclusion while crop yields under rainfed cultivation practices generally decline during droughts irrigation can play a critical role in reducing crop yield loss however given the constraint of water scarcity during droughts an accurate estimation of the iwr and irrigation scheduling is critical therefore this study presents a novel integrated modeling framework by using two parsimonious models namely cropwat an iwr simulation model and aquacrop gis a spatial crop yield simulation model to simulate corn and soybean yields at county scale under droughts in the mrb the calculation of spesmi agricultural drought index suggests mild to severe droughts varying spatially across the counties during the years 2008 2011 2012 and 2016 additionally a moderate to strong positive correlation is also noted among spesmi and detrended crop yields across the counties furthermore the integrated modeling approach reveals an increase in corn and soybean yields ranging from 10 to 259 and 20 to 229 respectively under different irrigation water application rates relative to rainfed crop yield for the four drought years within mrb although the integrated modeling framework presented in this study is time consuming it is essential in the deep south region and other similar regions where droughts are frequent and recurrent and farmers generally practice rainfed agriculture craig et al 2019 the integrated modeling framework simulates iwr and crop yield robustly and helps in devising better irrigation planning and management under drought conditions this is because the integrated modeling framework is capable of intaking the current operational weather prediction as input in calculating appropriate iwr and resulting potential increase in the crop yields especially during forecasted droughts furthermore the findings of this study can be used by state or local governments for capacity building and educating farmers to transition from rainfed to irrigated agriculture to avoid crop yield loss in the future it is worth noting that shifting from rainfed to irrigated agriculture may consume the regional surface or groundwater resources while some regions may be water limited and are not capable to attain the 100 irrigation level the irrigation should be based on water availability although the aim of this paper is not to evaluate how much water is realistically available for irrigation during droughts or whether is it economically viable the authors

3419,sub daily rainfall is used in modelling of small catchments design of urban drainage calculating soil erosion understanding the water balance of vegetated catchments and assessing the impact of climate change on short duration storms hence it is critical to ensure that sub daily rainfall records are homogeneous but with a global shift to automated measurement of rainfall there has been a change in the rainfall recording instrumentation although changes in instrumentation should be documented in many cases this is not the case and station metadata are missing as result studies of rainfall patterns particularly those investigating trends often cannot report their treatment of possible inhomogeneities and must assume the data is suitable for further analysis here we argue that standard quality assurance methods for checking inhomogeneities in rainfall may not identify a change in the rainfall record due to a change in instrumentation through testing 1 an aggregation of rainfall to the coarsest instrument resolution 2 removal of rainfall below a minimum rainfall depth 3 removal of rainfall below a minimum accumulation event depth and 4 a combination of the above adjustments we present recommendations for ensuring sub daily rainfall is homogenous with minimum alteration to the rainfall record we assess the proposed methods using the case study of australia s sub daily rainfall monitoring network where in 1996 the pluviograph network was switched to tipping buckets creating a large sample test bed with a known systematic instrumentation change our results show that event based statistics are considerably more sensitive to instrument change than annually aggregated rainfall statistics and hence standard methods for quality assurance may not identify possible inhomogeneities we suggest an aggregation of the data to the coarsest instrument resolution with the removal of small rainfall accumulations can alleviate inhomogeneities for event based statistics whereas for annual statistics aggregation to the coarsest instrument resolution is sufficient in the absence of a known instrumentation change removing rainfall at or below the instrument resolution is also a viable technique for improving rainfall record homogeneity for event based statistics these findings will aid future sub daily rainfall studies by justifying the use of a minimum rainfall or event depth for subsequent analysis keywords rainfall pluviograph tipping bucket rain gauge event analysis trend analysis disaggregation 1 introduction 1 1 background the temporal pattern of rainfall effects infiltration erosivity vegetation interception van dijk et al 2005 vernimmen et al 2007 as well as risk based infrastructure design o shea et al 2021 particularly in urban settings small catchments hillslopes and second order drainage networks ball 1994 grimaldi et al 2021 heneker et al 2001 verstraten et al 2019 hence accurate sub daily rainfall records are critical not only for the above applications but also disaggregation of rainfall from longer durations usually daily to hourly and sub hourly koutsoyiannis 1994 westra et al 2013 and calibration of stochastic weather generators burton et al 2008 heneker et al 2001 peleg and morin 2014 wasko and sharma 2017 which are subsequently used to model such systems boughton and droop 2003 hettiarachchi et al 2019 mullan et al 2012 despite the importance of temporal characteristics of rainfall at a sub daily resolution sub daily rainfall statistics are largely ignored in testing the homogeneity of rainfall time series in general double mass curves nathan and mcmahon 2017 searcy and hardison 1960 or break points in the rainfall amount lewis et al 2021 are used to assess if an inhomogeneity exists for example due to an instrumentation change small or trace rainfall amounts are often not used in testing for inhomogeneity with the focus usually on annual mean or extreme rainfalls but these small rainfall amounts represent a significant portion of annual total rainfall section 4 1 small rainfall amounts are relevant to important ecological functions dunkerley 2021 for example reducing the rate of photosynthesis and increasing soil respiration borken et al 2003 the accumulation of small rainfall amounts can influence the antecedent moisture conditions modulating the resultant streamflow and flooding as well as the behaviour of hydrologic models grimaldi et al 2021 hettiarachchi et al 2019 wu et al 2021 groundwater recharge can also be more sensitive to low intensity rainfalls huang and lin 2019 and rainfall totals than that from individual large events rathay et al 2018 with urban areas highly sensitive to pollutant transport from low intensity rainfalls oliver et al 2015 hence choosing what threshold or minimum depth constitutes a rainfall event and conversely the rainfall intermittency the period without rainfall is critical to any rainfall study in one example the intermittency within events changed from 13 9 when rainfall below 0 1 mm hr were considered zero to 39 2 if no rain periods were taken as those below 0 2 mm hr dunkerley 2015 despite the large sensitivity of event statistics to the choice of minimum event depth there is no consensus in the literature on what amount of rainfall amount should be considered a minimum rainfall depth or in effect zero rainfall dunkerley 2008 the fact that the literature does not contain recommendations on how to sample rainfall events leads to many different conventions for assessing minimum inter event times mit and minimum rain rates or event depths or durations in the instance of using the number of tips in a tipping bucket dunkerley 2008 in their review found studies citing mits ranging from 3 min to 24 h with differing rationale provided for these times in general mit thresholds are used to ensure independence restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 for example heneker et al 2001 observed that an mit of 2 h gives little observable correlation between successive storm depths separation times in the order of 1 2 h commonly appear in the literature gaál et al 2014 visser et al 2020 though other studies consider the mit as a multiple of the temporal resolution of the data wasko and sharma 2014 the aim of setting a minimum rainfall depth is to determine with an appropriate mit what is considered a rainfall event with rainfall below this amount considered either inconsequential to the analysis being performed or spurious salvadori and de michele 2006 a review of the literature as to what is considered a minimum event depth reveals that while most studies report the instrument resolution the adopted minimum event depth is either unclear or not reported the implications of a lack of clear reporting of the minimum event depth are further exacerbated when some data reports do not differentiate between zero rainfall and no data leading to ambiguity about whether the gauge was operating at a particular time lewis et al 2019 for those studies that do report the minimum rainfall depth table 1 briefly summarises minimum depths that are commonly adopted table 1 also reports the minimum depths as an intensity for comparison between differing data resolutions and the rationale for the choice of minimum rainfall depth in general the minimum rainfall depth will represent the resolution or detection limit of the instrument which for sub daily rainfall measurements is most commonly a tipping bucket type rain gauge hence rainfall that is measured as a solitary tip is often used as the threshold for rainfall occurrence for the u s this is usually 2 54 mm hr barbero et al 2017 groisman et al 2012 which is much greater than the minimum event depth used elsewhere in the world table 1 other rationale for threshold choice such as those that related to wet canopy evaporation rates give similar minimum rainfall depths dunkerley 2015 lloyd et al 1988 the choice of minimum rainfall depth has far reaching implications including on our understanding of climate processes for example the adopted minimum rainfall depth affects the identification of separate events through the mit as the mit is by definition the period of zero rainfall if events are correlated then an unreasonably low minimum rainfall depth will inflate statistical significance and can result in identification of a climate change signal when one does not exist indeed this is a common issue in studies of climatic data von storch 1999 for engineering design the choice of mit will affect the rainfall storm selection and so the duration and volume of the design hydrograph although rainfall mechanisms can be studied using daily data dey et al 2020 pepler et al 2021 sub daily rainfall is often required to characterize the event dependencies of key interest berg et al 2013 gaál et al 2014 ruiz leo et al 2013 for example the association of rainfall with temperature for projection of rainfall extremes with climate change hettiarachchi et al 2018 lenderink and attema 2015 manola et al 2018 is affected by the intermittence of the rainfall schleiss 2018 accurately sampling the temperature before the event which depends on the spacing between events adopted will affect the rainfall temperature association visser et al 2020 the issue of what minimum rainfall depth to adopt for studying rainfall is further complicated by changes in instrumentation changes in instrumentation although commonly encountered are often undocumented lucas 2010 and can introduce data errors requiring significant quality assurance efforts lewis et al 2021 although it is common to find that instrumentation at an individual station has changed at some point in time such changes have also occurred systematically across regional or continental observation networks for example the uk met office shifted to automatic rainfall measurement using tipping buckets across the synoptic network in the 1980s and 1990s from 1948 to 1960 gauges across the united states that recorded with a resolution of 0 254 mm were gradually replaced with gauges with a resolution of 2 54 mm groisman et al 2012 commencing in 1996 the instrumentation used in the australian sub daily rainfall network was progressively changed from dines tilting syphon pluviograph to tipping bucket rain gauge meaning that analogue chart observations which were originally manually digitised to 0 01 mm resolution at a minimum interval of six minutes were replaced by digital records with a resolution of 0 2 mm 1 2 problem statement to present the sensitivity of event based statistics relative to annual rainfall statistics to changes in instrumentation we introduce 6 minute rainfall from melbourne regional office fig 1 we know that the instrument changed from a dines pluviograph to a tipping bucket rain gauge around 1996 using the pettitt test to detect abrupt changes the mean annual rainfall displays no statistically significant change points fig 1a the reduction in mean rainfall post 1996 from 607 mm to 487 mm is likely the result of declines in rainfall in the extra tropics of australia due to climate change dey et al 2019 wasko et al 2021 a different statistic of interest however may be the mean event rainfall intensity which is expected to intensify with climate change fowler et al 2021 assuming a minimum rainfall depth of 0 mm and mit of 1 h the time series of annual mean event rainfall intensity is presented in fig 1b there is a clear statistically significant change point in 1996 there is also an instrument drift after another step change prior to 1996 any trend calculated on this station data would be anomalous and this rainfall record cannot be considered homogenous for calculation of event based statistics albeit appearing homogenous for total annual rainfall most methods of ensuring homogeneity focus on bias correction and there remains a lack of published literature on the implications of undetected changes in instrumentation on the calculation of event based statistics westra and sisson 2011 were aware of this possible discontinuity in their assessment of australian rainfall records and applied a univariate non stationary gev with a covariate for a step change at the time of instrumentation change of the 30 stations analysed 17 had a positive step change and 13 were negative the authors concluded that as a systematic shift would move the statistics in one direction any impact on a trend analysis would be minor additionally removing this step change and performing the analysis prior to any instrumentation change didn t affect their results however using several years of overlapping dines pluviograph data from six stations across australia srikanthan et al 2000 found a consistent over recording 2 5 by the tipping bucket compared to the pluviograph in five out of the six stations considered underestimation at the remaining station was attributed to the relatively large number of days with light rainfall as the differences in the annual rainfall were found to statistically significant at the 5 level it was concluded that while the tipping bucket and pluviograph data may be combined for analysis of extreme values as is required for derivation of design intensity frequency duration curves it is not suitable to combine the data for daily and monthly climate analyses as changes in instrumentation can have large effects on the interpretation and use of sub daily rainfall statistics particularly statistics based on low rainfall rates there is a need to ensure that due account is given to all systematic sources of inhomogeneity the australian sub daily rainfall network forms a unique test case where a large number of stations switched in both instrument type and resolution within a short time period this means we can test whether our data is homogeneous against a very well defined change point and ensure our results are robust due the continental scale of our analyses specifically we aim to answer the following questions 1 how can we ensure changes in instrumentation do not affect statistical analyses 2 what is an appropriate minimum threshold for rainfall occurrence here we focus our evaluation on two key potential applications 1 event based statistics where the temporal structure of the rainfall is important and 2 annual statistics which are often used to investigate non stationarity 2 methods 2 1 data the australian bureau of meteorology maintains data from 1503 sub daily rainfall measuring stations across australia and its territories sub daily rainfall data are provided at a resolution of 6 min historically dines pluviometers or simply pluviometers were used to measure sub daily rainfall the pluviometers traced the amount mass of water in a cylinder using a spring on a piece of paper which was subsequently digitized to 6 min increments at a resolution of 0 01 mm around the 1990s and early 2000s the australian bureau of meteorology embarked on a program to replace this paper chart recording network with tipping bucket rain gauges of resolution 0 2 mm osburn et al 2021 srikanthan et al 2000 westra and sisson 2011 our inspection of station metadata finds that the date of installation does not always match the date at which the data resolution changes which is the date indicating a change in the instrument used for reporting the meticulous electronic collection of metadata in australia began in 1997 and much data before this was not converted into electronic format lucas 2010 however our visual inspection of the data records shows that the instruments at the stations analysed were switched from dines pluviograph to tipping bucket gauges in late 1996 through to 2001 with the majority of stations switched in late 1996 hence for the purposes of this manuscript we use 1996 as our reference breakpoint an example of how the two instruments perform is presented in fig 2 there are two possibilities for how tips are recorded either the tips are recorded instantaneously or the rainfall can be interpolated between tips here the tipping bucket rain gauge data is recorded as instantaneous tips when a dines pluviograph chart recorder is used the resolution is 0 01 mm fig 2a and the temporal pattern of the data is much smoother than if instantaneous tips were to be recorded by a tipping bucket in increments of 0 2 mm fig 2b there is a trade off between record length and number of stations that can be used for analysis we perform all our analysis between the years 1970 and 2014 inclusive resulting in 71 stations being analysed across australia s mainland we note that the australia bureau of meteorology does not continuously update sub daily rainfall data and hence our analyse does not extend past 2014 values flagged as being suspect incorrect estimated interpolated and missing were removed visual inspection found that not all estimated values were correctly flagged misclassified data is an error that has been previously identified for example in australian daily rainfall data where accumulations are not always flagged viney and bates 2004 prior to 1996 many sites have a systematic increasing decreasing trend in the values flagged as estimated despite the instrument performance being stationary the result is an induced trend in the event length and intensity fig 1b prior to 1996 to remove this erroneous data an additional filter removing runs of repeated values of length equal to the mit in this case 1 h was applied years that had significant missing data were also omitted as a guiding principle a minimum of five events per year were needed for a year to be included in the analysis but the annual statistics were also visually inspected and erroneous years removed analysis was performed on the basis of calendar years the final data set including which years were omitted is presented in the appendix 2 2 adjustment of sub daily rainfall we applied four adjustments to our data set 1 an aggregation to match the resolution of the two instruments 2 removal of rainfall depth equal to or below a minimum depth which may be considered zero rainfall 3 removal of rainfall below a minimum accumulation event depth and 4 a combination of an aggregation to match the resolution and subsequent removal of rainfall equal to or below a minimum depth the issue of differing data resolution was noted in groisman et al 2012 where since the 1960s the tipping bucket gauges in the u s recording at 0 254 mm have been gradually replaced with tipping bucket gauges recording at a resolution of 2 54 mm to minimize errors in the aggregation step we adopt the solution suggested by groisman et al 2012 an approach that has been applied in several studies that use sub daily u s rainfall data e g barbero et al 2019 2017 and australia visser et al 2021 in essence the pluviograph data is re analysed to emulate a tipping bucket gauge to this end the rainfall measured by the pluviograph is summed to the resolution of the tipping bucket when the rainfall sum exceeds the tipping bucket resolution a tip is reported at the resolution amount and any residual rainfall is added to subsequent observations until again the tipping bucket resolution is reached this process is then repeated till the end of the data set is reached here we propose an additional adjustment to remove data equal to or below a minimum rainfall if the resolution of the data varies it is intuitive to remove any data below the coarsest instrument resolution to ensure homogeneity of the calculated statistics this is supported by the fact that digitized records are incomplete representations of continuous rainfall and contain unidentified rainfall breakpoints sansom 1992 we remove any rainfall equal to or below the tipping bucket resolution 0 2 mm however as noted in subsequent sections this results in the removal of a large amount of information as a result we also test removal of relatively small rainfall accumulations that is 1 mm which is a threshold commonly adopted to record rainfall occurrence using a daily read rain gauge finally we test the use of both aggregation and rainfall removal in unison 2 3 statistical analysis two statistical analyses are performed on the time series from 1970 to 2014 1 an event based analysis where the mean event statistic is calculated for each year after identification of rainfall events and 2 an annual analysis where rainfall statistics are calculated on each individual calendar year of data rainfall events are identified using a peaks over threshold algorithm implemented in the hydroevents package wasko and guo 2021 2022 in the software r an event is considered to have occurred if the rainfall is above zero with rainfall equal to or below the minimum event depth removed in this case 0 00 and 0 20 mm we adopt a mit of 1 h to check for a change in the instrumentation in 1996 we implement the pettitt change point test pettitt 1979 where the null hypothesis is that there is no change in the distribution of the data series and the alternative hypothesis that the data has a change consider each statistic xi for years i 1 t the difference for each pair of statistics is calculated and assigned a sign d such that d 1 if the difference is greater than zero d 1 when the difference is less than zero and d 0 if the two values are equal the test statistic k which gives the position of the possible change point is then k max 1 i t u t t where u t t i 1 t j i 1 t d ij significance is reported at the 5 level throughout the manuscript and the significance probability or p value p is calculated using the approximation p 2 e 6 k 2 t 3 t 2 3 results 3 1 event statistics we begin by demonstrating the proposed homogeneity adjustments using data from melbourne regional office from 1970 to 2014 with the results of the pettitt test presented in table 2 fig 3 a presents the same data in fig 1b where a statistically significant change point represented by the solid black circle on the time axis was found in the mean annual storm intensity in 1996 commensurate with the change in instrumentation from pluviograph to tipping bucket using a minimum depth above 0 2 mm a statistically significant change point is again found near 1996 fig 3b but the data pre 1996 appears more homogenous with a removal of small rainfall amounts fig 3b the mean event intensity is now much greater compared with the original data fig 3a with removal of events of rainfall less than or equal to 1 mm the change the change point near 1996 remains fig 3c albeit the entire data series now appears more homogenous removal of small rainfall amounts can help remove data inhomogeneities due to instrument change and in part remove the drift in the recording instrument pre 1996 data adjustment emulating a tipping bucket is presented in fig 3d the mean storm intensity is more homogenous fig 3d compared to the original data fig 3a and no statistically significant change point is found table 2 this is the ideal case because the lack of a significant change point around the time at which an instrument change occurred means that there is no need to make further adjustments to data set unfortunately as later results will show statistically significant change points are still often present despite the depth resolution being constant across the whole data set a second step of adjustment removing all rainfall 0 2 mm and below results in a mean storm intensity time series with no statistically significant change point fig 3e and lesser significance in the identified change point table 2 it does not appear that there is further improvement in homogeneity when a minimum event depth of 1 0 mm is adopted fig 3f but an advantage here is that compared to removing all rainfall 0 2 mm and below the mean event intensities resemble that of the original data for the interested reader a similar example is presented for station 057095 in figure s1 the analysis presented in fig 3 for melbourne regional office is extended to the 71 stations across australia for the years 1970 to 2014 inclusive with the change point year for each station for mean event intensity presented in fig 4 as anticipated by the results for the melbourne regional office fig 3a many of the stations across australia exhibit a statistically significant change point between 1996 and 2000 fig 4a there is some suggestion that more change points occur in the south commensurate with the greater amount of small rainfall depths recorded section 4 1 a histogram of the statistically significant change points at the 5 level is presented in fig 5 a there is a strong peak at the end of the 1990s corresponding to the instrument change in approximately 1996 we can safely conclude that this data set is not homogenous using a minimum rainfall depth of 0 2 mm fig 4b or event depth of 1 0 mm fig 4c does not appear to substantially reduce the number of change points observed around the year 1996 fig 5b 5c we can again conclude this data set is not temporally homogenous applying the aggregation to tipping bucket resolution reduces the number of statistically significant change points fig 4d but there remain a small number of statistically significant change points around the year 1996 suggesting that the impact of instrumentation change has not been fully removed fig 5d removing rainfall equal to and below 0 2 mm results in fewer change points detected around 1996 fig 4e with remaining change points likely associated with the incorrect classification of missing values pre 1996 fig 5e removal of events less than 1 mm results in the fewest change points fig 4f and the most uniform distribution of change points through time fig 5f it is prudent to also investigate the homogeneity of the event length as removal of rainfall below a certain depth reduces event length and increases the mean annual event intensity fig 3b e fig 6 presents histograms of statistically significant change points for the annual mean event length the event length appears to be more sensitive to the instrumentation change than the event intensity fig 5 as aggregation of the original data fig 6a to the tipping bucket resolution fig 6d does not result in a pronounced reduction in the large of number of stations that exhibit a statistically significant change point in event length at the time of instrumentation change aggregation of data to the tipping bucket resolution is hence not sufficient to achieve data homogeneity the inhomogeneity in the event length can explain some of the inhomogeneity in the storm event intensity as longer events could be expected in the pluviograph data as compared to the tipping bucket data thus reducing the mean event intensity only when the rainfall data is aggregated to the tipping bucket resolution and any rainfall data equal to or below 0 2 mm fig 6e or any events less than or equal to 1 0 mm fig 6f are removed do we see the most evidence for homogeneity in annual average storm event length very few stations exhibit statistically significant change points and their distribution is uniform over time simply removing data below or equal to the minimum event depth of 0 2 mm also reduces the number of statistically significant change points fig 6b as does removing events less than or equal to 1 mm fig 6c but not to the extent when these adjustments are made after aggregating to the tipping bucket resolution 3 2 annual statistics in section 1 2 we posed that annual statistics such as the mean annual rainfall are less likely to be affected by instrumentation change than event based statistics here we check if the instrumentation change in 1996 has had a significant impact on annual statistics in doing so we can make comment on whether typical inhomogeneity tests such as those based around double mass curves and annual statistics are as likely to identify instrumentation change as event based statistics fig 7 presents the percentage of stations by 4 year time block with statistically significant change points for unaggregated data aggregated data and aggregated data with minimum depth 0 2 mm and minimum event accumulations 1 0 mm removed only 5 6 of stations which is approximately the number that could be expected by chance exhibit statistically significant change points in the mean or total rainfall for the unaccumulated and accumulated data with no distinct spatial pattern not shown seen in any of the data sets this confirms that inhomogeneities in the data set as presented in section 3 1 using event based statistics would not have been identified if annual mass curves were used for inhomogeneity testing this result also points to the success of the change point test in not identifying spurious change points due to a trend statistically significant trends in mean rainfall have occurred across australia due to climate change dey et al 2019 wasko et al 2021 but the number of change points identified is small suggesting that any change point identified is in fact due to a change in instrumentation we can adopt the percentage of stations showing statistically significant change points for the mean annual rainfall as a baseline for which to compare the other annual statistics there is some evidence of non stationarity at or around 1996 in the variance fig 7 aggregating the rainfall to the tipping bucket resolution reduces the number of stations with statistically significant change points for variance particularly around the time of instrument change it is expected that a change in the instrument resolution would result in a change in the proportion of zero rainfalls recorded pzero and hence almost all stations display statistically significant change points in pzero fig 7 aggregation to the tipping bucket resolution and removing small rainfall amounts results in the number of stations with statistically significant change points in pzero being similar to the number of statistically significant change points in mean rainfall suggesting that these adjustments aid the creation of a homogenous data set percentiles will exhibit a discontinuity at 1996 simply due to the instrumentation change resulting in a different resolution osburn et al 2021 for this reason statistics are not presented for removing small rainfall amounts from the unaggregated raw data as this will only induce greater inhomogeneity in such statistics as the mean rainfall and rainfall percentiles this is confirmed through inspection of the 99th percentile p99 where almost all stations have a statistically significant change point close to the time of instrument change when data is not aggregated fig 7 however even after aggregation to tipping bucket resolution is undertaken more than a quarter of stations continue to exhibit a statistically significant change point the number of stations exhibiting a statistically significant change point after aggregation for p99 is similar to those of the maximum rainfall pmax there does not appear to be a peak in the number of stations with a statistically significant change point for pmax at or around 1996 the large number of change points for pmax as compared to the number of stations with change points for the mean is curious one might expect trends in extreme values to be more difficult to identify than in the annual mean rainfall figure s2 presents time series for the 6 stations with the lowest p values for their change point it appears there is no statistically significant shift in the data due to an instrumentation change around 1996 but rather there is a consistent trend in the extreme rainfall which is identified by the pettitt test we can conclude for annual statistics that aggregation of data is a key requirement to ensure homogeneity with removal of small rainfall depths or accumulations providing minimal improvement in the homogeneity of the record 4 discussion 4 1 implications of minimum event depth choice we presented the choice of two different minimum depth removals the tipping bucket resolution 0 2 mm applied to each rainfall observation and removal of any aggregation equal to or below 1 0 mm there was some marginal improvement in the homogeneity of our data sets for event based statistics section 3 1 when no aggregation was performed by using a minimum event depth of 0 2 mm but it is unclear whether removal of this data is justified when small low intensity rainfall amounts are important to many ecological and environmental processes fig 8 presents the percentage of the total rainfall removed for the two different options of rainfall removal in the tropical north of australia less than 20 of the total rainfall volume is removed by adopting a minimum event depth of 0 2 mm but this increases to 20 40 in the southern temperate regions and over 40 in the far southern cool regions fig 8a a histogram of the percentage removed fig 8b shows the median value is approximately 20 to state it another way on average one fifth of rainfall in australia has an intensity smaller than the instrument resolution of 2 mm hr when recorded at a 6 minute temporal resolution it is common practice to remove trace amounts of rainfall in hydrologic analyses but a large amount of information is contained in these trace rainfall depths if we instead apply a minimum event depth of 1 0 mm the percentage of annual rainfall removed is consistently below 20 fig 8c with a median value of 6 fig 8d as presented in section 3 1 adopting a minimum depth whether it be a rainfall depth over an increment or an event accumulation is critical to ensuring event based statistics are homogenous in the context of instrument change or drift removal of some rainfall to ensure homogeneity is unavoidable but it needs to be ensured that the information lost is either minimal or does not affect the statistics or processes of interest 4 2 sensitivity to minimum event inter event time and temporal resolution the majority of events sampled are of very short duration with station mean event lengths in order of 1 2 h figure s3 when a minimum rainfall depth of 0 2 mm is adopted the mean event duration reduces to less than one hour due to the shortening of the event length alternatively removing events with accumulations less than 1 mm results in a mean event length in the order of 2 4 h as short duration events are removed accordingly some altering of the sample statistics is inevitable if homogeneity in the annual event statistics is to be preserved as we are interested in studying short duration events these mean event lengths appear reasonable but our results could be affected by very short or long events that skew our sample to investigate this issue the change point analysis presented in fig 6 is repeated for the mean event length see fig 9 where events are partitioned into durations 6 min equivalent to removing single bucket tips 1 h less than 12 h and between 1 and 12 h here we do not remove any data below a minimum rainfall or event depth so fig 9 is most easily compared with fig 6b aggregating the data to emulate the tipping bucket and removing very short events fig 9a b results in only a few stations with statistically significant change points at or around 1996 once all events shorter than 1 h are excluded fig 9b the inhomogeneity in the event length is arguably removed and this provides an alternate sampling strategy to ensure homogeneity however it must be noted that this minimum event length is now ten times the temporal resolution of the original data and may defeat the purpose of using of sub daily data depending on the statistic of interest removing events that are greater than or equal to 12 h of duration fig 9c provides little benefit with restricting event duration to between 1 and 12 h fig 9d yielding the most robust data set it is also prudent to assess the sensitivity to the minimum interevent time section 1 1 we note that increasing the minimum interevent time mit is somewhat analogous to thresholding on a longer event as picking a longer mit will ultimately result in sampling longer events fig 9 sensitivity tests using a reduced mit of 30 min and 18 min produced results very similar to those presented in fig 5 and fig 6 and hence are not discussed in detail finally temporal resolutions different from the native data reporting resolution are often of interest when the 6 minute rainfall data was temporally aggregated to hourly it was found that change points for the mean rainfall intensity remained but not for the event length fig 10 hence removal of data from sub daily records to ensure homogeneity of event based statistics is likely to be required regardless of the temporal resolution of the rainfall 4 3 comparison to previous studies and limitations of current study using five years of overlapping record at six stations srikanthan et al 2000 concluded that the short duration rainfall data obtained from the dines pluviograph and tipping bucket rain gauge can be combined for extreme value analysis procedures such as developing intensity frequency duration curves for engineering design however it was suggested that for daily and monthly climate analyses data from the tipping bucket rain gauge and dines pluviograph should not be combined due to statistically significant differences in the total rainfall recorded although our analysis does not include overlapping data it does use much longer time series our analysis did not find evidence of change points due to instrumentation change that would preclude the use of the combined data sets for climatic studies such as investigating the mean annual rainfall though other statistics such as the variance or proportion of zero rainfall do require transformation of dines pluviograph data to emulate a tipping bucket rain gauge there is no suggestion that previous studies have been affected by the inhomogeneities in time series analysis of event based statistics that are presented here for example our results are commensurate with westra and sisson 2011 who demonstrated that the instrumentation change does not affect extreme value analysis however for the analysis of event based statistics our results suggest that aggregation of the data to the coarsest resolution tip as recommended in groisman et al 2012 is not sufficient to remove inhomogeneities due to an instrumentation change low range rainfall intensities heavily impact on the performance of tipping bucket rain gauges accuracy is low for high resolution rates and the precision of measurements has a strong variability even if the average error is low colli et al 2014 in other words the percentage error and variability is greatest for the shortest and lowest rainfall rates and the most uncertain measurements are removed when small rainfall accumulations or rainfall depths are removed future users of the data analysed here may wish to note the results presented are very sensitive to the removal of data flagged by the bom as quality code 4 that has been estimated through linear interpolation inspection of the data shows that there many instances of tips being interpolated and many of these are undocumented an interpolated value appears as an aggregation value spread evenly over the time of aggregation for example a daily value spread evenly over 24 h if these suspect values are not removed then inhomogeneities in the event based statistics are much more common as this data error is more common in the tipping bucket than the pluviograph measurement hence removal of the temporally estimated values aids interpretation of why change points are identified prior to 1996 5 conclusions inhomogeneities in rainfall measurement have traditionally been identified using annual rainfall statistics masking possible inhomogeneities in sub daily data if these inhomogeneities are not addressed there is a potential to misidentify trends in event based statistics and incorrectly parametrise stochastic rainfall generators here using a large sample of sub daily rainfall stations with a known instrument change near the year 1996 we test simple strategies for improving data homogeneity 1 an aggregation to match the resolution of the two instruments 2 removal of rainfall depth equal to or below a minimum depth which may be considered zero rainfall 3 removal of rainfall below a minimum accumulation event depth and 4 a combination of an aggregation to match the resolution and subsequent removal of rainfall equal to or below a minimum depth to ensure homogeneity of event based statistics we found that it is not sufficient to just aggregate to the coarsest instrument resolution but rather after aggregation small rainfall amounts need to be removed traditionally this has been performed by removing a minimum rainfall depth but this leads to the distortion of rainfall statistics and the removal of a large fraction of the total annual rainfall it is hence suggested that removing a minimum rainfall accumulation event depth is preferable as it results in a minimal loss of information an alternative may be to remove short rainfall events particularly events with depths less than a single tip but this will be largely subjective depending on the rainfall event durations of interest and the mit in the absence of aggregation to the coarsest instrument resolution removal of a minimum rainfall depth was also found to aid homogeneity of event based statistics for annual rainfall statistics removal of small rainfall amounts did not further aid removing inhomogeneities and aggregation to the coarsest instrument resolution was sufficient we recommend for future analyses data should be aggregated to the coarsest instrument resolution and then if event based statistics are to be calculated small rainfall event totals should be removed in the absence of a known instrumentation change removal of a minimum rainfall depth can help ensure the homogeneity of sub daily rainfalls as low intensity rainfalls equate to substantial proportions of the total annual rainfall volume and play a critical role in water resources and ecological assessments a careful assessment is required on the impact of the removal of these rainfalls on the subsequent analysis credit authorship contribution statement

3419,sub daily rainfall is used in modelling of small catchments design of urban drainage calculating soil erosion understanding the water balance of vegetated catchments and assessing the impact of climate change on short duration storms hence it is critical to ensure that sub daily rainfall records are homogeneous but with a global shift to automated measurement of rainfall there has been a change in the rainfall recording instrumentation although changes in instrumentation should be documented in many cases this is not the case and station metadata are missing as result studies of rainfall patterns particularly those investigating trends often cannot report their treatment of possible inhomogeneities and must assume the data is suitable for further analysis here we argue that standard quality assurance methods for checking inhomogeneities in rainfall may not identify a change in the rainfall record due to a change in instrumentation through testing 1 an aggregation of rainfall to the coarsest instrument resolution 2 removal of rainfall below a minimum rainfall depth 3 removal of rainfall below a minimum accumulation event depth and 4 a combination of the above adjustments we present recommendations for ensuring sub daily rainfall is homogenous with minimum alteration to the rainfall record we assess the proposed methods using the case study of australia s sub daily rainfall monitoring network where in 1996 the pluviograph network was switched to tipping buckets creating a large sample test bed with a known systematic instrumentation change our results show that event based statistics are considerably more sensitive to instrument change than annually aggregated rainfall statistics and hence standard methods for quality assurance may not identify possible inhomogeneities we suggest an aggregation of the data to the coarsest instrument resolution with the removal of small rainfall accumulations can alleviate inhomogeneities for event based statistics whereas for annual statistics aggregation to the coarsest instrument resolution is sufficient in the absence of a known instrumentation change removing rainfall at or below the instrument resolution is also a viable technique for improving rainfall record homogeneity for event based statistics these findings will aid future sub daily rainfall studies by justifying the use of a minimum rainfall or event depth for subsequent analysis keywords rainfall pluviograph tipping bucket rain gauge event analysis trend analysis disaggregation 1 introduction 1 1 background the temporal pattern of rainfall effects infiltration erosivity vegetation interception van dijk et al 2005 vernimmen et al 2007 as well as risk based infrastructure design o shea et al 2021 particularly in urban settings small catchments hillslopes and second order drainage networks ball 1994 grimaldi et al 2021 heneker et al 2001 verstraten et al 2019 hence accurate sub daily rainfall records are critical not only for the above applications but also disaggregation of rainfall from longer durations usually daily to hourly and sub hourly koutsoyiannis 1994 westra et al 2013 and calibration of stochastic weather generators burton et al 2008 heneker et al 2001 peleg and morin 2014 wasko and sharma 2017 which are subsequently used to model such systems boughton and droop 2003 hettiarachchi et al 2019 mullan et al 2012 despite the importance of temporal characteristics of rainfall at a sub daily resolution sub daily rainfall statistics are largely ignored in testing the homogeneity of rainfall time series in general double mass curves nathan and mcmahon 2017 searcy and hardison 1960 or break points in the rainfall amount lewis et al 2021 are used to assess if an inhomogeneity exists for example due to an instrumentation change small or trace rainfall amounts are often not used in testing for inhomogeneity with the focus usually on annual mean or extreme rainfalls but these small rainfall amounts represent a significant portion of annual total rainfall section 4 1 small rainfall amounts are relevant to important ecological functions dunkerley 2021 for example reducing the rate of photosynthesis and increasing soil respiration borken et al 2003 the accumulation of small rainfall amounts can influence the antecedent moisture conditions modulating the resultant streamflow and flooding as well as the behaviour of hydrologic models grimaldi et al 2021 hettiarachchi et al 2019 wu et al 2021 groundwater recharge can also be more sensitive to low intensity rainfalls huang and lin 2019 and rainfall totals than that from individual large events rathay et al 2018 with urban areas highly sensitive to pollutant transport from low intensity rainfalls oliver et al 2015 hence choosing what threshold or minimum depth constitutes a rainfall event and conversely the rainfall intermittency the period without rainfall is critical to any rainfall study in one example the intermittency within events changed from 13 9 when rainfall below 0 1 mm hr were considered zero to 39 2 if no rain periods were taken as those below 0 2 mm hr dunkerley 2015 despite the large sensitivity of event statistics to the choice of minimum event depth there is no consensus in the literature on what amount of rainfall amount should be considered a minimum rainfall depth or in effect zero rainfall dunkerley 2008 the fact that the literature does not contain recommendations on how to sample rainfall events leads to many different conventions for assessing minimum inter event times mit and minimum rain rates or event depths or durations in the instance of using the number of tips in a tipping bucket dunkerley 2008 in their review found studies citing mits ranging from 3 min to 24 h with differing rationale provided for these times in general mit thresholds are used to ensure independence restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 for example heneker et al 2001 observed that an mit of 2 h gives little observable correlation between successive storm depths separation times in the order of 1 2 h commonly appear in the literature gaál et al 2014 visser et al 2020 though other studies consider the mit as a multiple of the temporal resolution of the data wasko and sharma 2014 the aim of setting a minimum rainfall depth is to determine with an appropriate mit what is considered a rainfall event with rainfall below this amount considered either inconsequential to the analysis being performed or spurious salvadori and de michele 2006 a review of the literature as to what is considered a minimum event depth reveals that while most studies report the instrument resolution the adopted minimum event depth is either unclear or not reported the implications of a lack of clear reporting of the minimum event depth are further exacerbated when some data reports do not differentiate between zero rainfall and no data leading to ambiguity about whether the gauge was operating at a particular time lewis et al 2019 for those studies that do report the minimum rainfall depth table 1 briefly summarises minimum depths that are commonly adopted table 1 also reports the minimum depths as an intensity for comparison between differing data resolutions and the rationale for the choice of minimum rainfall depth in general the minimum rainfall depth will represent the resolution or detection limit of the instrument which for sub daily rainfall measurements is most commonly a tipping bucket type rain gauge hence rainfall that is measured as a solitary tip is often used as the threshold for rainfall occurrence for the u s this is usually 2 54 mm hr barbero et al 2017 groisman et al 2012 which is much greater than the minimum event depth used elsewhere in the world table 1 other rationale for threshold choice such as those that related to wet canopy evaporation rates give similar minimum rainfall depths dunkerley 2015 lloyd et al 1988 the choice of minimum rainfall depth has far reaching implications including on our understanding of climate processes for example the adopted minimum rainfall depth affects the identification of separate events through the mit as the mit is by definition the period of zero rainfall if events are correlated then an unreasonably low minimum rainfall depth will inflate statistical significance and can result in identification of a climate change signal when one does not exist indeed this is a common issue in studies of climatic data von storch 1999 for engineering design the choice of mit will affect the rainfall storm selection and so the duration and volume of the design hydrograph although rainfall mechanisms can be studied using daily data dey et al 2020 pepler et al 2021 sub daily rainfall is often required to characterize the event dependencies of key interest berg et al 2013 gaál et al 2014 ruiz leo et al 2013 for example the association of rainfall with temperature for projection of rainfall extremes with climate change hettiarachchi et al 2018 lenderink and attema 2015 manola et al 2018 is affected by the intermittence of the rainfall schleiss 2018 accurately sampling the temperature before the event which depends on the spacing between events adopted will affect the rainfall temperature association visser et al 2020 the issue of what minimum rainfall depth to adopt for studying rainfall is further complicated by changes in instrumentation changes in instrumentation although commonly encountered are often undocumented lucas 2010 and can introduce data errors requiring significant quality assurance efforts lewis et al 2021 although it is common to find that instrumentation at an individual station has changed at some point in time such changes have also occurred systematically across regional or continental observation networks for example the uk met office shifted to automatic rainfall measurement using tipping buckets across the synoptic network in the 1980s and 1990s from 1948 to 1960 gauges across the united states that recorded with a resolution of 0 254 mm were gradually replaced with gauges with a resolution of 2 54 mm groisman et al 2012 commencing in 1996 the instrumentation used in the australian sub daily rainfall network was progressively changed from dines tilting syphon pluviograph to tipping bucket rain gauge meaning that analogue chart observations which were originally manually digitised to 0 01 mm resolution at a minimum interval of six minutes were replaced by digital records with a resolution of 0 2 mm 1 2 problem statement to present the sensitivity of event based statistics relative to annual rainfall statistics to changes in instrumentation we introduce 6 minute rainfall from melbourne regional office fig 1 we know that the instrument changed from a dines pluviograph to a tipping bucket rain gauge around 1996 using the pettitt test to detect abrupt changes the mean annual rainfall displays no statistically significant change points fig 1a the reduction in mean rainfall post 1996 from 607 mm to 487 mm is likely the result of declines in rainfall in the extra tropics of australia due to climate change dey et al 2019 wasko et al 2021 a different statistic of interest however may be the mean event rainfall intensity which is expected to intensify with climate change fowler et al 2021 assuming a minimum rainfall depth of 0 mm and mit of 1 h the time series of annual mean event rainfall intensity is presented in fig 1b there is a clear statistically significant change point in 1996 there is also an instrument drift after another step change prior to 1996 any trend calculated on this station data would be anomalous and this rainfall record cannot be considered homogenous for calculation of event based statistics albeit appearing homogenous for total annual rainfall most methods of ensuring homogeneity focus on bias correction and there remains a lack of published literature on the implications of undetected changes in instrumentation on the calculation of event based statistics westra and sisson 2011 were aware of this possible discontinuity in their assessment of australian rainfall records and applied a univariate non stationary gev with a covariate for a step change at the time of instrumentation change of the 30 stations analysed 17 had a positive step change and 13 were negative the authors concluded that as a systematic shift would move the statistics in one direction any impact on a trend analysis would be minor additionally removing this step change and performing the analysis prior to any instrumentation change didn t affect their results however using several years of overlapping dines pluviograph data from six stations across australia srikanthan et al 2000 found a consistent over recording 2 5 by the tipping bucket compared to the pluviograph in five out of the six stations considered underestimation at the remaining station was attributed to the relatively large number of days with light rainfall as the differences in the annual rainfall were found to statistically significant at the 5 level it was concluded that while the tipping bucket and pluviograph data may be combined for analysis of extreme values as is required for derivation of design intensity frequency duration curves it is not suitable to combine the data for daily and monthly climate analyses as changes in instrumentation can have large effects on the interpretation and use of sub daily rainfall statistics particularly statistics based on low rainfall rates there is a need to ensure that due account is given to all systematic sources of inhomogeneity the australian sub daily rainfall network forms a unique test case where a large number of stations switched in both instrument type and resolution within a short time period this means we can test whether our data is homogeneous against a very well defined change point and ensure our results are robust due the continental scale of our analyses specifically we aim to answer the following questions 1 how can we ensure changes in instrumentation do not affect statistical analyses 2 what is an appropriate minimum threshold for rainfall occurrence here we focus our evaluation on two key potential applications 1 event based statistics where the temporal structure of the rainfall is important and 2 annual statistics which are often used to investigate non stationarity 2 methods 2 1 data the australian bureau of meteorology maintains data from 1503 sub daily rainfall measuring stations across australia and its territories sub daily rainfall data are provided at a resolution of 6 min historically dines pluviometers or simply pluviometers were used to measure sub daily rainfall the pluviometers traced the amount mass of water in a cylinder using a spring on a piece of paper which was subsequently digitized to 6 min increments at a resolution of 0 01 mm around the 1990s and early 2000s the australian bureau of meteorology embarked on a program to replace this paper chart recording network with tipping bucket rain gauges of resolution 0 2 mm osburn et al 2021 srikanthan et al 2000 westra and sisson 2011 our inspection of station metadata finds that the date of installation does not always match the date at which the data resolution changes which is the date indicating a change in the instrument used for reporting the meticulous electronic collection of metadata in australia began in 1997 and much data before this was not converted into electronic format lucas 2010 however our visual inspection of the data records shows that the instruments at the stations analysed were switched from dines pluviograph to tipping bucket gauges in late 1996 through to 2001 with the majority of stations switched in late 1996 hence for the purposes of this manuscript we use 1996 as our reference breakpoint an example of how the two instruments perform is presented in fig 2 there are two possibilities for how tips are recorded either the tips are recorded instantaneously or the rainfall can be interpolated between tips here the tipping bucket rain gauge data is recorded as instantaneous tips when a dines pluviograph chart recorder is used the resolution is 0 01 mm fig 2a and the temporal pattern of the data is much smoother than if instantaneous tips were to be recorded by a tipping bucket in increments of 0 2 mm fig 2b there is a trade off between record length and number of stations that can be used for analysis we perform all our analysis between the years 1970 and 2014 inclusive resulting in 71 stations being analysed across australia s mainland we note that the australia bureau of meteorology does not continuously update sub daily rainfall data and hence our analyse does not extend past 2014 values flagged as being suspect incorrect estimated interpolated and missing were removed visual inspection found that not all estimated values were correctly flagged misclassified data is an error that has been previously identified for example in australian daily rainfall data where accumulations are not always flagged viney and bates 2004 prior to 1996 many sites have a systematic increasing decreasing trend in the values flagged as estimated despite the instrument performance being stationary the result is an induced trend in the event length and intensity fig 1b prior to 1996 to remove this erroneous data an additional filter removing runs of repeated values of length equal to the mit in this case 1 h was applied years that had significant missing data were also omitted as a guiding principle a minimum of five events per year were needed for a year to be included in the analysis but the annual statistics were also visually inspected and erroneous years removed analysis was performed on the basis of calendar years the final data set including which years were omitted is presented in the appendix 2 2 adjustment of sub daily rainfall we applied four adjustments to our data set 1 an aggregation to match the resolution of the two instruments 2 removal of rainfall depth equal to or below a minimum depth which may be considered zero rainfall 3 removal of rainfall below a minimum accumulation event depth and 4 a combination of an aggregation to match the resolution and subsequent removal of rainfall equal to or below a minimum depth the issue of differing data resolution was noted in groisman et al 2012 where since the 1960s the tipping bucket gauges in the u s recording at 0 254 mm have been gradually replaced with tipping bucket gauges recording at a resolution of 2 54 mm to minimize errors in the aggregation step we adopt the solution suggested by groisman et al 2012 an approach that has been applied in several studies that use sub daily u s rainfall data e g barbero et al 2019 2017 and australia visser et al 2021 in essence the pluviograph data is re analysed to emulate a tipping bucket gauge to this end the rainfall measured by the pluviograph is summed to the resolution of the tipping bucket when the rainfall sum exceeds the tipping bucket resolution a tip is reported at the resolution amount and any residual rainfall is added to subsequent observations until again the tipping bucket resolution is reached this process is then repeated till the end of the data set is reached here we propose an additional adjustment to remove data equal to or below a minimum rainfall if the resolution of the data varies it is intuitive to remove any data below the coarsest instrument resolution to ensure homogeneity of the calculated statistics this is supported by the fact that digitized records are incomplete representations of continuous rainfall and contain unidentified rainfall breakpoints sansom 1992 we remove any rainfall equal to or below the tipping bucket resolution 0 2 mm however as noted in subsequent sections this results in the removal of a large amount of information as a result we also test removal of relatively small rainfall accumulations that is 1 mm which is a threshold commonly adopted to record rainfall occurrence using a daily read rain gauge finally we test the use of both aggregation and rainfall removal in unison 2 3 statistical analysis two statistical analyses are performed on the time series from 1970 to 2014 1 an event based analysis where the mean event statistic is calculated for each year after identification of rainfall events and 2 an annual analysis where rainfall statistics are calculated on each individual calendar year of data rainfall events are identified using a peaks over threshold algorithm implemented in the hydroevents package wasko and guo 2021 2022 in the software r an event is considered to have occurred if the rainfall is above zero with rainfall equal to or below the minimum event depth removed in this case 0 00 and 0 20 mm we adopt a mit of 1 h to check for a change in the instrumentation in 1996 we implement the pettitt change point test pettitt 1979 where the null hypothesis is that there is no change in the distribution of the data series and the alternative hypothesis that the data has a change consider each statistic xi for years i 1 t the difference for each pair of statistics is calculated and assigned a sign d such that d 1 if the difference is greater than zero d 1 when the difference is less than zero and d 0 if the two values are equal the test statistic k which gives the position of the possible change point is then k max 1 i t u t t where u t t i 1 t j i 1 t d ij significance is reported at the 5 level throughout the manuscript and the significance probability or p value p is calculated using the approximation p 2 e 6 k 2 t 3 t 2 3 results 3 1 event statistics we begin by demonstrating the proposed homogeneity adjustments using data from melbourne regional office from 1970 to 2014 with the results of the pettitt test presented in table 2 fig 3 a presents the same data in fig 1b where a statistically significant change point represented by the solid black circle on the time axis was found in the mean annual storm intensity in 1996 commensurate with the change in instrumentation from pluviograph to tipping bucket using a minimum depth above 0 2 mm a statistically significant change point is again found near 1996 fig 3b but the data pre 1996 appears more homogenous with a removal of small rainfall amounts fig 3b the mean event intensity is now much greater compared with the original data fig 3a with removal of events of rainfall less than or equal to 1 mm the change the change point near 1996 remains fig 3c albeit the entire data series now appears more homogenous removal of small rainfall amounts can help remove data inhomogeneities due to instrument change and in part remove the drift in the recording instrument pre 1996 data adjustment emulating a tipping bucket is presented in fig 3d the mean storm intensity is more homogenous fig 3d compared to the original data fig 3a and no statistically significant change point is found table 2 this is the ideal case because the lack of a significant change point around the time at which an instrument change occurred means that there is no need to make further adjustments to data set unfortunately as later results will show statistically significant change points are still often present despite the depth resolution being constant across the whole data set a second step of adjustment removing all rainfall 0 2 mm and below results in a mean storm intensity time series with no statistically significant change point fig 3e and lesser significance in the identified change point table 2 it does not appear that there is further improvement in homogeneity when a minimum event depth of 1 0 mm is adopted fig 3f but an advantage here is that compared to removing all rainfall 0 2 mm and below the mean event intensities resemble that of the original data for the interested reader a similar example is presented for station 057095 in figure s1 the analysis presented in fig 3 for melbourne regional office is extended to the 71 stations across australia for the years 1970 to 2014 inclusive with the change point year for each station for mean event intensity presented in fig 4 as anticipated by the results for the melbourne regional office fig 3a many of the stations across australia exhibit a statistically significant change point between 1996 and 2000 fig 4a there is some suggestion that more change points occur in the south commensurate with the greater amount of small rainfall depths recorded section 4 1 a histogram of the statistically significant change points at the 5 level is presented in fig 5 a there is a strong peak at the end of the 1990s corresponding to the instrument change in approximately 1996 we can safely conclude that this data set is not homogenous using a minimum rainfall depth of 0 2 mm fig 4b or event depth of 1 0 mm fig 4c does not appear to substantially reduce the number of change points observed around the year 1996 fig 5b 5c we can again conclude this data set is not temporally homogenous applying the aggregation to tipping bucket resolution reduces the number of statistically significant change points fig 4d but there remain a small number of statistically significant change points around the year 1996 suggesting that the impact of instrumentation change has not been fully removed fig 5d removing rainfall equal to and below 0 2 mm results in fewer change points detected around 1996 fig 4e with remaining change points likely associated with the incorrect classification of missing values pre 1996 fig 5e removal of events less than 1 mm results in the fewest change points fig 4f and the most uniform distribution of change points through time fig 5f it is prudent to also investigate the homogeneity of the event length as removal of rainfall below a certain depth reduces event length and increases the mean annual event intensity fig 3b e fig 6 presents histograms of statistically significant change points for the annual mean event length the event length appears to be more sensitive to the instrumentation change than the event intensity fig 5 as aggregation of the original data fig 6a to the tipping bucket resolution fig 6d does not result in a pronounced reduction in the large of number of stations that exhibit a statistically significant change point in event length at the time of instrumentation change aggregation of data to the tipping bucket resolution is hence not sufficient to achieve data homogeneity the inhomogeneity in the event length can explain some of the inhomogeneity in the storm event intensity as longer events could be expected in the pluviograph data as compared to the tipping bucket data thus reducing the mean event intensity only when the rainfall data is aggregated to the tipping bucket resolution and any rainfall data equal to or below 0 2 mm fig 6e or any events less than or equal to 1 0 mm fig 6f are removed do we see the most evidence for homogeneity in annual average storm event length very few stations exhibit statistically significant change points and their distribution is uniform over time simply removing data below or equal to the minimum event depth of 0 2 mm also reduces the number of statistically significant change points fig 6b as does removing events less than or equal to 1 mm fig 6c but not to the extent when these adjustments are made after aggregating to the tipping bucket resolution 3 2 annual statistics in section 1 2 we posed that annual statistics such as the mean annual rainfall are less likely to be affected by instrumentation change than event based statistics here we check if the instrumentation change in 1996 has had a significant impact on annual statistics in doing so we can make comment on whether typical inhomogeneity tests such as those based around double mass curves and annual statistics are as likely to identify instrumentation change as event based statistics fig 7 presents the percentage of stations by 4 year time block with statistically significant change points for unaggregated data aggregated data and aggregated data with minimum depth 0 2 mm and minimum event accumulations 1 0 mm removed only 5 6 of stations which is approximately the number that could be expected by chance exhibit statistically significant change points in the mean or total rainfall for the unaccumulated and accumulated data with no distinct spatial pattern not shown seen in any of the data sets this confirms that inhomogeneities in the data set as presented in section 3 1 using event based statistics would not have been identified if annual mass curves were used for inhomogeneity testing this result also points to the success of the change point test in not identifying spurious change points due to a trend statistically significant trends in mean rainfall have occurred across australia due to climate change dey et al 2019 wasko et al 2021 but the number of change points identified is small suggesting that any change point identified is in fact due to a change in instrumentation we can adopt the percentage of stations showing statistically significant change points for the mean annual rainfall as a baseline for which to compare the other annual statistics there is some evidence of non stationarity at or around 1996 in the variance fig 7 aggregating the rainfall to the tipping bucket resolution reduces the number of stations with statistically significant change points for variance particularly around the time of instrument change it is expected that a change in the instrument resolution would result in a change in the proportion of zero rainfalls recorded pzero and hence almost all stations display statistically significant change points in pzero fig 7 aggregation to the tipping bucket resolution and removing small rainfall amounts results in the number of stations with statistically significant change points in pzero being similar to the number of statistically significant change points in mean rainfall suggesting that these adjustments aid the creation of a homogenous data set percentiles will exhibit a discontinuity at 1996 simply due to the instrumentation change resulting in a different resolution osburn et al 2021 for this reason statistics are not presented for removing small rainfall amounts from the unaggregated raw data as this will only induce greater inhomogeneity in such statistics as the mean rainfall and rainfall percentiles this is confirmed through inspection of the 99th percentile p99 where almost all stations have a statistically significant change point close to the time of instrument change when data is not aggregated fig 7 however even after aggregation to tipping bucket resolution is undertaken more than a quarter of stations continue to exhibit a statistically significant change point the number of stations exhibiting a statistically significant change point after aggregation for p99 is similar to those of the maximum rainfall pmax there does not appear to be a peak in the number of stations with a statistically significant change point for pmax at or around 1996 the large number of change points for pmax as compared to the number of stations with change points for the mean is curious one might expect trends in extreme values to be more difficult to identify than in the annual mean rainfall figure s2 presents time series for the 6 stations with the lowest p values for their change point it appears there is no statistically significant shift in the data due to an instrumentation change around 1996 but rather there is a consistent trend in the extreme rainfall which is identified by the pettitt test we can conclude for annual statistics that aggregation of data is a key requirement to ensure homogeneity with removal of small rainfall depths or accumulations providing minimal improvement in the homogeneity of the record 4 discussion 4 1 implications of minimum event depth choice we presented the choice of two different minimum depth removals the tipping bucket resolution 0 2 mm applied to each rainfall observation and removal of any aggregation equal to or below 1 0 mm there was some marginal improvement in the homogeneity of our data sets for event based statistics section 3 1 when no aggregation was performed by using a minimum event depth of 0 2 mm but it is unclear whether removal of this data is justified when small low intensity rainfall amounts are important to many ecological and environmental processes fig 8 presents the percentage of the total rainfall removed for the two different options of rainfall removal in the tropical north of australia less than 20 of the total rainfall volume is removed by adopting a minimum event depth of 0 2 mm but this increases to 20 40 in the southern temperate regions and over 40 in the far southern cool regions fig 8a a histogram of the percentage removed fig 8b shows the median value is approximately 20 to state it another way on average one fifth of rainfall in australia has an intensity smaller than the instrument resolution of 2 mm hr when recorded at a 6 minute temporal resolution it is common practice to remove trace amounts of rainfall in hydrologic analyses but a large amount of information is contained in these trace rainfall depths if we instead apply a minimum event depth of 1 0 mm the percentage of annual rainfall removed is consistently below 20 fig 8c with a median value of 6 fig 8d as presented in section 3 1 adopting a minimum depth whether it be a rainfall depth over an increment or an event accumulation is critical to ensuring event based statistics are homogenous in the context of instrument change or drift removal of some rainfall to ensure homogeneity is unavoidable but it needs to be ensured that the information lost is either minimal or does not affect the statistics or processes of interest 4 2 sensitivity to minimum event inter event time and temporal resolution the majority of events sampled are of very short duration with station mean event lengths in order of 1 2 h figure s3 when a minimum rainfall depth of 0 2 mm is adopted the mean event duration reduces to less than one hour due to the shortening of the event length alternatively removing events with accumulations less than 1 mm results in a mean event length in the order of 2 4 h as short duration events are removed accordingly some altering of the sample statistics is inevitable if homogeneity in the annual event statistics is to be preserved as we are interested in studying short duration events these mean event lengths appear reasonable but our results could be affected by very short or long events that skew our sample to investigate this issue the change point analysis presented in fig 6 is repeated for the mean event length see fig 9 where events are partitioned into durations 6 min equivalent to removing single bucket tips 1 h less than 12 h and between 1 and 12 h here we do not remove any data below a minimum rainfall or event depth so fig 9 is most easily compared with fig 6b aggregating the data to emulate the tipping bucket and removing very short events fig 9a b results in only a few stations with statistically significant change points at or around 1996 once all events shorter than 1 h are excluded fig 9b the inhomogeneity in the event length is arguably removed and this provides an alternate sampling strategy to ensure homogeneity however it must be noted that this minimum event length is now ten times the temporal resolution of the original data and may defeat the purpose of using of sub daily data depending on the statistic of interest removing events that are greater than or equal to 12 h of duration fig 9c provides little benefit with restricting event duration to between 1 and 12 h fig 9d yielding the most robust data set it is also prudent to assess the sensitivity to the minimum interevent time section 1 1 we note that increasing the minimum interevent time mit is somewhat analogous to thresholding on a longer event as picking a longer mit will ultimately result in sampling longer events fig 9 sensitivity tests using a reduced mit of 30 min and 18 min produced results very similar to those presented in fig 5 and fig 6 and hence are not discussed in detail finally temporal resolutions different from the native data reporting resolution are often of interest when the 6 minute rainfall data was temporally aggregated to hourly it was found that change points for the mean rainfall intensity remained but not for the event length fig 10 hence removal of data from sub daily records to ensure homogeneity of event based statistics is likely to be required regardless of the temporal resolution of the rainfall 4 3 comparison to previous studies and limitations of current study using five years of overlapping record at six stations srikanthan et al 2000 concluded that the short duration rainfall data obtained from the dines pluviograph and tipping bucket rain gauge can be combined for extreme value analysis procedures such as developing intensity frequency duration curves for engineering design however it was suggested that for daily and monthly climate analyses data from the tipping bucket rain gauge and dines pluviograph should not be combined due to statistically significant differences in the total rainfall recorded although our analysis does not include overlapping data it does use much longer time series our analysis did not find evidence of change points due to instrumentation change that would preclude the use of the combined data sets for climatic studies such as investigating the mean annual rainfall though other statistics such as the variance or proportion of zero rainfall do require transformation of dines pluviograph data to emulate a tipping bucket rain gauge there is no suggestion that previous studies have been affected by the inhomogeneities in time series analysis of event based statistics that are presented here for example our results are commensurate with westra and sisson 2011 who demonstrated that the instrumentation change does not affect extreme value analysis however for the analysis of event based statistics our results suggest that aggregation of the data to the coarsest resolution tip as recommended in groisman et al 2012 is not sufficient to remove inhomogeneities due to an instrumentation change low range rainfall intensities heavily impact on the performance of tipping bucket rain gauges accuracy is low for high resolution rates and the precision of measurements has a strong variability even if the average error is low colli et al 2014 in other words the percentage error and variability is greatest for the shortest and lowest rainfall rates and the most uncertain measurements are removed when small rainfall accumulations or rainfall depths are removed future users of the data analysed here may wish to note the results presented are very sensitive to the removal of data flagged by the bom as quality code 4 that has been estimated through linear interpolation inspection of the data shows that there many instances of tips being interpolated and many of these are undocumented an interpolated value appears as an aggregation value spread evenly over the time of aggregation for example a daily value spread evenly over 24 h if these suspect values are not removed then inhomogeneities in the event based statistics are much more common as this data error is more common in the tipping bucket than the pluviograph measurement hence removal of the temporally estimated values aids interpretation of why change points are identified prior to 1996 5 conclusions inhomogeneities in rainfall measurement have traditionally been identified using annual rainfall statistics masking possible inhomogeneities in sub daily data if these inhomogeneities are not addressed there is a potential to misidentify trends in event based statistics and incorrectly parametrise stochastic rainfall generators here using a large sample of sub daily rainfall stations with a known instrument change near the year 1996 we test simple strategies for improving data homogeneity 1 an aggregation to match the resolution of the two instruments 2 removal of rainfall depth equal to or below a minimum depth which may be considered zero rainfall 3 removal of rainfall below a minimum accumulation event depth and 4 a combination of an aggregation to match the resolution and subsequent removal of rainfall equal to or below a minimum depth to ensure homogeneity of event based statistics we found that it is not sufficient to just aggregate to the coarsest instrument resolution but rather after aggregation small rainfall amounts need to be removed traditionally this has been performed by removing a minimum rainfall depth but this leads to the distortion of rainfall statistics and the removal of a large fraction of the total annual rainfall it is hence suggested that removing a minimum rainfall accumulation event depth is preferable as it results in a minimal loss of information an alternative may be to remove short rainfall events particularly events with depths less than a single tip but this will be largely subjective depending on the rainfall event durations of interest and the mit in the absence of aggregation to the coarsest instrument resolution removal of a minimum rainfall depth was also found to aid homogeneity of event based statistics for annual rainfall statistics removal of small rainfall amounts did not further aid removing inhomogeneities and aggregation to the coarsest instrument resolution was sufficient we recommend for future analyses data should be aggregated to the coarsest instrument resolution and then if event based statistics are to be calculated small rainfall event totals should be removed in the absence of a known instrumentation change removal of a minimum rainfall depth can help ensure the homogeneity of sub daily rainfalls as low intensity rainfalls equate to substantial proportions of the total annual rainfall volume and play a critical role in water resources and ecological assessments a careful assessment is required on the impact of the removal of these rainfalls on the subsequent analysis credit authorship contribution statement
