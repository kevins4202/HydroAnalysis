represent a growing area of interest for roboticists milana et al 2020 xing et al 2019 paschal et al 2019 in comparison to conventional amphibious robots with propellers and wheels or tracks they can be navigated on land and underwater the design of bionic amphibious robots was inspired by the ingenious mechanism and skilful movements of animals in addition they have several advantages such as efficient obstacle negotiation a strong manoeuvrability and a rapid land water transition zhong et al 2018 graf et al 2019 tanaka et al 2004 sequeira et al 2016 because of these abilities they have wide application prospects in the fields of security industry defence and transportation baines et al 2019 dudek et al 2007 greiner et al 1996 in nature there are a variety of amphibians such as crabs lobsters turtles snakes and frogs all of these amphibians can functionally move underwater and in terrestrial environments hence these amphibians are the inspiration for the bionic design researchers have studied the driving mechanism of organisms in different environments and then imitated their shape and motion structure to design biomimetic robots dudek et al 2007 greiner et al 1996 dowling 1997 han et al 2012 tang et al 2017 the world s first bionic amphibious robot was an autonomous crab like robot called ursula that was designed for mine hunting in the surf zone in 1996 greiner et al 1996 a large number of bionic amphibious robots that are based on lobsters turtles snakes and other creatures emerged one after another dudek et al 2007 ayers et al 2000a kemp et al 2005 liljeback et al 2014 recently some soft actuators such as a pneumatic artificial muscle pam fluidic elastomer actuators fea shape memory alloys sma and electroactive polymers eap are capable of motions that are needed for amphibious locomotion which have been exploited in bionic amphibious robots chu et al 2012 jin et al 2016 chang et al 2018 shintake et al 2018 marchese et al 2015 for instance paschal presented an urchin inspired robot with five fea tube feet and ten spines that could move on ferrous surfaces and underwater with an external fluid supply paschal et al 2019 by developing an intelligent control system advanced control methods such as reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks have been widely used in the robotics industry fan et al 2020 yu et al 2018a wu et al 2018 bin designed an amphibious robot called amphihex ii that has a central pattern generator neural network that achieves a smooth and quick gait transition zhong et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 the

organisms is the basis of bionic amphibious robots underwater driving modes can be divided into two categories non bionic underwater driving and bionic underwater driving there are two key methods for non bionic underwater driving propeller and water jet driving after a long period of natural evolution aquatic organisms have developed a variety of underwater motion patterns in which the vast majority are fish buren et al 2018 salazar et al 2019 according to the different driving sites fish propulsion is divided into body and or caudal fin propulsion bcf and media and or paired fin propulsion mpf lindsey 1978 as shown in fig 2 as illustrated in fig 2 the shaded areas contribute to the thrust generation the characteristics of the various underwater driving modes are listed in table 1 research on the driving mechanism of fish with the bcf and mpf propulsion mode has been carried out by applying three strategies theoretical models numerical simulations biological observations and prototype experiments yu et al 2018a scaradozzi et al 2017 kang et al 2020 the theoretical models are mathematical expressions of the propulsive force fish body structure and motion parameters and these models are established by simplifying the parameters under the ideal motion parameters due to the complexity of the hydrodynamics and the kinematics of swimming organisms the theoretical models usually have a certain range of applications lighthill 1971 taylor 1952 jiao et al 2018 in order to perform numerical simulations the fluid continuous flow differential equations need to be solved which are calculated by applying computational fluid dynamics cfd in comparison to the theoretical models the numerical simulation can reveal more detailed information about the flow field and the interactions between underwater organisms and the fluid scaradozzi et al 2017 lamas et al 2011a the kinematic parameters and motion characteristics of fish can be measured and extracted by directly observing the various movement behaviours of fish and imitating their biological movements with bionic robots recently digital particle image velocimetry dpiv has been gradually applied to quantify the wake hydrodynamics behind swimming fish or bionic robotic fish in order to reveal the motion mechanics of fish yu et al 2018a drucker and lauder 2002 wen et al 2018 approximately 85 of fish adopt bcf propulsion as their primary propulsion mode sfakiotakis et al 1999 this is achieved by undulating or oscillating their body or their caudal fin pushing back against the water around them and generating thrust with the help of the counterforces in 1952 taylor established the resistive force theory to analyse the fish swimming model taylor 1951 1952 however it is only applicable to analysing aquatic organisms with small reynolds numbers because of the neglect of the inertia forces wu proposed the two dimensional 2d flexible plate theory which uses the linearised inviscid flow theory to solve the general problem of 2d flexible plates under an arbitrary unsteady velocity wu 1961 1971 on this basis tong established the three dimensional 3d waving plate theory which was achieved by modelling fish as a deformable thin plate tong et al 1993 cheng et al 1991 lighthill s theory which includes the elongated body theory and the large amplitude elongated body theory are pertinent for modelling slender fish with bcf propulsion and they are widely used in the hydrodynamic modelling of robotic fish lighthill 1960 1970 1971 with the development of computer technology schultz obtained the distribution of pressure and velocity in the swimming process by performing 2d numerical calculations sw et al 1991 subsequently some researchers performed a cfd simulation to calculate the 2d and 3d wake structures of fish such as tadpoles lamprey and tuna and they carried out in depth research on the body shape and swimming parameters liu et al 1996 carling et al 1998 zhu et al 2002 kern and koumoutsakos 2006 tytell et al 2010 in 1995 stamhuis made use of the dpiv for the first time to measure the velocity of small aquatic organisms such as copepods fish larvae and juvenile fish drucker and lauder 2002 stamhuis and videler 1995 by measuring the wake flow field with the 3d dpiv it was observed that fish such as rainbow trout and sunfish can utilise the energy in the vortex by swinging their tail fins the other 15 of fish take their dorsal fins anal fins pelvic fins or pectoral fins as the main propulsion parts sfakiotakis et al 1999 this is known as median and or paired fin mpf locomotion which has great manoeuvrability kato 2005 blake analysed the thrust force of mandarin fish and considered the pectoral fins as the actuator discs however the accuracy of the propulsion calculation is defective due to the neglect of energy in the wake vortex blake 1979 by combining the blade element theory and unsteady airfoil theory daniel qualitatively analysed the relationship between the propulsion performance and the parameters of the pectoral fins such as the aspect ratio wavelength fin flexibility and frequency daniel 1988 lighthill applied the elongated body theory to balistiform and gymnotiform locomotion lighthill and blake 1990 xie established the ideal undulating fin model and determined the analytical expressions of the forces and torques in different directions xie and yin 2013 researchers used 2d and 3d cfd to analyse the relationship between the propulsion force of the undulating fin and the wave frequency amplitude and wavelength rahman et al 2011 lamas et al 2011b lamasgaldo et al 2014 hu et al 2006 sharp employed a simulation on the undulatory pectoral fin with cfd and multiparticle collision dynamics and established an analytical model of the undulatory kinematics sharp et al 2014 zhao investigated the combined undulating motion pattern of the undulating fin that was inspired by the large mouthed catfish which can dramatically improve its thrust zhao and dou 2019 hu observed the body shape characteristics of the amiiform fish under different motion states through dpiv and analysed the relationship between the morphological parameters undulatory parameters of the undulating fin and the undulation dynamics hu et al 2009 sefati observed two inward counter propagating waves that are produced by knifefish and determined that the thrust force of the undulating fin can be adjusted by controlling the meeting node sefati et al 2012 neveln used dpiv to observe the vortex on the anal fin and observed that the tilted fin ray affects the continuity of the vortex and reduces the propulsion efficiency neveln et al 2014 zhou discovered that the optimal propulsion efficiency of the undulatory fin is related to the device structure and control strategy zhou and low 2014 di sant observed the three dimensional kinematics of sting rays and identified that the motion amplitude of each pectoral fin position is significantly different di sant noted that the motion velocity can be adjusted by actively controlling the curvature of the pectoral fin disanto et al 2017 liu used the motion energy consumption wave efficiency and strouhal number as indicators in addition lin used the undulating fin propulsion device to analyse the relationship between the fin stiffness morphology and propulsion efficiency function liu et al 2017 liu and curet 2018 after a few decades of development the bcf and mpf underwater driving modes have accomplished a significant amount of theoretical research simulation analyses observations and experimental research however the theoretical models remain too simple and the simulation results prototype tests and biological observation results are far from each other dabiri 2005 2 2 driving mechanism of terrestrial animals there are two types of land driving modes bionic land driving and non bionic land driving non bionic land driving mainly includes the wheel driving mode and track driving mode which are widely used in industry due to its stronger environmental adaptability and obstacle surmounting ability bionic driving modes have attracted the attention of research institutions around the world over the past few decades according to their motion forms they can be divided into legged walking legged jumping and limbless locomotion grzelczyk and awrejcewicz 2019a zhang et al 2020 ding et al 2013 mahapatra et al 2020 the legged walking driving mode uses the static friction force between the ground and the foot as the driving force by several foot ends which contacts the ground because the contact point between the driving foot and the ground is discretely distributed the obstacle surmounting ability is higher than the crawler hence it can adapt to the requirements of complex terrain movement the number of driving feet can be divided into bipedal human four legged cats and multi legged spiders wang et al 2003 in 1977 cavagna proposed an inverted pendulum motion model that is based on the changes in kinetic energy and the potential energy in the movement of animals mochon and mcmahon 1980 cavagna et al 1977 dickinson et al 2000 the walking process can be divided into two steps first the kinetic energy of the body is converted into gravitational potential energy under the support of the legs and the centre of gravity advances and rises with the foot as the fulcrum later as the body s centre of gravity passes the support position some of the gravitational potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy as shown in fig 3 a cavagna et al 1977 the cognition of the kinetic model in the movement of creatures such as lobsters and spiders is relatively clear blickhan and barth 1985 domenici et al 1999 full and tu 1991 some multi legged robots that are represented by bigdog a legged robot produced by boston dynamics have been equipped with practical application capabilities studies on legged walking robots has been mainly focused on the parallel mechanism dynamic model zhang et al 1994 the foot ground force model the motion efficiency and stability control mahapatra et al 2020 grzelczyk and awrejcewicz 2019b creatures such as frogs kangaroos locusts and fleas are driven by legged jumping they jump over obstacles that are several times their body size and this is achieved by releasing energy that is stored in their muscles tendons and ligaments in a short time as shown in fig 3b in comparison to legged walking the obstacle surmounting the performance of legged jumping has greatly improved zhang et al 2020 paskins determined that kangaroos can achieve energy accumulation and altitude adjustment during landing in order to make continuous jumps paskins et al 2007 however small animals such as fleas and frogs need to rebuild their energy after landing and they can only achieve intermittent jumps bennet clark and lucey 1967 astley and roberts 2012 the literature on the mechanism of biological jumping is very thorough and most of the research focuses on the regulation of the body posture of organisms in the air for instance kangaroos use their tails for balance paskins et al 2007 and grasshoppers adjust their posture in the air by swinging its belly and forewings chen et al 2015 in terms of the jumping performance many jumping robots are far ahead of creatures mo et al 2019 limbless animals such as snakes can move themselves by wiggling their bodies against the ground or the objects around them as shown in fig 3c according to the swing method the serpentine gait can be divided into the following classes concertina lateral undulation sidewinding rectilinear slide pushing and other less common forms gray 1946 hirose proposed a serpenoid curve to describe snake locomotion and developed a snake robot hirose 1993 afterwards the serpentine curve and 3d serpentine curves were employed to generate a 3d gait ma 1999 gonzalez gomez and boemo 2006 ostrowski transformed the snake like robot control problem into a nonlinear system problem by using the differential geometry method ostrowski and burdick 1998 matsuno took the snake like robot as a multi degree of freedom redundant controllable system for position and shape control matsuno and sato 2005 presently the mechanism of limbless locomotion is almost clear but there are still some deficiencies in the mathematical description of the 3d space motion model motion structure and the motion control of limbless robots in comparison to aquatic animals the research on terrestrial animals is more sophisticated and advanced in terms of the driving mechanism mechanical structure and control mode some robots already have practical application abilities however there are still some problems such as over simplified models a low motion efficiency and an insufficient control ability 3 classification over the last three decades several bionic amphibious robots have been presented according to the different bionic prototypes bionic amphibious robots can be generally divided into two categories simple bionic amphibious robots and compound bionic amphibious robots simple bionic amphibious robots refer to robots that imitate real amphibians in nature compound bionic amphibious robots integrate non bionic locomotion or a variety of biological locomotion modes that are based on the usage requirements fig 4 displays the classification of bionic amphibious robots and the categories of locomotion on land and underwater 3 1 simple bionic amphibious robots simple bionic amphibious robots use natural organisms as prototypes based on their imitations of creatures they can be classified into three subclasses legged amphibious robots snake like amphibious robots and salamander like amphibious robots the typical simple bionic amphibious robots are presented in table 2 which has terrestrial and underwater driving modes and it provides a key analysis on their highlights and deficiencies as well as the pictures for reference because of its excellent motion performance and obstacle surmounting ability the legged walking driving mode is widely used in bionic amphibious robots as the world s first bionic amphibious robot the ursula aluv which was inspired by insects was designed to hunt and eliminate minds the ursula aluv has six 2 dof rigid walking legs that are actuated by motors greiner et al 1996 then a lobster robot driven by sma shape memory alloys with eight 3 dof walking legs was developed by using a neuronal circuit based controller and neuromorphic sensors as well as a behavioural library from real lobsters ayers et al 2000a 2000b hyungwon developed a crab like robot named cr200 which has sufficient performance for seabed walking with two 6 dof front legs and four 4 dof legs shim et al 2016 yoo et al 2015 faudzi et al created a soft amphibious robot with four walking legs that are driven by pam which was able to walk on a flat surface sand and underwater when considering the advantages of crab legs nicole performed a series of experiments with different feet with a waterproofing robot and discovered that the wave induced displacement can be reduced with modified feet graf et al 2019 thibaut and his consultants created a robot that was inspired by sea urchins which had ten spines and five tubes the robot was driven by fea and it moved on ferrous surfaces with magnets in the tube ends without fins or paddles the robots that were introduced above can only move on land and on the seabed and they swim poorly underwater thus legged amphibious robots with fins or paddles were developed that can move on land and underwater in addition they have a neutral buoyancy or buoyancy control devices which is similar to the fish underwater in order to reveal the impact of flipper collaborative propulsion on biological mobility john developed a turtle like robot named madeleine and identified that the synergistic action of flippers can effectively improve the propulsion efficiency through eight gait propulsion experiments long et al 2006 han and his colleagues created a turtle like robot called miniturtle i which has high environmental adaptability with four 4 dof leg flippers by adjusting the positions and motion range of four independently controlled rotating joints the variable topology leg flippers can be used as walking feet or swimming flippers which enables it to move on land and underwater han et al 2012 a crayfish inspired microrobot with eight walking legs and a pair of hands was presented as a son robot in the father son robot system in this design the microrobot son robot was driven by ten ipmc ionic polymer metallic composite actuators and it communicated with the father robot by using a blue led based underwater optical communication system li et al 2015 2016 wang presented a shoal crablike robot that adopted a bounding gait with six 3 dof legs and two 3 dof paddles wang et al 2017 the average speed increased by 54 in comparison to the walking gait and this was achieved by performing gait process planning kinematics modelling and trajectory planning wang et al 2017 a starfish robot driven by sma actuators was created with flexible tentacles that could perform walking and swimming motions jin et al 2016 mao et al 2014 a snake like robot called the acm r5 was created with nine waterproofing modules it could move on land and swim underwater by using a limbless locomotion mode and the bcf propulsion mode by planning every joint rotation yamada 2005 similarly yu et al developed a snake like robot to explore a new 3d gait generation method and they verified its locomotion ability by performing gait experiments yu 2012 the snake like robot mamba adopted modular and reconfigurable design ideas which includes the head module tail module joint module with passive wheels and the propulsion module with motorised wheels in addition in order to study the driving mechanism of the snake like robot the researchers developed force sensors that are based on strain gauges and they installed them inside the unit modules to measure the interaction forces between each module and the ground liljeback et al 2014 milana et al created a bioinspired multimodal amphibious robot called eelworm that had a flexible body consisting of five inflatable bending and elongating actuator modules milana et al 2020 by planning the drive sequence it performed limbless locomotion and bcf locomotion at a speed of two and three body lengths per minute respectively salamanders have four walking legs and a flexible narrow body which allows them to walk on land and swim underwater like a bcf propulsion fish a bionic amphibious robot salamander was created with 1 dof walking legs and nine modular units that are connected by 1 dof joints and the robot gaits were generated by a central pattern generator cpg the researchers studied the mathematical models of the gait transition under different amphibious environments and the relevant conclusions were verified by conducting biological experimental observations these investigations revealed the internal relationship between the cpg motion model and biological evolution ijspeert et al 2007 crespi et al 2013 based on this robot karakasiliotis et al designed another salamander inspired robot named pleurobot the pleurobot had four 4 dof walking legs and twelve segments that were connected by eleven 1 dof joints karakasiliotis et al 2016 in a study conducted by yin et al a salamander inspired robot named chigon that consisted of five modules in series was created the front two modules served as the trunk of the robot and they were equipped with driving feet while the rear three modules reduced the friction resistance with the driven wheels the cpg was used to optimise its gait effectively reduce the impact intensity between the moving foot and the ground and achieve high speed land movement of the robot yin et al 2012 presently most simple bionic amphibious robots have been able to move in an unstructured environment however due to the limitations of the driving structure there are still some problems for the movement of different environmental media these problems include insufficient mobility weak environmental adaptability a slow period when switching between water and land motion modes a weak environmental perception ability and an insufficient autonomous control ability 3 2 compound bionic amphibious robots compound bionic amphibious robots are not limited to imitating a certain organism but they combine various driving methods to meet the practical application requirements according to the main features of bionic amphibious robots they can be divided into compound legged amphibious robots and amphibious robotic fishes table 3 presents their terrestrial and underwater driving modes and a key analysis of their highlights and deficiencies as well as pictures for reference owing to the excellent motion performance and obstacle surmounting ability of performing legged locomotion compound legged amphibious robots have adapted the underwater driven structure into a compound leg structure alexander et al designed the whegs iv robot which is a cockroach inspired amphibious robot with six independently controlled 2 dof propeller legs and a 1 dof rotating trunk boxerbaum et al 2005 harkins et al 2005 by adjusting the phase difference and propulsion angle of the propeller legs it was adaptable to a variety of complex terrestrial and aquatic environments on the basis of six legged crawling robots an amphibious robot aqua with six 1 dof driving structures was created by using umbilical cord cables for the data transmission the visual observation of the offshore coral reefs and 3d scene modelling could be completed however the legs had to be manually switched to paddles dudek et al 2007 by focusing on the shortcomings of aqua bir et al created ninja legs which has six 1 dof offset wheel walking legs and the experiments were conducted in a variety of environments dey et al 2013 the experimental results demonstrated that even though the offset wheel walking legs have a higher single cycle power consumption than the semi circular walking legs they could be applied to wetlands beaches be used underwater and applied in other environments hence it has a strong environmental adaptability as mentioned above a turtle inspired robot was created as a father robot in the father son robot system xing et al 2019 it had four 2 dof water jet propulsion units that were controlled by servo motors which could achieve vector propulsion underwater and it could use its feet to walk on land zhong and his colleagues developed the hexapod amphibious robot amphihex ii which contained six 1 dof variable stiffness compound legs and cpgs generating gaits zhong et al 2018 through a series of field experiments the cpgs could effectively shorten the gait transition time and the variable stiffness compound legs have an excellent environmental adaptability with more emphasis on the underwater manoeuvrability amphibious robotic fish mainly imitate the structure of fish the multi mode amphibious fish amphirobot could perform carangiform or dolphin like swimming by rotating its tail fin with pectoral fins this provided assistance for underwater steering as well as motion on land with its paddle wheel compound pectoral fins that were continuously rotating yang et al 2007 li et al designed an amphibious transformable robot called amoeba ii that had two drive modules two pitch modules and one linking module in this design li et al proposed a multi objective genetic algorithm to obtain a pareto solution afterwards li et al verified the manoeuvrability and obstacle striding ability of the robot through a large number of experiments in an amphibious environment li et al 2012 yang created a frog inspired amphibious robot called frobot that had a dual swing leg propulsion mechanism by swinging its legs to generate propulsion the frobot could move on land and swim underwater with the anti bias wheels and flexible fins on its legs yang et al 2015 a bionic amphibious robot named velox was created with a pair of flexible fins the fins were undulated periodically under the control of the actuators and they generated a thrust force to allow the robot to swim underwater and crawl on land pliant energy systems s the design of the compound bionic amphibious robots is oriented by its practical application and it is not limited to the structure of certain organisms in nature which greatly increases the environmental adaptability and engineering application prospects of bionic amphibious robots 4 actuators actuators play an important role in bionic amphibious robot systems in this section the various actuators for the existing bionic amphibious robots and their driving mechanisms are introduced based on the structure of the actuators that are used in bionic amphibious robots they can be divided into rigid actuators that are represented by motor and soft actuators which includes the pma and fea table 4 lists the actuators for the existing bionic amphibious robots as well as the masses dimensions and peak velocities of the robots 4 1 rigid actuators owing to the strong output and control precision more than 80 of bionic amphibious robots use motors as their actuators as shown in table 4 the motor can complete the motion function of the robot end effector by connecting to a single or multiple joints a single joint means that the driving structure has only one degree of rotational freedom which is the simplest design and it is easy to control compound legged amphibious robots such as ninja legs and amphihex ii use a single joint to drive the paddle rotate reduce the movement complexity and simplify the robot structure because rigid structures are inefficient underwater these robots have many elaborate designs for the composite legs fig 5 presents the structure of the variable stiffness legs in amphihex ii and the rotary motion for land and underwater zhong et al 2018 the designers placed the flexible flippers into the rigid fan shaped frames and adjusted the flipper stiffness by manually adjusting the slider position to adapt to the diverse environments in comparison to the single joint structure the multiple joint structure has more dof this allows the bionic amphibious robot to be more similar to the biological structure for creatures in nature as shown in fig 6 the snake like amphibious robot acm r5 consists of nine waterproof modules that are connected in series through universal joints yamada 2005 each module is equipped with a cpu batteries and universal joint driving motors and the entire body is covered with driven wheels to ensure that the friction conditions can be satisfied it can achieve a variety of 3d gaits in aquatic and terrestrial environments by planning every joint movement recently great achievements have been made in terms of the biomimetic structures design motion performance and the outdoor working abilities of the bionic amphibious robots for greater reliability these robots designed for engineering applications are driven by a motor and they have been constantly improved however due to the limitations of the motor s properties it is difficult to apply this to micro robots due to its disadvantages such as its large size and high power consumption 4 2 soft actuators along with the development of bionics and material science fea pam sma and eaps have been gradually applied to bionic amphibious robots feas are mainly composed of fluid grid channels that consist of elastic rubber gas hydraulic valves reversing valves and fluid pipelines katzschmann et al 2018 fig 7 shows the schematic diagram of the urchinbot tube foot structure that is driven by fea and its actuation principle paschal et al 2019 marchese et al 2015 when the fluid enters the upper fluid grid channels of the tube foot the fluid grid channels expand in all directions and strain the elastomer under the action of the fluid pressure which results in downward bending of the tube foot through a tube foot that is driven by the fea the urchinbot achieved linear motion at a maximum speed of 0 027 bl s underwater which is approximately 10 of what is observed with live juvenile sea urchins the fea s advantages include a large driving force and a sensitive response however it has poor controllability and positioning accuracy moreover the entire fea system is quite complex which usually includes hydraulic pumps pipeline delivery systems and fluid regulation mechanisms another common soft actuator that is used in bionic amphibious robots is pam which is also known as the mckibben actuator the pam primarily consists of an inflatable elastic tube that is surrounded by a braided fibre to restrict the actuator expansion in a certain direction and the elastic tube expands with the pneumatic pressure as shown in fig 8 the soft amphibious robot with four walking legs is driven by four groups of pam actuators in each group the three pam actuators are arranged in parallel and their upper and bottom parts are fixed faudzi et al 2017 the bending motion of the legs can be produced by pressurizing one of the three actuators in each group with the assistance of a plastic plate in the body the robot successfully walked like a salamander with a speed of 0 056 m s on land and 0 022 m s underwater similar to the fea pam has the advantages of smooth motion high stability having a light weight and a large output force however it also has some shortcomings such as a low control accuracy slow response speed and a complex system in addition to the above two flexible actuators sma has also been applied to bionic amphibious robots the fundamental principle of the sma actuator is to release stress during the martensitic reverse transformation of the material due to its thermo mechanical characteristics as demonstrated in fig 9 the starfish robot is driven by five groups of sma wires and the phase transition process can be described in three basic stages the twinned martensite phase transforms into the deformed martensite phase under an external stress with residual stress in the material which is called the forward transformation the deformation martensite is converted into austenite and the material returns to its original shape by heating as a result the material stress is released and this is called the reverse transformation after cooling the austenite phase again turns into the twinned martensite phase the entire process is manifested as the deformation and reverse deformation of the sma material with the temperature change chu et al 2012 mao et al 2014 lee and lee 2000 a series of experiments were conducted in semi submerged and underwater environments under an adaptive regulation heating strategy these experiments revealed that the speed of the starfish robot was at least an order of magnitude higher than the other robots when using the sma actuators jin et al 2016 the sma has the advantages of a high output stress and a low driving voltage however it has a poor driving frequency and energy consumption when used underwater the driving frequency of the sma can be greatly improved in comparison to air due to the rapid heat transfer between the water and sma materials as a new intelligent material the eap materials have the characteristics of a large driving force and a large deformation in response to an applied electrical field and it is widely used in a variety of fields such as biomimetic robots and aerospace energy carpi et al 2014 follador et al 2014 according to the electroactuation principle of eap intelligent driving materials it can be divided into two major areas ionic eap and electronic eap the representative material of the ionic eap is ipmc chang et al 2018 fig 10 presents a crayfish inspired microrobot that has two hands and eight legs that are actuated by ten ipmc actuators and the electroactuation principle of the ipmc when the two flexible electrodes are energised the hydrated cations are evenly distributed inside the material and they move and accumulate towards the negative pole in response to an applied electrical field this is manifested as the material bends towards the positive pole and it generates deformation at the macro level the researchers proposed a father son robot system that is composed of a crayfish inspired microrobot and a turtle inspired robot which greatly enhances the practical applications of amphibious robots through the collaborative work experiments on autonomous targets that involve grasping and optical navigation have been completed with copper wires that are connected to the father robot which receives control signals and a power supply xing et al 2019 li et al 2016 the ipmc has the advantages of a fast response speed a large driving displacement and a low driving voltage however it can only be used in a humid environment with a small driving force bhandari et al 2012 de is a representative material of the electronic eap pelrine et al 2002 fig 11 shows the frog inspired robot with two legs that are driven by four de actuators and the electroactuation principle of the de when the two flexible electrodes are energised the de material in the natural state expands and extends horizontally under the action of an electric field force which drives the frog inspired robot to swim underwater tang et al 2017 shintake et al 2018 it was determined that the projected area of the jumping legs increased by more than 60 with a high voltage hence it can generate a thrust that is larger than the drag and achieve underwater self propulsion tang et al 2017 since the driving voltage is extremely high kv and the electrode and de material require synchronous deformation it is extremely difficult to make the external insulation material of the electrode which is currently being studied pelrine et al 2002 li et al 2018 however because of its advantages that include a large deformation a fast response speed and high energy efficiency de materials have broad application prospects for bionic amphibious robots by having great continuity a large deformation and a rapid response soft actuators can significantly change the driving structure of bionic amphibious robots and provide new solutions for bionic designs table 5 shows the characteristics of the electroactuation material bionic amphibious robots designed for scientific research mostly adopt soft actuators to imitate the muscle tissue structure of organisms and reproduce the motion process of organisms because of the immaturity of the soft actuators the functions of the bionic amphibious robots are currently relatively simple this can verify the driving function of the amphibious environment in a laboratory setting however further research is required before it is widely used in practical applications 5 energy the different energy supply modes of the bionic amphibious robots mainly include onboard batteries external power supplies and external fluid supplies as presented in table 6 more than 75 of bionic amphibious robots are powered by onboard batteries which includes lithium li batteries and nickel metal hydride ni mh batteries as shown in table 6 ni mh batteries are cheap pollution free and they have a short service life meanwhile li batteries are more energy dense and lighter but they are more expensive mahmud et al 2019 in general the energy carried by the onboard battery is difficult to support the autonomous movement of a robot for a long time in the field environment in the field environment some bionic amphibious robots may be tested by using a cable power supply to ensure the stability of the energy supply for example in a shoal crablike robot ninja legs and the amphihex ii were designed to carry onboard batteries and they have the ability to work outdoors however during the outdoor performance test they were all powered by external power sources zhong et al 2018 wang et al 2017 dey et al 2013 these fluid driven soft actuators such as the fea and pam are difficult to perform onboard with bionic amphibious robots because of the large size of the actuator system and the complex field environment milana et al 2020 soft amphibious robots and other robots that are driven by the fea or pam are supplied with external air and fluid as a result these robots can only perform movement research in a laboratory environment faudzi et al 2017 because of their high driving voltage and low energy utilisation efficiency the bionic amphibious robots that are driven by de and sma also need an external power supply hence they cannot achieve independent outdoor locomotion let alone long term intelligent outdoor operations a crayfish inspired microrobot that is driven by an ipmc with a low voltage and small size is powered by umbilical cord cables from the father robot which can result in independent motion of the father son robot system li et al 2015 6 control animals have excellent movement ability and a high adaptability to the natural environment this benefits the smart driving structure as well as the rich perception system and the ability to make independent decisions the working environment of the bionic amphibious robots is complex and varied as a result it needs to be able to perceive the external environment information the parameter change trend and its own functional state in real time in order to obtain real bionic intelligent control the airborne processor integrates the collected information and it adjusts the operation strategy in time such as mode switching path planning and data transmission 6 1 sensors sensors are of great significance for bionic amphibious robots because they can sense the position information of their environment monitor the movement state of the robot and complete path planning and motion mode switching finally sensors can achieve the amphibious robot s independent work the sensors carried by the bionic amphibious robot are listed in table 7 environmental sensing sensors primarily include water detection sensors water flow sensors proximity sensors and cameras the working environment of the amphibious robots includes land underwater and the amphibious transition environments in addition the water detection sensor is used to determine the environment of the robot which is the premise for the robot to achieve autonomous work in the field the water flow sensor achieves underwater obstacle avoidance through the fluid motion sensing obstacles and the proximity sensor and camera are mainly used for land obstacle avoidance an electronic compass and a gps are used for robot positioning and directional movement the depth gauge and pressure gauge can ensure that the robot works at a safe depth by detecting the water pressure the acceleration and force sensors are used to monitor the motion state of the system and to maintain motion stability robots can carry task sensors such as metal detectors and video cameras to complete a variety of tasks 6 2 control strategies there are a variety of control strategies in the field of robotics this paper summarises the existing control methods for bionic amphibious robots and it generally divides them into three categories behaviour based methods model based methods and biocybernetics methods grzelczyk and awrejcewicz 2019b aoi et al 2017 zhang 2018 the characteristics of these three types of control modes and typical amphibious robots are listed in table 8 early bionic amphibious robots adopted behaviour based methods for instance the lobster robot reversely designs the action pattern library according to the behaviour of the lobsters in the target operating environment and then it perceives the environmental information and executes different movements ayers et al 2000b however because of their poor intelligence behaviour based methods are rarely used in bionic amphibious robots model based methods are used to model the robot body and environment plan the robot s trajectory and control the deviation when using a feedback mechanism most bionic amphibious robots such as whegs iv the turtle inspired father robot and inspector iii adopt the model based method kinetic modelling methods mainly include the newton euler method lagrangian method kane method and the hamilton principle among these the kinetic modelling methods that are based on the newton euler method and lagrangian method are often adopted according to the specific characteristics of the different control objects an appropriate dynamic modelling method can be selected in general all the current dynamic models have high coupling and strong nonlinear characteristics the developing trend is to design simplified models of bionic amphibious robots in addition to these two types of control strategies biologically controlled methods that are represented by the cpg are increasingly being used in bionic amphibious robots the cpg is a neural network that can produce the rhythm pattern output in the absence of high level control signals and peripheral feedback information the inherent nonlinear characteristics of the cpg are conducive to the smooth transition of different bionic amphibious robot gaits with a strong environmental adaptability and control stability in 2007 ijspeert adopted the cpg to achieve multimode switching for the bionic amphibious robot salamander ijspeert et al 2007 ijspeert predicted that the natural frequency of the limb oscillator is lower than the body oscillator which was verified by a large amount of biological experimental data and the connection between the cpg model and the amphibious evolution was revealed ijspeert et al 2007 7 discussion since the world s first bionic amphibious robot was designed in 1996 remarkable achievements have been made however there is still a big gap between bionic amphibious robots and animals when considering the flexibility and intelligence this section will focus on the existing problems of bionic amphibious robots and their future development 7 1 existing problems the working environment of bionic amphibious robots includes a variety of complex terrains such as beaches wetlands and being underwater and the biological prototype primarily consists of aquatic and terrestrial creatures although scholars have established the resistive force theory elongated body theory inverted pendulum model and many other theoretical models lighthill 1971 cavagna et al 1977 dickinson et al 2000 most of these models are only applicable to static lab environments as a complex system every action of an organism is affected by a variety of internal and external factors however most studies on biological mechanisms start from unilateral factors which cannot fully meet the needs of biological research nature has created rigid flexible and compact body structures that have an excellent athletic performance bionic amphibious robots are essentially electromechanical systems most of them are driven by electric motors and they are quite complex in structure and they are large in size in addition bionic amphibious robots use a rigid connecting rod transmission for instance the compound legged robot amphihex ii can only rotate its flippers with a larger size and its motion performance is worse than a real cockroach zhong et al 2018 the snake robot simulates the 3d movement of the snake spine through a series of 2 dof joints which greatly increases the control complexity and it has poor stability and flexibility yamada 2005 presently soft actuators are compact in structure but they are short in control accuracy for control of robots with soft actuators it still remains in the stage of performing simple actions in the laboratory as a result bionic amphibious robots are far away from being used in practical applications that require autonomous operations after a long period of natural selection the energy usage efficiency of organisms has reached an extremely high level which is far higher than all of the existing artificial driving methods bionic amphibious robots need to independently complete specific tasks and cross various terrains after being deployed which requires a large amount of onboard energy owing to the limited energy utilisation efficiency it is difficult for onboard batteries to meet the long term operational needs of amphibious robots the limited energy and low energy utilisation efficiency affects the applications of bionic amphibious robots animals have an excellent motion ability and a high adaptability to their natural environment this is attributed to their dexterous driving structure as well as their rich sensory system and autonomous decision making ability yu et al 2017 the robotic fish only have a maximum thrust efficiency at 61 while fish in the carangiform achieve a propulsive efficiency of approximately 90 with lunate fins or flukes cheng and blickhan 1994 wen et al 2012 fish capture energy from vortices to improve motion efficiency with their mechanosensory lateral line system perceiving the weak flow and pressure variations liao et al 2003 jiang et al 2019a bigdog mobile robots carry about 50 sensors that can monitor their own state quantity environmental parameters and the interaction between the robot and the environment meng et al 2016 the working environment of a bionic amphibious robot is complex and changeable which requires sensing the external environment information parameter variation trend and its own running state in real time during the movement however the existing amphibious robots cannot accurately simulate the sensing characteristics of the organisms especially in underwater environments the fluid could also lead to long response times with a poor sensing accuracy for the surrounding environment in addition the robot s ability to process the environment information and its motion control are still insufficient thus it is difficult to obtain biological motion control that is fast and accurate 7 2 future prospects revealing the motion characteristics of biological prototypes is the premise of bionic design due to the rapid developments in biology chemistry structural science and other disciplines research on the driving mechanisms for a variety of underwater and terrestrial animals has gradually entered the muscle tissue structure and the microcellular energy utilisation process aiello et al 2018 chen et al 2019 more accurate mathematical models are required to provide a theoretical basis for the design of underwater and land driven robot structures the organisms in nature usually have rigid and flexible structures in which they are characterised by compact structures agile motion a high energy utilisation efficiency and enhancing the motion performance and environmental adaptability salazar et al 2018 in addition the organism can dynamically adjust the flexibility of the limb by changing the muscle state as a result it can achieve efficient movement in different environments whereas the existing bionic amphibious robots mostly adopt rigid structures researchers at yale university have developed new limbs with a variable stiffness which provides a new design scheme for rigid flexible structures baines et al 2020 they used composite materials and a soft actuator fea in addition they changed the state of the limbs between leg and flipper configurations by varying the electrical input to the flexible heater in the fabric sleeve as shown in fig 12 it is an important development direction for amphibious bionic robots to design rigid flexible structures by improving the existing mechanical drive structures or using soft actuators such as fea de and sma the extremely limited energy and low energy utilisation efficiency restrict the applications of bionic amphibious robots from the perspective of broadening the sources of income and reducing the expenditure on the one hand it is necessary for bionic amphibious robots to carry batteries with a higher energy density and to improve the outdoor energy collection capacity the environmental energy which can be collected and utilized by robots mainly includes solar energy wind energy wave energy and tidal energy yu et al 2018b the working environment of bionic amphibious robots covers land and sea and they can collect a variety of environmental energy according to their working environment and their own structural characteristics the application of a soft actuator dielectric elastomer generator for ocean buoys provides a method for bionic amphibious robots to collect energy outdoors chiba et al 2008 in this case a dielectric elastomer generator is attached to a rotating waterwheel via a crankshaft which harvests the energy of the ocean waves and it supplies power to the ocean buoys on the other hand to improve the efficiency of the energy utilisation some methods can be adopted which includes optimising the task route switching the optimal modes and closing the redundant sensors to improve the adaptability of the bionic amphibious robots to land and underwater they usually have several motion modes to deal with the different medium environments this requires a variety of sensors to monitor the environment and their own state quantity due to the complex and changeable working environment airborne sensors need to have a higher sensitivity and stability just like fish that sense changes in the flow through the lateral line by integrating the sensory organs with the body the lobster robot integrates the flow sensors that are designed for micro mechanical structures into the robot s feet to make the robot more compact chalmers 2000 in the future design of amphibious bionic robots it is necessary to develop micro electro mechanical sensors that are suitable for them in an amphibious working environment asadnia et al 2014 kottapalli et al 2016 while ensuring the accuracy the volume of airborne sensors needs to be reduced to realise the integrated design of the structure and perception fig 13 presents a new biomimetic tactile and slip sensor by using piezoelectric sensors with microstructures which can play an important role in robot perception systems and provide new ideas for the sensor design jiang et al 2019b the subsequent development of bionic amphibious robots requires more application of modern control methods such as fuzzy control neural networks and genetic algorithms researchers have begun to study the speed gait and energy consumption of robot platforms in different environments e g underwater pavement grassland wetland beach etc zhong et al 2018 dey et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 however only a few studies have looked at motion parameter switching and the autonomous motion mode adjustment under different environments therefore modern control methods should be used to enhance the stability of the robots in different environments as well as the ability of modal switching control for robots with soft actuators researchers have developed a new family of bending and helical extensile pams and realized precise control guan et al 2020 in future based on the accurate motion of the soft actuators it is necessary to apply modern control theory to soft robots in addition high precision sensors should be integrated into the robot system to achieve autonomous multi modal motion of the robots on land and underwater in recent years artificial intelligence has been widely used in the robotics industry wu et al 2018 for bionic amphibious robots new intelligent control methods such as reinforcement learning and deep learning can help improve the adaptability and robustness of the robots in the field environment and enhance their autonomous decision making ability hwangbo et al 2019 the information collected by the sensors is processed by onboard processors in addition the operation strategies such as mode switching path planning data transmission and large scale network communication should be adjusted in time to achieve a true sense of bionic intelligent control 8 conclusion after a long period of natural selection organisms have evolved highly adaptive structures to the natural environment which provides a new idea for the study of amphibious robots recently bionic structures bionic materials and other cutting edge research achievements have been applied to bionic amphibious robots and their excellent performances have shown broad application prospects this paper offers a comprehensive review of the current status of bionic amphibious robots this review emphasises the driving mechanisms of the aquatic and terrestrial motion modes the classification of the bionic amphibian robots the actuators energy and control methods as well as the existing deficiencies of the bionic amphibious robots future bionic amphibious robots will be able to simplify the amphibious drive structures by using soft actuators they will improve the energy utilisation efficiency they should be able to perceive the environment and have the ability to make autonomous decisions finally future studies on bionic amphibious robots will focus on providing them with bionic and intelligent directions funding this work

trends of bionic amphibious robots are analysed and discussed keywords amphibious robots bionics driving mechanism soft actuator mechanical structure 1 introduction presently bionic amphibious robots represent a growing area of interest for roboticists milana et al 2020 xing et al 2019 paschal et al 2019 in comparison to conventional amphibious robots with propellers and wheels or tracks they can be navigated on land and underwater the design of bionic amphibious robots was inspired by the ingenious mechanism and skilful movements of animals in addition they have several advantages such as efficient obstacle negotiation a strong manoeuvrability and a rapid land water transition zhong et al 2018 graf et al 2019 tanaka et al 2004 sequeira et al 2016 because of these abilities they have wide application prospects in the fields of security industry defence and transportation baines et al 2019 dudek et al 2007 greiner et al 1996 in nature there are a variety of amphibians such as crabs lobsters turtles snakes and frogs all of these amphibians can functionally move underwater and in terrestrial environments hence these amphibians are the inspiration for the bionic design researchers have studied the driving mechanism of organisms in different environments and then imitated their shape and motion structure to design biomimetic robots dudek et al 2007 greiner et al 1996 dowling 1997 han et al 2012 tang et al 2017 the world s first bionic amphibious robot was an autonomous crab like robot called ursula that was designed for mine hunting in the surf zone in 1996 greiner et al 1996 a large number of bionic amphibious robots that are based on lobsters turtles snakes and other creatures emerged one after another dudek et al 2007 ayers et al 2000a kemp et al 2005 liljeback et al 2014 recently some soft actuators such as a pneumatic artificial muscle pam fluidic elastomer actuators fea shape memory alloys sma and electroactive polymers eap are capable of motions that are needed for amphibious locomotion which have been exploited in bionic amphibious robots chu et al 2012 jin et al 2016 chang et al 2018 shintake et al 2018 marchese et al 2015 for instance paschal presented an urchin inspired robot with five fea tube feet and ten spines that could move on ferrous surfaces and underwater with an external fluid supply paschal et al 2019 by developing an intelligent control system advanced control methods such as reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks have been widely used in the robotics industry fan et al 2020 yu et al 2018a wu et al 2018 bin designed an amphibious robot called amphihex ii that has a central pattern generator neural network that achieves a smooth and quick gait transition zhong et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 the driving mechanism classification actuator energy and control are the key factors of bionic amphibious robots for the system simulation and machine manufacturing these key factors are illustrated in the following sections section 2 introduces the aquatic and terrestrial driving mechanisms of animals that are considered to be bionic objects section 3 presents the classification of the bionic amphibious robots the various types of actuators and structures are presented in section 4 section 5 focuses on the energy of the bionic amphibious robots the sensors and typical control strategies

amphibious robots finally the conclusions are presented in section 8 2 driving mechanism 2 1 driving mechanism of aquatic animals undoubtedly the driving mechanism of underwater and terrestrial organisms is the basis of bionic amphibious robots underwater driving modes can be divided into two categories non bionic underwater driving and bionic underwater driving there are two key methods for non bionic underwater driving propeller and water jet driving after a long period of natural evolution aquatic organisms have developed a variety of underwater motion patterns in which the vast majority are fish buren et al 2018 salazar et al 2019 according to the different driving sites fish propulsion is divided into body and or caudal fin propulsion bcf and media and or paired fin propulsion mpf lindsey 1978 as shown in fig 2 as illustrated in fig 2 the shaded areas contribute to the thrust generation the characteristics of the various underwater driving modes are listed in table 1 research on the driving mechanism of fish with the bcf and mpf propulsion mode has been carried out by applying three strategies theoretical models numerical simulations biological observations and prototype experiments yu et al 2018a scaradozzi et al 2017 kang et al 2020 the theoretical models are mathematical expressions of the propulsive force fish body structure and motion parameters and these models are established by simplifying the parameters under the ideal motion parameters due to the complexity of the hydrodynamics and the kinematics of swimming organisms the theoretical models usually have a certain range of applications lighthill 1971 taylor 1952 jiao et al 2018 in order to perform numerical simulations the fluid continuous flow differential equations need to be solved which are calculated by applying computational fluid dynamics cfd in comparison to the theoretical models the numerical simulation can reveal more detailed information about the flow field and the interactions between underwater organisms and the fluid scaradozzi et al 2017 lamas et al 2011a the kinematic parameters and motion characteristics of fish can be measured and extracted by directly observing the various movement behaviours of fish and imitating their biological movements with bionic robots recently digital particle image velocimetry dpiv has been gradually applied to quantify the wake hydrodynamics behind swimming fish or bionic robotic fish in order to reveal the motion mechanics of fish yu et al 2018a drucker and lauder 2002 wen et al 2018 approximately 85 of fish adopt bcf propulsion as their primary propulsion mode sfakiotakis et al 1999 this is achieved by undulating or oscillating their body or their caudal fin pushing back against the water around them and generating thrust with the help of the counterforces in 1952 taylor established the resistive force theory to analyse the fish swimming model taylor 1951 1952 however it is only applicable to analysing aquatic organisms with small reynolds numbers because of the neglect of the inertia forces wu proposed the two dimensional 2d flexible plate theory which uses the linearised inviscid flow theory to solve the general problem of 2d flexible plates under an arbitrary unsteady velocity wu 1961 1971 on this basis tong established the three dimensional 3d waving plate theory which was achieved by modelling fish as a deformable thin plate tong et al 1993 cheng et al 1991 lighthill s theory which includes the elongated body theory and the large amplitude elongated body theory are pertinent for modelling slender fish with bcf propulsion and they are widely used in the hydrodynamic modelling of robotic fish lighthill 1960 1970 1971 with the development of computer technology schultz obtained the distribution of pressure and velocity in the swimming process by performing 2d numerical calculations sw et al 1991 subsequently some researchers performed a cfd simulation to calculate the 2d and 3d wake structures of fish such as tadpoles lamprey and tuna and they carried out in depth research on the body shape and swimming parameters liu et al 1996 carling et al 1998 zhu et al 2002 kern and koumoutsakos 2006 tytell et al 2010 in 1995 stamhuis made use of the dpiv for the first time to measure the velocity of small aquatic organisms such as copepods fish larvae and juvenile fish drucker and lauder 2002 stamhuis and videler 1995 by measuring the wake flow field with the 3d dpiv it was observed that fish such as rainbow trout and sunfish can utilise the energy in the vortex by swinging their tail fins the other 15 of fish take their dorsal fins anal fins pelvic fins or pectoral fins as the main propulsion parts sfakiotakis et al 1999 this is known as median and or paired fin mpf locomotion which has great manoeuvrability kato 2005 blake analysed the thrust force of mandarin fish and considered the pectoral fins as the actuator discs however the accuracy of the propulsion calculation is defective due to the neglect of energy in the wake vortex blake 1979 by combining the blade element theory and unsteady airfoil theory daniel qualitatively analysed the relationship between the propulsion performance and the parameters of the pectoral fins such as the aspect ratio wavelength fin flexibility and frequency daniel 1988 lighthill applied the elongated body theory to balistiform and gymnotiform locomotion lighthill and blake 1990 xie established the ideal undulating fin model and determined the analytical expressions of the forces and torques in different directions xie and yin 2013 researchers used 2d and 3d cfd to analyse the relationship between the propulsion force of the undulating fin and the wave frequency amplitude and wavelength rahman et al 2011 lamas et al 2011b lamasgaldo et al 2014 hu et al 2006 sharp employed a simulation on the undulatory pectoral fin with cfd and multiparticle collision dynamics and established an analytical model of the undulatory kinematics sharp et al 2014 zhao investigated the combined undulating motion pattern of the undulating fin that was inspired by the large mouthed catfish which can dramatically improve its thrust zhao and dou 2019 hu observed the body shape characteristics of the amiiform fish under different motion states through dpiv and analysed the relationship between the morphological parameters undulatory parameters of the undulating fin and the undulation dynamics hu et al 2009 sefati observed two inward counter propagating waves that are produced by knifefish and determined that the thrust force of the undulating fin can be adjusted by controlling the meeting node sefati et al 2012 neveln used dpiv to observe the vortex on the anal fin and observed that the tilted fin ray affects the continuity of the vortex and reduces the propulsion efficiency neveln et al 2014 zhou discovered that the optimal propulsion efficiency of the undulatory fin is related to the device structure and control strategy zhou and low 2014 di sant observed the three dimensional kinematics of sting rays and identified that the motion amplitude of each pectoral fin position is significantly different di sant noted that the motion velocity can be adjusted by actively controlling the curvature of the pectoral fin disanto et al 2017 liu used the motion energy consumption wave efficiency and strouhal number as indicators in addition lin used the undulating fin propulsion device to analyse the relationship between the fin stiffness morphology and propulsion efficiency function liu et al 2017 liu and curet 2018 after a few decades of development the bcf and mpf underwater driving modes have accomplished a significant amount of theoretical research simulation analyses observations and experimental research however the theoretical models remain too simple and the simulation results prototype tests and biological observation results are far from each other dabiri 2005 2 2 driving mechanism of terrestrial animals there are two types of land driving modes bionic land driving and non bionic land driving non bionic land driving mainly includes the wheel driving mode and track driving mode which are widely used in industry due to its stronger environmental adaptability and obstacle surmounting ability bionic driving modes have attracted the attention of research institutions around the world over the past few decades according to their motion forms they can be divided into legged walking legged jumping and limbless locomotion grzelczyk and awrejcewicz 2019a zhang et al 2020 ding et al 2013 mahapatra et al 2020 the legged walking driving mode uses the static friction force between the ground and the foot as the driving force by several foot ends which contacts the ground because the contact point between the driving foot and the ground is discretely distributed the obstacle surmounting ability is higher than the crawler hence it can adapt to the requirements of complex terrain movement the number of driving feet can be divided into bipedal human four legged cats and multi legged spiders wang et al 2003 in 1977 cavagna proposed an inverted pendulum motion model that is based on the changes in kinetic energy and the potential energy in the movement of animals mochon and mcmahon 1980 cavagna et al 1977 dickinson et al 2000 the walking process can be divided into two steps first the kinetic energy of the body is converted into gravitational potential energy under the support of the legs and the centre of gravity advances and rises with the foot as the fulcrum later as the body s centre of gravity passes the support position some of the gravitational potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy as shown in fig 3 a cavagna et al 1977 the cognition of the kinetic model in the movement of creatures such as lobsters and spiders is relatively clear blickhan and barth 1985 domenici et al 1999 full and tu 1991 some multi legged robots that are represented by bigdog a legged robot produced by boston dynamics have been equipped with practical application capabilities studies on legged walking robots has been mainly focused on the parallel mechanism dynamic model zhang et al 1994 the foot ground force model the motion efficiency and stability control mahapatra et al 2020 grzelczyk and awrejcewicz 2019b creatures such as frogs kangaroos locusts and fleas are driven by legged jumping they jump over obstacles that are several times their body size and this is achieved by releasing energy that is stored in their muscles tendons and ligaments in a short time as shown in fig 3b in comparison to legged walking the obstacle surmounting the performance of legged jumping has greatly improved zhang et al 2020 paskins determined that kangaroos can achieve energy accumulation and altitude adjustment during landing in order to make continuous jumps paskins et al 2007 however small animals such as fleas and frogs need to rebuild their energy after landing and they can only achieve intermittent jumps bennet clark and lucey 1967 astley and roberts 2012 the literature on the mechanism of biological jumping is very thorough and most of the research focuses on the regulation of the body posture of organisms in the air for instance kangaroos use their tails for balance paskins et al 2007 and grasshoppers adjust their posture in the air by swinging its belly and forewings chen et al 2015 in terms of the jumping performance many jumping robots are far ahead of creatures mo et al 2019 limbless animals such as snakes can move themselves by wiggling their bodies against the ground or the objects around them as shown in fig 3c according to the swing method the serpentine gait can be divided into the following classes concertina lateral undulation sidewinding rectilinear slide pushing and other less common forms gray 1946 hirose proposed a serpenoid curve to describe snake locomotion and developed a snake robot hirose 1993 afterwards the serpentine curve and 3d serpentine curves were employed to generate a 3d gait ma 1999 gonzalez gomez and boemo 2006 ostrowski transformed the snake like robot control problem into a nonlinear system problem by using the differential geometry method ostrowski and burdick 1998 matsuno took the snake like robot as a multi degree of freedom redundant controllable system for position and shape control matsuno and sato 2005 presently the mechanism of limbless locomotion is almost clear but there are still some deficiencies in the mathematical description of the 3d space motion model motion structure and the motion control of limbless robots in comparison to aquatic animals the research on terrestrial animals is more sophisticated and advanced in terms of the driving mechanism mechanical structure and control mode some robots already have practical application abilities however there are still some problems such as over simplified models a low motion efficiency and an insufficient control ability 3 classification over the last three decades several bionic amphibious robots have been presented according to the different bionic prototypes bionic amphibious robots can be generally divided into two categories simple bionic amphibious robots and compound bionic amphibious robots simple bionic amphibious robots refer to robots that imitate real amphibians in nature compound bionic amphibious robots integrate non bionic locomotion or a variety of biological locomotion modes that are based on the usage requirements fig 4 displays the classification of bionic amphibious robots and the categories of locomotion on land and underwater 3 1 simple bionic amphibious robots simple bionic amphibious robots use natural organisms as prototypes based on their imitations of creatures they can be classified into three subclasses legged amphibious robots snake like amphibious robots and salamander like amphibious robots the typical simple bionic amphibious robots are presented in table 2 which has terrestrial and underwater driving modes and it provides a key analysis on their highlights and deficiencies as well as the pictures for reference because of its excellent motion performance and obstacle surmounting ability the legged walking driving mode is widely used in bionic amphibious robots as the world s first bionic amphibious robot the ursula aluv which was inspired by insects was designed to hunt and eliminate minds the ursula aluv has six 2 dof rigid walking legs that are actuated by motors greiner et al 1996 then a lobster robot driven by sma shape memory alloys with eight 3 dof walking legs was developed by using a neuronal circuit based controller and neuromorphic sensors as well as a behavioural library from real lobsters ayers et al 2000a 2000b hyungwon developed a crab like robot named cr200 which has sufficient performance for seabed walking with two 6 dof front legs and four 4 dof legs shim et al 2016 yoo et al 2015 faudzi et al created a soft amphibious robot with four walking legs that are driven by pam which was able to walk on a flat surface sand and underwater when considering the advantages of crab legs nicole performed a series of experiments with different feet with a waterproofing robot and discovered that the wave induced displacement can be reduced with modified feet graf et al 2019 thibaut and his consultants created a robot that was inspired by sea urchins which had ten spines and five tubes the robot was driven by fea and it moved on ferrous surfaces with magnets in the tube ends without fins or paddles the robots that were introduced above can only move on land and on the seabed and they swim poorly underwater thus legged amphibious robots with fins or paddles were developed that can move on land and underwater in addition they have a neutral buoyancy or buoyancy control devices which is similar to the fish underwater in order to reveal the impact of flipper collaborative propulsion on biological mobility john developed a turtle like robot named madeleine and identified that the synergistic action of flippers can effectively improve the propulsion efficiency through eight gait propulsion experiments long et al 2006 han and his colleagues created a turtle like robot called miniturtle i which has high environmental adaptability with four 4 dof leg flippers by adjusting the positions and motion range of four independently controlled rotating joints the variable topology leg flippers can be used as walking feet or swimming flippers which enables it to move on land and underwater han et al 2012 a crayfish inspired microrobot with eight walking legs and a pair of hands was presented as a son robot in the father son robot system in this design the microrobot son robot was driven by ten ipmc ionic polymer metallic composite actuators and it communicated with the father robot by using a blue led based underwater optical communication system li et al 2015 2016 wang presented a shoal crablike robot that adopted a bounding gait with six 3 dof legs and two 3 dof paddles wang et al 2017 the average speed increased by 54 in comparison to the walking gait and this was achieved by performing gait process planning kinematics modelling and trajectory planning wang et al 2017 a starfish robot driven by sma actuators was created with flexible tentacles that could perform walking and swimming motions jin et al 2016 mao et al 2014 a snake like robot called the acm r5 was created with nine waterproofing modules it could move on land and swim underwater by using a limbless locomotion mode and the bcf propulsion mode by planning every joint rotation yamada 2005 similarly yu et al developed a snake like robot to explore a new 3d gait generation method and they verified its locomotion ability by performing gait experiments yu 2012 the snake like robot mamba adopted modular and reconfigurable design ideas which includes the head module tail module joint module with passive wheels and the propulsion module with motorised wheels in addition in order to study the driving mechanism of the snake like robot the researchers developed force sensors that are based on strain gauges and they installed them inside the unit modules to measure the interaction forces between each module and the ground liljeback et al 2014 milana et al created a bioinspired multimodal amphibious robot called eelworm that had a flexible body consisting of five inflatable bending and elongating actuator modules milana et al 2020 by planning the drive sequence it performed limbless locomotion and bcf locomotion at a speed of two and three body lengths per minute respectively salamanders have four walking legs and a flexible narrow body which allows them to walk on land and swim underwater like a bcf propulsion fish a bionic amphibious robot salamander was created with 1 dof walking legs and nine modular units that are connected by 1 dof joints and the robot gaits were generated by a central pattern generator cpg the researchers studied the mathematical models of the gait transition under different amphibious environments and the relevant conclusions were verified by conducting biological experimental observations these investigations revealed the internal relationship between the cpg motion model and biological evolution ijspeert et al 2007 crespi et al 2013 based on this robot karakasiliotis et al designed another salamander inspired robot named pleurobot the pleurobot had four 4 dof walking legs and twelve segments that were connected by eleven 1 dof joints karakasiliotis et al 2016 in a study conducted by yin et al a salamander inspired robot named chigon that consisted of five modules in series was created the front two modules served as the trunk of the robot and they were equipped with driving feet while the rear three modules reduced the friction resistance with the driven wheels the cpg was used to optimise its gait effectively reduce the impact intensity between the moving foot and the ground and achieve high speed land movement of the robot yin et al 2012 presently most simple bionic amphibious robots have been able to move in an unstructured environment however due to the limitations of the driving structure there are still some problems for the movement of different environmental media these problems include insufficient mobility weak environmental adaptability a slow period when switching between water and land motion modes a weak environmental perception ability and an insufficient autonomous control ability 3 2 compound bionic amphibious robots compound bionic amphibious robots are not limited to imitating a certain organism but they combine various driving methods to meet the practical application requirements according to the main features of bionic amphibious robots they can be divided into compound legged amphibious robots and amphibious robotic fishes table 3 presents their terrestrial and underwater driving modes and a key analysis of their highlights and deficiencies as well as pictures for reference owing to the excellent motion performance and obstacle surmounting ability of performing legged locomotion compound legged amphibious robots have adapted the underwater driven structure into a compound leg structure alexander et al designed the whegs iv robot which is a cockroach inspired amphibious robot with six independently controlled 2 dof propeller legs and a 1 dof rotating trunk boxerbaum et al 2005 harkins et al 2005 by adjusting the phase difference and propulsion angle of the propeller legs it was adaptable to a variety of complex terrestrial and aquatic environments on the basis of six legged crawling robots an amphibious robot aqua with six 1 dof driving structures was created by using umbilical cord cables for the data transmission the visual observation of the offshore coral reefs and 3d scene modelling could be completed however the legs had to be manually switched to paddles dudek et al 2007 by focusing on the shortcomings of aqua bir et al created ninja legs which has six 1 dof offset wheel walking legs and the experiments were conducted in a variety of environments dey et al 2013 the experimental results demonstrated that even though the offset wheel walking legs have a higher single cycle power consumption than the semi circular walking legs they could be applied to wetlands beaches be used underwater and applied in other environments hence it has a strong environmental adaptability as mentioned above a turtle inspired robot was created as a father robot in the father son robot system xing et al 2019 it had four 2 dof water jet propulsion units that were controlled by servo motors which could achieve vector propulsion underwater and it could use its feet to walk on land zhong and his colleagues developed the hexapod amphibious robot amphihex ii which contained six 1 dof variable stiffness compound legs and cpgs generating gaits zhong et al 2018 through a series of field experiments the cpgs could effectively shorten the gait transition time and the variable stiffness compound legs have an excellent environmental adaptability with more emphasis on the underwater manoeuvrability amphibious robotic fish mainly imitate the structure of fish the multi mode amphibious fish amphirobot could perform carangiform or dolphin like swimming by rotating its tail fin with pectoral fins this provided assistance for underwater steering as well as motion on land with its paddle wheel compound pectoral fins that were continuously rotating yang et al 2007 li et al designed an amphibious transformable robot called amoeba ii that had two drive modules two pitch modules and one linking module in this design li et al proposed a multi objective genetic algorithm to obtain a pareto solution afterwards li et al verified the manoeuvrability and obstacle striding ability of the robot through a large number of experiments in an amphibious environment li et al 2012 yang created a frog inspired amphibious robot called frobot that had a dual swing leg propulsion mechanism by swinging its legs to generate propulsion the frobot could move on land and swim underwater with the anti bias wheels and flexible fins on its legs yang et al 2015 a bionic amphibious robot named velox was created with a pair of flexible fins the fins were undulated periodically under the control of the actuators and they generated a thrust force to allow the robot to swim underwater and crawl on land pliant energy systems s the design of the compound bionic amphibious robots is oriented by its practical application and it is not limited to the structure of certain organisms in nature which greatly increases the environmental adaptability and engineering application prospects of bionic amphibious robots 4 actuators actuators play an important role in bionic amphibious robot systems in this section the various actuators for the existing bionic amphibious robots and their driving mechanisms are introduced based on the structure of the actuators that are used in bionic amphibious robots they can be divided into rigid actuators that are represented by motor and soft actuators which includes the pma and fea table 4 lists the actuators for the existing bionic amphibious robots as well as the masses dimensions and peak velocities of the robots 4 1 rigid actuators owing to the strong output and control precision more than 80 of bionic amphibious robots use motors as their actuators as shown in table 4 the motor can complete the motion function of the robot end effector by connecting to a single or multiple joints a single joint means that the driving structure has only one degree of rotational freedom which is the simplest design and it is easy to control compound legged amphibious robots such as ninja legs and amphihex ii use a single joint to drive the paddle rotate reduce the movement complexity and simplify the robot structure because rigid structures are inefficient underwater these robots have many elaborate designs for the composite legs fig 5 presents the structure of the variable stiffness legs in amphihex ii and the rotary motion for land and underwater zhong et al 2018 the designers placed the flexible flippers into the rigid fan shaped frames and adjusted the flipper stiffness by manually adjusting the slider position to adapt to the diverse environments in comparison to the single joint structure the multiple joint structure has more dof this allows the bionic amphibious robot to be more similar to the biological structure for creatures in nature as shown in fig 6 the snake like amphibious robot acm r5 consists of nine waterproof modules that are connected in series through universal joints yamada 2005 each module is equipped with a cpu batteries and universal joint driving motors and the entire body is covered with driven wheels to ensure that the friction conditions can be satisfied it can achieve a variety of 3d gaits in aquatic and terrestrial environments by planning every joint movement recently great achievements have been made in terms of the biomimetic structures design motion performance and the outdoor working abilities of the bionic amphibious robots for greater reliability these robots designed for engineering applications are driven by a motor and they have been constantly improved however due to the limitations of the motor s properties it is difficult to apply this to micro robots due to its disadvantages such as its large size and high power consumption 4 2 soft actuators along with the development of bionics and material science fea pam sma and eaps have been gradually applied to bionic amphibious robots feas are mainly composed of fluid grid channels that consist of elastic rubber gas hydraulic valves reversing valves and fluid pipelines katzschmann et al 2018 fig 7 shows the schematic diagram of the urchinbot tube foot structure that is driven by fea and its actuation principle paschal et al 2019 marchese et al 2015 when the fluid enters the upper fluid grid channels of the tube foot the fluid grid channels expand in all directions and strain the elastomer under the action of the fluid pressure which results in downward bending of the tube foot through a tube foot that is driven by the fea the urchinbot achieved linear motion at a maximum speed of 0 027 bl s underwater which is approximately 10 of what is observed with live juvenile sea urchins the fea s advantages include a large driving force and a sensitive response however it has poor controllability and positioning accuracy moreover the entire fea system is quite complex which usually includes hydraulic pumps pipeline delivery systems and fluid regulation mechanisms another common soft actuator that is used in bionic amphibious robots is pam which is also known as the mckibben actuator the pam primarily consists of an inflatable elastic tube that is surrounded by a braided fibre to restrict the actuator expansion in a certain direction and the elastic tube expands with the pneumatic pressure as shown in fig 8 the soft amphibious robot with four walking legs is driven by four groups of pam actuators in each group the three pam actuators are arranged in parallel and their upper and bottom parts are fixed faudzi et al 2017 the bending motion of the legs can be produced by pressurizing one of the three actuators in each group with the assistance of a plastic plate in the body the robot successfully walked like a salamander with a speed of 0 056 m s on land and 0 022 m s underwater similar to the fea pam has the advantages of smooth motion high stability having a light weight and a large output force however it also has some shortcomings such as a low control accuracy slow response speed and a complex system in addition to the above two flexible actuators sma has also been applied to bionic amphibious robots the fundamental principle of the sma actuator is to release stress during the martensitic reverse transformation of the material due to its thermo mechanical characteristics as demonstrated in fig 9 the starfish robot is driven by five groups of sma wires and the phase transition process can be described in three basic stages the twinned martensite phase transforms into the deformed martensite phase under an external stress with residual stress in the material which is called the forward transformation the deformation martensite is converted into austenite and the material returns to its original shape by heating as a result the material stress is released and this is called the reverse transformation after cooling the austenite phase again turns into the twinned martensite phase the entire process is manifested as the deformation and reverse deformation of the sma material with the temperature change chu et al 2012 mao et al 2014 lee and lee 2000 a series of experiments were conducted in semi submerged and underwater environments under an adaptive regulation heating strategy these experiments revealed that the speed of the starfish robot was at least an order of magnitude higher than the other robots when using the sma actuators jin et al 2016 the sma has the advantages of a high output stress and a low driving voltage however it has a poor driving frequency and energy consumption when used underwater the driving frequency of the sma can be greatly improved in comparison to air due to the rapid heat transfer between the water and sma materials as a new intelligent material the eap materials have the characteristics of a large driving force and a large deformation in response to an applied electrical field and it is widely used in a variety of fields such as biomimetic robots and aerospace energy carpi et al 2014 follador et al 2014 according to the electroactuation principle of eap intelligent driving materials it can be divided into two major areas ionic eap and electronic eap the representative material of the ionic eap is ipmc chang et al 2018 fig 10 presents a crayfish inspired microrobot that has two hands and eight legs that are actuated by ten ipmc actuators and the electroactuation principle of the ipmc when the two flexible electrodes are energised the hydrated cations are evenly distributed inside the material and they move and accumulate towards the negative pole in response to an applied electrical field this is manifested as the material bends towards the positive pole and it generates deformation at the macro level the researchers proposed a father son robot system that is composed of a crayfish inspired microrobot and a turtle inspired robot which greatly enhances the practical applications of amphibious robots through the collaborative work experiments on autonomous targets that involve grasping and optical navigation have been completed with copper wires that are connected to the father robot which receives control signals and a power supply xing et al 2019 li et al 2016 the ipmc has the advantages of a fast response speed a large driving displacement and a low driving voltage however it can only be used in a humid environment with a small driving force bhandari et al 2012 de is a representative material of the electronic eap pelrine et al 2002 fig 11 shows the frog inspired robot with two legs that are driven by four de actuators and the electroactuation principle of the de when the two flexible electrodes are energised the de material in the natural state expands and extends horizontally under the action of an electric field force which drives the frog inspired robot to swim underwater tang et al 2017 shintake et al 2018 it was determined that the projected area of the jumping legs increased by more than 60 with a high voltage hence it can generate a thrust that is larger than the drag and achieve underwater self propulsion tang et al 2017 since the driving voltage is extremely high kv and the electrode and de material require synchronous deformation it is extremely difficult to make the external insulation material of the electrode which is currently being studied pelrine et al 2002 li et al 2018 however because of its advantages that include a large deformation a fast response speed and high energy efficiency de materials have broad application prospects for bionic amphibious robots by having great continuity a large deformation and a rapid response soft actuators can significantly change the driving structure of bionic amphibious robots and provide new solutions for bionic designs table 5 shows the characteristics of the electroactuation material bionic amphibious robots designed for scientific research mostly adopt soft actuators to imitate the muscle tissue structure of organisms and reproduce the motion process of organisms because of the immaturity of the soft actuators the functions of the bionic amphibious robots are currently relatively simple this can verify the driving function of the amphibious environment in a laboratory setting however further research is required before it is widely used in practical applications 5 energy the different energy supply modes of the bionic amphibious robots mainly include onboard batteries external power supplies and external fluid supplies as presented in table 6 more than 75 of bionic amphibious robots are powered by onboard batteries which includes lithium li batteries and nickel metal hydride ni mh batteries as shown in table 6 ni mh batteries are cheap pollution free and they have a short service life meanwhile li batteries are more energy dense and lighter but they are more expensive mahmud et al 2019 in general the energy carried by the onboard battery is difficult to support the autonomous movement of a robot for a long time in the field environment in the field environment some bionic amphibious robots may be tested by using a cable power supply to ensure the stability of the energy supply for example in a shoal crablike robot ninja legs and the amphihex ii were designed to carry onboard batteries and they have the ability to work outdoors however during the outdoor performance test they were all powered by external power sources zhong et al 2018 wang et al 2017 dey et al 2013 these fluid driven soft actuators such as the fea and pam are difficult to perform onboard with bionic amphibious robots because of the large size of the actuator system and the complex field environment milana et al 2020 soft amphibious robots and other robots that are driven by the fea or pam are supplied with external air and fluid as a result these robots can only perform movement research in a laboratory environment faudzi et al 2017 because of their high driving voltage and low energy utilisation efficiency the bionic amphibious robots that are driven by de and sma also need an external power supply hence they cannot achieve independent outdoor locomotion let alone long term intelligent outdoor operations a crayfish inspired microrobot that is driven by an ipmc with a low voltage and small size is powered by umbilical cord cables from the father robot which can result in independent motion of the father son robot system li et al 2015 6 control animals have excellent movement ability and a high adaptability to the natural environment this benefits the smart driving structure as well as the rich perception system and the ability to make independent decisions the working environment of the bionic amphibious robots is complex and varied as a result it needs to be able to perceive the external environment information the parameter change trend and its own functional state in real time in order to obtain real bionic intelligent control the airborne processor integrates the collected information and it adjusts the operation strategy in time such as mode switching path planning and data transmission 6 1 sensors sensors are of great significance for bionic amphibious robots because they can sense the position information of their environment monitor the movement state of the robot and complete path planning and motion mode switching finally sensors can achieve the amphibious robot s independent work the sensors carried by the bionic amphibious robot are listed in table 7 environmental sensing sensors primarily include water detection sensors water flow sensors proximity sensors and cameras the working environment of the amphibious robots includes land underwater and the amphibious transition environments in addition the water detection sensor is used to determine the environment of the robot which is the premise for the robot to achieve autonomous work in the field the water flow sensor achieves underwater obstacle avoidance through the fluid motion sensing obstacles and the proximity sensor and camera are mainly used for land obstacle avoidance an electronic compass and a gps are used for robot positioning and directional movement the depth gauge and pressure gauge can ensure that the robot works at a safe depth by detecting the water pressure the acceleration and force sensors are used to monitor the motion state of the system and to maintain motion stability robots can carry task sensors such as metal detectors and video cameras to complete a variety of tasks 6 2 control strategies there are a variety of control strategies in the field of robotics this paper summarises the existing control methods for bionic amphibious robots and it generally divides them into three categories behaviour based methods model based methods and biocybernetics methods grzelczyk and awrejcewicz 2019b aoi et al 2017 zhang 2018 the characteristics of these three types of control modes and typical amphibious robots are listed in table 8 early bionic amphibious robots adopted behaviour based methods for instance the lobster robot reversely designs the action pattern library according to the behaviour of the lobsters in the target operating environment and then it perceives the environmental information and executes different movements ayers et al 2000b however because of their poor intelligence behaviour based methods are rarely used in bionic amphibious robots model based methods are used to model the robot body and environment plan the robot s trajectory and control the deviation when using a feedback mechanism most bionic amphibious robots such as whegs iv the turtle inspired father robot and inspector iii adopt the model based method kinetic modelling methods mainly include the newton euler method lagrangian method kane method and the hamilton principle among these the kinetic modelling methods that are based on the newton euler method and lagrangian method are often adopted according to the specific characteristics of the different control objects an appropriate dynamic modelling method can be selected in general all the current dynamic models have high coupling and strong nonlinear characteristics the developing trend is to design simplified models of bionic amphibious robots in addition to these two types of control strategies biologically controlled methods that are represented by the cpg are increasingly being used in bionic amphibious robots the cpg is a neural network that can produce the rhythm pattern output in the absence of high level control signals and peripheral feedback information the inherent nonlinear characteristics of the cpg are conducive to the smooth transition of different bionic amphibious robot gaits with a strong environmental adaptability and control stability in 2007 ijspeert adopted the cpg to achieve multimode switching for the bionic amphibious robot salamander ijspeert et al 2007 ijspeert predicted that the natural frequency of the limb oscillator is lower than the body oscillator which was verified by a large amount of biological experimental data and the connection between the cpg model and the amphibious evolution was revealed ijspeert et al 2007 7 discussion since the world s first bionic amphibious robot was designed in 1996 remarkable achievements have been made however there is still a big gap between bionic amphibious robots and animals when considering the flexibility and intelligence this section will focus on the existing problems of bionic amphibious robots and their future development 7 1 existing problems the working environment of bionic amphibious robots includes a variety of complex terrains such as beaches wetlands and being underwater and the biological prototype primarily consists of aquatic and terrestrial creatures although scholars have established the resistive force theory elongated body theory inverted pendulum model and many other theoretical models lighthill 1971 cavagna et al 1977 dickinson et al 2000 most of these models are only applicable to static lab environments as a complex system every action of an organism is affected by a variety of internal and external factors however most studies on biological mechanisms start from unilateral factors which cannot fully meet the needs of biological research nature has created rigid flexible and compact body structures that have an excellent athletic performance bionic amphibious robots are essentially electromechanical systems most of them are driven by electric motors and they are quite complex in structure and they are large in size in addition bionic amphibious robots use a rigid connecting rod transmission for instance the compound legged robot amphihex ii can only rotate its flippers with a larger size and its motion performance is worse than a real cockroach zhong et al 2018 the snake robot simulates the 3d movement of the snake spine through a series of 2 dof joints which greatly increases the control complexity and it has poor stability and flexibility yamada 2005 presently soft actuators are compact in structure but they are short in control accuracy for control of robots with soft actuators it still remains in the stage of performing simple actions in the laboratory as a result bionic amphibious robots are far away from being used in practical applications that require autonomous operations after a long period of natural selection the energy usage efficiency of organisms has reached an extremely high level which is far higher than all of the existing artificial driving methods bionic amphibious robots need to independently complete specific tasks and cross various terrains after being deployed which requires a large amount of onboard energy owing to the limited energy utilisation efficiency it is difficult for onboard batteries to meet the long term operational needs of amphibious robots the limited energy and low energy utilisation efficiency affects the applications of bionic amphibious robots animals have an excellent motion ability and a high adaptability to their natural environment this is attributed to their dexterous driving structure as well as their rich sensory system and autonomous decision making ability yu et al 2017 the robotic fish only have a maximum thrust efficiency at 61 while fish in the carangiform achieve a propulsive efficiency of approximately 90 with lunate fins or flukes cheng and blickhan 1994 wen et al 2012 fish capture energy from vortices to improve motion efficiency with their mechanosensory lateral line system perceiving the weak flow and pressure variations liao et al 2003 jiang et al 2019a bigdog mobile robots carry about 50 sensors that can monitor their own state quantity environmental parameters and the interaction between the robot and the environment meng et al 2016 the working environment of a bionic amphibious robot is complex and changeable which requires sensing the external environment information parameter variation trend and its own running state in real time during the movement however the existing amphibious robots cannot accurately simulate the sensing characteristics of the organisms especially in underwater environments the fluid could also lead to long response times with a poor sensing accuracy for the surrounding environment in addition the robot s ability to process the environment information and its motion control are still insufficient thus it is difficult to obtain biological motion control that is fast and accurate 7 2 future prospects revealing the motion characteristics of biological prototypes is the premise of bionic design due to the rapid developments in biology chemistry structural science and other disciplines research on the driving mechanisms for a variety of underwater and terrestrial animals has gradually entered the muscle tissue structure and the microcellular energy utilisation process aiello et al 2018 chen et al 2019 more accurate mathematical models are required to provide a theoretical basis for the design of underwater and land driven robot structures the organisms in nature usually have rigid and flexible structures in which they are characterised by compact structures agile motion a high energy utilisation efficiency and enhancing the motion performance and environmental adaptability salazar et al 2018 in addition the organism can dynamically adjust the flexibility of the limb by changing the muscle state as a result it can achieve efficient movement in different environments whereas the existing bionic amphibious robots mostly adopt rigid structures researchers at yale university have developed new limbs with a variable stiffness which provides a new design scheme for rigid flexible structures baines et al 2020 they used composite materials and a soft actuator fea in addition they changed the state of the limbs between leg and flipper configurations by varying the electrical input to the flexible heater in the fabric sleeve as shown in fig 12 it is an important development direction for amphibious bionic robots to design rigid flexible structures by improving the existing mechanical drive structures or using soft actuators such as fea de and sma the extremely limited energy and low energy utilisation efficiency restrict the applications of bionic amphibious robots from the perspective of broadening the sources of income and reducing the expenditure on the one hand it is necessary for bionic amphibious robots to carry batteries with a higher energy density and to improve the outdoor energy collection capacity the environmental energy which can be collected and utilized by robots mainly includes solar energy wind energy wave energy and tidal energy yu et al 2018b the working environment of bionic amphibious robots covers land and sea and they can collect a variety of environmental energy according to their working environment and their own structural characteristics the application of a soft actuator dielectric elastomer generator for ocean buoys provides a method for bionic amphibious robots to collect energy outdoors chiba et al 2008 in this case a dielectric elastomer generator is attached to a rotating waterwheel via a crankshaft which harvests the energy of the ocean waves and it supplies power to the ocean buoys on the other hand to improve the efficiency of the energy utilisation some methods can be adopted which includes optimising the task route switching the optimal modes and closing the redundant sensors to improve the adaptability of the bionic amphibious robots to land and underwater they usually have several motion modes to deal with the different medium environments this requires a variety of sensors to monitor the environment and their own state quantity due to the complex and changeable working environment airborne sensors need to have a higher sensitivity and stability just like fish that sense changes in the flow through the lateral line by integrating the sensory organs with the body the lobster robot integrates the flow sensors that are designed for micro mechanical structures into the robot s feet to make the robot more compact chalmers 2000 in the future design of amphibious bionic robots it is necessary to develop micro electro mechanical sensors that are suitable for them in an amphibious working environment asadnia et al 2014 kottapalli et al 2016 while ensuring the accuracy the volume of airborne sensors needs to be reduced to realise the integrated design of the structure and perception fig 13 presents a new biomimetic tactile and slip sensor by using piezoelectric sensors with microstructures which can play an important role in robot perception systems and provide new ideas for the sensor design jiang et al 2019b the subsequent development of bionic amphibious robots requires more application of modern control methods such as fuzzy control neural networks and genetic algorithms researchers have begun to study the speed gait and energy consumption of robot platforms in different environments e g underwater pavement grassland wetland beach etc zhong et al 2018 dey et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 however only a few studies have looked at motion parameter switching and the autonomous motion mode adjustment under different environments therefore modern control methods should be used to enhance the stability of the robots in different environments as well as the ability of modal switching control for robots with soft actuators researchers have developed a new family of bending and helical extensile pams and realized precise control guan et al 2020 in future based on the accurate motion of the soft actuators it is necessary to apply modern control theory to soft robots in addition high precision sensors should be integrated into the robot system to achieve autonomous multi modal motion of the robots on land and underwater in recent years artificial intelligence has been widely used in the robotics industry wu et al 2018 for bionic amphibious robots new intelligent control methods such as reinforcement learning and deep learning can help improve the adaptability and robustness of the robots in the field environment and enhance their autonomous decision making ability hwangbo et al 2019 the information collected by the sensors is processed by onboard processors in addition the operation strategies such as mode switching path planning data transmission and large scale network communication should be adjusted in time to achieve a true sense of bionic intelligent control 8 conclusion after a long period of natural selection organisms have evolved highly adaptive structures to the natural environment which provides a new idea for the study of amphibious robots recently bionic structures bionic materials and other cutting edge research achievements have been applied to bionic amphibious robots and their excellent performances have shown broad application prospects this paper offers a comprehensive review of the current status of bionic amphibious robots this review emphasises the driving mechanisms of the aquatic and terrestrial motion modes the classification of the bionic amphibian robots the actuators energy and control methods as well as the existing deficiencies of the bionic amphibious robots future bionic amphibious robots will be able to simplify the amphibious drive structures by using soft actuators they will improve the energy utilisation efficiency they should be able to perceive the environment and have the ability to make autonomous decisions finally future studies on bionic amphibious robots will focus on providing them with bionic and intelligent directions funding this work

20871,this paper reviews the state of the art research progress of large scale model at sea measurements in relation to ship resistance propulsion manoeuvrability seakeeping and structural loads physical experiments have long been an indispensable tool in the research of ship hydrodynamics and structural loads to date a substantial number of experiments including tank model tests and full scale measurements have been extensively conducted and reported in the recent years an alternative experimental approach namely large scale model measurement has been paid special attention in order to better understand some strongly nonlinear fluid structure interaction problems and rarely occurring events on ships in realistic and complex ocean environment the review on large scale seakeeping and wave loads experiments is undertaken by extensively referring related work conducted worldwide challenges and recommendations towards further developing and refining large scale model measurement techniques are also reported and discussed keywords ship hydrodynamics seakeeping wave loads structural response tank model test full scale sea trial large scale model test 1 introduction the problems of ship hydrodynamics and structural loads have long been of great interest to both the industry and academic research due to the complexity of interaction between water waves and arbitrary shape moving floating structures in the presence of free surface and forward speed no perfect numerical model has been proposed yet even though great progresses and fruitful achievements have been made in the past decades hirdaris et al 2014 the classical potential flow theory which mainly includes 2d strip theory korvin kroukovsky and jacobs 1957 salvesen et al 1970 rajendran et al 2015 2 5d high speed slender body theory faltinsen and zhao 1991 wang et al 2018a and 3d panel theory ganesan and sen 2015 bishop et al 1986 datta and guedes soares 2020 have been established to solve both rigid body motions and hydroelastic responses of ship without or with forward speed in both frequency and time domain hirdaris and temarel 2009 ittc 2008 2011a 2014 2017 issc 2012 2015 2018 thanks to the dramatic advances of computer science and technology in the recent years the numerical wave tank techniques have attracted great interest from researchers the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods making use of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are becoming increasingly popular and mature hirdaris et al 2016 mousaviraad et al 2015 wang et al 2019a islam and guedes soares 2018 2019 this is also evident from the increasing number of commercial and open source software packages such as ansys fluent cfx flow 3d star ccm ls dyna openfoam and cfdship iowa however due to the excessive computational cost of cfd tools they are still reserved for niche applications rather than wide engineering applications in addition to the numerical methods physical experiments constitute an indispensable tool in the scientific community experiments are conducted for different purposes such as full scale performance prediction numerical method validation and new physical phenomena exploration the world first physical basin for ship model testing was built by william froude in 1872 then many state of the art tank facilities have been built all over the world till now tank model tests have been widely applied for the investigation of ship hydrodynamics and wave loads which mainly includes resistance and propulsion manoeuvrability and seakeeping structural response and slamming loads the advantages of tank model tests are obvious for example the wind and wave environment in the laboratory are well controlled and reproducible the time and cost are relatively economic compared with full scale measurement however there are some limitations associated with the tank model tests in some aspects for example the artificially generated waves in the tank are not real as the wind forcing is not present zhang et al 2017 the reynolds scale effects are obvious and the model sailing range is limited jiao et al 2016a full scale measurements are believed to be the most authentic and reliable method to obtain ship hydrodynamic responses in seaways traditionally full scale sea trials are mainly conducted during delivery stage for checking contract requirements such as velocity and manoeuvrability performance full scale measurement data for ship seakeeping and wave loads are relatively scarce especially for ship operating in harsh weather fortunately with the development of global positioning system gps satellite remote sensing and intelligent monitoring technologies nunez et al 2017 perera et al 2012 lee et al 2010 more and more commercial and military ships are equipped with permanent monitoring systems to record the ship s operational data and responses to the current environment for the up to date decision making and long term improvements to design and simulation tools review of the related work of full scale measurement can be found in the past ittc seakeeping committees ittc 2008 2011a 2014 2017 and issc loads committees issc 2012 2015 2018 although full scale measurement provides invaluable data for what really happened in real vessel operations it is however complex expensive and time consuming moreover even though investigation on ship responses in extremely severe sea states is interesting and significant the related full scale experiments would pose a major threat to the safety of crew and ship furthermore the timing of the occurrence of the extreme sea states in full scale conditions and the realization of the tests would not be easy to synchronize thus full scale sea trials cannot be widely applied for scientific research and practice engineering application and resource has to be made to model tests for extreme wave loads guedes soares et al 2006 2008 due to the inherent limitations associated with the laboratory tank model test and full scale sea trial an alternative experimental technique which includes conducting large scale model test in realistic sea conditions has been proposed and developed in the recent years large scale model tests are usually conducted prior to the design and construction of full scale ship which significantly derisks new technology and commercial costs in some sense this testing approach is a compromise between laboratory tank test and full scale sea trial and also provides obvious advantages over them in some aspects for instance the experimental environment is more realistic than laboratory tank environment since the wind driven sea waves are more complex and real and they are associated with obviously nonlinear characteristics such as short crestedness broad frequency strong randomness sharp crest and flat trough behavior in particular for storm sea states guedes soares et al 2004 campos et al 2018 the six degree of freedom 6 dof motions of free running model at sea are fully coupled without any constraint caused by mechanical seaworthiness instrument used in the laboratory large models can be also tested with their superstructures bilge keels and fin stabilizers so that the wind and current effects are being taken into account the reynolds scale effects can be reduced by using large models which will be of great significance for the investigations of scale effects in ship resistance propulsion and manoeuvrability moreover the tank wall effects and blockage effects do not exist at sea the sea surface is large enough thus the large scale self propelled model is possible to run in a relative open area at any heading angle which will be of great helpful for manoeuvrability and seakeeping investigations more wave samples can be recorded by a model in one run during seakeeping sea trials and this is important for data statistical analysis of irregular waves some strongly nonlinear fluid structure interaction fsi problems and rarely occurring events such as ship large amplitude motion bow stern emergence high speed of advance slamming and whipping green water on deck can be hardly satisfactorily reproduced by tank model test although relatively good accuracy can be obtained as these events are inertia dominated large scale model sea trials are alternative experimental method for such investigations although it is very difficult to have sea trials in really heavy weather the conduct of large scale model measurements is much cheaper compared with full scale sea trials on the other hand testing large scale model at sea avoids the utilization of large and expensive towing tank facilities such as carriage and wave maker which may have a tight working time schedule and are not available at any time the model can be fully utilized since almost all kinds of standard hydrodynamic tests can be conducted with an elaborate designed large scale model the tests could include stability floodability resistance propulsion manoeuvrability seakeeping wave loads slamming and whipping loads and even underwater explosion the aim of this paper is to present an overview of the advances in the development of large scale model at sea measurements and shed light on its potential opportunities and challenges currently existing publications regarding large scale model measurement are scarce and even when available they are usually incomplete only a few crucial naval and commercial ships have been tested through large scale measurement technique fortunately in the recent years increasing efforts are being devoted towards adopting and refining this kind of testing technique due to its unique advantages this paper reviews the state of the art of large scale model measurement techniques especially the seakeeping and wave loads experiments and also explores their potential applications in different kinds of typical hydrodynamic experiments the structure of this paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the research background and significance section 2 gives a brief overview of calm water related large scale model experiments which include ship resistance propulsion and manoeuvrability measurements section 3 reviews the large scale model seakeeping measurements and summarizes the related critical technique problems and data analysis methods section 4 reviews the large scale model measurements for wave loads and structural responses section 5 discusses the experimental uncertainty in relation to large scale model at sea measurements section 6 presents main conclusions and recommendations from this review 2 large scale experiments in calm seas the majority of the experimental measurements and cfd simulations for ship resistance propulsion manoeuvrability and seakeeping have focused on model scale the practical limitations of matching both reynolds and froude scales simultaneously in model scale are well known for example for ship scale the reynolds number is of the order of 109 but the value is usually of the order of 107 for model scale it is well known that the reynolds scaling effect has significant influence on the ship hydrodynamics when viscous effects are relevant even though various extrapolation methodologies have been proposed to predict full scale hydrodynamic performance from model scale results and satisfactory results can be obtained direct measurements and calculations of large or full scale ship s hydrodynamic performance are still necessary especially for investigating scale effects and improving extrapolation methodologies since model testing for ship resistance propulsion and manoeuvrability in natural open water environment are relatively common the research progress of large scale model tests for these purposes are briefly reviewed in this section 2 1 ship resistance and propulsion typical test for ship speed includes ship resistance test propeller open water test and self propulsion test testing condition for ship resistance generally includes naked model resistance and appended resistance tests the full scale resistance is usually extrapolated by the 2d froude s method or the 3d form factor method from the scaled model testing results the ship model self propulsion tests generally include self propulsion test in a gravity tank and free running model test however extrapolating self propulsion results from model scale to full scale is problematic due to the inherently different flow conditions near the propeller according to the ittc recommendation procedures and guidelines of resistance test ittc 2011b experimental models should generally be as large as possible for the size of the towing tank taking into consideration the wall blockage and finite depth effects as well as model mass and the maximum speed of towing carriage visonneau et al 2016 performed cfd simulations for the japan bulk carrier jbc and showed significant differences in flow field at the stern between model and full scale similar differences were also observed by castro et al 2011 who performed cfd calculations of self propulsion simulations on a kcs containership at full scale and model scale hua et al 2011 investigated roll damping and the related scale effects of a french frigate by four different scales model experiments including full scale measurement and numerical calculations heinke and hellwig rieck 2011 investigated the reynolds scale effect on the flow around the appendages and on the inflow to the propeller by a containership equipped with wake equalizing duct wed and the vortex generator fins vgf through cfd simulation full scale measurements are conducted to get better understandings of ship resistance and propulsion trägärdh et al 2005 conducted a comprehensive open water model test with a 1 42 scaled model to investigate aspects of resistance propulsion manoeuvrability and cavitation performance full scale sea trials were also conducted which well confirmed the results by model tests kayano et al 2013 performed full scale experiments using a training ship of length overall 105 m in order to investigate its propulsion performance characteristics in actual seas guiard et al 2013 proposed a full scale design for a pre swirl duct by using cfd code and the computed results are expected to be validated by full scale test data ouchi 1989 reported comparative analyses of the sea trial results of 11 ships against their model testing results the results indicated considerable scale effects between the model and actual measurements such that the efficiency gain at full scale could be two to three times that at the model scale even though cfd techniques have been validated extensively by developers and researchers most of the cfd simulations are conducted in model scale mainly due to the following two reasons i lack of experimental results in large and full scale for numerical validation ii complexity of numerical codes at very high reynolds numbers such as turbulence modelling gorski et al 2004 hanninen and mikkola 2006 with the increase of computing efficiency of computers there is a trend to perform large or full scale cfd numerical simulations in attempt to reduce reynolds scale effects castro et al 2011 performed full scale cfd simulation of a self propelled kcs containership with direct discretization of the propeller tezdogan et al 2015 performed a fully nonlinear unsteady rans simulation to predict ship motions and added resistance of a full scale kriso containership bhushan et al 2009 conducted model and full scale unsteady rans simulations of ship power seakeeping and manoeuvrability and investigated the scale effects on the results of different models wang et al 2015 solved the viscous flow fields around a 4000 teu containership at different scales by rans method and investigated the scale effect of nominal wake of the single screw ship jasak et al 2019 compared full scale cfd simulations with sea trial measurements of two self propelled ships the lloyd s register technical investigation department lr tid performed full scale measurements of ship speed engine power shaft speed propeller thrust and torque on a medium range tanker for the purpose of validating full scale cfd predictions ponkratov and zegos 2014 2015 islam et al 2021 have compared predicted propulsion power for a 64teu inland container vessel from full scale and model scale cfd simulations at different operating conditions illustrating the problems of scale it is not the objective of this paper to discuss ship cfd techniques but more available experimental data of large and full scale ship hydrodynamics would not only shed some more light on the influence of scaling effects on the extrapolation outcome but also be used for improving cfd codes the cavitation phenomena are widely investigated to evaluate ship propeller performance sampson et al 2015 made a comparison of full scale and 1 3 5 model scale cavitation for a deep v catamaran research vessel a high speed camera was used to record the propeller cavitation phenomena and a good correlation between the full scale and model scale observations was observed in terms of the types strength and dynamic behaviour of the cavitation kleinwachter et al 2015 studied about piv as a novel full scale measurement technique in cavitation research the novel piv technique is well suited to recording wake field velocity data at full scale grigoropoulos and katsaounis 2004 mentioned that during large scale model measurements video recording of areas of specific interest for example above propeller disks can be performed using special miniature cameras recently a joint research project in china has been undertaken by the shanghai ship and shipping research institute sssri in collaboration with the harbin engineering university heu the marine design research institute of china maric and the china ship scientific research center cssrc a series of large scale sea trial activities for resistance propulsion manoeuvrability and seakeeping of a 230 000 dwt bulk carrier were designed and conducted in the year 2018 the main objective of the large scale model tests is to evaluate and validate the newly developed energy saving device esd and also investigate the energy saving efficiency in different scales and finally develop a full scale extrapolation method for energy saving efficiency evaluation a 1 13 large scale model was made by fiber reinforced plastic frp and the model is about 25 m long and 115 tonnes heavy strong transverse frames are provided inside the hull shell to strengthen its stiffness and resist deformation of the hull the model is equipped with its superstructure and esd in order to account for wind and current resistance a conventional five bladed propeller and single rudder were designed for self propulsion tests the shaft line is equipped with a dynamometer for the measurements of propeller torque and thrust loads more parameters of the model can be found in table 2 by referring the model i general view of the large scale model measurement is shown in fig 1 lin et al 2020 reported a comprehensive testing system to assess the resistance and propulsion performance of the 25 m long ship model in actual seas fig 2 shows the layout of the ship model the propulsion system of the model comprises a console generator integrated cabinet servomotor reduction gear broken shaft type self propulsion instrument two couplings and a shaft and propeller on the bottom platform of the stern room the rotating speed of the propeller can be controlled as required the broken shaft type self propulsion instrument can simultaneously measure the thrust and torque of the propeller of the ship model with a high accuracy both towing test and self propulsion test were conducted and the related data processing method and testing results are presented in the paper guo et al 2020 conducted self propulsion test for propulsion performance using the same large scale model and the effects of complex wake field environments on the propulsion performance are studied using the equal thrust and equal torque method with the measurement data of the same model su et al 2020a investigated the influence of pre swirl stator and rudder bulb system on the propulsion performance of the large scale model zhou et al 2020 studied the uncertainty of the ship model propulsion test using the large scale model measurement data and the influence of the test environment was quantified almost all the existing large or full scale resistance and propulsion measurements in open waters are conducted by free running ships which implies that the ship resistance and propeller performance are investigated with propeller hull interaction effects as a result the large or full scale naked hull resistance and appended resistance measurements are rarely seen in the laboratory tank tests towed model resistance can be measured with the help of the towing carriage however it is difficult to find a plane movement or fixed platform which could act as a reference at sea ré et al 2008 conducted bollard thrust tests of a 5 28 m lifeboat at the dock using a 30 m long rope and in line load cell one end of the rope was attached at the stern pull point of the lifeboat while the other end was attached to the dock s bollard they also conducted towed test with the help of another ship to roughly estimate the calm water resistance but without considering the wake of the towing ship one of the special aims of the 230 000 dwt bulk carrier large scale model resistance trials is to determine the naked hull resistance and appended resistance for this purpose two testing schemes can be used and they are depicted in fig 3 the first scheme includes towing the model with a pair of ships by forming a y type fleet tension in the cables can be measured by force sensors the relative position of the three ships is pre determined according to the speed and drag force so as to minimize the interference of wake generated by the two towing ships this scheme however requires that the two towing ships operating fully consistent with each other which is very difficult to realize the second scheme includes adopting a large anchored ship to act as fixing base and towing the model with the help of a winch another cable is used to attach the model s stern with a gravity weight that supported by a pulley fixed on bollard to ensure model s course stability the latter scheme was adopted for the large scale model towing tests and proved to be feasible by lin et al 2020 it is noted that the horizontal towing point should be set at model s centre of gravity cog so that the model s sinkage and trim are unrestrained however in the above reference the towing point on model was at bow and stern to overcome this problem a towing scheme for large scale model resistance measurement at sea is proposed in the patent large scale ship model resistance measurement system 1 1 patent application no cn201911030003 9 granted chinese invention patent a method for acting towing forcing on cog of model with the help of wire rope winch and convex structure and the related measurement for resistance and sinkage and trim of hull is documented in the patent which is shown in fig 4 2 2 ship manoeuvrability ship manoeuvring experiments can be conducted by captive model tests or free running model tests sutulo and guedes soares 2004 wang et al 2020 captive model tests are conducted by forcing a scale model to move in a prescribed manner in laboratory tank with facilities such as rotating arm and planar motion mechanism pmm to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives of ships free running manoeuvring tests can be conducted by scaled model or full scale ship full scale manoeuvring trials are widely conducted by designers and operators especially at ship delivery stage the tests are usually performed in deep unrestricted water under calm environment conditions ship motion parameters are measured by instruments such as gps system typical free running manoeuvring tests include turning circle test zigzag test spiral test pull out test and stopping test sutulo and guedes soares 2011 zhang et al 2015 used the full scale sea trial data of yukun vessel to validate their proposed manoeuvring identification algorithm guedes soares et al 2004 conducted full scale manoeuvring trials on a fast patrol vessel and guedes soares et al 1999 performed manoeuvring tests in a catamaran which were then compared with the results of captive model tests sutulo and guedes soares 2006 bekker et al 2014 performed full scale manoeuvring measurements on a polar supply and research vessel during ice trials you et al 2018 proposed a new approach to predict the actual revolution per minute rpm and engine power of an lng carrier from full scale measurement data considering the described performance the reynolds scale effects could be obvious in small scale manoeuvring tests suzuki et al 2019 proposed an extrapolation method for full scale ship manoeuvring motions from free running model test with consideration of the operational limit of an engine ueno and tsukada 2016 proposed a method to estimate full scale propeller torque and thrust consisting of low frequency and high frequency components in waves by free running model test jin et al 2016 investigated the influence of ship model size on manoeuvring hydrodynamic coefficients by rans simulation of a kriso very large crude carrier kvlcc2 it was concluded that the full scale ship has a relatively smaller turbulence wake region after the hull when compared with model scale conditions and the scale effects are evident in the surge and sway forces but found to be less influential in the yaw moment performing manoeuvring tests with large scale free running models in natural environment have been undertaken by some designers and researchers such experiments are commonly conducted especially with submarine seaplane autonomous underwater vehicle auv and unmanned surface vehicle usv corato et al 2014 wang et al 2019b serter 1993 reported manoeuvring tests of radio controlled high speed military models in a swiss lake mu et al 2018 conducted manoeuvring tests with a 7 m long usv which is equipped with a single vector propulsion device in calm sea surface coraddu et al 2013 conducted large scale free running model of a twin screw ship in a volcanic lake to investigate the asymmetric propeller functioning phenomenon a 7 2 m long large model of a twin screw twin rudder naval ship was manufactured see fig 5 tests were carried out in correspondence to three different simplified control strategies i e constant rpm constant torque and constant power guo et al 2020 conducted large scale model manoeuvring tests which include turning circle test and zig zag test using the model shown in fig 1 typical manoeuvring testing results are shown in fig 6 fossati et al 2015 reported a full scale sailing yacht laboratory and measured the motions and loads on a 10 m long sailing yacht in wind conditions it can be concluded that the experimental setup for large scale free running model manoeuvring trials in open waters are similar to those in the laboratory tank however gps and inertial measurement unit imu devices are usually necessary for the open water trials and this is described in section 3 4 perera et al 2015 have used gps and imu in autonomous ship models of 3 m and 4 m long in an oceanic pool to assess anti collision manoeuvers while hinostroza et al 2021 have used the same models for testing manoeuvres in formation 3 large scale seakeeping experiments ships require good seakeeping performance to fulfill their designated missions the prediction of ship seakeeping performance is an integral part at ship design stage the majority of the seakeeping tests are routinely carried out in laboratory tanks where it is possible to control the experimental setup to a high degree and variables can be monitored relatively easily as a result researchers have a wealth of methods to know ship hydrodynamic behaviour in tank waves the ship environment adaptability research center searc at heu has long been devoted to investigating ship seakeeping behaviour in harsh environment through the decade long comparative investigations between tank experiments and full scale sea trials cai et al 2003a 2003b it was found that the ship seakeeping behaviour in actual sea waves can be quite different from that reproduced in the laboratory tank even though the reynolds scale effects is not a main effect in tank model seakeeping tests since the fluid viscous force has less effect on ship s vertical motions compared with inertia force in europe several joint projects have been made to study the behaviour of ships in extreme storms leading also to important set of results of good quality vasquez et al 2016 rajendran et al 2016b in korea several similar tests in harsh environment have been conducted as described in kim and kim 2016 despite the good results obtained in laboratory there was a motivation to conduct large scale model seakeeping tests at sea mainly due to the realism of wind wave environment lloyd 1989 briefly outlined the concept of conducting open water model seakeeping experiments in a professional book of seakeeping he suggested the model dimension ratio to be selected of the order of 10 ship motion instrumentation similar to that employed in full scale sea trials can be used for large scale test and motor speed setting and steering can be achieved by radio control he also pointed out that the full scale wave spectrum should be reproduced at model scale according to the similitude laws which is often difficult to realize this therefore generally dictates the seakeeping test area in sheltered water with limited fetch he concluded that large scale experiments have an intrinsic appeal for their apparent realism and they are certainly much cheaper than full scale trials however the book is mainly focus on seakeeping theory and tank model and full scale tests no further information regarding large scale model trial are provided in this section the large scale seakeeping measurements are summarized and discussed the content mainly includes the research progress of ship seakeeping in short crested waves the worldwide conducted large scale model seakeeping tests and the most related key technical issues 3 1 ship responses in short crested waves the realistic ocean waves where full scale ship operates are associated with characteristics such as randomness and short crestedness guedes soares 1984 lucas et al 2011 however the traditional numerical and experimental seakeeping investigations mainly focus on ship motions and loads in long crested or uni directional waves in fact the directionality of waves can significantly influence the motions and loads experienced by ships and offshore structures teixeira and guedes soares 2009 for example it may lead to a reduction of the loads and increase of structure life which consequently results in saving the steel weight and manufacture costs therefore a better understanding of ship motions and loads in short crested waves and their difference compared with in long crested waves will be of great helpful for highlighting the importance of conducting large scale model sea trials the wave loads acting on fixed structures in multi directional waves have been investigated in the early years nwogu 1985 numerically investigate the effects of wave directionality on the motions and loads of infinitely long structures such as fixed breakwater or floating bridges nwogu 1989 studied the wave forces and motions on fixed and floating structures in random multi directional waves by spectral methods experiments were also conducted to study the forces on a fixed segmented vertical cylinder and a moored floating barge in random multi directional waves sannasiraj et al 1995 studied the hydrodynamic behaviour of 2d horizontal freely floating structures in multi directional waves by linear transfer function approach the motions and forces on a rectangular floating structure experiencing unidirectional and multi directional waves were calculated wang 2006 studied the wave forces on a fixed long semi circular breakwater in both long and short crested random waves numerically and experimentally song and tao 2007 and liu et al 2012 investigated the general 3d short crested wave interaction with a concentric two cylinder system which is surface piercing and bottom mounted by linear potential theory ong et al 2013 provided a practical stochastic method to estimate the maximum equilibrium scour around a vertical pile exposed to long and short crested nonlinear random waves plus a current ji et al 2015a investigated the interaction of multi directional irregular waves with a large vertical bottom mounted cylinder by wave tank test it was found that the effect of the wave directionality is more obvious on transverse force than on normal force ji et al 2015b investigated the wave run up and wave loads acting on an array of circular bottom mounted vertical cylinders in short crested waves by both linear superposition theory and tank experiment xu et al 2019 solved the 3d time domain second order stokes wave diffracting problem by desingularized boundary integral equation method dbiem and the interaction between multi directional waves and a single upright fixing cylinder was studied they concluded that the second order forces on structure in multi directional waves are much greater than in unidirectional waves while the difference in first order forces is ignorable till now the short crested wave models have not been commonly used in the prediction of ship seakeeping performance naess 1990 developed a general theory for statistical analysis of nonlinear second order forces and motions of offshore structures in short crested random seas li and wen 2007 predicted the motion responses of a fpso in short crested waves by linear frequency spectral analysis method they concluded that the amplitude of roll and pitch motions of the fpso in short crested waves is less sensitive to the change of wave heading compared with in long crested waves chen et al 2011 predicted ship motion responses in both long and short crested irregular waves by 3d rankine source based potential flow theory in time domain renaud et al 2008 investigated the second order wave loads on a lng carrier in regular cross waves monochromatic but coming from two directions separated by 90 deg and bichromatic cross waves both numerically and experimentally see fig 7 they concluded that the interaction effect between waves from different headings is very important and should be taken into account in the estimation of excitation loads to mooring systems pessoa et al 2013 studied experimentally and numerically the first order and slowly varying motions of a floating body in bichromatic waves obtaining good agreement jiao and huang 2020 jiao et al 2021 and huang et al 2021 studied the seakeeping performance and slamming loads of a s175 containership in bi directional cross waves using cfd and compared with that in uni directional regular waves see fig 8 lee et al 2007 analysed the hydroelastic responses of a ship advancing in multi directional irregular waves by combination of 3d source distribution method dynamic response analysis and spectral analysis method publications reporting ship hydrodynamic experiments in short crested irregular waves are scarce this is partly due to the lack of laboratories capable of generating short crested waves and inadequate measurement of directional spectra in the past decades a number of laboratory tanks which are equipped with segmented wave generators capable of producing directional waves have been built ittc 2008 2011a 2014 2017 for example the actual sea model basin at the national maritime research institute nmri of japan is equipped with a total of 382 segmented flap type absorbing wave makers along the entire periphery except in front of the trim tank see fig 9 a the new wave maker at the maneuvering and seakeeping basin of carderock division naval surface warfare center nswc consists of 216 paddles 108 paddles along the long wall of the tank 60 paddles in the curve and 48 paddles along the short wall see fig 9b the wave maker is capable of regular and irregular seas multi component long and short crested seaways generating the deep water basin at heu has a dimension of 50 m long by 30 m wide by 10 m deep and has the capacity of generating multi directional waves the wave maker comprises 75 paddles which are located at one boundary of the tank see fig 9c maeda et al 1986 conducted tank experiments on motions of a floating body in two directional waves from rectangle each other and pointed out the interesting phenomena of slow drift oscillation of a moored floating body in the bi directional waves takezawa and hirayama 1989 takezawa et al 1989 and takezawa et al 1990 conducted a series of towed model tests in a long tank where the directional spectrum waves can be generated by a snake type wave maker to investigate the ship motions in directional waves ding et al 2019 studied the influence of inhomogeneous incident waves different significant wave heights mean periods and directions caused by seashore islands and reefs on hydroelastic motions and loads of very large floating structure vlfs by hydroelasticity theory and tank experiment zheng et al 2009a 2009b and chen 2011 investigated a ship model s heave roll pitch and vertical accelerations in both long and short crested waves by conducting tests in the seakeeping basin of cssrc where the tank dimension is 69 m long by 46 m wide by 4 m deep a wave probe array which comprises five wave probes was used to measure the short crested waves frequency and time domain numerical methods were also used to simulate ship motion responses in short and long crested irregular waves table 1 summarizes the ratio coefficients of roll pitch and heave responses of ship in short crested waves to those in long crested waves under equivalent sea state the same significant wave height and mean period based on theoretical calculation and tank model experiment results zheng et al 2009b they concluded that ship heave and pitch motions in short crested waves are generally greater than in equivalent long crested waves for head wave condition however this conclusion goes against with those drawn by li and wen 2007 and jiao et al 2019a jiao et al 2019a conducted a comparative study on ship motions and loads in short crested irregular waves by hydroelasticity theory small scale model towing tank test and large scale model sea trial the influence of directional function of short crested waves on ship statistical values of motions and loads for different wave headings β 0 deg denotes head wave are shown in fig 10 the results are obtained by combining frequency domain hydrodynamic theory and 2d spectral analysis the involved directional function is expressed as follows 1 d ω θ γ n 2 1 π γ n 2 1 2 cos n θ π 2 θ π 2 where θ denotes the angle between component wave and dominant wave direction γ denotes gama function n denotes positive integer rousset et al 2010 conducted segmented model tank tests in directional irregular waves the pitch motion of model in head short crested waves without speed was found to be slightly reduced compared with in long crested waves under the same significant wave height and mean period 3 2 overview of typical large scale models the publicly reported experimental models and data analyses for large scale model seakeeping tests are limited due to various reasons including confidentiality large scale model test is usually conducted by some advanced organizations especially those involved in naval applications in the recent years increasing efforts are being devoted by naval engineers and researchers towards adopting and refining this kind of testing technique the representative large scale models as far as the authors knowledge concerned are summarized in table 2 where the symbol x denotes unknown the models are briefly described as follows in the 1980s the french navy conducted a series of sea trials with a 1 12 large scale manned model about 22 m long and 20 tonnes mass denoted by model a of aircraft carrier charles de gaulle anon 1994 which is shown in fig 11 some typical devices such as fin stabilizer and transverse stabilization system were fitted on the model for testing the main objective of the large model test was to validate and improve its dedicated platform stabilization system in harsh waves so as to provide a stable platform for aircraft take off and landing faou and boudon 1997 a series of tests with respect to manoeuvrability seakeeping and propeller performance were conducted by the model in seaways which lasted for over two years the us navy developed a large steel model of destroyer ddg 1000 quintana et al 2007 grogan and borthen 2010 haas et al 2014 the 1 4 large scale model model b is about 45 m long 6 m wide and with a light ship displacement of over 90 tonnes the model was used for a variety of seakeeping and structural response measurements and finally used for underwater explosion and floodability tests the 1 4 large scale model as well as full scale and tank test model are shown in fig 12 detailed experimental information and data analysis regarding the two naval ship models are not found grigoropoulos and katsaounis 2004 reported the measurement procedure and methodology of large scale model seakeeping test at sea in their work a large scale corvette model model c as shown in fig 13 was made and tested in coastal waves the model track was monitored by a real time kinematics rtk system and motion responses were measured by an in house developed 6 dof system which consists of seven uni axial accelerometers grigoropoulos and politis 1999 a small diameter discus buoy was used to measure the directional wave spectrum the paper briefly describes the design specification instrumentation and preparation of large scale seakeeping tests as well as its advantages and shortcomings the potential applications on propulsion manoeuvrability structural loads tests by using this model are also discussed however analysis of the measured data by the large scale model is not presented shi 2007 zhao 2008 wang 2009 and sun et al 2010 made the first attempt of conducting large scale model s seakeeping tests in natural sea wave environment in china two large scale models see fig 14 were built for sea trials after a series of hull form optimization work conducted by numerical calculations zhang and li 2007 li and zhang 2008 and tank model tests li et al 2008 sun et al 2014 one traditional round bilge type hull model d was used to act as a reference ship and the other model is the newly developed deep v type hull model e which corresponds to the optimal scheme the main objective of the project was to research and develop novel naval ship with excellent rapidity and seakeeping performance another objective of the large scale measurement was to validate the effectiveness of the developed semi submerged bow ssb mounted on the deep v hull for vertical motion stabilization jiao et al 2018a comparatively analysed the seakeeping performance of the two monohulls by 2 5d theoretical calculation small scale tank test and large scale sea trial several years later two large scale segmented models were designed built and tested for seakeeping and wave loads by the same research team at heu jiao et al 2016a 2016b the two models around 12 m long and 4 tonnes mass are much larger than the previously developed models see fig 15 one large scale model model f was mainly tested for seakeeping performance and it was divided into two pieces by the midships section a short and strong backbone beam is installed to measure the sectional loads amidships the other large scale model model g was mainly tested for structural loads response and hydroelasticity thus the model was divided into seven parts and they are connected by a backbone beam which well reproduces the modal characteristics of prototype jiao et al 2016c further description of the two segmented models is reported in section 4 3 3 reproduction of full scale ocean waves it is essential to reproduce the full scale sea states of interest when conducting seakeeping tests at model scale unlike the laboratory tank wave environment the natural environment where large scale models are tested is however complex and uncontrollable therefore the first fundamental challenge for large scale model seakeeping measurement at sea is to provide an expected wave state which well reproduces full scale sea state moreover accurate measurement and description of the short crested irregular waves experienced by model is another important task of concern this section discusses the wave reproduction and measurement issues 3 3 1 key problem statements the irregular wave state in short term is usually described by the wave spectrum sun et al 2015 reported the measured coastal wave spectra in comparison with the standard ittc and other target spectra the results show that the dimensionless spectra of coastal waves agree well with full scale ocean wave spectra sun et al 2016 in fact the problem of full scale wave reproduction is however much more complex for example even though the dimensionless spectral shape of coastal waves shows good agreement with the target spectra the wave parameters such as significant wave height and characteristic period may not be similar between model and full scale simultaneously jiao et al 2018b as is well known the significant wave height h m and characteristic period t m at model scale are determined by the full scale parameters significant wave height h p and characteristic period t p as per the froude s similitude law 2 h m h p λ 3 t m t p λ where λ denotes model scaling factor an example is illustrated hereunder to explain the difficulty in wave reproduction the north atlantic sea state information is selected as a representative for full scale wave states according to the long term statistical data jiao et al 2019b the probability density distribution of significant wave height h p against zero crossing period t p of the north atlantic sea states is shown in fig 16 according to the data in fig 16 the weighted mean zero crossing periods at different significant wave heights and their cubic polynomial fitting curve are presented in fig 17 a histogram is also displayed in the figure to illustrate the occurrence probability of each significant wave height in this sea area suppose that large scale model measurements are conducted in the open ocean the model will encounter such a same sea wave environment as full scale in probability the realistic and extrapolated full scale sea states with various model scaling factors λ 1 30 by using froude s similitude law eq 2 3 are shown in fig 18 as is seen the extrapolated wave periods are generally too much greater than the realistic values in addition the difference increases dramatically with the increasing of model scaling factor on the other hand the extrapolated full scale significant wave height may be too high for investigation detailed description of this problem can be found in jiao et al 2018b as shown in fig 19 viselli et al 2015 conducted 1 8 large scale model offshore measurement of a 6 mw semi submersible floating wind turbine offshore prior to full scale construction aiming at derisking full scale commercial projects by providing scaled global motion data in the test similarity in wind force should also be satisfied in addition to wave state thus a turbine with a small rotor diameter was selected to provide correctly scaled thrust loads given the wind conditions at the test site 3 3 2 guidelines for wave reproduction as indicated from the above analysis it is difficult to reproduce full scale sea states when conducting large scale model sea trials in the open ocean fortunately dictate selecting the testing zone near the shore may be possible since the wave heights and periods of coastal waves are generally much lower than those in the open seas lloyd 1989 fonseca et al 2017 lucas et al 2017 jiao et al 2018b analysed comprehensively the possibility of ocean wave reproduction in nearshore coastal areas for large scale model seakeeping tests in the study a total of four judgment criteria i e i spectral shape ii significant wave height iii mean period and iv directional spreading are involved in the similarity analysis of waves using the wave statistical database in puerto rico virgin islands and gulf of maine that provided by the us national data buoy center the paper also summarizes the methodology and framework of large scale model experimental wave selection which is shown in fig 20 the influence of season climate model scaling sea site and offshore distance on the possibility of ocean wave reproduction for large scale model measurement is comprehensively investigated and discussed in the paper jiao et al 2019c analysed the spatial and seasonal distribution of significant wave height and mean period of china coastal waves it was also concluded that the full scale waves could be reproduced at model scale in coastal areas by properly selecting the model scaling experimental sea area climate and weather conditions which provides opportunity for large scale model seakeeping measurement full grasp of the features and principles of coastal waves is necessary for the conduct of large scale model seakeeping measurement in high efficiency jiao et al 2016b planned to establish a database of coastal waves by long term monitoring and statistical regression analysis of the nearshore waves around their large scale model experimental base glejin et al 2016 investigated the directional characteristics of shallow water waves along the southwestern bay of bengal amrutha et al 2017 analysed the long period waves in the nearshore waters of central west coast of india camus et al 2013 presents a global framework to downscale wave reanalysis to coastal areas for wave numerical simulation myrhaug et al 2016 studied the joint distribution of wave height with period this joint distribution was also studied by rodriguez and guedes soares 1999 in sea states characterised by two wave systems guedes soares 1984 emmanouil et al 2016 developed a high resolution atmospheric and wave modeling system to simulate wind speed and direction significant wave height and energy wave period guedes soares and rusu 2013 have developed a high resolution wave forecasting system for the approaches to ports and rusu et al 2011 have used wave spectral models to predict wave characteristics in very shallow water o reilly et al 2016 estimated nearshore wave conditions based on decade long offshore buoy observations along the california coast a wave height collection and statistics methodology of sea waves for seakeeping assessment is presented by parunov et al 2011 malliouri et al 2019 investigated and described the short and long term statistics for short crested waves in deep and intermediate waters the methodology presented in their paper can provide detailed and accurate information on the long term wave climate and joint distributions of significant wave height and mean period ashton et al 2013 measured ocean waves by an array of four directional wave buoys installed in a square formation with side 500 m and analysed the spatial distribution properties 3 3 3 measurement of sea waves sea wave measurement is an essential part of large scale model seakeeping experiment many types of equipments can be used to measure coastal waves such as pressure gauges tsai and tsai 2009 floating buoys ashton and johanning 2015 campos et al 2021 satellite remote sensing queffeulou and bentamy 2007 petrov et al 2019 marine radar izquierdo et al 2004 cheng and chien 2017 lidar harry et al 2018 and underwater acoustic gauges karaev et al 2014 furthermore the directional spectra of sea states can be also estimated from the motion responses of an advancing ship nielsen 2006 pascoal and guedes soares 2008 2009 nielsen and stredulinsky 2012 pascoal et al 2017 nielsen et al 2018 among the above mentioned wave measurement technologies wave buoys are considered to be the best compromise among accuracy ease of handing reliability and cost for ship seakeeping sea trials till now various types of wave buoys have been developed which differ in shape and size as well as methods used for measurement generally large scale buoys can be deployed in oceanic locations while small ones are used for nearshore or coastal wave observation sun et al 2016 reported a vertical acceleration based single point spherical buoy with diameter 0 4 m for coastal wave measurement an iron chain is connected at the bottom of the buoy to lower its barycentre and improve its stability the lower half part of the buoy is immersed in water during measurement it is expected that the buoy moves synchronously with respect to the wave surface vertical elevation whereas the pitch and roll motions are not expected since they would pollute the vertical acceleration signal the developed buoy was used for large scale model seakeeping tests with models d and e for the design of a spherical wave buoy that could accurately respond the coastal wave frequency of interest jiao et al 2018a calculated the motion responses of semi sphere with different diameter induced by unit amplitude regular wave which is shown in fig 21 it is an important task to identify the directional spreading of ocean waves in addition to frequency spectrum even though wave probe arrays are commonly used for short crested waves measurement in laboratory tanks nwogu 1989 they are not applicable for large scale model sea trial since it is difficult to find a fixed platform at sea de vries et al 2003 developed a directional wave rider gps wave buoy which consists of a sphere with a diameter of 0 4 m and a weight of 17 kg see fig 22 a an oblate spheroid type wave buoy was developed by tang and li 2004 to measure the slopes and vertical acceleration of wave surface simultaneously grigoropoulos and katsaounis 2004 developed a flat type wave buoy see fig 22b which could better respond the wave surface roll and pitch motion compared with the oblate spheroid buoy hirakawa et al 2012 developed an ultra small buoy for directional wave measurement see fig 22c the buoy has three floats at the end of tripod and the data collector is located at the center base float the directional spreading function can be estimated from the measured time series data such as surface elevation slopes or velocities by direct fourier transform dft maximum likelihood method mlm maximum entropy method mem and bayesian method from the measured data nwogu 1989 liu et al 2015 conducted both regular and irregular wave tank experiments with three different buoys i e 1 8 and 1 16 scaled wavescan models and a 1 11 25 odas buoy model and a reference wave gauge to investigate whether the wave characteristics can be accurately measured using these buoys the results indicated that the 1 16 scale wavescan buoy model performs better on measuring the wave surface than the 1 8 scale one an additional onboard wave detecting device for the measurement of incident waves at bow area will be very helpful for seakeeping data processing and analysis there are various options available commercially including acoustic and electromagnetic ranging devices a down looking radar has been used in various full scale tests silva et al 2006 and can be seen in the third figure of pascoal et al 2017 a giant wave probe based on electric resistance measurement can also be a feasible alternative extreme short term prediction of ship motions can be made by system identification based methods with incident wave data information zhang and ye 2009 these investigations have potential applications in such as aircraft landing and take off motion compensation ship borne helicopter recovery missile launching cargo transfer between ships huang et al 2014 drennan et al 1994 estimated wave directional spectra by an array of wave staffs equipped on a swath ship and proposed an algorithm for removing the effects of ship motions sun et al 2005 developed a remote sensing method to measure directional waves by three laser altimeters on an aircraft christensen et al 2013 presented a method for measuring one dimensional surface wave spectra using a ship mounted ultrasonic altimeter in combination with a motion correction device see fig 23 yumori 1981 acquired incident wave height by measuring water pressure with a pressure sensor mounted on the underwater hull surface and subtracting ship heave displacement that obtained by double integrating the heave acceleration the obtained incident wave height was then used to predict ship motions with an auto regressive moving average arma algorithm 3 4 remote control and telemetry system since large scale model sea trials are always conducted to investigate ship response in harsh and extreme seas the models are usually designed as unmanned for safety reasons thus motor speed setting and steering are usually achieved by radio control submitted from another escort ship which carries crew and researchers therefore a shipboard remote control and telemetry experimental system is necessary for large scale model measurement the gps and imu technology are generally used for large scale model s navigation and motion measurement at sea this is different from laboratory tank seakeeping test since no reference platform such as towing carriage exists at sea the real time kinematic gps receivers and a fixed base station were used to accurately measure the sinkage trim and roll of full scale ship and the related measurement details as well as data analyses are reported by gourlay and klaka 2007 the large scale model for manoeuvring tests that developed by coraddu et al 2013 was equipped with technical devices including difference global positioning system dgps imu torque and thrusts meters on the propeller axis dynamo tachometers and real time data transmission devices the tests were conducted in a natural volcanic lake which has been included in the official ittc facility data sheet see fig 24 sun et al 2010 and wang 2009 developed a remote control and telemetry system for large scale model seakeeping test for the models d and e the experimental system mainly includes propulsion unit rudder control unit remote control unit emergency rescue unit and data acquisition unit the model speed was roughly estimated from motor rpm and calibration test had been conducted in a calm water river prior to the sea trial the rudder was remotely controlled and steered by a researcher with the help of a suite of worm gear mechanism global motion signal of the model was saved by an onboard data collector which also transmitted the data to the base station arrangement of the technique sensors on the deep v model model e is shown in fig 25 jiao et al 2016a 2016b 2016c 2017a updated the remote control and telemetry system on the basis of the previous system established by sun et al 2010 a dedicated commercial gps ins device was developed to measure the large scale model s sailing trace position speeds and motions at sea the course of model in the seaway was kept intelligently with the help of a commercial autopilot which was produced by the us garmin ltd garmin 2011 radio stations were adopted to facilitate communications between the testing model and the escort yacht during measurement the model s sailing state would be displayed on the screen of a laptop on the escort yacht typical software interfaces are shown in fig 26 framework of the remote control and telemetry system is shown in figs 27 and 28 respectively lin et al 2020 developed a comprehensive test system see fig 29 for large scale ship model measurement in actual sea environment which is mainly used for resistance and propulsion tests but manoeuvrability and seakeeping tests can be also conducted using this system the seakeeping tests are usually conducted with three control strategies sea state sailing speed and heading angle a fleet of three vessels i e the large scale model the auxiliary environment measuring boat and the escort yacht were used for the sea trial measurement jiao et al 2016b during the measurement the escort yacht run together with the testing model and control it by radio signal the environment monitoring boat will be anchored at the centre of model s sailing trace during in situ environment measurement an appropriate sequence of running direction can minimize the gap between the runs and the average distance from the wave buoy the effect of factors that by changing during the trial influence the results can also be minimized johnson 2004 and prini et al 2018 summarized the commonly adopted trajectories in seakeeping sea trials the experimental procedure and trajectory developed by jiao et al 2017a is shown in fig 30 3 5 ship seakeeping response analyses large scale sea trials are valuable in assessing the response of actual ship operating in real irregular seaways they also allow the investigation of strongly nonlinear motion and load effects that are challenging to capture with numerical simulations or tank model tests for the very same reasons the data analysis is challenging and can significantly affect the outcome the most fundamental seakeeping data processing method includes spectral analysis which gives the frequency spectrum and statistical values such as root mean square or significant value of ship motions and loads in short term irregular waves the frequency spectral methods have been widely used for processing full scale and tank test seakeeping data denis and pierson 1953 journée and massie 2001 tello et al 2011 cakici and aydin 2014 maggi et al 1998 compared frequency responses of a customs vessel with length overall 20 m with the results of full scale sea trial 1 12 scaled tank test and strip theory calculation jiao et al 2018a presented comparative dimensionless spectra of heave pitch and bow vertical acceleration of ships models d and e between by large scale model sea trial in short crested waves and small scale model tank test in long crested waves under equivalent sea state level 6 and at head wave speed 24 knots see fig 31 the results indicate that the spectral density of heave and acceleration by small scale model tank test concentrates around the peak frequency with a narrow band distribution while the large scale model s spectral density disperses over a broader frequency range this can be attributed to the 3d effects of sea waves similar results can be found from the testing results of the model g jiao et al 2016a sun et al 2015 concluded that the frequency of green water on deck of the large scale models d and e is respectively 28 and 85 reduced compared with long crested wave tank test results the physical phenomena of green water on the large scale model s deck at sea are more realistic compared with tank test see fig 32 in order to investigate the influence of directional spreading of short crested waves on ship response jiao et al 2016a developed an approximate analysis method which extracts dominant wave components from the overall sea waves and then estimated ship response under the dominant direction waves fig 33 a shows the ratios of statistical significant value for pitch roll bow acceleration stern acceleration and vertical bending moment vbm amidships of small scale model tank test result to that of large scale model sea trial with model g under equivalent sea states fig 33b additionally includes the ship response ratios of small scale model to large scale model that induced by unit amplitude of dominant direction wave it is noted that the large scale model response was processed by dividing the dominant direction significant wave height it was concluded that hull vertical responses when sailing in head short crested waves are mainly induced by the oncoming dominant direction waves the component incident waves even though contributed to the overall wave height have much less effect on hull vertical responses therefore the tank model test in long crested wave could overestimate the response statistical values of ship in a specified sea state compared with the real condition in fact the linear spectral analysis method cannot interpret the nonlinear characteristics of the measured time series such as asymmetry in crest and trough because various spectral components may interact with other components the realistic sea waves and ship large amplitude motion and load responses are associated with certain nonlinearity there is normally a large amount of information hidden in the measurement data from ship model tests zhang 2008 developed a nonlinear spectral analysis method to obtain high order frequency response function and then accurately predict ship nonlinear motions the linear and second order nonlinear frequency response functions are respectively obtained by 4 h 1 ω s x y ω s x x ω 5 h 2 ω 1 ω 2 s x x y ω 1 ω 2 2 s x x ω 1 s x x ω 2 where ω denotes circular frequency the subscript x and y denotes wave input and ship response output e g pitch and heave respectively s xx ω denotes auto spectral density function s xy ω and s xxy ω denotes first order and second order cross spectral density function respectively the estimated linear and nonlinear pitch frequency response functions of the round bilge ship by tank model test and large scale sea trial with model d under equivalent sea state level 5 and at 18 knots are compared in fig 34 zhu and moan 2013 also used nonlinear bi spectral analysis method to evaluate the influence of second harmonics wave loads and nonlinear wave interactions with tank model testing results time domain processing methods are necessary to be adopted for large scale model response analysis michael et al 1983 estimated the heave pitch roll sway and yaw motions of a destroyer by kalman filtering techniques for application in aircraft landing jiao et al 2019d outlined a scheme of full scale response extrapolation method from large scale model measurement data based on system identification the nonlinear auto regressive moving average model with exogenous input narmax algorithm ji et al 2008 is used to identify ship intrinsic time domain response function based on the measured bow incident wave and ship responses and then the ship time domain motion responses can be predicted with any specified input wave information due to the fact that onboard wave meter was not equipped on the authors previously conducted large scale models an example of ship heave and pitch responses extrapolated by the narmax algorithm using tank model data is presented in fig 35 it is noted that the system identification and motion prediction were made using towing tank long crested irregular wave testing data however the effectiveness and stability of the narmax algorithm in application for ship operating in short crested wave or oblique wave cases should also be further investigated even though the bow incident wave can be measured by the technique introduced in section 3 3 3 sun et al 2009 and zhang et al 2008 predicted ship nonlinear frequency response function by combing narmax algorithm with harmonic probing method wilson 1981 and also compared the results with those by high order spectral analysis method su et al 2020b proposed a real time ship vertical acceleration prediction algorithm based on the long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent units gru models of a recurrent neural network and the proposed method is used to predict the vertical acceleration of the large scale model model i at sea 4 structural loads and response experiments the structural response and elastic deformation of large ships operating in harsh waves should also be of concern to the designers and operators full scale sea trials are believed to be the most realistic and reliable method to obtain the loads behaviour and responses of ships which have been increasingly reported in the past issc loads committees issc 2012 2015 2018 a number of full scale measurements focus on investigating slamming and whipping responses of large ships especially the containerships due to their ever increasing industrial applications and relatively high risk have been conducted lee et al 2010 recorded the long term hull girder loads and navigation data of an 8063 teu containership by hull stress monitoring system hsms and analysed the extreme load events by statistical methods andersen and jensen 2014 investigated the extreme vertical loads acting on a 9400 teu container carrier using the full scale measurement data of hull girder strains motions navigational data and the encountered sea state that collected during a period of two years kim et al 2018 investigated the modal behaviour such as the mode shapes natural frequencies and damping ratios of a 9400 teu container carrier by full scale measurement since the external environmental loads on ships are random complex and unpredictable more and more structural health monitoring systems are used to real time record analysis evaluation warning and assist decision making of the sea conditions and structural response encountered in the service process of real ship lindemann et al 1977 perera et al 2012 mondoro et al 2016 wang et al 2018b mieloszyk et al 2021 tank model tests are widely used for the investigation of ship wave loads there are basically three kinds of physical models in use for ship wave loads and hydroelasticity measurement monoblock elastic model watanabe et al 1989 lin et al 1992 segmented hinged model zhu and moan 2014 and segmented model with backbone beam marón et al 2004 fonseca and guedes soares 2004 thomas et al 2011 jiao and ren 2016 rajendran et al 2016a the segmented model test is the most popular approach among them lewis 1954 made the pioneering work of hydroelasticity test and already studied the slamming and whipping events a series of wave loads model experiments were conducted within the scope of the joint industry project jip of wave induced loads on ships wils organized by the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering risoe kim et al 2010 2014 lee et al 2011 hong and kim 2014 a chinese jip which focuses on springing and whipping benchmark study with a 20 000 teu containership was initiated by cssrc which will last for three years from 2018 to 2021 initial results from this program can be found in feng et al 2021 comprehensive reviews of ship wave loads and hydroelasticity tank model tests can be found in jiao et al 2017b tian and wu 2008 and marón and kapsenberg 2014 4 1 structural design of large scale segmented model large scale model wave loads tests are conducted to better understand the structural loads and responses acting on full scale ships leguen and fréchou 2007 made a 25 m frigate model 1 5 large scale whose hull structure is in mechanical similarity to the full scale the model was built to maintain elastic similarity and proper scaling relation between modes of resonance between the model and real ship seakeeping and hydroelasticity model experiments were conducted in the towing tank of french marine institute the main purpose of this large scale model experiment was to collect data for the validation of design tools for predictions of hull motions and structural responses in the recent years jiao et al 2016a 2016b 2016c conducted a series of large scale segmented model measurements at sea for wave induced and slamming loads investigations two segmented models models f and g with steel backbone were made by frp and the sea trials were performed in the period from 2015 to 2017 another segmented model model h corresponding to a 20 000 teu containership was made of steel and tested by the same team in the year 2018 main parameters of the three large scale segmented models are summarized in table 3 as afore mentioned in section 3 2 the two segment ship model model f was mainly used for seakeeping measurement of global motions and green water on deck the model was divided into two parts so that the vbm amidships can be also measured the two segments were connected by a short and strong backbone beam without similarity in stiffness or natural frequency only the wave frequency vbm was involved for investigation since the high frequency slamming and whipping loads cannot be reproduced by the backbone view of this large scale model and testing scene at sea are shown in fig 36 the large scale model was tested in coastal waves of bohai bay china the motivation of the large scale sea trial was to final validate the seakeeping performance of the ship sailing in realistic harsh waves at high speed with a series of tank model tests being conducted but prior to prototype construction the testing schemes are mainly focus on extreme conditions such as full scale significant wave heights 6 m and 9 m and ship forward speeds 18 knots 24 knots and 30 knots the 1 25 large scale segmented model model g that equipped with backbone beam was used for wave loads and hydroelasticity tests at sea jiao et al 2016a the large scale model was built in 2015 and the sea trial activities had lasted for over three years an additional 1 50 small scale model was also made and tested in laboratory tanks for comparative investigation on ship motions and loads at different scales and in different wave environments for the comparative investigations model setup and sensor arrangement of the two models were designed to be almost the same see figs 37 and 38 a series of tank tests were conducted with the small scale model in three different laboratory tanks for different testing conditions jiao et al 2015a 2016e jiao and ren 2016 both the two segmented models with different scales were divided into seven parts by the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th divisions in order to measure the sectional loads at these cut sections stations from 13th to 20th at the stern area are used for housing the self propelled mechanism which includes motors shafts gearboxes and propellers rectangular hollow structure backbones are adopted at the 1st 5th and 7th 13th sections to measure sectional vbm and horizontal bending moment hbm cylindrical hollow structure backbone is adopted at the 5th 7th sections to measure torsional moment tm in addition to vbm and hbm the backbones were designed with variable cross section to provide similarity in stiffness distribution and first order natural frequency with full scale overview of sensor arrangement on the large scale model is shown in fig 39 moreover a set of in house developed structural health monitoring system which is intended to be used for full scale ships hull stress monitoring and evaluation was fitted onboard the large scale model for a preliminary trial and validation prior to its full scale applications jiao et al 2017a the in house developed structural health monitoring system comprises three modules the stress monitoring unit the structure strength assessment unit and the hull stress database unit the stress monitoring unit is responsible for transforming the measured strain signal into stress in real time the optical signal detected by sensors is transformed into electrical signal with the help of an optic sensor demodulator the structural strength assessment unit is used to evaluate both the fatigue strength and yield strength of hull based on the measured stress data and a developed algorithm the fatigue strength of hull is evaluated according to the palmgren miner damage summation rule while the yield strength is evaluated based on the reliability theory the hull stress database unit is used for the storage of real time monitoring data and assessment results fig 40 shows the fiber optic sensors mounted on the backbone beam of the large scale segmented model seven fiber optic sensors were installed on the backbone beam among which one was used for temperature compensation it is noted that the sectional strain at the six cut divisions were measured by both the fiber optic sensors and resistance strain gauges for comparison more detailed information of the structural health monitoring system and the measurement data from the large scale model sea trials can be found in tang et al 2016 in the year 2018 a 20 m long large scale segmented model model h corresponding to a 20 000 teu containership was made with a steel shell of 5 mm thick liu 2019 this large model was initially planed to be built as a monoblock elastic steel model by elaborately design of global and local structures and stiffness distribution however this scheme was not accepted by the research team considering the fact that the global sectional loads i e vbm hbm and tm of ship in short crested waves are difficult to be exactly identified from a complex hull cross section structure finally the scheme of segmented steel model with steel backbone system was adopted nevertheless the monoblock elastic model scheme is still under development and will be adopted in our future large scale experimental activities the model was cut at stations 4 6 10 14 and 16 see fig 41 a continuous box backbone beam was equipped from station 1 to 18 to connect the segments a rectangular hole was provided in the upper side of the backbone beam from station 8 to 13 to obtain an open u shape for large deck opening simulation the sectional loads on the u shaped beam were measured by the method developed by jiao et al 2015b a group of pressure gauges were mounted at bow flare area of the model see fig 42 general arrangement and 3d modeling of the large scale containership model is shown in fig 43 the model was also designed to be equipped with superstructures to take wind resistance effects into account the large steel model was constructed in a shipyard at huludao china then the model was launched into the sea for experiments with the help of a 380 tons class gantry crane in the shipyard see fig 44 in the future work more kinds of backbone beams can be designed and adopted for large scale model wave loads measurement so as to better reproduce the load responses on ship for example marón and kapsenberg 2014 used a box beam with rectangular holes provided in several positions on the upper side of the beam to obtain an open u shape the sectional load components including three forces and three moments were measured and determined from a group of 10 strain gauges lee et al 2011 designed u shape backbone and h shape backbone schemes for tank model s springing and whipping tests in the wils jip work zhu et al 2011 developed a model with 17 segments connected by an aluminum backbone beam on its top five rectangular openings are provided on the top side of the beam to reduce the torsional stiffness so that realistic natural frequencies of torsional modes are obtained in addition to those of vertical and horizontal bending modes tang et al 2017 designed a suite of cylindrical steel backbone with variable cross sections to simulate the longitudinal stiffness distribution of a trimaran 4 2 structural design of large scale fully elastic monoblock model in addition to the segmented models adopting and testing large scale monoblock elastic model is even more interesting which has unique advantages in the investigation of local structural loads on real ships however there are two key issues related to this model the design of model structure in mechanical similarity and loads measurement scheme the first problem can be addressed by designing a simplified structural model in mechanical and stiffness similarity with the help of fea software at model design stage which will be briefly described hereunder however when it comes to the second problem it is difficult to fully grasp the loads distribution on the relatively simplified hull structure in complex and random sea waves with limited number of stress measurement points for example only the local stress or strain at critical points such as on deck or bottom plates at midship section are measured and analysed by full elastic model experiment the global sectional vbm is then roughly estimated by multiplying section modulus with the measured stress based on simple beam theory however the stress distribution on the cross section can be very complex another limitation associated with this measurement method is that it is difficult to accurately separate the load components e g vbm hbm tm and axial force from the measured total stress nevertheless this problem is hopefully to be addressed in the future with the advent of state of the art stress distribution measurement technology the scheme of small scale fully elastic monoblock models which are made of special material such as copper and composite for tank model wave loads test are reported in some early publications akita and ochi 1955 watanabe et al 1989 lin et al 1992 according to lin et al 1992 the materials should have a proper young modulus which is of the order of 1 that of steel and poisson ratio to match the elastic effects similitude this makes the material difficult to be found watanabe et al 1989 used synthetic resin and foam urethane and lin et al 1992 used special synthetic material abs702 for making the elastic model with a length of the order of 4 m for tank test however such material is not applicable for the construction of large scale model for reasons such as cost the large scale monoblock flexible model is most suitable to be made of steel fortunately the increase of model dimension makes the steel model hull can be made with similar shipbuilding technology as of real ship a scheme of monoblock elastic model with simplified structure is proposed in one of the author s patent ship model with simplified structure for hydroelasticity experiment and its design method 2 2 patent application no cn 201911250354 0 granted chinese invention patent fig 45 shows an example of the simplified transverse section of model in comparison with the real ship the model s shell plate thickness is usually thicker than the value obtained by similitude law the model s sectional stiffness and position of neutral axis can be design to be similar with prototype by adjusting the size number and position of longitudinals fig 46 shows a sketch of the simplified large scale fully elastic model the methods for ship structure design of scaled model have also been reported in some references in relation to ship structural experiment for example sun and guedes soares 2003 made two ship type models which reflect the possible failure modes of large open deck ships under pure torque for ultimate torsional strength experiment shi and wang 2012 designed a simplified single bottom structure model for experimental investigation of the hogging ultimate strength of a double bottoms containership see fig 47 a wang et al 2019c designed a simplified scale model of a 10 000 teu container ship for ultimate strength experiment of both longitudinal bending and torsion analysis see fig 47b they proposed a similarity theory to design the scale model which provides similar height of neutral axis section modulus inertia moment about neutral axis and polar inertia moment as those of full scale prini et al 2018 described a measurement scheme for global sectional vbm on a 17 m full scale ship with three or four strain gauges mounted on the hull bottom or deck zhu et al 2011 measured sectional vbm hbm and tm on rectangular cross section of backbone with a total of 12 unidirectional strain gauges 4 3 wave loads analyses a series of data analysis on large scale model s wave loads and hydroelasticity were conduced in previous work fig 48 shows the experimental scene during large scale model sea trial of model g it can be observed that both the sea waves and ship responses are associated with strong nonlinearity the time series of pitch roll vertical acceleration at bow deck vbms at bow and amidships stations by the large scale model measurement in extreme and design sea states at full scale speed 18 knots are presented in fig 49 jiao et al 2016a it was found that the roll motion is pronounced even though the model was sailing in head seas compared with the motion signals the vbm signals are neither linear nor stationary the spectral shape and statistical values of motions and loads are compared between the results by large scale sea trial and small scale tank test in the reference jiao et al 2016a it was found that the traditional long crested wave tank model test over estimates the statistical values of motions and wave loads jiao et al 2016f analysed the short term extreme values of ship motions and vbm based on a 2 h voyage measurement data of the large scale model model g the weibull distribution function was used to fit the statistical peak values for long term design loads prediction see fig 50 the statistics of pitch and roll peaks shows a good agreement with the weibull distribution however the statistics of acceleration and vbm loads show differences between measurement and the weibull statistical model mainly due to the nonlinear behaviour caused by severe sea waves jiao et al 2016g identified the wetted natural frequency of the large scale model by impact hammer test the authors also investigated the longitudinal distribution of significant amplitude value and extreme value for both vbm and hbm it was found that the hbm loads are nearly as large as vbm when the ship was sailing in realistic severe bow oblique waves so enough attention should also be paid to the horizontal strength of ships at design stage due to the non stationarity and nonlinearities of wave induced load signal reliable methods should be further adopted to analysis the large scale model s loads data in order to overcome the drawbacks such as spurious harmonics associate with fourier analysis rousset et al 2010 possessed the nonlinear and non stationary wave loads time series by hilbert huang transform hht which combines the empirical mode decomposition emd with hilbert spectral analysis to decompose the load components pedersen and jensen 2009 proposed a closed form expression to estimate hull girder vbm including nonlinear and flexibility effects for calculation of the short and long term distribution of wave induced and slamming induced stresses gaidai et al 2018 described a practical method for the prediction of extreme stress acting on full scale containership with sea trial measurement data 4 4 slamming and whipping loads throughout the maritime world considerable efforts have been spent on predicting loads associated with slamming and whipping kapsenberg 2011 wang and guedes soares 2013 2016a b and a variety of methods have been used to analyse them wang and guedes soares 2017 however large and full scale ship sea trial data regarding slamming loads are relatively scarce and valuable camilleri et al 2018 investigated the slamming loads and responses on a 9 6 m high speed planning craft by full scale measurement at sea methods for processing the slamming pressure data from sea trial measurement such as removing the trends from strain signals and identifying the peaks in the pressure and strain signals are developed and reported andersen and jensen 2014 analysed full scale measurement data of a 9400 teu containership and found that whipping effects increase more hogging than sagging loads which is however opposite from the results by tank model test that reported by zhu and moan 2013 jacobi et al 2014 investigated the slamming behaviour of a 98 m wave piercer catamaran by full scale measurement jiao et al 2016b presented the short term time series of motions and loads acting on the large scale model model g at full scale speed 19 knots in a wave state level 6 see fig 51 the presented signals include pitch bow vertical acceleration vertical bending stress and horizontal bending stress at bow station 2 where slamming is relatively severe in model scale the time series of total stress were filtered into wave frequency and whipping components and the whipping stress are presented together with the slamming pressure measured by bow pressure gauge no 1 the position can be seen in fig 39 it was found that the horizontal loads are almost of the same order of magnitude as vertical loads when ship sailing in bow oblique seas pronounced high frequency horizontal whipping loads were also observed when slamming events took place this is very different from the results of tank model testing in head wave conditions therefore attention should also be paid to horizontal strength of ships even sailing in head sea waves similar results can be found in jiao et al 2019e where both the full scale vbm and hbm acting on the same model during an extreme slamming event are presented see fig 52 the transient whipping sagging vbm loads at bow is nearly two times as large as the wave frequency vbm the transient total hbm at bow around 364 mnm is even greater than the corresponding vbm at bow around 280 mnm even though the transient total hbm amidships around 1550 mnm is lower than the total vbm amidships around 2080 mnm large containerships with bow flare are prone to slamming in harsh waves the slamming phenomena on the large scale containership model model h in a sea state level 7 are shown in fig 53 typical time series of impact pressure the position can be seen in fig 41 within 200 s and its local view within 50 s are presented in fig 54 the sample rate of impact pressure was set at 500 hz as a compromise between the slamming peak capture requirement and the available storage memory of data collector the slamming pressure peaks at gauge no 3 in centreline are much greater than gauges nos 5 and 6 at side bow area jiao et al 2019e conducted a comparative study on the motions and wave loads between large scale model test with model g and small scale model tank test the statistical parameters of pitch and vbm by different model measurements in the equivalent sea state level 6 are summarized in table 4 where the results are presented at full scale for the convenience of comparison the large scale model s standard deviations of pitch and vbm at stations 2 and 10 in head wave are respectively 3 35 17 45 and 17 72 larger than in starboard bow wave condition however although the sea wave level ship speed and wave heading are the same the large scale model s standard deviations of pitch and vbm at stations 2 and 10 are respectively 29 12 23 48 and 24 73 lower than the small scale model results this indicates that the long crested waves would highly overestimate the standard deviation of ship motions and loads even though sailing in a same condition the skewness and kurtosis of pitch motion are generally small apart from that the kurtosis of large scale model in head wave is 0 940 the skewness and kurtosis of large scale model s vbm are obviously deviation from the gaussian distribution due to the strong nonlinearity of ship responses in realistic sea waves especially for the vbm statistical results at bow when sailing in head waves the comparisons of probability of exceedance for peaks of pitch and vbm between large and small scale model testing results are presented in figs 55 and 56 respectively jiao et al 2019e as is seen the peaks of crest and trough of pitch motion are symmetrically distributed and only a slight asymmetry is observed at the tail of the distribution for all the three cases the largest pitch peak shows similar magnitude between large and small model in head wave conditions however the corresponding occurrence probability is lower for large scale model test the probability of exceedance of large scale model s pitch at low pitch peak value is also much smaller than the small scale model result which explains the reason that the standard deviation of large scale model s pitch is 29 12 lower than small scale model result similar phenomenon can be also found by comparing the vbm results in cases 2 and 3 although the standard deviations of vbm in realistic sea waves are approximately 24 lower than those in tank waves the extreme vbm values in realistic sea waves are however much larger as found from the tail of vbm distribution especially at station 2 in the head wave case this means that the rarely occurring events extreme loads are more frequently occurred in realistic sea waves than in tank waves thus the large scale model sea trial is a potential tool in the reproduction of rarely occurring events and nonlinear motions and loads of full scale ship sailing in seaways 5 discussion on experimental uncertainty at issc the assessment of uncertainty has been a permanent subject of research in particular in the issc committee i 2 loads which has produced several studies guedes soares 1996 has analysed the effect of the uncertainty in the wave scatter diagrams and on the transfer functions guedes soares 1999 has reported on the model uncertainty of the long term wave induced load effects in a containership and a tanker watanabe and guedes soares 1999 presented a benchmark study of different non linear time domain codes applied to study the vertical wave induced bending moment in a containership in waves of different steepness one of the emerging issues in ittc activities is the uncertainty analysis kim and hermansky 2014 the issc and ittc jointly held a workshop in 2012 in order to understand the uncertainties in the description of environment predictions of loads and responses of marine structures and risk assessment and mitigation in design and operation qiu et al 2014 according to the classification made in the report of the seakeeping committee in ittc 2017 seven groups of uncertainties are identified in seakeeping tests uncertainty of instruments uncertainty of model mass properties model geometry uncertainty uncertainty of the test setup calibration uncertainty measurement uncertainty and data reduction uncertainty guedes soares 1991 introduced the observation of uncertainty for different theories of wave induced motions and loads of ships in this pioneering work the uncertainties of computational models were assessed from comparisons with model experiments gavrilin and steen 2015 presented the uncertainty analyses of full scale turning circle trials using monte carlo techniques the uncertainties in full scale measurements were caused by the changing environmental data drummen and holtmann 2014 reported a benchmark study of slamming and whipping in relation to modal response impulsive loading and regular head wave response parunov et al 2020 presented a benchmark study aimed at the uncertainty assessment of numerical predictions of global wave loads on damaged ships zhou et al 2020 studied the uncertainty of ship model propulsion test using the large scale model measurement data of model i and the influence of the experimental environment was quantified the accuracy of ship geometry parameters distribution of mass and inertia and reynolds number similarity of large scale model are improved compared with towing tank model test which will reduce the experimental uncertainty however during the sea trials of resistance and propulsion tests the uncertainties within sensor measurement accuracy ship speed and course angle and their effects on the results should be considered in addition the external ocean environment is not well controlled as in the laboratory thus the wind wave and current could contribute to the experimental uncertainty during calm water measurements although the data obtained by large scale model seakeeping trials is unquestionable there are more uncertainties that are relevant to the data collected at sea which are mainly attributed to the lack of control over the complex sea environment the realistic sea waves have a strong randomness and nonlinearity and they are characterized with broad band frequency distribution and direction spreading however wave buoys are only responsible in the measurement of wave components in a certain range of frequency which has been explained in fig 21 in addition to the measurement uncertainty the coastal and near shore waves may associate with shoaling diffraction refraction reflection and breaking effects many sea states found at sea are more complex and they can be composed by one wind sea spectrum and an additional swell spectrum and they even come from different directions guedes soares 1984 vettor and guedes soares 2020 in fact a detailed study of the wave spectra showed that several shapes of spectra can be identified and classified in classes in a given location lucas et al 2011 moreover the wave data measured by wave buoys is neither local nor synchronous with respect to the ship model ashton et al 2013 investigated the spatial distribution of ocean wave spectral parameters using measurements from an array of four directional wave buoys installed in a square formation with side length 500 m it was demonstrated that wave conditions cannot be considered stationary across the measurement area and differences were observed primarily in the low frequencies even though onboard wave meter allows the local and synchronous wave measurement the wave data correction by removing the ship 6 dof motions is still a challenging work that needs further development in the laboratory tank tests the forward speed and heading angle of models are well controlled with the help of towing carriage however the deviation from mean value of forward speed and heading of large scale model at sea would be larger which would contribute to experimental uncertainty an example of the measured time series of speed and heading angle of the large scale model model g during seakeeping measurement is illustrated in fig 57 as is seen the fluctuation of navigational speed and heading angle in the period between 6100 s and 6800 s are about 0 1 m s resultant speed around 2 m s and 5 respectively the fluctuations are acceptable for the study of full scale response in a sea state level 6 significant wave height 6 65 m and ship speed 19 knots in addition the accuracy in speed and trajectory measurement with gps system should also be concerned 6 conclusions and recommendations in this paper large scale model at sea measurements for ship hydrodynamics and structural loads are comprehensively reviewed the advantages and drawbacks of large scale model tests compared with laboratory tank tests and full scale sea trials are also discussed in general the large scale model sea trial is a potential tool in investigating nonlinear motions and loads on full scale ships almost all kinds of hydrodynamic tests such as stability floodability resistance propulsion cavitation manoeuvrability seakeeping and structural loads can be carried out by large scale model measurement even though the data obtained by large scale model test is more realistic there are still some problems and difficulties inherent to this testing technique mainly due to the uncontrollability of natural environment till now the reported work regarding large scale model sea trials are limited there has been no published paper reporting the comparison of large scale model testing results against full scale sea trial results which would pose numerous challenges and are costly to acquire even under normal circumstances such research will be highly interesting and helpful in examining the credibility and appropriateness of large scale model results in addition more attentions should be paid to the uncertainty analysis and benchmark study of large scale model measurement data in the future work large scale model measurement is still a technique in progress according to the scientific community of naoe future development trend of ship experiments includes performing large and full scale trials in natural environment it is worth mentioning that the classical laboratory tank tests definitely have their obvious advantages and contributions in ship hydrodynamics investigations the large scale model testing technique is positioned as a supplement to the classical tank tests and full scale trial and it is mainly aimed to be used for investigating some strongly nonlinear fsi problems and rarely occurring events it is also expected to be conducted prior to the design and construction of full scale ship to derisk new technology and commercial cost therefore there should be a good balance between the development of different testing methods so as

20871,this paper reviews the state of the art research progress of large scale model at sea measurements in relation to ship resistance propulsion manoeuvrability seakeeping and structural loads physical experiments have long been an indispensable tool in the research of ship hydrodynamics and structural loads to date a substantial number of experiments including tank model tests and full scale measurements have been extensively conducted and reported in the recent years an alternative experimental approach namely large scale model measurement has been paid special attention in order to better understand some strongly nonlinear fluid structure interaction problems and rarely occurring events on ships in realistic and complex ocean environment the review on large scale seakeeping and wave loads experiments is undertaken by extensively referring related work conducted worldwide challenges and recommendations towards further developing and refining large scale model measurement techniques are also reported and discussed keywords ship hydrodynamics seakeeping wave loads structural response tank model test full scale sea trial large scale model test 1 introduction the problems of ship hydrodynamics and structural loads have long been of great interest to both the industry and academic research due to the complexity of interaction between water waves and arbitrary shape moving floating structures in the presence of free surface and forward speed no perfect numerical model has been proposed yet even though great progresses and fruitful achievements have been made in the past decades hirdaris et al 2014 the classical potential flow theory which mainly includes 2d strip theory korvin kroukovsky and jacobs 1957 salvesen et al 1970 rajendran et al 2015 2 5d high speed slender body theory faltinsen and zhao 1991 wang et al 2018a and 3d panel theory ganesan and sen 2015 bishop et al 1986 datta and guedes soares 2020 have been established to solve both rigid body motions and hydroelastic responses of ship without or with forward speed in both frequency and time domain hirdaris and temarel 2009 ittc 2008 2011a 2014 2017 issc 2012 2015 2018 thanks to the dramatic advances of computer science and technology in the recent years the numerical wave tank techniques have attracted great interest from researchers the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods making use of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are becoming increasingly popular and mature hirdaris et al 2016 mousaviraad et al 2015 wang et al 2019a islam and guedes soares 2018 2019 this is also evident from the increasing number of commercial and open source software packages such as ansys fluent cfx flow 3d star ccm ls dyna openfoam and cfdship iowa however due to the excessive computational cost of cfd tools they are still reserved for niche applications rather than wide engineering applications in addition to the numerical methods physical experiments constitute an indispensable tool in the scientific community experiments are conducted for different purposes such as full scale performance prediction numerical method validation and new physical phenomena exploration the world first physical basin for ship model testing was built by william froude in 1872 then many state of the art tank facilities have been built all over the world till now tank model tests have been widely applied for the investigation of ship hydrodynamics and wave loads which mainly includes resistance and propulsion manoeuvrability and seakeeping structural response and slamming loads the advantages of tank model tests are obvious for example the wind and wave environment in the laboratory are well controlled and reproducible the time and cost are relatively economic compared with full scale measurement however there are some limitations associated with the tank model tests in some aspects for example the artificially generated waves in the tank are not real as the wind forcing is not present zhang et al 2017 the reynolds scale effects are obvious and the model sailing range is limited jiao et al 2016a full scale measurements are believed to be the most authentic and reliable method to obtain ship hydrodynamic responses in seaways traditionally full scale sea trials are mainly conducted during delivery stage for checking contract requirements such as velocity and manoeuvrability performance full scale measurement data for ship seakeeping and wave loads are relatively scarce especially for ship operating in harsh weather fortunately with the development of global positioning system gps satellite remote sensing and intelligent monitoring technologies nunez et al 2017 perera et al 2012 lee et al 2010 more and more commercial and military ships are equipped with permanent monitoring systems to record the ship s operational data and responses to the current environment for the up to date decision making and long term improvements to design and simulation tools review of the related work of full scale measurement can be found in the past ittc seakeeping committees ittc 2008 2011a 2014 2017 and issc loads committees issc 2012 2015 2018 although full scale measurement provides invaluable data for what really happened in real vessel operations it is however complex expensive and time consuming moreover even though investigation on ship responses in extremely severe sea states is interesting and significant the related full scale experiments would pose a major threat to the safety of crew and ship furthermore the timing of the occurrence of the extreme sea states in full scale conditions and the realization of the tests would not be easy to synchronize thus full scale sea trials cannot be widely applied for scientific research and practice engineering application and resource has to be made to model tests for extreme wave loads guedes soares et al 2006 2008 due to the inherent limitations associated with the laboratory tank model test and full scale sea trial an alternative experimental technique which includes conducting large scale model test in realistic sea conditions has been proposed and developed in the recent years large scale model tests are usually conducted prior to the design and construction of full scale ship which significantly derisks new technology and commercial costs in some sense this testing approach is a compromise between laboratory tank test and full scale sea trial and also provides obvious advantages over them in some aspects for instance the experimental environment is more realistic than laboratory tank environment since the wind driven sea waves are more complex and real and they are associated with obviously nonlinear characteristics such as short crestedness broad frequency strong randomness sharp crest and flat trough behavior in particular for storm sea states guedes soares et al 2004 campos et al 2018 the six degree of freedom 6 dof motions of free running model at sea are fully coupled without any constraint caused by mechanical seaworthiness instrument used in the laboratory large models can be also tested with their superstructures bilge keels and fin stabilizers so that the wind and current effects are being taken into account the reynolds scale effects can be reduced by using large models which will be of great significance for the investigations of scale effects in ship resistance propulsion and manoeuvrability moreover the tank wall effects and blockage effects do not exist at sea the sea surface is large enough thus the large scale self propelled model is possible to run in a relative open area at any heading angle which will be of great helpful for manoeuvrability and seakeeping investigations more wave samples can be recorded by a model in one run during seakeeping sea trials and this is important for data statistical analysis of irregular waves some strongly nonlinear fluid structure interaction fsi problems and rarely occurring events such as ship large amplitude motion bow stern emergence high speed of advance slamming and whipping green water on deck can be hardly satisfactorily reproduced by tank model test although relatively good accuracy can be obtained as these events are inertia dominated large scale model sea trials are alternative experimental method for such investigations although it is very difficult to have sea trials in really heavy weather the conduct of large scale model measurements is much cheaper compared with full scale sea trials on the other hand testing large scale model at sea avoids the utilization of large and expensive towing tank facilities such as carriage and wave maker which may have a tight working time schedule and are not available at any time the model can be fully utilized since almost all kinds of standard hydrodynamic tests can be conducted with an elaborate designed large scale model the tests could include stability floodability resistance propulsion manoeuvrability seakeeping wave loads slamming and whipping loads and even underwater explosion the aim of this paper is to present an overview of the advances in the development of large scale model at sea measurements and shed light on its potential opportunities and challenges currently existing publications regarding large scale model measurement are scarce and even when available they are usually incomplete only a few crucial naval and commercial ships have been tested through large scale measurement technique fortunately in the recent years increasing efforts are being devoted towards adopting and refining this kind of testing technique due to its unique advantages this paper reviews the state of the art of large scale model measurement techniques especially the seakeeping and wave loads experiments and also explores their potential applications in different kinds of typical hydrodynamic experiments the structure of this paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the research background and significance section 2 gives a brief overview of calm water related large scale model experiments which include ship resistance propulsion and manoeuvrability measurements section 3 reviews the large scale model seakeeping measurements and summarizes the related critical technique problems and data analysis methods section 4 reviews the large scale model measurements for wave loads and structural responses section 5 discusses the experimental uncertainty in relation to large scale model at sea measurements section 6 presents main conclusions and recommendations from this review 2 large scale experiments in calm seas the majority of the experimental measurements and cfd simulations for ship resistance propulsion manoeuvrability and seakeeping have focused on model scale the practical limitations of matching both reynolds and froude scales simultaneously in model scale are well known for example for ship scale the reynolds number is of the order of 109 but the value is usually of the order of 107 for model scale it is well known that the reynolds scaling effect has significant influence on the ship hydrodynamics when viscous effects are relevant even though various extrapolation methodologies have been proposed to predict full scale hydrodynamic performance from model scale results and satisfactory results can be obtained direct measurements and calculations of large or full scale ship s hydrodynamic performance are still necessary especially for investigating scale effects and improving extrapolation methodologies since model testing for ship resistance propulsion and manoeuvrability in natural open water environment are relatively common the research progress of large scale model tests for these purposes are briefly reviewed in this section 2 1 ship resistance and propulsion typical test for ship speed includes ship resistance test propeller open water test and self propulsion test testing condition for ship resistance generally includes naked model resistance and appended resistance tests the full scale resistance is usually extrapolated by the 2d froude s method or the 3d form factor method from the scaled model testing results the ship model self propulsion tests generally include self propulsion test in a gravity tank and free running model test however extrapolating self propulsion results from model scale to full scale is problematic due to the inherently different flow conditions near the propeller according to the ittc recommendation procedures and guidelines of resistance test ittc 2011b experimental models should generally be as large as possible for the size of the towing tank taking into consideration the wall blockage and finite depth effects as well as model mass and the maximum speed of towing carriage visonneau et al 2016 performed cfd simulations for the japan bulk carrier jbc and showed significant differences in flow field at the stern between model and full scale similar differences were also observed by castro et al 2011 who performed cfd calculations of self propulsion simulations on a kcs containership at full scale and model scale hua et al 2011 investigated roll damping and the related scale effects of a french frigate by four different scales model experiments including full scale measurement and numerical calculations heinke and hellwig rieck 2011 investigated the reynolds scale effect on the flow around the appendages and on the inflow to the propeller by a containership equipped with wake equalizing duct wed and the vortex generator fins vgf through cfd simulation full scale measurements are conducted to get better understandings of ship resistance and propulsion trägärdh et al 2005 conducted a comprehensive open water model test with a 1 42 scaled model to investigate aspects of resistance propulsion manoeuvrability and cavitation performance full scale sea trials were also conducted which well confirmed the results by model tests kayano et al 2013 performed full scale experiments using a training ship of length overall 105 m in order to investigate its propulsion performance characteristics in actual seas guiard et al 2013 proposed a full scale design for a pre swirl duct by using cfd code and the computed results are expected to be validated by full scale test data ouchi 1989 reported comparative analyses of the sea trial results of 11 ships against their model testing results the results indicated considerable scale effects between the model and actual measurements such that the efficiency gain at full scale could be two to three times that at the model scale even though cfd techniques have been validated extensively by developers and researchers most of the cfd simulations are conducted in model scale mainly due to the following two reasons i lack of experimental results in large and full scale for numerical validation ii complexity of numerical codes at very high reynolds numbers such as turbulence modelling gorski et al 2004 hanninen and mikkola 2006 with the increase of computing efficiency of computers there is a trend to perform large or full scale cfd numerical simulations in attempt to reduce reynolds scale effects castro et al 2011 performed full scale cfd simulation of a self propelled kcs containership with direct discretization of the propeller tezdogan et al 2015 performed a fully nonlinear unsteady rans simulation to predict ship motions and added resistance of a full scale kriso containership bhushan et al 2009 conducted model and full scale unsteady rans simulations of ship power seakeeping and manoeuvrability and investigated the scale effects on the results of different models wang et al 2015 solved the viscous flow fields around a 4000 teu containership at different scales by rans method and investigated the scale effect of nominal wake of the single screw ship jasak et al 2019 compared full scale cfd simulations with sea trial measurements of two self propelled ships the lloyd s register technical investigation department lr tid performed full scale measurements of ship speed engine power shaft speed propeller thrust and torque on a medium range tanker for the purpose of validating full scale cfd predictions ponkratov and zegos 2014 2015 islam et al 2021 have compared predicted propulsion power for a 64teu inland container vessel from full scale and model scale cfd simulations at different operating conditions illustrating the problems of scale it is not the objective of this paper to discuss ship cfd techniques but more available experimental data of large and full scale ship hydrodynamics would not only shed some more light on the influence of scaling effects on the extrapolation outcome but also be used for improving cfd codes the cavitation phenomena are widely investigated to evaluate ship propeller performance sampson et al 2015 made a comparison of full scale and 1 3 5 model scale cavitation for a deep v catamaran research vessel a high speed camera was used to record the propeller cavitation phenomena and a good correlation between the full scale and model scale observations was observed in terms of the types strength and dynamic behaviour of the cavitation kleinwachter et al 2015 studied about piv as a novel full scale measurement technique in cavitation research the novel piv technique is well suited to recording wake field velocity data at full scale grigoropoulos and katsaounis 2004 mentioned that during large scale model measurements video recording of areas of specific interest for example above propeller disks can be performed using special miniature cameras recently a joint research project in china has been undertaken by the shanghai ship and shipping research institute sssri in collaboration with the harbin engineering university heu the marine design research institute of china maric and the china ship scientific research center cssrc a series of large scale sea trial activities for resistance propulsion manoeuvrability and seakeeping of a 230 000 dwt bulk carrier were designed and conducted in the year 2018 the main objective of the large scale model tests is to evaluate and validate the newly developed energy saving device esd and also investigate the energy saving efficiency in different scales and finally develop a full scale extrapolation method for energy saving efficiency evaluation a 1 13 large scale model was made by fiber reinforced plastic frp and the model is about 25 m long and 115 tonnes heavy strong transverse frames are provided inside the hull shell to strengthen its stiffness and resist deformation of the hull the model is equipped with its superstructure and esd in order to account for wind and current resistance a conventional five bladed propeller and single rudder were designed for self propulsion tests the shaft line is equipped with a dynamometer for the measurements of propeller torque and thrust loads more parameters of the model can be found in table 2 by referring the model i general view of the large scale model measurement is shown in fig 1 lin et al 2020 reported a comprehensive testing system to assess the resistance and propulsion performance of the 25 m long ship model in actual seas fig 2 shows the layout of the ship model the propulsion system of the model comprises a console generator integrated cabinet servomotor reduction gear broken shaft type self propulsion instrument two couplings and a shaft and propeller on the bottom platform of the stern room the rotating speed of the propeller can be controlled as required the broken shaft type self propulsion instrument can simultaneously measure the thrust and torque of the propeller of the ship model with a high accuracy both towing test and self propulsion test were conducted and the related data processing method and testing results are presented in the paper guo et al 2020 conducted self propulsion test for propulsion performance using the same large scale model and the effects of complex wake field environments on the propulsion performance are studied using the equal thrust and equal torque method with the measurement data of the same model su et al 2020a investigated the influence of pre swirl stator and rudder bulb system on the propulsion performance of the large scale model zhou et al 2020 studied the uncertainty of the ship model propulsion test using the large scale model measurement data and the influence of the test environment was quantified almost all the existing large or full scale resistance and propulsion measurements in open waters are conducted by free running ships which implies that the ship resistance and propeller performance are investigated with propeller hull interaction effects as a result the large or full scale naked hull resistance and appended resistance measurements are rarely seen in the laboratory tank tests towed model resistance can be measured with the help of the towing carriage however it is difficult to find a plane movement or fixed platform which could act as a reference at sea ré et al 2008 conducted bollard thrust tests of a 5 28 m lifeboat at the dock using a 30 m long rope and in line load cell one end of the rope was attached at the stern pull point of the lifeboat while the other end was attached to the dock s bollard they also conducted towed test with the help of another ship to roughly estimate the calm water resistance but without considering the wake of the towing ship one of the special aims of the 230 000 dwt bulk carrier large scale model resistance trials is to determine the naked hull resistance and appended resistance for this purpose two testing schemes can be used and they are depicted in fig 3 the first scheme includes towing the model with a pair of ships by forming a y type fleet tension in the cables can be measured by force sensors the relative position of the three ships is pre determined according to the speed and drag force so as to minimize the interference of wake generated by the two towing ships this scheme however requires that the two towing ships operating fully consistent with each other which is very difficult to realize the second scheme includes adopting a large anchored ship to act as fixing base and towing the model with the help of a winch another cable is used to attach the model s stern with a gravity weight that supported by a pulley fixed on bollard to ensure model s course stability the latter scheme was adopted for the large scale model towing tests and proved to be feasible by lin et al 2020 it is noted that the horizontal towing point should be set at model s centre of gravity cog so that the model s sinkage and trim are unrestrained however in the above reference the towing point on model was at bow and stern to overcome this problem a towing scheme for large scale model resistance measurement at sea is proposed in the patent large scale ship model resistance measurement system 1 1 patent application no cn201911030003 9 granted chinese invention patent a method for acting towing forcing on cog of model with the help of wire rope winch and convex structure and the related measurement for resistance and sinkage and trim of hull is documented in the patent which is shown in fig 4 2 2 ship manoeuvrability ship manoeuvring experiments can be conducted by captive model tests or free running model tests sutulo and guedes soares 2004 wang et al 2020 captive model tests are conducted by forcing a scale model to move in a prescribed manner in laboratory tank with facilities such as rotating arm and planar motion mechanism pmm to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives of ships free running manoeuvring tests can be conducted by scaled model or full scale ship full scale manoeuvring trials are widely conducted by designers and operators especially at ship delivery stage the tests are usually performed in deep unrestricted water under calm environment conditions ship motion parameters are measured by instruments such as gps system typical free running manoeuvring tests include turning circle test zigzag test spiral test pull out test and stopping test sutulo and guedes soares 2011 zhang et al 2015 used the full scale sea trial data of yukun vessel to validate their proposed manoeuvring identification algorithm guedes soares et al 2004 conducted full scale manoeuvring trials on a fast patrol vessel and guedes soares et al 1999 performed manoeuvring tests in a catamaran which were then compared with the results of captive model tests sutulo and guedes soares 2006 bekker et al 2014 performed full scale manoeuvring measurements on a polar supply and research vessel during ice trials you et al 2018 proposed a new approach to predict the actual revolution per minute rpm and engine power of an lng carrier from full scale measurement data considering the described performance the reynolds scale effects could be obvious in small scale manoeuvring tests suzuki et al 2019 proposed an extrapolation method for full scale ship manoeuvring motions from free running model test with consideration of the operational limit of an engine ueno and tsukada 2016 proposed a method to estimate full scale propeller torque and thrust consisting of low frequency and high frequency components in waves by free running model test jin et al 2016 investigated the influence of ship model size on manoeuvring hydrodynamic coefficients by rans simulation of a kriso very large crude carrier kvlcc2 it was concluded that the full scale ship has a relatively smaller turbulence wake region after the hull when compared with model scale conditions and the scale effects are evident in the surge and sway forces but found to be less influential in the yaw moment performing manoeuvring tests with large scale free running models in natural environment have been undertaken by some designers and researchers such experiments are commonly conducted especially with submarine seaplane autonomous underwater vehicle auv and unmanned surface vehicle usv corato et al 2014 wang et al 2019b serter 1993 reported manoeuvring tests of radio controlled high speed military models in a swiss lake mu et al 2018 conducted manoeuvring tests with a 7 m long usv which is equipped with a single vector propulsion device in calm sea surface coraddu et al 2013 conducted large scale free running model of a twin screw ship in a volcanic lake to investigate the asymmetric propeller functioning phenomenon a 7 2 m long large model of a twin screw twin rudder naval ship was manufactured see fig 5 tests were carried out in correspondence to three different simplified control strategies i e constant rpm constant torque and constant power guo et al 2020 conducted large scale model manoeuvring tests which include turning circle test and zig zag test using the model shown in fig 1 typical manoeuvring testing results are shown in fig 6 fossati et al 2015 reported a full scale sailing yacht laboratory and measured the motions and loads on a 10 m long sailing yacht in wind conditions it can be concluded that the experimental setup for large scale free running model manoeuvring trials in open waters are similar to those in the laboratory tank however gps and inertial measurement unit imu devices are usually necessary for the open water trials and this is described in section 3 4 perera et al 2015 have used gps and imu in autonomous ship models of 3 m and 4 m long in an oceanic pool to assess anti collision manoeuvers while hinostroza et al 2021 have used the same models for testing manoeuvres in formation 3 large scale seakeeping experiments ships require good seakeeping performance to fulfill their designated missions the prediction of ship seakeeping performance is an integral part at ship design stage the majority of the seakeeping tests are routinely carried out in laboratory tanks where it is possible to control the experimental setup to a high degree and variables can be monitored relatively easily as a result researchers have a wealth of methods to know ship hydrodynamic behaviour in tank waves the ship environment adaptability research center searc at heu has long been devoted to investigating ship seakeeping behaviour in harsh environment through the decade long comparative investigations between tank experiments and full scale sea trials cai et al 2003a 2003b it was found that the ship seakeeping behaviour in actual sea waves can be quite different from that reproduced in the laboratory tank even though the reynolds scale effects is not a main effect in tank model seakeeping tests since the fluid viscous force has less effect on ship s vertical motions compared with inertia force in europe several joint projects have been made to study the behaviour of ships in extreme storms leading also to important set of results of good quality vasquez et al 2016 rajendran et al 2016b in korea several similar tests in harsh environment have been conducted as described in kim and kim 2016 despite the good results obtained in laboratory there was a motivation to conduct large scale model seakeeping tests at sea mainly due to the realism of wind wave environment lloyd 1989 briefly outlined the concept of conducting open water model seakeeping experiments in a professional book of seakeeping he suggested the model dimension ratio to be selected of the order of 10 ship motion instrumentation similar to that employed in full scale sea trials can be used for large scale test and motor speed setting and steering can be achieved by radio control he also pointed out that the full scale wave spectrum should be reproduced at model scale according to the similitude laws which is often difficult to realize this therefore generally dictates the seakeeping test area in sheltered water with limited fetch he concluded that large scale experiments have an intrinsic appeal for their apparent realism and they are certainly much cheaper than full scale trials however the book is mainly focus on seakeeping theory and tank model and full scale tests no further information regarding large scale model trial are provided in this section the large scale seakeeping measurements are summarized and discussed the content mainly includes the research progress of ship seakeeping in short crested waves the worldwide conducted large scale model seakeeping tests and the most related key technical issues 3 1 ship responses in short crested waves the realistic ocean waves where full scale ship operates are associated with characteristics such as randomness and short crestedness guedes soares 1984 lucas et al 2011 however the traditional numerical and experimental seakeeping investigations mainly focus on ship motions and loads in long crested or uni directional waves in fact the directionality of waves can significantly influence the motions and loads experienced by ships and offshore structures teixeira and guedes soares 2009 for example it may lead to a reduction of the loads and increase of structure life which consequently results in saving the steel weight and manufacture costs therefore a better understanding of ship motions and loads in short crested waves and their difference compared with in long crested waves will be of great helpful for highlighting the importance of conducting large scale model sea trials the wave loads acting on fixed structures in multi directional waves have been investigated in the early years nwogu 1985 numerically investigate the effects of wave directionality on the motions and loads of infinitely long structures such as fixed breakwater or floating bridges nwogu 1989 studied the wave forces and motions on fixed and floating structures in random multi directional waves by spectral methods experiments were also conducted to study the forces on a fixed segmented vertical cylinder and a moored floating barge in random multi directional waves sannasiraj et al 1995 studied the hydrodynamic behaviour of 2d horizontal freely floating structures in multi directional waves by linear transfer function approach the motions and forces on a rectangular floating structure experiencing unidirectional and multi directional waves were calculated wang 2006 studied the wave forces on a fixed long semi circular breakwater in both long and short crested random waves numerically and experimentally song and tao 2007 and liu et al 2012 investigated the general 3d short crested wave interaction with a concentric two cylinder system which is surface piercing and bottom mounted by linear potential theory ong et al 2013 provided a practical stochastic method to estimate the maximum equilibrium scour around a vertical pile exposed to long and short crested nonlinear random waves plus a current ji et al 2015a investigated the interaction of multi directional irregular waves with a large vertical bottom mounted cylinder by wave tank test it was found that the effect of the wave directionality is more obvious on transverse force than on normal force ji et al 2015b investigated the wave run up and wave loads acting on an array of circular bottom mounted vertical cylinders in short crested waves by both linear superposition theory and tank experiment xu et al 2019 solved the 3d time domain second order stokes wave diffracting problem by desingularized boundary integral equation method dbiem and the interaction between multi directional waves and a single upright fixing cylinder was studied they concluded that the second order forces on structure in multi directional waves are much greater than in unidirectional waves while the difference in first order forces is ignorable till now the short crested wave models have not been commonly used in the prediction of ship seakeeping performance naess 1990 developed a general theory for statistical analysis of nonlinear second order forces and motions of offshore structures in short crested random seas li and wen 2007 predicted the motion responses of a fpso in short crested waves by linear frequency spectral analysis method they concluded that the amplitude of roll and pitch motions of the fpso in short crested waves is less sensitive to the change of wave heading compared with in long crested waves chen et al 2011 predicted ship motion responses in both long and short crested irregular waves by 3d rankine source based potential flow theory in time domain renaud et al 2008 investigated the second order wave loads on a lng carrier in regular cross waves monochromatic but coming from two directions separated by 90 deg and bichromatic cross waves both numerically and experimentally see fig 7 they concluded that the interaction effect between waves from different headings is very important and should be taken into account in the estimation of excitation loads to mooring systems pessoa et al 2013 studied experimentally and numerically the first order and slowly varying motions of a floating body in bichromatic waves obtaining good agreement jiao and huang 2020 jiao et al 2021 and huang et al 2021 studied the seakeeping performance and slamming loads of a s175 containership in bi directional cross waves using cfd and compared with that in uni directional regular waves see fig 8 lee et al 2007 analysed the hydroelastic responses of a ship advancing in multi directional irregular waves by combination of 3d source distribution method dynamic response analysis and spectral analysis method publications reporting ship hydrodynamic experiments in short crested irregular waves are scarce this is partly due to the lack of laboratories capable of generating short crested waves and inadequate measurement of directional spectra in the past decades a number of laboratory tanks which are equipped with segmented wave generators capable of producing directional waves have been built ittc 2008 2011a 2014 2017 for example the actual sea model basin at the national maritime research institute nmri of japan is equipped with a total of 382 segmented flap type absorbing wave makers along the entire periphery except in front of the trim tank see fig 9 a the new wave maker at the maneuvering and seakeeping basin of carderock division naval surface warfare center nswc consists of 216 paddles 108 paddles along the long wall of the tank 60 paddles in the curve and 48 paddles along the short wall see fig 9b the wave maker is capable of regular and irregular seas multi component long and short crested seaways generating the deep water basin at heu has a dimension of 50 m long by 30 m wide by 10 m deep and has the capacity of generating multi directional waves the wave maker comprises 75 paddles which are located at one boundary of the tank see fig 9c maeda et al 1986 conducted tank experiments on motions of a floating body in two directional waves from rectangle each other and pointed out the interesting phenomena of slow drift oscillation of a moored floating body in the bi directional waves takezawa and hirayama 1989 takezawa et al 1989 and takezawa et al 1990 conducted a series of towed model tests in a long tank where the directional spectrum waves can be generated by a snake type wave maker to investigate the ship motions in directional waves ding et al 2019 studied the influence of inhomogeneous incident waves different significant wave heights mean periods and directions caused by seashore islands and reefs on hydroelastic motions and loads of very large floating structure vlfs by hydroelasticity theory and tank experiment zheng et al 2009a 2009b and chen 2011 investigated a ship model s heave roll pitch and vertical accelerations in both long and short crested waves by conducting tests in the seakeeping basin of cssrc where the tank dimension is 69 m long by 46 m wide by 4 m deep a wave probe array which comprises five wave probes was used to measure the short crested waves frequency and time domain numerical methods were also used to simulate ship motion responses in short and long crested irregular waves table 1 summarizes the ratio coefficients of roll pitch and heave responses of ship in short crested waves to those in long crested waves under equivalent sea state the same significant wave height and mean period based on theoretical calculation and tank model experiment results zheng et al 2009b they concluded that ship heave and pitch motions in short crested waves are generally greater than in equivalent long crested waves for head wave condition however this conclusion goes against with those drawn by li and wen 2007 and jiao et al 2019a jiao et al 2019a conducted a comparative study on ship motions and loads in short crested irregular waves by hydroelasticity theory small scale model towing tank test and large scale model sea trial the influence of directional function of short crested waves on ship statistical values of motions and loads for different wave headings β 0 deg denotes head wave are shown in fig 10 the results are obtained by combining frequency domain hydrodynamic theory and 2d spectral analysis the involved directional function is expressed as follows 1 d ω θ γ n 2 1 π γ n 2 1 2 cos n θ π 2 θ π 2 where θ denotes the angle between component wave and dominant wave direction γ denotes gama function n denotes positive integer rousset et al 2010 conducted segmented model tank tests in directional irregular waves the pitch motion of model in head short crested waves without speed was found to be slightly reduced compared with in long crested waves under the same significant wave height and mean period 3 2 overview of typical large scale models the publicly reported experimental models and data analyses for large scale model seakeeping tests are limited due to various reasons including confidentiality large scale model test is usually conducted by some advanced organizations especially those involved in naval applications in the recent years increasing efforts are being devoted by naval engineers and researchers towards adopting and refining this kind of testing technique the representative large scale models as far as the authors knowledge concerned are summarized in table 2 where the symbol x denotes unknown the models are briefly described as follows in the 1980s the french navy conducted a series of sea trials with a 1 12 large scale manned model about 22 m long and 20 tonnes mass denoted by model a of aircraft carrier charles de gaulle anon 1994 which is shown in fig 11 some typical devices such as fin stabilizer and transverse stabilization system were fitted on the model for testing the main objective of the large model test was to validate and improve its dedicated platform stabilization system in harsh waves so as to provide a stable platform for aircraft take off and landing faou and boudon 1997 a series of tests with respect to manoeuvrability seakeeping and propeller performance were conducted by the model in seaways which lasted for over two years the us navy developed a large steel model of destroyer ddg 1000 quintana et al 2007 grogan and borthen 2010 haas et al 2014 the 1 4 large scale model model b is about 45 m long 6 m wide and with a light ship displacement of over 90 tonnes the model was used for a variety of seakeeping and structural response measurements and finally used for underwater explosion and floodability tests the 1 4 large scale model as well as full scale and tank test model are shown in fig 12 detailed experimental information and data analysis regarding the two naval ship models are not found grigoropoulos and katsaounis 2004 reported the measurement procedure and methodology of large scale model seakeeping test at sea in their work a large scale corvette model model c as shown in fig 13 was made and tested in coastal waves the model track was monitored by a real time kinematics rtk system and motion responses were measured by an in house developed 6 dof system which consists of seven uni axial accelerometers grigoropoulos and politis 1999 a small diameter discus buoy was used to measure the directional wave spectrum the paper briefly describes the design specification instrumentation and preparation of large scale seakeeping tests as well as its advantages and shortcomings the potential applications on propulsion manoeuvrability structural loads tests by using this model are also discussed however analysis of the measured data by the large scale model is not presented shi 2007 zhao 2008 wang 2009 and sun et al 2010 made the first attempt of conducting large scale model s seakeeping tests in natural sea wave environment in china two large scale models see fig 14 were built for sea trials after a series of hull form optimization work conducted by numerical calculations zhang and li 2007 li and zhang 2008 and tank model tests li et al 2008 sun et al 2014 one traditional round bilge type hull model d was used to act as a reference ship and the other model is the newly developed deep v type hull model e which corresponds to the optimal scheme the main objective of the project was to research and develop novel naval ship with excellent rapidity and seakeeping performance another objective of the large scale measurement was to validate the effectiveness of the developed semi submerged bow ssb mounted on the deep v hull for vertical motion stabilization jiao et al 2018a comparatively analysed the seakeeping performance of the two monohulls by 2 5d theoretical calculation small scale tank test and large scale sea trial several years later two large scale segmented models were designed built and tested for seakeeping and wave loads by the same research team at heu jiao et al 2016a 2016b the two models around 12 m long and 4 tonnes mass are much larger than the previously developed models see fig 15 one large scale model model f was mainly tested for seakeeping performance and it was divided into two pieces by the midships section a short and strong backbone beam is installed to measure the sectional loads amidships the other large scale model model g was mainly tested for structural loads response and hydroelasticity thus the model was divided into seven parts and they are connected by a backbone beam which well reproduces the modal characteristics of prototype jiao et al 2016c further description of the two segmented models is reported in section 4 3 3 reproduction of full scale ocean waves it is essential to reproduce the full scale sea states of interest when conducting seakeeping tests at model scale unlike the laboratory tank wave environment the natural environment where large scale models are tested is however complex and uncontrollable therefore the first fundamental challenge for large scale model seakeeping measurement at sea is to provide an expected wave state which well reproduces full scale sea state moreover accurate measurement and description of the short crested irregular waves experienced by model is another important task of concern this section discusses the wave reproduction and measurement issues 3 3 1 key problem statements the irregular wave state in short term is usually described by the wave spectrum sun et al 2015 reported the measured coastal wave spectra in comparison with the standard ittc and other target spectra the results show that the dimensionless spectra of coastal waves agree well with full scale ocean wave spectra sun et al 2016 in fact the problem of full scale wave reproduction is however much more complex for example even though the dimensionless spectral shape of coastal waves shows good agreement with the target spectra the wave parameters such as significant wave height and characteristic period may not be similar between model and full scale simultaneously jiao et al 2018b as is well known the significant wave height h m and characteristic period t m at model scale are determined by the full scale parameters significant wave height h p and characteristic period t p as per the froude s similitude law 2 h m h p λ 3 t m t p λ where λ denotes model scaling factor an example is illustrated hereunder to explain the difficulty in wave reproduction the north atlantic sea state information is selected as a representative for full scale wave states according to the long term statistical data jiao et al 2019b the probability density distribution of significant wave height h p against zero crossing period t p of the north atlantic sea states is shown in fig 16 according to the data in fig 16 the weighted mean zero crossing periods at different significant wave heights and their cubic polynomial fitting curve are presented in fig 17 a histogram is also displayed in the figure to illustrate the occurrence probability of each significant wave height in this sea area suppose that large scale model measurements are conducted in the open ocean the model will encounter such a same sea wave environment as full scale in probability the realistic and extrapolated full scale sea states with various model scaling factors λ 1 30 by using froude s similitude law eq 2 3 are shown in fig 18 as is seen the extrapolated wave periods are generally too much greater than the realistic values in addition the difference increases dramatically with the increasing of model scaling factor on the other hand the extrapolated full scale significant wave height may be too high for investigation detailed description of this problem can be found in jiao et al 2018b as shown in fig 19 viselli et al 2015 conducted 1 8 large scale model offshore measurement of a 6 mw semi submersible floating wind turbine offshore prior to full scale construction aiming at derisking full scale commercial projects by providing scaled global motion data in the test similarity in wind force should also be satisfied in addition to wave state thus a turbine with a small rotor diameter was selected to provide correctly scaled thrust loads given the wind conditions at the test site 3 3 2 guidelines for wave reproduction as indicated from the above analysis it is difficult to reproduce full scale sea states when conducting large scale model sea trials in the open ocean fortunately dictate selecting the testing zone near the shore may be possible since the wave heights and periods of coastal waves are generally much lower than those in the open seas lloyd 1989 fonseca et al 2017 lucas et al 2017 jiao et al 2018b analysed comprehensively the possibility of ocean wave reproduction in nearshore coastal areas for large scale model seakeeping tests in the study a total of four judgment criteria i e i spectral shape ii significant wave height iii mean period and iv directional spreading are involved in the similarity analysis of waves using the wave statistical database in puerto rico virgin islands and gulf of maine that provided by the us national data buoy center the paper also summarizes the methodology and framework of large scale model experimental wave selection which is shown in fig 20 the influence of season climate model scaling sea site and offshore distance on the possibility of ocean wave reproduction for large scale model measurement is comprehensively investigated and discussed in the paper jiao et al 2019c analysed the spatial and seasonal distribution of significant wave height and mean period of china coastal waves it was also concluded that the full scale waves could be reproduced at model scale in coastal areas by properly selecting the model scaling experimental sea area climate and weather conditions which provides opportunity for large scale model seakeeping measurement full grasp of the features and principles of coastal waves is necessary for the conduct of large scale model seakeeping measurement in high efficiency jiao et al 2016b planned to establish a database of coastal waves by long term monitoring and statistical regression analysis of the nearshore waves around their large scale model experimental base glejin et al 2016 investigated the directional characteristics of shallow water waves along the southwestern bay of bengal amrutha et al 2017 analysed the long period waves in the nearshore waters of central west coast of india camus et al 2013 presents a global framework to downscale wave reanalysis to coastal areas for wave numerical simulation myrhaug et al 2016 studied the joint distribution of wave height with period this joint distribution was also studied by rodriguez and guedes soares 1999 in sea states characterised by two wave systems guedes soares 1984 emmanouil et al 2016 developed a high resolution atmospheric and wave modeling system to simulate wind speed and direction significant wave height and energy wave period guedes soares and rusu 2013 have developed a high resolution wave forecasting system for the approaches to ports and rusu et al 2011 have used wave spectral models to predict wave characteristics in very shallow water o reilly et al 2016 estimated nearshore wave conditions based on decade long offshore buoy observations along the california coast a wave height collection and statistics methodology of sea waves for seakeeping assessment is presented by parunov et al 2011 malliouri et al 2019 investigated and described the short and long term statistics for short crested waves in deep and intermediate waters the methodology presented in their paper can provide detailed and accurate information on the long term wave climate and joint distributions of significant wave height and mean period ashton et al 2013 measured ocean waves by an array of four directional wave buoys installed in a square formation with side 500 m and analysed the spatial distribution properties 3 3 3 measurement of sea waves sea wave measurement is an essential part of large scale model seakeeping experiment many types of equipments can be used to measure coastal waves such as pressure gauges tsai and tsai 2009 floating buoys ashton and johanning 2015 campos et al 2021 satellite remote sensing queffeulou and bentamy 2007 petrov et al 2019 marine radar izquierdo et al 2004 cheng and chien 2017 lidar harry et al 2018 and underwater acoustic gauges karaev et al 2014 furthermore the directional spectra of sea states can be also estimated from the motion responses of an advancing ship nielsen 2006 pascoal and guedes soares 2008 2009 nielsen and stredulinsky 2012 pascoal et al 2017 nielsen et al 2018 among the above mentioned wave measurement technologies wave buoys are considered to be the best compromise among accuracy ease of handing reliability and cost for ship seakeeping sea trials till now various types of wave buoys have been developed which differ in shape and size as well as methods used for measurement generally large scale buoys can be deployed in oceanic locations while small ones are used for nearshore or coastal wave observation sun et al 2016 reported a vertical acceleration based single point spherical buoy with diameter 0 4 m for coastal wave measurement an iron chain is connected at the bottom of the buoy to lower its barycentre and improve its stability the lower half part of the buoy is immersed in water during measurement it is expected that the buoy moves synchronously with respect to the wave surface vertical elevation whereas the pitch and roll motions are not expected since they would pollute the vertical acceleration signal the developed buoy was used for large scale model seakeeping tests with models d and e for the design of a spherical wave buoy that could accurately respond the coastal wave frequency of interest jiao et al 2018a calculated the motion responses of semi sphere with different diameter induced by unit amplitude regular wave which is shown in fig 21 it is an important task to identify the directional spreading of ocean waves in addition to frequency spectrum even though wave probe arrays are commonly used for short crested waves measurement in laboratory tanks nwogu 1989 they are not applicable for large scale model sea trial since it is difficult to find a fixed platform at sea de vries et al 2003 developed a directional wave rider gps wave buoy which consists of a sphere with a diameter of 0 4 m and a weight of 17 kg see fig 22 a an oblate spheroid type wave buoy was developed by tang and li 2004 to measure the slopes and vertical acceleration of wave surface simultaneously grigoropoulos and katsaounis 2004 developed a flat type wave buoy see fig 22b which could better respond the wave surface roll and pitch motion compared with the oblate spheroid buoy hirakawa et al 2012 developed an ultra small buoy for directional wave measurement see fig 22c the buoy has three floats at the end of tripod and the data collector is located at the center base float the directional spreading function can be estimated from the measured time series data such as surface elevation slopes or velocities by direct fourier transform dft maximum likelihood method mlm maximum entropy method mem and bayesian method from the measured data nwogu 1989 liu et al 2015 conducted both regular and irregular wave tank experiments with three different buoys i e 1 8 and 1 16 scaled wavescan models and a 1 11 25 odas buoy model and a reference wave gauge to investigate whether the wave characteristics can be accurately measured using these buoys the results indicated that the 1 16 scale wavescan buoy model performs better on measuring the wave surface than the 1 8 scale one an additional onboard wave detecting device for the measurement of incident waves at bow area will be very helpful for seakeeping data processing and analysis there are various options available commercially including acoustic and electromagnetic ranging devices a down looking radar has been used in various full scale tests silva et al 2006 and can be seen in the third figure of pascoal et al 2017 a giant wave probe based on electric resistance measurement can also be a feasible alternative extreme short term prediction of ship motions can be made by system identification based methods with incident wave data information zhang and ye 2009 these investigations have potential applications in such as aircraft landing and take off motion compensation ship borne helicopter recovery missile launching cargo transfer between ships huang et al 2014 drennan et al 1994 estimated wave directional spectra by an array of wave staffs equipped on a swath ship and proposed an algorithm for removing the effects of ship motions sun et al 2005 developed a remote sensing method to measure directional waves by three laser altimeters on an aircraft christensen et al 2013 presented a method for measuring one dimensional surface wave spectra using a ship mounted ultrasonic altimeter in combination with a motion correction device see fig 23 yumori 1981 acquired incident wave height by measuring water pressure with a pressure sensor mounted on the underwater hull surface and subtracting ship heave displacement that obtained by double integrating the heave acceleration the obtained incident wave height was then used to predict ship motions with an auto regressive moving average arma algorithm 3 4 remote control and telemetry system since large scale model sea trials are always conducted to investigate ship response in harsh and extreme seas the models are usually designed as unmanned for safety reasons thus motor speed setting and steering are usually achieved by radio control submitted from another escort ship which carries crew and researchers therefore a shipboard remote control and telemetry experimental system is necessary for large scale model measurement the gps and imu technology are generally used for large scale model s navigation and motion measurement at sea this is different from laboratory tank seakeeping test since no reference platform such as towing carriage exists at sea the real time kinematic gps receivers and a fixed base station were used to accurately measure the sinkage trim and roll of full scale ship and the related measurement details as well as data analyses are reported by gourlay and klaka 2007 the large scale model for manoeuvring tests that developed by coraddu et al 2013 was equipped with technical devices including difference global positioning system dgps imu torque and thrusts meters on the propeller axis dynamo tachometers and real time data transmission devices the tests were conducted in a natural volcanic lake which has been included in the official ittc facility data sheet see fig 24 sun et al 2010 and wang 2009 developed a remote control and telemetry system for large scale model seakeeping test for the models d and e the experimental system mainly includes propulsion unit rudder control unit remote control unit emergency rescue unit and data acquisition unit the model speed was roughly estimated from motor rpm and calibration test had been conducted in a calm water river prior to the sea trial the rudder was remotely controlled and steered by a researcher with the help of a suite of worm gear mechanism global motion signal of the model was saved by an onboard data collector which also transmitted the data to the base station arrangement of the technique sensors on the deep v model model e is shown in fig 25 jiao et al 2016a 2016b 2016c 2017a updated the remote control and telemetry system on the basis of the previous system established by sun et al 2010 a dedicated commercial gps ins device was developed to measure the large scale model s sailing trace position speeds and motions at sea the course of model in the seaway was kept intelligently with the help of a commercial autopilot which was produced by the us garmin ltd garmin 2011 radio stations were adopted to facilitate communications between the testing model and the escort yacht during measurement the model s sailing state would be displayed on the screen of a laptop on the escort yacht typical software interfaces are shown in fig 26 framework of the remote control and telemetry system is shown in figs 27 and 28 respectively lin et al 2020 developed a comprehensive test system see fig 29 for large scale ship model measurement in actual sea environment which is mainly used for resistance and propulsion tests but manoeuvrability and seakeeping tests can be also conducted using this system the seakeeping tests are usually conducted with three control strategies sea state sailing speed and heading angle a fleet of three vessels i e the large scale model the auxiliary environment measuring boat and the escort yacht were used for the sea trial measurement jiao et al 2016b during the measurement the escort yacht run together with the testing model and control it by radio signal the environment monitoring boat will be anchored at the centre of model s sailing trace during in situ environment measurement an appropriate sequence of running direction can minimize the gap between the runs and the average distance from the wave buoy the effect of factors that by changing during the trial influence the results can also be minimized johnson 2004 and prini et al 2018 summarized the commonly adopted trajectories in seakeeping sea trials the experimental procedure and trajectory developed by jiao et al 2017a is shown in fig 30 3 5 ship seakeeping response analyses large scale sea trials are valuable in assessing the response of actual ship operating in real irregular seaways they also allow the investigation of strongly nonlinear motion and load effects that are challenging to capture with numerical simulations or tank model tests for the very same reasons the data analysis is challenging and can significantly affect the outcome the most fundamental seakeeping data processing method includes spectral analysis which gives the frequency spectrum and statistical values such as root mean square or significant value of ship motions and loads in short term irregular waves the frequency spectral methods have been widely used for processing full scale and tank test seakeeping data denis and pierson 1953 journée and massie 2001 tello et al 2011 cakici and aydin 2014 maggi et al 1998 compared frequency responses of a customs vessel with length overall 20 m with the results of full scale sea trial 1 12 scaled tank test and strip theory calculation jiao et al 2018a presented comparative dimensionless spectra of heave pitch and bow vertical acceleration of ships models d and e between by large scale model sea trial in short crested waves and small scale model tank test in long crested waves under equivalent sea state level 6 and at head wave speed 24 knots see fig 31 the results indicate that the spectral density of heave and acceleration by small scale model tank test concentrates around the peak frequency with a narrow band distribution while the large scale model s spectral density disperses over a broader frequency range this can be attributed to the 3d effects of sea waves similar results can be found from the testing results of the model g jiao et al 2016a sun et al 2015 concluded that the frequency of green water on deck of the large scale models d and e is respectively 28 and 85 reduced compared with long crested wave tank test results the physical phenomena of green water on the large scale model s deck at sea are more realistic compared with tank test see fig 32 in order to investigate the influence of directional spreading of short crested waves on ship response jiao et al 2016a developed an approximate analysis method which extracts dominant wave components from the overall sea waves and then estimated ship response under the dominant direction waves fig 33 a shows the ratios of statistical significant value for pitch roll bow acceleration stern acceleration and vertical bending moment vbm amidships of small scale model tank test result to that of large scale model sea trial with model g under equivalent sea states fig 33b additionally includes the ship response ratios of small scale model to large scale model that induced by unit amplitude of dominant direction wave it is noted that the large scale model response was processed by dividing the dominant direction significant wave height it was concluded that hull vertical responses when sailing in head short crested waves are mainly induced by the oncoming dominant direction waves the component incident waves even though contributed to the overall wave height have much less effect on hull vertical responses therefore the tank model test in long crested wave could overestimate the response statistical values of ship in a specified sea state compared with the real condition in fact the linear spectral analysis method cannot interpret the nonlinear characteristics of the measured time series such as asymmetry in crest and trough because various spectral components may interact with other components the realistic sea waves and ship large amplitude motion and load responses are associated with certain nonlinearity there is normally a large amount of information hidden in the measurement data from ship model tests zhang 2008 developed a nonlinear spectral analysis method to obtain high order frequency response function and then accurately predict ship nonlinear motions the linear and second order nonlinear frequency response functions are respectively obtained by 4 h 1 ω s x y ω s x x ω 5 h 2 ω 1 ω 2 s x x y ω 1 ω 2 2 s x x ω 1 s x x ω 2 where ω denotes circular frequency the subscript x and y denotes wave input and ship response output e g pitch and heave respectively s xx ω denotes auto spectral density function s xy ω and s xxy ω denotes first order and second order cross spectral density function respectively the estimated linear and nonlinear pitch frequency response functions of the round bilge ship by tank model test and large scale sea trial with model d under equivalent sea state level 5 and at 18 knots are compared in fig 34 zhu and moan 2013 also used nonlinear bi spectral analysis method to evaluate the influence of second harmonics wave loads and nonlinear wave interactions with tank model testing results time domain processing methods are necessary to be adopted for large scale model response analysis michael et al 1983 estimated the heave pitch roll sway and yaw motions of a destroyer by kalman filtering techniques for application in aircraft landing jiao et al 2019d outlined a scheme of full scale response extrapolation method from large scale model measurement data based on system identification the nonlinear auto regressive moving average model with exogenous input narmax algorithm ji et al 2008 is used to identify ship intrinsic time domain response function based on the measured bow incident wave and ship responses and then the ship time domain motion responses can be predicted with any specified input wave information due to the fact that onboard wave meter was not equipped on the authors previously conducted large scale models an example of ship heave and pitch responses extrapolated by the narmax algorithm using tank model data is presented in fig 35 it is noted that the system identification and motion prediction were made using towing tank long crested irregular wave testing data however the effectiveness and stability of the narmax algorithm in application for ship operating in short crested wave or oblique wave cases should also be further investigated even though the bow incident wave can be measured by the technique introduced in section 3 3 3 sun et al 2009 and zhang et al 2008 predicted ship nonlinear frequency response function by combing narmax algorithm with harmonic probing method wilson 1981 and also compared the results with those by high order spectral analysis method su et al 2020b proposed a real time ship vertical acceleration prediction algorithm based on the long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent units gru models of a recurrent neural network and the proposed method is used to predict the vertical acceleration of the large scale model model i at sea 4 structural loads and response experiments the structural response and elastic deformation of large ships operating in harsh waves should also be of concern to the designers and operators full scale sea trials are believed to be the most realistic and reliable method to obtain the loads behaviour and responses of ships which have been increasingly reported in the past issc loads committees issc 2012 2015 2018 a number of full scale measurements focus on investigating slamming and whipping responses of large ships especially the containerships due to their ever increasing industrial applications and relatively high risk have been conducted lee et al 2010 recorded the long term hull girder loads and navigation data of an 8063 teu containership by hull stress monitoring system hsms and analysed the extreme load events by statistical methods andersen and jensen 2014 investigated the extreme vertical loads acting on a 9400 teu container carrier using the full scale measurement data of hull girder strains motions navigational data and the encountered sea state that collected during a period of two years kim et al 2018 investigated the modal behaviour such as the mode shapes natural frequencies and damping ratios of a 9400 teu container carrier by full scale measurement since the external environmental loads on ships are random complex and unpredictable more and more structural health monitoring systems are used to real time record analysis evaluation warning and assist decision making of the sea conditions and structural response encountered in the service process of real ship lindemann et al 1977 perera et al 2012 mondoro et al 2016 wang et al 2018b mieloszyk et al 2021 tank model tests are widely used for the investigation of ship wave loads there are basically three kinds of physical models in use for ship wave loads and hydroelasticity measurement monoblock elastic model watanabe et al 1989 lin et al 1992 segmented hinged model zhu and moan 2014 and segmented model with backbone beam marón et al 2004 fonseca and guedes soares 2004 thomas et al 2011 jiao and ren 2016 rajendran et al 2016a the segmented model test is the most popular approach among them lewis 1954 made the pioneering work of hydroelasticity test and already studied the slamming and whipping events a series of wave loads model experiments were conducted within the scope of the joint industry project jip of wave induced loads on ships wils organized by the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering risoe kim et al 2010 2014 lee et al 2011 hong and kim 2014 a chinese jip which focuses on springing and whipping benchmark study with a 20 000 teu containership was initiated by cssrc which will last for three years from 2018 to 2021 initial results from this program can be found in feng et al 2021 comprehensive reviews of ship wave loads and hydroelasticity tank model tests can be found in jiao et al 2017b tian and wu 2008 and marón and kapsenberg 2014 4 1 structural design of large scale segmented model large scale model wave loads tests are conducted to better understand the structural loads and responses acting on full scale ships leguen and fréchou 2007 made a 25 m frigate model 1 5 large scale whose hull structure is in mechanical similarity to the full scale the model was built to maintain elastic similarity and proper scaling relation between modes of resonance between the model and real ship seakeeping and hydroelasticity model experiments were conducted in the towing tank of french marine institute the main purpose of this large scale model experiment was to collect data for the validation of design tools for predictions of hull motions and structural responses in the recent years jiao et al 2016a 2016b 2016c conducted a series of large scale segmented model measurements at sea for wave induced and slamming loads investigations two segmented models models f and g with steel backbone were made by frp and the sea trials were performed in the period from 2015 to 2017 another segmented model model h corresponding to a 20 000 teu containership was made of steel and tested by the same team in the year 2018 main parameters of the three large scale segmented models are summarized in table 3 as afore mentioned in section 3 2 the two segment ship model model f was mainly used for seakeeping measurement of global motions and green water on deck the model was divided into two parts so that the vbm amidships can be also measured the two segments were connected by a short and strong backbone beam without similarity in stiffness or natural frequency only the wave frequency vbm was involved for investigation since the high frequency slamming and whipping loads cannot be reproduced by the backbone view of this large scale model and testing scene at sea are shown in fig 36 the large scale model was tested in coastal waves of bohai bay china the motivation of the large scale sea trial was to final validate the seakeeping performance of the ship sailing in realistic harsh waves at high speed with a series of tank model tests being conducted but prior to prototype construction the testing schemes are mainly focus on extreme conditions such as full scale significant wave heights 6 m and 9 m and ship forward speeds 18 knots 24 knots and 30 knots the 1 25 large scale segmented model model g that equipped with backbone beam was used for wave loads and hydroelasticity tests at sea jiao et al 2016a the large scale model was built in 2015 and the sea trial activities had lasted for over three years an additional 1 50 small scale model was also made and tested in laboratory tanks for comparative investigation on ship motions and loads at different scales and in different wave environments for the comparative investigations model setup and sensor arrangement of the two models were designed to be almost the same see figs 37 and 38 a series of tank tests were conducted with the small scale model in three different laboratory tanks for different testing conditions jiao et al 2015a 2016e jiao and ren 2016 both the two segmented models with different scales were divided into seven parts by the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th divisions in order to measure the sectional loads at these cut sections stations from 13th to 20th at the stern area are used for housing the self propelled mechanism which includes motors shafts gearboxes and propellers rectangular hollow structure backbones are adopted at the 1st 5th and 7th 13th sections to measure sectional vbm and horizontal bending moment hbm cylindrical hollow structure backbone is adopted at the 5th 7th sections to measure torsional moment tm in addition to vbm and hbm the backbones were designed with variable cross section to provide similarity in stiffness distribution and first order natural frequency with full scale overview of sensor arrangement on the large scale model is shown in fig 39 moreover a set of in house developed structural health monitoring system which is intended to be used for full scale ships hull stress monitoring and evaluation was fitted onboard the large scale model for a preliminary trial and validation prior to its full scale applications jiao et al 2017a the in house developed structural health monitoring system comprises three modules the stress monitoring unit the structure strength assessment unit and the hull stress database unit the stress monitoring unit is responsible for transforming the measured strain signal into stress in real time the optical signal detected by sensors is transformed into electrical signal with the help of an optic sensor demodulator the structural strength assessment unit is used to evaluate both the fatigue strength and yield strength of hull based on the measured stress data and a developed algorithm the fatigue strength of hull is evaluated according to the palmgren miner damage summation rule while the yield strength is evaluated based on the reliability theory the hull stress database unit is used for the storage of real time monitoring data and assessment results fig 40 shows the fiber optic sensors mounted on the backbone beam of the large scale segmented model seven fiber optic sensors were installed on the backbone beam among which one was used for temperature compensation it is noted that the sectional strain at the six cut divisions were measured by both the fiber optic sensors and resistance strain gauges for comparison more detailed information of the structural health monitoring system and the measurement data from the large scale model sea trials can be found in tang et al 2016 in the year 2018 a 20 m long large scale segmented model model h corresponding to a 20 000 teu containership was made with a steel shell of 5 mm thick liu 2019 this large model was initially planed to be built as a monoblock elastic steel model by elaborately design of global and local structures and stiffness distribution however this scheme was not accepted by the research team considering the fact that the global sectional loads i e vbm hbm and tm of ship in short crested waves are difficult to be exactly identified from a complex hull cross section structure finally the scheme of segmented steel model with steel backbone system was adopted nevertheless the monoblock elastic model scheme is still under development and will be adopted in our future large scale experimental activities the model was cut at stations 4 6 10 14 and 16 see fig 41 a continuous box backbone beam was equipped from station 1 to 18 to connect the segments a rectangular hole was provided in the upper side of the backbone beam from station 8 to 13 to obtain an open u shape for large deck opening simulation the sectional loads on the u shaped beam were measured by the method developed by jiao et al 2015b a group of pressure gauges were mounted at bow flare area of the model see fig 42 general arrangement and 3d modeling of the large scale containership model is shown in fig 43 the model was also designed to be equipped with superstructures to take wind resistance effects into account the large steel model was constructed in a shipyard at huludao china then the model was launched into the sea for experiments with the help of a 380 tons class gantry crane in the shipyard see fig 44 in the future work more kinds of backbone beams can be designed and adopted for large scale model wave loads measurement so as to better reproduce the load responses on ship for example marón and kapsenberg 2014 used a box beam with rectangular holes provided in several positions on the upper side of the beam to obtain an open u shape the sectional load components including three forces and three moments were measured and determined from a group of 10 strain gauges lee et al 2011 designed u shape backbone and h shape backbone schemes for tank model s springing and whipping tests in the wils jip work zhu et al 2011 developed a model with 17 segments connected by an aluminum backbone beam on its top five rectangular openings are provided on the top side of the beam to reduce the torsional stiffness so that realistic natural frequencies of torsional modes are obtained in addition to those of vertical and horizontal bending modes tang et al 2017 designed a suite of cylindrical steel backbone with variable cross sections to simulate the longitudinal stiffness distribution of a trimaran 4 2 structural design of large scale fully elastic monoblock model in addition to the segmented models adopting and testing large scale monoblock elastic model is even more interesting which has unique advantages in the investigation of local structural loads on real ships however there are two key issues related to this model the design of model structure in mechanical similarity and loads measurement scheme the first problem can be addressed by designing a simplified structural model in mechanical and stiffness similarity with the help of fea software at model design stage which will be briefly described hereunder however when it comes to the second problem it is difficult to fully grasp the loads distribution on the relatively simplified hull structure in complex and random sea waves with limited number of stress measurement points for example only the local stress or strain at critical points such as on deck or bottom plates at midship section are measured and analysed by full elastic model experiment the global sectional vbm is then roughly estimated by multiplying section modulus with the measured stress based on simple beam theory however the stress distribution on the cross section can be very complex another limitation associated with this measurement method is that it is difficult to accurately separate the load components e g vbm hbm tm and axial force from the measured total stress nevertheless this problem is hopefully to be addressed in the future with the advent of state of the art stress distribution measurement technology the scheme of small scale fully elastic monoblock models which are made of special material such as copper and composite for tank model wave loads test are reported in some early publications akita and ochi 1955 watanabe et al 1989 lin et al 1992 according to lin et al 1992 the materials should have a proper young modulus which is of the order of 1 that of steel and poisson ratio to match the elastic effects similitude this makes the material difficult to be found watanabe et al 1989 used synthetic resin and foam urethane and lin et al 1992 used special synthetic material abs702 for making the elastic model with a length of the order of 4 m for tank test however such material is not applicable for the construction of large scale model for reasons such as cost the large scale monoblock flexible model is most suitable to be made of steel fortunately the increase of model dimension makes the steel model hull can be made with similar shipbuilding technology as of real ship a scheme of monoblock elastic model with simplified structure is proposed in one of the author s patent ship model with simplified structure for hydroelasticity experiment and its design method 2 2 patent application no cn 201911250354 0 granted chinese invention patent fig 45 shows an example of the simplified transverse section of model in comparison with the real ship the model s shell plate thickness is usually thicker than the value obtained by similitude law the model s sectional stiffness and position of neutral axis can be design to be similar with prototype by adjusting the size number and position of longitudinals fig 46 shows a sketch of the simplified large scale fully elastic model the methods for ship structure design of scaled model have also been reported in some references in relation to ship structural experiment for example sun and guedes soares 2003 made two ship type models which reflect the possible failure modes of large open deck ships under pure torque for ultimate torsional strength experiment shi and wang 2012 designed a simplified single bottom structure model for experimental investigation of the hogging ultimate strength of a double bottoms containership see fig 47 a wang et al 2019c designed a simplified scale model of a 10 000 teu container ship for ultimate strength experiment of both longitudinal bending and torsion analysis see fig 47b they proposed a similarity theory to design the scale model which provides similar height of neutral axis section modulus inertia moment about neutral axis and polar inertia moment as those of full scale prini et al 2018 described a measurement scheme for global sectional vbm on a 17 m full scale ship with three or four strain gauges mounted on the hull bottom or deck zhu et al 2011 measured sectional vbm hbm and tm on rectangular cross section of backbone with a total of 12 unidirectional strain gauges 4 3 wave loads analyses a series of data analysis on large scale model s wave loads and hydroelasticity were conduced in previous work fig 48 shows the experimental scene during large scale model sea trial of model g it can be observed that both the sea waves and ship responses are associated with strong nonlinearity the time series of pitch roll vertical acceleration at bow deck vbms at bow and amidships stations by the large scale model measurement in extreme and design sea states at full scale speed 18 knots are presented in fig 49 jiao et al 2016a it was found that the roll motion is pronounced even though the model was sailing in head seas compared with the motion signals the vbm signals are neither linear nor stationary the spectral shape and statistical values of motions and loads are compared between the results by large scale sea trial and small scale tank test in the reference jiao et al 2016a it was found that the traditional long crested wave tank model test over estimates the statistical values of motions and wave loads jiao et al 2016f analysed the short term extreme values of ship motions and vbm based on a 2 h voyage measurement data of the large scale model model g the weibull distribution function was used to fit the statistical peak values for long term design loads prediction see fig 50 the statistics of pitch and roll peaks shows a good agreement with the weibull distribution however the statistics of acceleration and vbm loads show differences between measurement and the weibull statistical model mainly due to the nonlinear behaviour caused by severe sea waves jiao et al 2016g identified the wetted natural frequency of the large scale model by impact hammer test the authors also investigated the longitudinal distribution of significant amplitude value and extreme value for both vbm and hbm it was found that the hbm loads are nearly as large as vbm when the ship was sailing in realistic severe bow oblique waves so enough attention should also be paid to the horizontal strength of ships at design stage due to the non stationarity and nonlinearities of wave induced load signal reliable methods should be further adopted to analysis the large scale model s loads data in order to overcome the drawbacks such as spurious harmonics associate with fourier analysis rousset et al 2010 possessed the nonlinear and non stationary wave loads time series by hilbert huang transform hht which combines the empirical mode decomposition emd with hilbert spectral analysis to decompose the load components pedersen and jensen 2009 proposed a closed form expression to estimate hull girder vbm including nonlinear and flexibility effects for calculation of the short and long term distribution of wave induced and slamming induced stresses gaidai et al 2018 described a practical method for the prediction of extreme stress acting on full scale containership with sea trial measurement data 4 4 slamming and whipping loads throughout the maritime world considerable efforts have been spent on predicting loads associated with slamming and whipping kapsenberg 2011 wang and guedes soares 2013 2016a b and a variety of methods have been used to analyse them wang and guedes soares 2017 however large and full scale ship sea trial data regarding slamming loads are relatively scarce and valuable camilleri et al 2018 investigated the slamming loads and responses on a 9 6 m high speed planning craft by full scale measurement at sea methods for processing the slamming pressure data from sea trial measurement such as removing the trends from strain signals and identifying the peaks in the pressure and strain signals are developed and reported andersen and jensen 2014 analysed full scale measurement data of a 9400 teu containership and found that whipping effects increase more hogging than sagging loads which is however opposite from the results by tank model test that reported by zhu and moan 2013 jacobi et al 2014 investigated the slamming behaviour of a 98 m wave piercer catamaran by full scale measurement jiao et al 2016b presented the short term time series of motions and loads acting on the large scale model model g at full scale speed 19 knots in a wave state level 6 see fig 51 the presented signals include pitch bow vertical acceleration vertical bending stress and horizontal bending stress at bow station 2 where slamming is relatively severe in model scale the time series of total stress were filtered into wave frequency and whipping components and the whipping stress are presented together with the slamming pressure measured by bow pressure gauge no 1 the position can be seen in fig 39 it was found that the horizontal loads are almost of the same order of magnitude as vertical loads when ship sailing in bow oblique seas pronounced high frequency horizontal whipping loads were also observed when slamming events took place this is very different from the results of tank model testing in head wave conditions therefore attention should also be paid to horizontal strength of ships even sailing in head sea waves similar results can be found in jiao et al 2019e where both the full scale vbm and hbm acting on the same model during an extreme slamming event are presented see fig 52 the transient whipping sagging vbm loads at bow is nearly two times as large as the wave frequency vbm the transient total hbm at bow around 364 mnm is even greater than the corresponding vbm at bow around 280 mnm even though the transient total hbm amidships around 1550 mnm is lower than the total vbm amidships around 2080 mnm large containerships with bow flare are prone to slamming in harsh waves the slamming phenomena on the large scale containership model model h in a sea state level 7 are shown in fig 53 typical time series of impact pressure the position can be seen in fig 41 within 200 s and its local view within 50 s are presented in fig 54 the sample rate of impact pressure was set at 500 hz as a compromise between the slamming peak capture requirement and the available storage memory of data collector the slamming pressure peaks at gauge no 3 in centreline are much greater than gauges nos 5 and 6 at side bow area jiao et al 2019e conducted a comparative study on the motions and wave loads between large scale model test with model g and small scale model tank test the statistical parameters of pitch and vbm by different model measurements in the equivalent sea state level 6 are summarized in table 4 where the results are presented at full scale for the convenience of comparison the large scale model s standard deviations of pitch and vbm at stations 2 and 10 in head wave are respectively 3 35 17 45 and 17 72 larger than in starboard bow wave condition however although the sea wave level ship speed and wave heading are the same the large scale model s standard deviations of pitch and vbm at stations 2 and 10 are respectively 29 12 23 48 and 24 73 lower than the small scale model results this indicates that the long crested waves would highly overestimate the standard deviation of ship motions and loads even though sailing in a same condition the skewness and kurtosis of pitch motion are generally small apart from that the kurtosis of large scale model in head wave is 0 940 the skewness and kurtosis of large scale model s vbm are obviously deviation from the gaussian distribution due to the strong nonlinearity of ship responses in realistic sea waves especially for the vbm statistical results at bow when sailing in head waves the comparisons of probability of exceedance for peaks of pitch and vbm between large and small scale model testing results are presented in figs 55 and 56 respectively jiao et al 2019e as is seen the peaks of crest and trough of pitch motion are symmetrically distributed and only a slight asymmetry is observed at the tail of the distribution for all the three cases the largest pitch peak shows similar magnitude between large and small model in head wave conditions however the corresponding occurrence probability is lower for large scale model test the probability of exceedance of large scale model s pitch at low pitch peak value is also much smaller than the small scale model result which explains the reason that the standard deviation of large scale model s pitch is 29 12 lower than small scale model result similar phenomenon can be also found by comparing the vbm results in cases 2 and 3 although the standard deviations of vbm in realistic sea waves are approximately 24 lower than those in tank waves the extreme vbm values in realistic sea waves are however much larger as found from the tail of vbm distribution especially at station 2 in the head wave case this means that the rarely occurring events extreme loads are more frequently occurred in realistic sea waves than in tank waves thus the large scale model sea trial is a potential tool in the reproduction of rarely occurring events and nonlinear motions and loads of full scale ship sailing in seaways 5 discussion on experimental uncertainty at issc the assessment of uncertainty has been a permanent subject of research in particular in the issc committee i 2 loads which has produced several studies guedes soares 1996 has analysed the effect of the uncertainty in the wave scatter diagrams and on the transfer functions guedes soares 1999 has reported on the model uncertainty of the long term wave induced load effects in a containership and a tanker watanabe and guedes soares 1999 presented a benchmark study of different non linear time domain codes applied to study the vertical wave induced bending moment in a containership in waves of different steepness one of the emerging issues in ittc activities is the uncertainty analysis kim and hermansky 2014 the issc and ittc jointly held a workshop in 2012 in order to understand the uncertainties in the description of environment predictions of loads and responses of marine structures and risk assessment and mitigation in design and operation qiu et al 2014 according to the classification made in the report of the seakeeping committee in ittc 2017 seven groups of uncertainties are identified in seakeeping tests uncertainty of instruments uncertainty of model mass properties model geometry uncertainty uncertainty of the test setup calibration uncertainty measurement uncertainty and data reduction uncertainty guedes soares 1991 introduced the observation of uncertainty for different theories of wave induced motions and loads of ships in this pioneering work the uncertainties of computational models were assessed from comparisons with model experiments gavrilin and steen 2015 presented the uncertainty analyses of full scale turning circle trials using monte carlo techniques the uncertainties in full scale measurements were caused by the changing environmental data drummen and holtmann 2014 reported a benchmark study of slamming and whipping in relation to modal response impulsive loading and regular head wave response parunov et al 2020 presented a benchmark study aimed at the uncertainty assessment of numerical predictions of global wave loads on damaged ships zhou et al 2020 studied the uncertainty of ship model propulsion test using the large scale model measurement data of model i and the influence of the experimental environment was quantified the accuracy of ship geometry parameters distribution of mass and inertia and reynolds number similarity of large scale model are improved compared with towing tank model test which will reduce the experimental uncertainty however during the sea trials of resistance and propulsion tests the uncertainties within sensor measurement accuracy ship speed and course angle and their effects on the results should be considered in addition the external ocean environment is not well controlled as in the laboratory thus the wind wave and current could contribute to the experimental uncertainty during calm water measurements although the data obtained by large scale model seakeeping trials is unquestionable there are more uncertainties that are relevant to the data collected at sea which are mainly attributed to the lack of control over the complex sea environment the realistic sea waves have a strong randomness and nonlinearity and they are characterized with broad band frequency distribution and direction spreading however wave buoys are only responsible in the measurement of wave components in a certain range of frequency which has been explained in fig 21 in addition to the measurement uncertainty the coastal and near shore waves may associate with shoaling diffraction refraction reflection and breaking effects many sea states found at sea are more complex and they can be composed by one wind sea spectrum and an additional swell spectrum and they even come from different directions guedes soares 1984 vettor and guedes soares 2020 in fact a detailed study of the wave spectra showed that several shapes of spectra can be identified and classified in classes in a given location lucas et al 2011 moreover the wave data measured by wave buoys is neither local nor synchronous with respect to the ship model ashton et al 2013 investigated the spatial distribution of ocean wave spectral parameters using measurements from an array of four directional wave buoys installed in a square formation with side length 500 m it was demonstrated that wave conditions cannot be considered stationary across the measurement area and differences were observed primarily in the low frequencies even though onboard wave meter allows the local and synchronous wave measurement the wave data correction by removing the ship 6 dof motions is still a challenging work that needs further development in the laboratory tank tests the forward speed and heading angle of models are well controlled with the help of towing carriage however the deviation from mean value of forward speed and heading of large scale model at sea would be larger which would contribute to experimental uncertainty an example of the measured time series of speed and heading angle of the large scale model model g during seakeeping measurement is illustrated in fig 57 as is seen the fluctuation of navigational speed and heading angle in the period between 6100 s and 6800 s are about 0 1 m s resultant speed around 2 m s and 5 respectively the fluctuations are acceptable for the study of full scale response in a sea state level 6 significant wave height 6 65 m and ship speed 19 knots in addition the accuracy in speed and trajectory measurement with gps system should also be concerned 6 conclusions and recommendations in this paper large scale model at sea measurements for ship hydrodynamics and structural loads are comprehensively reviewed the advantages and drawbacks of large scale model tests compared with laboratory tank tests and full scale sea trials are also discussed in general the large scale model sea trial is a potential tool in investigating nonlinear motions and loads on full scale ships almost all kinds of hydrodynamic tests such as stability floodability resistance propulsion cavitation manoeuvrability seakeeping and structural loads can be carried out by large scale model measurement even though the data obtained by large scale model test is more realistic there are still some problems and difficulties inherent to this testing technique mainly due to the uncontrollability of natural environment till now the reported work regarding large scale model sea trials are limited there has been no published paper reporting the comparison of large scale model testing results against full scale sea trial results which would pose numerous challenges and are costly to acquire even under normal circumstances such research will be highly interesting and helpful in examining the credibility and appropriateness of large scale model results in addition more attentions should be paid to the uncertainty analysis and benchmark study of large scale model measurement data in the future work large scale model measurement is still a technique in progress according to the scientific community of naoe future development trend of ship experiments includes performing large and full scale trials in natural environment it is worth mentioning that the classical laboratory tank tests definitely have their obvious advantages and contributions in ship hydrodynamics investigations the large scale model testing technique is positioned as a supplement to the classical tank tests and full scale trial and it is mainly aimed to be used for investigating some strongly nonlinear fsi problems and rarely occurring events it is also expected to be conducted prior to the design and construction of full scale ship to derisk new technology and commercial cost therefore there should be a good balance between the development of different testing methods so as to better serve the scientific community of ship design and research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

20872,this paper is concerned with a coordinated target tracking problem for a network of unmanned surface vehicles usvs subject to communication delays and constrained actuation resources the target to be tracked maneuvers with arbitrary velocity its position can be measured by a small fraction of usvs whereas its velocity is not known to follower usvs a resource aware event triggered control design method is presented for coordinated target tracking specifically a distributed event triggered extended state observer eso is designed to estimate the position and velocity of the target over a cooperative estimation network furthermore the above result is extended to cooperative estimation subject to communication delays and a time delayed distributed event triggered eso is designed in the control law design an event triggered anti disturbance position tracking control law is proposed for each follower usv based on a reduced order eso by the proposed resource aware event triggered control laws cooperative target tracking can be achieved regardless of the model uncertainty and external disturbances moreover both the execution rate of the actuators and communication burden of the network are reduced the stability of the closed loop system is proven through input to state stability and cascade stability analysis simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the coordinated target tracking of usvs keywords coordinated target tracking unmanned surface vehicles distributed event triggered eso event triggered actuation communication delays 1 introduction motion control of marine vehicles has received a surge of interests due to the fact they are vital tools in various oceanic applications such as environment monitoring biological detection search and rescue and sensor network fossen 2011 liao et al 2019 peng et al 2020c current studies are beyond the control of a single marine vehicle and a lot of works are dedicated to cooperative control of multiple marine vehicles apparently cooperative control enables individual usvs to execute more challenging tasks over a single usv in terms of enhanced efficiency and effectiveness qin et al 2019 peng et al 2020b cooperative motion control scenarios include coordinated trajectory tracking zou and meng 2019 chen et al 2019 coordinated path following gu et al 2018 coordinated target tracking yu et al 2019 yan et al 2018 yu et al 2015 and coordinated target enclosing lan et al 2019 zheng et al 2015 in particular coordinated target tracking is to enforce multiple vehicles to track a moving target while keeping a desired formation and completing specific tasks except the instantaneous movement of the target the future behavior of the target may not be known in advance breivik et al 2008 in recent years target tracking of marine vehicles has been widely studied see for example breivik et al 2008 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 in breivik et al 2008 a target tracking control law is proposed for one usv to track one target vehicle moving along a straight line in shojaei 2015 a target tracking controller is developed for one follower msv to track one target with limited torque under environmental disturbances jin 2016 presents a target tracking control law for one autonomous surface vessel asv to track one target with los range and angle constraints however in practice the velocity information of the target may not be available by the followers because of the limited sensing capabilities in order to track the leader with unknown dynamics a variety of control methods are available fossen 2011 sinisterra et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in fossen 2011 a straight line target tracking controller is developed for one underactuated usv to track one moving target with a high speed in peng et al 2013 a robust adaptive formation controller is developed for one asv to track one target by employing nns and a dynamic surface control dsc technique in sinisterra et al 2017 a target tracking system is designed for one usv and the speed of a marine vehicle is estimated by a stereovision based methodology in liu et al 2018 a target tracking controller design method is presented for one asv to track one target in the presence of unknown dynamics and limited control torques however the proposed methods in aforementioned works fossen 2011 sinisterra et al 2017 liu et al 2018 are designed for one follower vehicle to track one target these methods may limit the applications of usvs in challenging tasks such as cooperative tracking an underwater submarine by using a fleet of usvs there are some results available on the cooperative target tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs yu et al 2019 unmanned ground vehicles ugvs briñón arranz et al 2019 yu et al 2015 and unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs yan et al 2018 in yu et al 2019 a weighted average consensus based unscented information filter is proposed to achieve cooperative target tracking briñón arranz et al 2019 presents a circular formation control method for target tracking with a fleet of unicycles in yu et al 2015 a cooperative target tracking method based on a dynamic occupancy grid for uavs and ugvs in urban environments is presented in yan et al 2018 a consensus based coordinated target tracking strategy is presented for multiple uuvs the methods in aforementioned works yu et al 2019 briñón arranz et al 2019 yu et al 2015 yan et al 2018 are time triggered which may demand large communication and actuation resources in the maritime environments the communication bandwidth could be limited and it is desirable to integrate the event triggered mechanism into coordinated target tracking system for reducing network burden jain et al 2018 li et al 2020 peng et al 2021 moreover the aforementioned works yu et al 2019 briñón arranz et al 2019 yu et al 2015 yan et al 2018 do not consider communication delays in communication channels motivated by the above observations a resource aware control method for a group of usvs to achieve coordinated target tracking by using an event triggered mechanism is studied by taking into account no communication delays and communication delays at first a distributed event triggered eso is presented to estimate the position and velocity of the target over a cooperative estimation network based on the distributed event triggered eso the communication burden can be reduced in addition the above result is extended to cooperative estimation subject to communication delays and a time delayed distributed event triggered eso is designed the communication burden can be reduced by the distributed event triggered eso to reduce the actuation frequency of the actuators an event triggered position tracking control law is proposed based on a reduced order eso for each follower usv finally through the cascade stability analysis the closed loop coordinated target tracking system is proven to be input to state stable iss the salient features of the presented paper are three folds in contrast to the existing works in breivik et al 2008 fossen 2011 peng et al 2013 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 sinisterra et al 2017 and liu et al 2018 where the proposed control laws are designed for one follower marine vehicle to track one target vehicle a distributed estimation and control architecture is proposed for multiple usvs to track one moving target in a cooperative manner it is the first attempt to address the resource aware cooperative target tracking problem of multiple usvs with a dynamic leader moving at an unknown velocity in contrast to the works in peng et al 2021 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 fu and yu 2018 liu et al 2019 peng and wan 2018 liu et al 2018 cui et al 2017a and liu et al 2017 where the esos are used to estimate the disturbance in system dynamics a time delayed distributed event triggered eso is proposed for usvs such that the leader velocity can be recovered through a cooperative estimation network and the communication burden between esos can be reduced in the presence of communication delays in contrast to the target tracking control laws proposed in breivik et al 2008 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 fossen 2011 sinisterra et al 2017 and liu et al 2018 event triggered positioning tracking control laws are proposed such that the actuation frequency can be decreased and the desired performance can be maintained in addition compared with the traditional backstepping and dsc methods the computational complexity of the proposed method is reduced thanks to the reduced order eso the rest of the paper is organized as follows the preliminaries and problem formulation are presented in section 2 the design and analysis of the position tracking control law is presented in section 3 simulation results are presented in section 4 section 5 concludes this paper 2 preliminaries 2 1 graph theory a graph g v e is introduced to describe the communication topology for a fleet of usvs where v n 0 n 1 n n is a node set and e n i n j v v is an edge set an adjacency matrix a a i j ℜ n n is a square matrix and defined as follows 1 a a i j 1 if i j e a i j 0 if i j e a i i 0 then the laplacian matrix is defined as l d a where d diag d i as the in degree matrix with d i j n a i j similarly if the i th node obtains the information of the target a i 0 1 otherwise a i

the root node being the leader node n 0 assumption 2 the communication graph g is a direct communication graph and let the root node have access to the leader i e a i j a j i and a i 0 0 lemma 1 zhang

the multiple usvs in target tracking let x 0 y 0 and ψ 0 be the position and orientation of the target in an earth fixed frame e u 0 and υ 0 represent the surge velocity and sway velocity in a body fixed frame b respectively r 0 is an angular rate of the target in a body fixed frame b which can be constant or time varying the kinematics of the target with unknown velocity is given as follows fossen 2011 2 p 0 r 0 ψ 0 u 0 υ 0 ψ 0 r 0 where p 0 x 0 y 0 t r 0 ψ 0 is a rotation matrix given as follows 3 r 0 ψ 0 cos ψ 0 sin ψ 0 sin ψ 0 cos ψ 0 note that the velocities u 0 υ 0 and r 0 of the target are unavailable and bounded in this paper in this paper we aim to design controllers for follower usvs to achieve cooperative target tracking by using the position information of the target only thus only the kinematic equation of target is considered in this paper let x i y i and ψ i be the position and orientation of the i th follower in an earth fixed frame e u i υ i and r i represent the surge velocity sway velocity and the angular rate of the i th follower in a body fixed frame b respectively then the dynamical equation of the i th follower usv can be described by a three degrees of freedom model as follows 4 p i r i ψ i u i υ i ψ i r i m u i u i ζ u i u i υ i r i τ u i τ w u i m υ i υ i ζ υ i u i υ i r i τ w υ i m r i r i ζ r i u i υ i r i τ r i τ w r i where p i x i y i t r

which include coriolis centripetal forces and hydrodynamic damping forces τ u i and τ r i denote the surge force and yaw moment respectively τ w u i τ w υ i and τ w r i denote the disturbances caused by wind waves and ocean currents the control objective of this paper is to design a resource aware control method for a swarm of usvs with dynamics 4 to track one moving target usv with kinematics 2 in the presence of communication delays and constrained actuation resources 3 design and analysis in this section the design and analysis of the resource aware control method is presented the position and velocity of the target are estimated by the distributed event triggered eso and the time delayed distributed event triggered eso respectively the position tracking control law is proposed for each follower to track the target to achieve the coordinated target tracking guided by a formation pattern moreover to reduce the actuation the event triggered mechanism is integrated into control law design the input to state stability of the closed loop coordinated tracking system is proved through cascade stability analysis the architecture of the resource aware control method is shown in fig 2

to estimate the position and velocity of the target the distributed event triggered eso is proposed as follows 8 u ˆ 0 i c k u ˆ o j 1 n a i j x ˆ 0 i e x ˆ 0 j e a i 0 x ˆ 0 i e x 0 x ˆ 0 i c k x ˆ o

note that v 2 t is bounded by ε 2 and p 0 2 as t then it is concluded that the system 25 is uniformly ultimately bounded provided that the connectivity condition in assumptions 1 2 are satisfied note that if d increases ϱ 3 will decrease and ϱ 4 and ϱ 5 would increase accordingly as a result ϱ 4 ε 2 and ϱ 5 p 0 2 will increase it means that the estimation errors will get large and a tradeoff

proof of theorem 2 which is omitted here the proposed resource aware coordinated target tracking algorithm is summarized in table 1 4 simulation results in this section a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method for usvs subject to communication delays consider a cooperative system consisting of a leader usv with unknown kinematics 2 and four follower usvs with uncertain dynamics 4 the communication topology among usvs is shown in fig 3 the model parameters are taken from skjetne et al 2005 the initial states for the leader and follower usvs are set to 67 x 0 y 0 ψ 0 8 0 0 x 1 y 1 ψ 1 6 6 π 6 x 2 y 2 ψ 2 14 2 π 4 x 3 y 3 ψ 3 0 0 0 x 4 y 4 ψ 4 7 5 0 and the target dynamics and deviations are designed as 68 l 1 1 m l 2 1 m l 3 1 m l 4

provided in table 2 the trajectories of the usvs are displayed in fig 4 where the target usv is tracked by the four follower usvs it can be observed that a formation pattern of coordinated target tracking is achieved regardless of the unavailable velocity of the target and unknown follower dynamics due to sideslip angle model uncertainties and environmental disturbances figs 5 6 show that the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin that is the follower usvs can track the target subject to communication delays and constrained actuation resources this is in accordance with theorem 3 where the tracking errors e ρ i e β i e u i and e r i are all bounded figs 7 8 depict that the tracking errors e ρ 1 e β 1 e u 1 and e r 1 of follower 1 by using the proposed event triggered control laws in table 1 and time triggered control laws ω u 1 c u 1 u e 1 π u 1 g ˆ u 1 m u 1 and ω r 1 c r 1 r e 1 π r 1 g ˆ r 1 m r 1 which demonstrate that the tracking errors of the both methods converge to a small neighborhood of the origin it can be observed that the steady tracking performance of the two methods is almost the same however the event triggered method requires less communication and actuation resources than time trigged control simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event triggered method figs 9 10 show that the estimation performance of the time delayed distributed event triggered eso it reveals that the time delayed distributed event triggered eso 22 can effectively estimate the position and velocity of the target fig 11 gives the triggering times of communication the triggering times and percentage for communication are listed in table 3 in which one finds that the number of triggering times can be reduced by the proposed event triggered mechanism the estimation performance of reduced order esos in the velocity yaw and surge directions are plotted in figs 12 13 implying that the uncertainties are estimated by the reduced order esos 41 it is clearly seen from fig 14 and control inputs τ u i and τ r i are bounded fig 15 gives the triggering times of actuation and the triggering times and percentage for the actuation are listed in table 4 compared with the time triggered method with 18000 samples with a sampling interval of 0 01 the proposed event triggered controller is updated only at the triggering instants as a result compared with the time triggered method the proposed resource aware method requires less communication and actuation resources 5 conclusions this paper addressed a coordinated target tracking problem for a group of usvs with uncertain dynamics subject to communication delays and constrained actuation resources a resource aware design method is presented for reducing the communication and actuation burden specifically a distributed event triggered eso is proposed for recovering the position and velocity of the target through a cooperative estimation network furthermore the above result is extended to cooperative estimation subject to communication delays and a time delayed distributed event triggered eso is designed then an event triggered anti disturbance position tracking control law based on a reduced order eso is designed for each follower usv to track a virtual reference point prescribed by the distributed event triggered eso finally it is proven that the closed loop system is iss via the cascade stability analysis simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented method for resource aware coordinated

20872,this paper is concerned with a coordinated target tracking problem for a network of unmanned surface vehicles usvs subject to communication delays and constrained actuation resources the target to be tracked maneuvers with arbitrary velocity its position can be measured by a small fraction of usvs whereas its velocity is not known to follower usvs a resource aware event triggered control design method is presented for coordinated target tracking specifically a distributed event triggered extended state observer eso is designed to estimate the position and velocity of the target over a cooperative estimation network furthermore the above result is extended to cooperative estimation subject to communication delays and a time delayed distributed event triggered eso is designed in the control law design an event triggered anti disturbance position tracking control law is proposed for each follower usv based on a reduced order eso by the proposed resource aware event triggered control laws cooperative target tracking can be achieved regardless of the model uncertainty and external disturbances moreover both the execution rate of the actuators and communication burden of the network are reduced the stability of the closed loop system is proven through input to state stability and cascade stability analysis simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the coordinated target tracking of usvs keywords coordinated target tracking unmanned surface vehicles distributed event triggered eso event triggered actuation communication delays 1 introduction motion control of marine vehicles has received a surge of interests due to the fact they are vital tools in various oceanic applications such as environment monitoring biological detection search and rescue and sensor network fossen 2011 liao et al 2019 peng et al 2020c current studies are beyond the control of a single marine vehicle and a lot of works are dedicated to cooperative control of multiple marine vehicles apparently cooperative control enables individual usvs to execute more challenging tasks over a single usv in terms of enhanced efficiency and effectiveness qin et al 2019 peng et al 2020b cooperative motion control scenarios include coordinated trajectory tracking zou and meng 2019 chen et al 2019 coordinated path following gu et al 2018 coordinated target tracking yu et al 2019 yan et al 2018 yu et al 2015 and coordinated target enclosing lan et al 2019 zheng et al 2015 in particular coordinated target tracking is to enforce multiple vehicles to track a moving target while keeping a desired formation and completing specific tasks except the instantaneous movement of the target the future behavior of the target may not be known in advance breivik et al 2008 in recent years target tracking of marine vehicles has been widely studied see for example breivik et al 2008 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 in breivik et al 2008 a target tracking control law is proposed for one usv to track one target vehicle moving along a straight line in shojaei 2015 a target tracking controller is developed for one follower msv to track one target with limited torque under environmental disturbances jin 2016 presents a target tracking control law for one autonomous surface vessel asv to track one target with los range and angle constraints however in practice the velocity information of the target may not be available by the followers because of the limited sensing capabilities in order to track the leader with unknown dynamics a variety of control methods are available fossen 2011 sinisterra et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in fossen 2011 a straight line target tracking controller is developed for one underactuated usv to track one moving target with a high speed in peng et al 2013 a robust adaptive formation controller is developed for one asv to track one target by employing nns and a dynamic surface control dsc technique in sinisterra et al 2017 a target tracking system is designed for one usv and the speed of a marine vehicle is estimated by a stereovision based methodology in liu et al 2018 a target tracking controller design method is presented for one asv to track one target in the presence of unknown dynamics and limited control torques however the proposed methods in aforementioned works fossen 2011 sinisterra et al 2017 liu et al 2018 are designed for one follower vehicle to track one target these methods may limit the applications of usvs in challenging tasks such as cooperative tracking an underwater submarine by using a fleet of usvs there are some results available on the cooperative target tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs yu et al 2019 unmanned ground vehicles ugvs briñón arranz et al 2019 yu et al 2015 and unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs yan et al 2018 in yu et al 2019 a weighted average consensus based unscented information filter is proposed to achieve cooperative target tracking briñón arranz et al 2019 presents a circular formation control method for target tracking with a fleet of unicycles in yu et al 2015 a cooperative target tracking method based on a dynamic occupancy grid for uavs and ugvs in urban environments is presented in yan et al 2018 a consensus based coordinated target tracking strategy is presented for multiple uuvs the methods in aforementioned works yu et al 2019 briñón arranz et al 2019 yu et al 2015 yan et al 2018 are time triggered which may demand large communication and actuation resources in the maritime environments the communication bandwidth could be limited and it is desirable to integrate the event triggered mechanism into coordinated target tracking system for reducing network burden jain et al 2018 li et al 2020 peng et al 2021 moreover the aforementioned works yu et al 2019 briñón arranz et al 2019 yu et al 2015 yan et al 2018 do not consider communication delays in communication channels motivated by the above observations a resource aware control method for a group of usvs to achieve coordinated target tracking by using an event triggered mechanism is studied by taking into account no communication delays and communication delays at first a distributed event triggered eso is presented to estimate the position and velocity of the target over a cooperative estimation network based on the distributed event triggered eso the communication burden can be reduced in addition the above result is extended to cooperative estimation subject to communication delays and a time delayed distributed event triggered eso is designed the communication burden can be reduced by the distributed event triggered eso to reduce the actuation frequency of the actuators an event triggered position tracking control law is proposed based on a reduced order eso for each follower usv finally through the cascade stability analysis the closed loop coordinated target tracking system is proven to be input to state stable iss the salient features of the presented paper are three folds in contrast to the existing works in breivik et al 2008 fossen 2011 peng et al 2013 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 sinisterra et al 2017 and liu et al 2018 where the proposed control laws are designed for one follower marine vehicle to track one target vehicle a distributed estimation and control architecture is proposed for multiple usvs to track one moving target in a cooperative manner it is the first attempt to address the resource aware cooperative target tracking problem of multiple usvs with a dynamic leader moving at an unknown velocity in contrast to the works in peng et al 2021 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 fu and yu 2018 liu et al 2019 peng and wan 2018 liu et al 2018 cui et al 2017a and liu et al 2017 where the esos are used to estimate the disturbance in system dynamics a time delayed distributed event triggered eso is proposed for usvs such that the leader velocity can be recovered through a cooperative estimation network and the communication burden between esos can be reduced in the presence of communication delays in contrast to the target tracking control laws proposed in breivik et al 2008 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 fossen 2011 sinisterra et al 2017 and liu et al 2018 event triggered positioning tracking control laws are proposed such that the actuation frequency can be decreased and the desired performance can be maintained in addition compared with the traditional backstepping and dsc methods the computational complexity of the proposed method is reduced thanks to the reduced order eso the rest of the paper is organized as follows the preliminaries and problem formulation are presented in section 2 the design and analysis of the position tracking control law is presented in section 3 simulation results are presented in section 4 section 5 concludes this paper 2 preliminaries 2 1 graph theory a graph g v e is introduced to describe the communication topology for a fleet of usvs where v n 0 n 1 n n is a node set and e n i n j v v is an edge set an adjacency matrix a a i j ℜ n n is a square matrix and defined as follows 1 a a i j 1 if i j e a i j 0 if i j e a i i 0 then the laplacian matrix is defined as l d a where d diag d i as the in degree matrix with d i j n a i j similarly if the i th node obtains the information of the target a i 0 1 otherwise a i

the multiple usvs in target tracking let x 0 y 0 and ψ 0 be the position and orientation of the target in an earth fixed frame e u 0 and υ 0 represent the surge velocity and sway velocity in a body fixed frame b respectively r 0 is an angular rate of the target in a body fixed frame b which can be constant or time varying the kinematics of the target with unknown velocity is given as follows fossen 2011 2 p 0 r 0 ψ 0 u 0 υ 0 ψ 0 r 0 where p 0 x 0 y 0 t r 0 ψ 0 is a rotation matrix given as follows 3 r 0 ψ 0 cos ψ 0 sin ψ 0 sin ψ 0 cos ψ 0 note that the velocities u 0 υ 0 and r 0 of the target are unavailable and bounded in this paper in this paper we aim to design controllers for follower usvs to achieve cooperative target tracking by using the position information of the target only thus only the kinematic equation of target is considered in this paper let x i y i and ψ i be the position and orientation of the i th follower in an earth fixed frame e u i υ i and r i represent the surge velocity sway velocity and the angular rate of the i th follower in a body fixed frame b respectively then the dynamical equation of the i th follower usv can be described by a three degrees of freedom model as follows 4 p i r i ψ i u i υ i ψ i r i m u i u i ζ u i u i υ i r i τ u i τ w u i m υ i υ i ζ υ i u i υ i r i τ w υ i m r i r i ζ r i u i υ i r i τ r i τ w r i where p i x i y i t r

which include coriolis centripetal forces and hydrodynamic damping forces τ u i and τ r i denote the surge force and yaw moment respectively τ w u i τ w υ i and τ w r i denote the disturbances caused by wind waves and ocean currents the control objective of this paper is to design a resource aware control method for a swarm of usvs with dynamics 4 to track one moving target usv with kinematics 2 in the presence of communication delays and constrained actuation resources 3 design and analysis in this section the design and analysis of the resource aware control method is presented the position and velocity of the target are estimated by the distributed event triggered eso and the time delayed distributed event triggered eso respectively the position tracking control law is proposed for each follower to track the target to achieve the coordinated target tracking guided by a formation pattern moreover to reduce the actuation the event triggered mechanism is integrated into control law design the input to state stability of the closed loop coordinated tracking system is proved through cascade stability analysis the architecture of the resource aware control method is shown in fig 2

proof of theorem 2 which is omitted here the proposed resource aware coordinated target tracking algorithm is summarized in table 1 4 simulation results in this section a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method for usvs subject to communication delays consider a cooperative system consisting of a leader usv with unknown kinematics 2 and four follower usvs with uncertain dynamics 4 the communication topology among usvs is shown in fig 3 the model parameters are taken from skjetne et al 2005 the initial states for the leader and follower usvs are set to 67 x 0 y 0 ψ 0 8 0 0 x 1 y 1 ψ 1 6 6 π 6 x 2 y 2 ψ 2 14 2 π 4 x 3 y 3 ψ 3 0 0 0 x 4 y 4 ψ 4 7 5 0 and the target dynamics and deviations are designed as 68 l 1 1 m l 2 1 m l 3 1 m l 4

provided in table 2 the trajectories of the usvs are displayed in fig 4 where the target usv is tracked by the four follower usvs it can be observed that a formation pattern of coordinated target tracking is achieved regardless of the unavailable velocity of the target and unknown follower dynamics due to sideslip angle model uncertainties and environmental disturbances figs 5 6 show that the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin that is the follower usvs can track the target subject to communication delays and constrained actuation resources this is in accordance with theorem 3 where the tracking errors e ρ i e β i e u i and e r i are all bounded figs 7 8 depict that the tracking errors e ρ 1 e β 1 e u 1 and e r 1 of follower 1 by using the proposed event triggered control laws in table 1 and time triggered control laws ω u 1 c u 1 u e 1 π u 1 g ˆ u 1 m u 1 and ω r 1 c r 1 r e 1 π r 1 g ˆ r 1 m r 1 which demonstrate that the tracking errors of the both methods converge to a small neighborhood of the origin it can be observed that the steady tracking performance of the two methods is almost the same however the event triggered method requires less communication and actuation resources than time trigged control simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event triggered method figs 9 10 show that the estimation performance of the time delayed distributed event triggered eso it reveals that the time delayed distributed event triggered eso 22 can effectively estimate the position and velocity of the target fig 11 gives the triggering times of communication the triggering times and percentage for communication are listed in table 3 in which one finds that the number of triggering times can be reduced by the proposed event triggered mechanism the estimation performance of reduced order esos in the velocity yaw and surge directions are plotted in figs 12 13 implying that the uncertainties are estimated by the reduced order esos 41 it is clearly seen from fig 14 and control inputs τ u i and τ r i are bounded fig 15 gives the triggering times of actuation and the triggering times and percentage for the actuation are listed in table 4 compared with the time triggered method with 18000 samples with a sampling interval of 0 01 the proposed event triggered controller is updated only at the triggering instants as a result compared with the time triggered method the proposed resource aware method requires less communication and actuation resources 5 conclusions this paper addressed a coordinated target tracking problem for a group of usvs with uncertain dynamics subject to communication delays and constrained actuation resources a resource aware design method is presented for reducing the communication and actuation burden specifically a distributed event triggered eso is proposed for recovering the position and velocity of the target through a cooperative estimation network furthermore the above result is extended to cooperative estimation subject to communication delays and a time delayed distributed event triggered eso is designed then an event triggered anti disturbance position tracking control law based on a reduced order eso is designed for each follower usv to track a virtual reference point prescribed by the distributed event triggered eso finally it is proven that the closed loop system is iss via the cascade stability analysis simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented method for resource aware coordinated

20873,this paper focuses on the elastic buckling of cross ply composite closed cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure the analytical model for buckling of composite cylindrical shell is derived by using the first order shear deformation theory fosdt and considering the pressure stiffness several types of shells including thin thick long and short shells are investigated two composite materials i e carbon epoxy and glass epoxy and several layup configurations are employed the results of the derived fosdt based model are compared with those obtained from a shell buckling equation sbe used in earlier studies and the classical shell theory cst for verification the results of the derived fosdt based model are compared with the results found in literature and also with the results obtained from finite element analysis the difference among the results of the sbe and fosdt and the cst and fosdt increases with the increase of the thickness in the case of all layup configurations and materials for thin shells the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt almost vanishes while for thin and large shells the difference between the results of the sbe and fosdt is still significant keywords cross ply thin shell thick shell shell theories hydrostatic pressure elastic buckling 1 introduction due to the increased strength to weight ratio and other desirable properties fiber reinforced plastics frps are widely employed in many applications a large number of studies have been conducted dealing with different applications of frps these studies have used experimental as well as theoretical approaches the composite shell such as composite pressure hull is one of the many examples of the applications of frps in marine industries as a submersible structure the composite shell is subjected to hydrostatic pressure and may undergo geometric deformation known as buckling in order to address the buckling instability of the composite shell at the design stage study is undertaken to determine the safe operating depth for the composite shell several earlier studies have focused on the development of various theories and experimental approaches for determination of the buckling instability of the composite shells three theories classical shell theory cst first order shear deformation theory fodst and higher order shear deformation theory hodst along with classical lamination theory clt and a shell buckling equation sbe have been extensively used for the analytical modeling of the composite shells undergoing buckling deformation the main difference between the cst fodst and hodst is that the former does not account for the shear deformation while the latter do a brief literature review of the research work conducted on the composite cylindrical shell is given as follows liang et al 2003 conducted optimal design analysis of the filament wound sandwich composite cylindrical shell under hydrostatic pressure they employed the cst based sbe reported in vinson and sierakowski 2004 nguyen et al 2009 conducted analytical investigation of the variable thickness cylindrical shell based on the thin shell theory asymptotic equations in terms of thickness variation were derived employing combined perturbation and bubnov galerkin s procedures topal 2009 developed a finite element methodology based on the fosdt for the optimal analysis of thin composite cylindrical shell subjected to external load a four node shear flexible element was used for modeling of the composite shell moon et al 2010 conducted finite element simulations and experiments on the filament wound cfrp cylinder under hydrostatic pressure they concluded that after initial buckling the composite cylinder did not come back to its original position which resulted in its collapse cagdas and adali 2011 conducted study on the buckling of cross ply cylinder subjected to hydrostatic pressure utilizing the fosdt based semi analytical finite element method and taking into account the pressure stiffness by employing koiter s related energy cagdas 2011 carried out elastic buckling analysis of the shells of revolution including isotropic cross ply composite and orthotropic shells subjected to axial compressive forces the shells stability models were developed employing a curved axisymmetric finite element shell element derived on the basis of fosdt lopatin and morozov 2012 developed a solution procedure for the cantilever thin circular shells including isotropic orthotropic and cross ply cylindrical shells subjected to lateral pressure the analytical model was developed by using the cst based variational equation the solution for the buckling of the studied thin shells was derived by using the generalized galerkin s method sofiyev and kuruoglu 2014 employed the shear deformation shell theory based on the donnel shell theory to investigate the buckling and vibration of functionally graded composite cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure in a similar study lopatin and morozov 2015 conducted numerical investigation of the clamped sandwich laminated cylindrical shell under uniform external pressure employing the fosdt based linearized equations of shell stability in another study lopatin and morozov 2017 developed analytical model for buckling of the composite cylindrical shell with rigid ends they employed the fourier decomposition and galerkin s methods to solve the earlier cst based stability equations reported in vasiliev 1993 khakimova et al 2017 conducted an experimental and numerical study on the buckling of the carbon fiber reinforced composite cfrp cylinder subjected to axial compression and with and without additional lateral load the experimental results were compared with those obtained from finite element analysis salahshour and fallah 2018 conducted a research study on the long thin cylindrical shell employing the donnel and sander thin shell theory and von karman assumptions of nonlinearity the external hydrostatic pressure was considered as follower load live load the ritz method was used for calculation of the buckling pressure and equilibrium path wei et al 2019 used the flügge model for stability of the thin shell flügge 1973 to investigate the stability of composite cylinder subjected to hydrostatic pressure the stability equations of the flügge model do not contain shear forces which shows that the flügge model was derived based on the cst imran et al 2019 conducted optimization simulations of the composite pressure hull subjected to hydrostatic pressure they employed linear buckling analysis for the calculation of the buckling load factor shell element based on the fosdt was utilized for meshing of the composite shell ebrahimi et al 2020 conducted buckling investigation of the nanocomposite shells by employing the fosdt the analytical formulation of the shell was derived by using the principle of virtual work the galerkin s method was used for solving the resultant stability equations in another study imran et al 2020a carried out the multi objective design optimization of the composite submerged cylindrical pressure hull by linking the analytical shell buckling model with the optimization tool the analytical shell buckling model was derived based on the cst and considering the pressure stiffness moreover a large number of studies on the optimal analysis of the composite shells have employed linear buckling analysis using shell elements for calculation of the buckling load the shell elements used in those studies have been developed based on the fosdt fathallah et al 2014a 2014b 2015 helal et al 2019 imran et al 2020b messager et al 2002 waqas et al 2019 as mentioned in the literature review part of the present study several studies have been undertaken on the investigation of the composite cylindrical shells employing three distinct formulations developed based on the different shell theories these three formulations are the sbe vinson and sierakowski 2004 cst and fosdt based analytical composite shell buckling models the important consideration in the buckling analysis of the composite shell is the inclusion of pressure stiffness when the pressure on the surface of the composite shell acts as a follower load live load then it produces an extra stiffness effect which is known as the pressure load stiffness or simply the pressure stiffness in the case of follower load the pressure remains normal to the deformed surface of the composite shell the pressure stiffness greatly affects the buckling instability of the composite shell sridharan and kasagi 1997 therefore it is very important to apply the pressure load according to the real application of the composite shell to accurately determine its buckling behavior the authors of this paper have carefully examined the sbe and found that it has been derived based on the cst without considering the pressure stiffness furthermore several studies have considered the analytical shell buckling formulations for prediction of buckling behavior of the general ply laminated composite shells however in fact the analytical buckling formulations used were derived only for cross ply configurations using the cross ply assumption the analytical stability equations are greatly simplified and relieved of the trigonometric functions directly during solution the instability equations for general ply configurations are not relieved of all the trigonometric functions and cannot be solved directly as in the case of cross ply configurations the stability equations in the case of general ply configurations can be solved by using approximate methods such as the galerkin s method according to the author s understanding the analytical shell buckling formulations derived based on the cross ply assumption cannot predict buckling pressure with sufficient accuracy for all types of ply configurations therefore to further assess the suitability and revisit the range of accuracy of these theories in the buckling investigation of the composite cylindrical shells subjected to hydrostatic pressure a detailed study of the elastic stability analysis of the composite cylindrical shell is conducted in the present paper the analytical formulation for the composite cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure is derived based on the fosdt and considering the pressure stiffness the results obtained using the fosdt are compared with those of the sbe and cst for verification of the analytical model finite element analysis is also conducted in ansys employing the shell elements 2 materials and methods 2 1 derivation of analytical model for buckling of the composite cylindrical shell the fosdt is used to derive the buckling formulation of the composite laminated closed cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 1 according to the hook s law the stresses and strains are related

element modeling for verification of analytical formulation to verify the analytical shell buckling model derived in this study finite element analysis of the composite cylindrical shell is also conducted in ansys the results of the derived analytical shell buckling model are compared with the results of finite element analysis and also with those published in the literature cagdas 2011 han and simitses 1991 hur et al 2008 li et al 2018 shen and li 2002 the description of the finite element analysis conducted in ansys for the verification of the analytical shell buckling model is given below first a geometric model of the cylindrical shell is created in the ansys composite prepost acp with the help of the revolved feature of the design modeler the finite element model is produced by meshing the geometric model with shell181 element three mesh sizes i e 0 1 in 2 54 mm 0 15 in 3 81 mm and 0 25 in 6 35 mm are used to investigate the mesh sensitivity of the composite cylindrical shell the difference among the results of all mesh sizes is almost 2 therefore 0 15 in 3 81 mm mesh size is used for meshing of the composite cylindrical shell the shell181 element is based on the fosdt ansys 2017a the plies for the composite laminates of the cylindrical shell are then created by using the setup of acp in the setup of acp a fabric is generated and the orientation and reference direction of the fibers are set the composite plies for each layer of the laminates are generated by using the modeling groups the finite element model of the cylindrical shell is shown in fig 2 a boundary conditions to both ends of the cylindrical shell are applied to avoid rigid body motion the boundary conditions are simply supported boundary conditions and are similar to those used in the analytical shell buckling model at aft end of the cylindrical shell the displacement of the curve in the x y and z directions and its rotation about the x axis are restrained at the forward end of the cylindrical shell the displacement of the curve is restrained in the y and z directions a uniform pressure of 1 psi 0 00689476 mpa is applied to the outer surface of the cylindrical shell using the normal to surface feature which accounts for the pressure stiffness due to the application of hydrostatic pressure follower load according to the ansys user s guide ansys 2017b the force on the surface depends on the magnitude of the applied pressure and also on the orientation of the surface the pressure load if applied normal to faces or edges could produce a pressure load stiffness effect that plays a substantial role in the modal and eigenvalue buckling analyses the external pressure of 1 psi was applied because the dimensions of the composite shell in the reference studies have been given in inches in this way the eigenvalue computed in the buckling analysis is directly equal to the linear buckling pressure the boundary and loading conditions on the cylindrical shell are shown in fig 2 b after carrying out the composite layup creation in the acp the composite shell model is shifted to the static structural analysis the model from the static structural analysis is then shifted to the eigenvalue buckling analysis the analysis is run and the critical pressure is determined 3 results and discussions 3 1 verification of analytical model to verify the analytical model derived in

based analytical model and ansys with those of han and simitses 1991 shen and li 2002 the results of the cst and sbe are also listed the dimensions and material properties of the cylindrical shell are the same as listed in example 1 as can be seen from tables 1 and 2 the present fosdt based analytical model determines the buckling pressure with acceptable accuracy the small discrepancies among the results are due to the use of different theories verification example 3 similarly the results of the present fosdt based analytical model for the cross ply 0 90 12t laminated composite cylinders are compared with those of hur et al 2008 and li et at li et al 2018 the length and thickness of each cylinder are given in table 3 while the inner radius of each cylinder is 158 mm and all plies have the same thickness the material properties of the composite used are e 11 162 gpa e 22 9 6 gpa g 12 g 13 6 1 gpa g 23 3 5 gpa and ν 12 ν 13 ν 23 0 298 the results in table 3 show that the results predicted by the present fosdt based analytical model are greater than the experimental results of hur et al 2008 except for cylinder cmt1 but lower than the fem results of hur et al 2008 and li et al 2018 the discrepancy among the results is due to the different techniques and boundary conditions used for all configurations of composite cylinders the number of longitudinal half waves is 1 and the circumferential complete waves are 4 verification example 4 in this example results of the present model are compared with the results of the 3d elasticity theory published in kasagi and sridharan 1995 and the tosdt published in arciniega et al 2004 in both of these studies the effect of follower pressure has been considered by using a similar form of eq 19 the results are listed in table 4 two types of shell with lay up 90 0 s and having r h ratios of 10 and 50 have been investigated in the reference studies the mean radius of the shell is 1 27 m and the material properties of the composite material are e 11 110 316 gpa e 22 e 33 10 2042 gpa g 12 g 13 5 24002 gpa g 23 3 51633 gpa and ν 12 0 33 it can be noted that the results obtained from the present model are very close to the results of both studies verification example 5 in this example results of the present model are compared with the results of the 3d elasticity theory published in kasagi and sridharan 1995 and flügge 1973 for the isotropic shell under hydrostatic pressure in both of these studies the effect of follower pressure has been considered the mean radius of the shell is 1 27 m and r h ratio is 200 the properties of the material are e 71 7055 gpa and ν 0 3 the results are listed in table 5 good agreement can be observed between the results of the present study and those of the reference studies a case from the reference study where follower pressure effect was not considered is also given it can be observed that the effect of the follower pressure increases with the decrease of the number of circumferential waves 3 2 results and discussions for different types of shells to determine the range of accuracy of the three analytical formulations for the stability of the closed composite cylindrical shell several cases of the composite shells including thick moderately thick short and long shells under hydrostatic pressure are investigated the radius to thickness ratio r h for the closed composite cylindrical shells varies from 5 to 50 a r h of 5 represents a thick shell while that of 50 represents a very thin shell similarly the length to radius ratio l r for the closed composite cylindrical shell varies from 2 to 10 a l r of 2 represents a short shell and that of 10 represents a long shell two materials carbon epoxy and glass epoxy and several cross ply symmetric and unsymmetrical layups including 0 90 0 0 90 0 s 0 90 0 90 s 90 0 and 90 0 s are used the material properties of carbon epoxy are e 11 121 gpa e 22 8 6 gpa g 12 g 13 4 7 gpa g 23 3 1 gpa and ν 12 ν 13 ν 23 0 27 and the material properties of glass epoxy are e 11 45 gpa e 22 10 gpa g 12 g 13 5 gpa g 12 3 8462 gpa and ν 12 ν 13 ν 23 0 3 the analytical models of the elastic buckling of the closed cylindrical are programmed in matlab the number of layers and thickness of each layer in their corresponding layups are kept same the fosdt and cst related equations are solved as eigenvalue problems while the sbe is directly solved the related equations of the cst and sbe are listed in appendix a the results of all composite cylindrical shell configurations and material systems obtained from the three analytical buckling formulations are listed in tables 6 17 and discussed as follows the number in the parentheses represents the number of waves in the circumferential direction while the number of half waves in the longitudinal direction is 1 in all cases it is considered in the present study that the results of the fosdt are more accurate than those of the sbe and cst therefore comparison of results obtained in this study is carried out based on the results of fosdt as can be observed from tables 6 17 the difference among the results of cst and fosdt and the sbe and fodst increases with the increase of the thickness ratio in the case of all layups and materials considered in this paper a considerable difference between the results of the cst and fosdt and sbe and fosdt can be noted for r h of 5 the difference between the results of the sbe and fosdt accounts for the absence of both pressure stiffness and transverse shear stresses similarly the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt accounts for the absence of transverse shear stresses only also the difference between the results of the sbe and cst accounts for the absence of pressure stiffness only from table 8 it can be noted that the maximum difference of 23 03 between the results of the sbe and cst is calculated for carbon epoxy composite layup 0 90 with r h of 5 and l r of 8 similarly from the same table it can be observed that the maximum difference of 20 67 between the results of sbe and cst is calculated for the same composite layup with r h of 10 and l r of 10 the maximum difference of 19 14 between the results of the sbe and cst is obtained for same composite layup with r h of 20 and l r of 10 table 8 for shell with r h of 50 the maximum difference of 17 61 between the results of the sbe and cst is obtained for composite layup 90 0 s and l r of 10 table 11 from table 11 it can be noted that the maximum difference of 42 25 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for carbon epoxy composite layup 90 0 s with r h of 5 and l r of 6 similarly the maximum difference of 11 28 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for the same composite layup with r h of 10 and l r of 4 table 11 in the case of r h of 20 the maximum difference of 3 97 between the results of the cst and fosdt is obtained for carbon epoxy layup 90 0 s with l r of 2 table 11 as can be observed from table 11 the maximum difference of 60 55 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for carbon epoxy composite layup 90 0 s with r h of 5 and l r of 4 from the same table it is clear that the maximum difference of 29 58 between the results of the sbe and fosdt in the case of moderate thick shell with r h of 10 and l r of 8 is calculated for the same composite and layup in the case of r h of 20 the maximum difference of 20 64 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is obtained for carbon epoxy layup 90 0 s with l r of 8 table 11 this shows that for a thin shell ignoring the pressure stiffness can give rise to very inaccurate results in the case of very thin shell i e r h of 50 the maximum difference between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for carbon epoxy layup 90 0 s with l r of 10 which is equal to 17 99 table 11 this shows that even in the case of a very thin shell ignoring the pressure stiffness effect in the modeling of composite shell can substantially over predict the buckling pressure from table 14 it can be noted that the overall maximum difference of 21 30 between the results of the sbe and cst is calculated for glass epoxy composite layup 0 90 with r h of 5 and l r of 8 from the same table it can be observed that the maximum difference of 19 77 between the results of the sbe and cst is calculated for the same composite layup with r h of 10 and l r of 10 table 14 also shows that the for r h of 20 and 50 the maximum difference of 18 64 and 17 96 between the results of the sbe and cst is obtained for the same composite layup with l r of 10 as can be observed from table 13 the maximum difference of 16 97 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for glass epoxy layup 0 90 0 s with r h of 5 and l r of 2 the maximum difference of 6 79 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for glass epoxy layup 90 0 s with r h of 10 and l r of 2 table 17 similarly it can be noted from table 17 that in the case of r h of 20 the maximum difference of 1 87 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for the same layup with l r of 4 for a very thin cylindrical shell i e r h of 50 the difference between the predictions of the cst and fosdt is less than 1 in the case of all layups and length to radius ratios similarly as can be observed from table 17 the maximum difference of 32 79 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is obtained for glass epoxy layup 90 0 s with r h of 5 and l r of 6 for r h of 10 the maximum difference of 21 88 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for glass epoxy layup 90 0 s with l r of 10 table 17 in the case of r h of 20 the maximum difference of 19 08 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for glass epoxy layup 0 90 with l r of 10 table 14 as can be noted from table 14 for a very thin glass epoxy cylindrical shell i e r h of 50 the maximum difference of 17 96 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for layup 0 90 with l r of 10 the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h 5 becomes more prominent and reaches more than 40 for carbon epoxy and 16 97 for glass epoxy for both composites the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h 10 is still considerable and for moderate thick shell fosdt should be used on the other hand the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h 20 is small and almost vanishes for r h of 50 from these observations it can be concluded that for r h 20 the cst can be used instead of the fosdt with sufficient accuracy to determine the buckling pressure of the composite cylindrical shell the use of the cst for r h 20 instead of the fosdt will simplify the analytical modeling and also reduce the computational efforts without affecting the accuracy of the results due to the absence of the pressure stiffness effect in its formulation the sbe gives higher values of buckling pressure even in the case of r h of 50 as compared to the fosdt and cst the effect of the pressure stiffness increases with the decrease of number of circumferential wave n the same observation was also noted in the reference study of kasagi and sridharan 1995 therefore based on the findings in this paper it is not recommended to use the sbe for determining the elastic stability of longer cylindrical shell even with r h as large as 50 however it can be used for a rough estimate of buckling pressure in the case of larger r h with proper factor of safety to account for the error in its estimate of the buckling pressure 4 conclusions the analytical buckling formulation for the composite closed cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure is derived based on the first order shear deformation theory fosdt the pressure stiffness effect is also included in the derivation of the analytical buckling formulation the results obtained from the fosdt are compared with the results of two other buckling formulations the analytical shell buckling equation sbe and the classical shell theory cst a total of 12 layup configurations using two composite materials carbon epoxy and glass epoxy are used in modeling of the composite cylindrical shell from the present study the following points can be concluded the difference among the results of the sbe and fosdt and the sbe and cst increases with the increase of the length to radius ratios and with the decrease of number of circumferential waves for a shell with radius to thickness ratio of 50 and length to radius ratio of 10 the difference between the results of the sbe and fosdt and the sbe and cst is still significant this shows that ignoring the pressure stiffness affects negatively the accuracy of the buckling pressure even in the case of long and thin shell therefore it is recommended that for long and thin shell the fosdt or cst should be used for calculation of the buckling pressure the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h of 5 becomes more significant and approaches more than 40 for carbon epoxy and 16 97 for glass epoxy therefore based on this observation the fosdt should be used in the case of r h of 5 however for thick shell the fosdt may also predict less accurate results due to the absence of 1 z r terms in the derivation of the buckling formulation for r h of 10 the maximum difference of 11 28 and 6 79 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for carbon epoxy and glass epoxy respectively this shows that even in the case of the moderately thick cylindrical shell the cst may over predict the buckling pressure the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h 20 declines and almost disappears for r h 50 this shows that ignoring the transverse shear stresses in the analysis of the composite cylindrical shell for r h 20 does not affect the buckling pressure in some of the earlier studies on the stability analysis of the composite cylindrical shell under hydrostatic pressure the researchers have used the buckling formulations derived on the basis of cross ply assumption for general ply configurations therefore it is recommended that the formulations derived here and elsewhere for the cross ply configurations should be used only for the cross ply laminated cylindrical shells to accurately predict the buckling pressure credit authorship

20873,this paper focuses on the elastic buckling of cross ply composite closed cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure the analytical model for buckling of composite cylindrical shell is derived by using the first order shear deformation theory fosdt and considering the pressure stiffness several types of shells including thin thick long and short shells are investigated two composite materials i e carbon epoxy and glass epoxy and several layup configurations are employed the results of the derived fosdt based model are compared with those obtained from a shell buckling equation sbe used in earlier studies and the classical shell theory cst for verification the results of the derived fosdt based model are compared with the results found in literature and also with the results obtained from finite element analysis the difference among the results of the sbe and fosdt and the cst and fosdt increases with the increase of the thickness in the case of all layup configurations and materials for thin shells the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt almost vanishes while for thin and large shells the difference between the results of the sbe and fosdt is still significant keywords cross ply thin shell thick shell shell theories hydrostatic pressure elastic buckling 1 introduction due to the increased strength to weight ratio and other desirable properties fiber reinforced plastics frps are widely employed in many applications a large number of studies have been conducted dealing with different applications of frps these studies have used experimental as well as theoretical approaches the composite shell such as composite pressure hull is one of the many examples of the applications of frps in marine industries as a submersible structure the composite shell is subjected to hydrostatic pressure and may undergo geometric deformation known as buckling in order to address the buckling instability of the composite shell at the design stage study is undertaken to determine the safe operating depth for the composite shell several earlier studies have focused on the development of various theories and experimental approaches for determination of the buckling instability of the composite shells three theories classical shell theory cst first order shear deformation theory fodst and higher order shear deformation theory hodst along with classical lamination theory clt and a shell buckling equation sbe have been extensively used for the analytical modeling of the composite shells undergoing buckling deformation the main difference between the cst fodst and hodst is that the former does not account for the shear deformation while the latter do a brief literature review of the research work conducted on the composite cylindrical shell is given as follows liang et al 2003 conducted optimal design analysis of the filament wound sandwich composite cylindrical shell under hydrostatic pressure they employed the cst based sbe reported in vinson and sierakowski 2004 nguyen et al 2009 conducted analytical investigation of the variable thickness cylindrical shell based on the thin shell theory asymptotic equations in terms of thickness variation were derived employing combined perturbation and bubnov galerkin s procedures topal 2009 developed a finite element methodology based on the fosdt for the optimal analysis of thin composite cylindrical shell subjected to external load a four node shear flexible element was used for modeling of the composite shell moon et al 2010 conducted finite element simulations and experiments on the filament wound cfrp cylinder under hydrostatic pressure they concluded that after initial buckling the composite cylinder did not come back to its original position which resulted in its collapse cagdas and adali 2011 conducted study on the buckling of cross ply cylinder subjected to hydrostatic pressure utilizing the fosdt based semi analytical finite element method and taking into account the pressure stiffness by employing koiter s related energy cagdas 2011 carried out elastic buckling analysis of the shells of revolution including isotropic cross ply composite and orthotropic shells subjected to axial compressive forces the shells stability models were developed employing a curved axisymmetric finite element shell element derived on the basis of fosdt lopatin and morozov 2012 developed a solution procedure for the cantilever thin circular shells including isotropic orthotropic and cross ply cylindrical shells subjected to lateral pressure the analytical model was developed by using the cst based variational equation the solution for the buckling of the studied thin shells was derived by using the generalized galerkin s method sofiyev and kuruoglu 2014 employed the shear deformation shell theory based on the donnel shell theory to investigate the buckling and vibration of functionally graded composite cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure in a similar study lopatin and morozov 2015 conducted numerical investigation of the clamped sandwich laminated cylindrical shell under uniform external pressure employing the fosdt based linearized equations of shell stability in another study lopatin and morozov 2017 developed analytical model for buckling of the composite cylindrical shell with rigid ends they employed the fourier decomposition and galerkin s methods to solve the earlier cst based stability equations reported in vasiliev 1993 khakimova et al 2017 conducted an experimental and numerical study on the buckling of the carbon fiber reinforced composite cfrp cylinder subjected to axial compression and with and without additional lateral load the experimental results were compared with those obtained from finite element analysis salahshour and fallah 2018 conducted a research study on the long thin cylindrical shell employing the donnel and sander thin shell theory and von karman assumptions of nonlinearity the external hydrostatic pressure was considered as follower load live load the ritz method was used for calculation of the buckling pressure and equilibrium path wei et al 2019 used the flügge model for stability of the thin shell flügge 1973 to investigate the stability of composite cylinder subjected to hydrostatic pressure the stability equations of the flügge model do not contain shear forces which shows that the flügge model was derived based on the cst imran et al 2019 conducted optimization simulations of the composite pressure hull subjected to hydrostatic pressure they employed linear buckling analysis for the calculation of the buckling load factor shell element based on the fosdt was utilized for meshing of the composite shell ebrahimi et al 2020 conducted buckling investigation of the nanocomposite shells by employing the fosdt the analytical formulation of the shell was derived by using the principle of virtual work the galerkin s method was used for solving the resultant stability equations in another study imran et al 2020a carried out the multi objective design optimization of the composite submerged cylindrical pressure hull by linking the analytical shell buckling model with the optimization tool the analytical shell buckling model was derived based on the cst and considering the pressure stiffness moreover a large number of studies on the optimal analysis of the composite shells have employed linear buckling analysis using shell elements for calculation of the buckling load the shell elements used in those studies have been developed based on the fosdt fathallah et al 2014a 2014b 2015 helal et al 2019 imran et al 2020b messager et al 2002 waqas et al 2019 as mentioned in the literature review part of the present study several studies have been undertaken on the investigation of the composite cylindrical shells employing three distinct formulations developed based on the different shell theories these three formulations are the sbe vinson and sierakowski 2004 cst and fosdt based analytical composite shell buckling models the important consideration in the buckling analysis of the composite shell is the inclusion of pressure stiffness when the pressure on the surface of the composite shell acts as a follower load live load then it produces an extra stiffness effect which is known as the pressure load stiffness or simply the pressure stiffness in the case of follower load the pressure remains normal to the deformed surface of the composite shell the pressure stiffness greatly affects the buckling instability of the composite shell sridharan and kasagi 1997 therefore it is very important to apply the pressure load according to the real application of the composite shell to accurately determine its buckling behavior the authors of this paper have carefully examined the sbe and found that it has been derived based on the cst without considering the pressure stiffness furthermore several studies have considered the analytical shell buckling formulations for prediction of buckling behavior of the general ply laminated composite shells however in fact the analytical buckling formulations used were derived only for cross ply configurations using the cross ply assumption the analytical stability equations are greatly simplified and relieved of the trigonometric functions directly during solution the instability equations for general ply configurations are not relieved of all the trigonometric functions and cannot be solved directly as in the case of cross ply configurations the stability equations in the case of general ply configurations can be solved by using approximate methods such as the galerkin s method according to the author s understanding the analytical shell buckling formulations derived based on the cross ply assumption cannot predict buckling pressure with sufficient accuracy for all types of ply configurations therefore to further assess the suitability and revisit the range of accuracy of these theories in the buckling investigation of the composite cylindrical shells subjected to hydrostatic pressure a detailed study of the elastic stability analysis of the composite cylindrical shell is conducted in the present paper the analytical formulation for the composite cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure is derived based on the fosdt and considering the pressure stiffness the results obtained using the fosdt are compared with those of the sbe and cst for verification of the analytical model finite element analysis is also conducted in ansys employing the shell elements 2 materials and methods 2 1 derivation of analytical model for buckling of the composite cylindrical shell the fosdt is used to derive the buckling formulation of the composite laminated closed cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 1 according to the hook s law the stresses and strains are related

boundary conditions to both ends of the cylindrical shell are applied to avoid rigid body motion the boundary conditions are simply supported boundary conditions and are similar to those used in the analytical shell buckling model at aft end of the cylindrical shell the displacement of the curve in the x y and z directions and its rotation about the x axis are restrained at the forward end of the cylindrical shell the displacement of the curve is restrained in the y and z directions a uniform pressure of 1 psi 0 00689476 mpa is applied to the outer surface of the cylindrical shell using the normal to surface feature which accounts for the pressure stiffness due to the application of hydrostatic pressure follower load according to the ansys user s guide ansys 2017b the force on the surface depends on the magnitude of the applied pressure and also on the orientation of the surface the pressure load if applied normal to faces or edges could produce a pressure load stiffness effect that plays a substantial role in the modal and eigenvalue buckling analyses the external pressure of 1 psi was applied because the dimensions of the composite shell in the reference studies have been given in inches in this way the eigenvalue computed in the buckling analysis is directly equal to the linear buckling pressure the boundary and loading conditions on the cylindrical shell are shown in fig 2 b after carrying out the composite layup creation in the acp the composite shell model is shifted to the static structural analysis the model from the static structural analysis is then shifted to the eigenvalue buckling analysis the analysis is run and the critical pressure is determined 3 results and discussions 3 1 verification of analytical model to verify the analytical model derived in the present study results obtained from the present fosdt based analytical model are compared with the results obtained from ansys and with those found in the literature for simply supported cross ply laminated cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure the contour plots for buckling strength factor obtained from finite element analysis are shown in fig 3 a i verification example 1 table 1 shows the results of verification study for buckling pressure obtained from the present fosdt based analytical model and ansys with those of han and simitses 1991 shen and li 2002 and cagdas 2011 the results of the cst and sbe are also listed the length and mean radius of each cylindrical shell are 7 5 in 0 1905 m and the thickness of each cylindrical shell is 0 0212 in 0 00053848 m the material considered has the properties as follows e 11 21 17 10 6 psi 145 96 gpa e 22 1 44 10 6 psi 9 93 gpa g 12 g 13 g 23 0 65 10 6 psi 4 48 gpa and ν 12 ν 13 ν 23 0 28 in all the tables the number in parentheses shows the number of waves in the circumferential direction verification example 2 table 2 shows the results of verification study for buckling pressure obtained from the present fosdt based analytical model and ansys with those of han and simitses 1991 shen and li 2002 the results of the cst and sbe are also listed the dimensions and material properties of the cylindrical shell are the same as listed in example 1 as can be seen from tables 1 and 2 the present fosdt based analytical model determines the buckling pressure with acceptable accuracy the small discrepancies among the results are due to the use of different theories verification example 3 similarly the results of the present fosdt based analytical model for the cross ply 0 90 12t laminated composite cylinders are compared with those of hur et al 2008 and li et at li et al 2018 the length and thickness of each cylinder are given in table 3 while the inner radius of each cylinder is 158 mm and all plies have the same thickness the material properties of the composite used are e 11 162 gpa e 22 9 6 gpa g 12 g 13 6 1 gpa g 23 3 5 gpa and ν 12 ν 13 ν 23 0 298 the results in table 3 show that the results predicted by the present fosdt based analytical model are greater than the experimental results of hur et al 2008 except for cylinder cmt1 but lower than the fem results of hur et al 2008 and li et al 2018 the discrepancy among the results is due to the different techniques and boundary conditions used for all configurations of composite cylinders the number of longitudinal half waves is 1 and the circumferential complete waves are 4 verification example 4 in this example results of the present model are compared with the results of the 3d elasticity theory published in kasagi and sridharan 1995 and the tosdt published in arciniega et al 2004 in both of these studies the effect of follower pressure has been considered by using a similar form of eq 19 the results are listed in table 4 two types of shell with lay up 90 0 s and having r h ratios of 10 and 50 have been investigated in the reference studies the mean radius of the shell is 1 27 m and the material properties of the composite material are e 11 110 316 gpa e 22 e 33 10 2042 gpa g 12 g 13 5 24002 gpa g 23 3 51633 gpa and ν 12 0 33 it can be noted that the results obtained from the present model are very close to the results of both studies verification example 5 in this example results of the present model are compared with the results of the 3d elasticity theory published in kasagi and sridharan 1995 and flügge 1973 for the isotropic shell under hydrostatic pressure in both of these studies the effect of follower pressure has been considered the mean radius of the shell is 1 27 m and r h ratio is 200 the properties of the material are e 71 7055 gpa and ν 0 3 the results are listed in table 5 good agreement can be observed between the results of the present study and those of the reference studies a case from the reference study where follower pressure effect was not considered is also given it can be observed that the effect of the follower pressure increases with the decrease of the number of circumferential waves 3 2 results and discussions for different types of shells to determine the range of accuracy of the three analytical formulations for the stability of the closed composite cylindrical shell several cases of the composite shells including thick moderately thick short and long shells under hydrostatic pressure are investigated the radius to thickness ratio r h for the closed composite cylindrical shells varies from 5 to 50 a r h of 5 represents a thick shell while that of 50 represents a very thin shell similarly the length to radius ratio l r for the closed composite cylindrical shell varies from 2 to 10 a l r of 2 represents a short shell and that of 10 represents a long shell two materials carbon epoxy and glass epoxy and several cross ply symmetric and unsymmetrical layups including 0 90 0 0 90 0 s 0 90 0 90 s 90 0 and 90 0 s are used the material properties of carbon epoxy are e 11 121 gpa e 22 8 6 gpa g 12 g 13 4 7 gpa g 23 3 1 gpa and ν 12 ν 13 ν 23 0 27 and the material properties of glass epoxy are e 11 45 gpa e 22 10 gpa g 12 g 13 5 gpa g 12 3 8462 gpa and ν 12 ν 13 ν 23 0 3 the analytical models of the elastic buckling of the closed cylindrical are programmed in matlab the number of layers and thickness of each layer in their corresponding layups are kept same the fosdt and cst related equations are solved as eigenvalue problems while the sbe is directly solved the related equations of the cst and sbe are listed in appendix a the results of all composite cylindrical shell configurations and material systems obtained from the three analytical buckling formulations are listed in tables 6 17 and discussed as follows the number in the parentheses represents the number of waves in the circumferential direction while the number of half waves in the longitudinal direction is 1 in all cases it is considered in the present study that the results of the fosdt are more accurate than those of the sbe and cst therefore comparison of results obtained in this study is carried out based on the results of fosdt as can be observed from tables 6 17 the difference among the results of cst and fosdt and the sbe and fodst increases with the increase of the thickness ratio in the case of all layups and materials considered in this paper a considerable difference between the results of the cst and fosdt and sbe and fosdt can be noted for r h of 5 the difference between the results of the sbe and fosdt accounts for the absence of both pressure stiffness and transverse shear stresses similarly the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt accounts for the absence of transverse shear stresses only also the difference between the results of the sbe and cst accounts for the absence of pressure stiffness only from table 8 it can be noted that the maximum difference of 23 03 between the results of the sbe and cst is calculated for carbon epoxy composite layup 0 90 with r h of 5 and l r of 8 similarly from the same table it can be observed that the maximum difference of 20 67 between the results of sbe and cst is calculated for the same composite layup with r h of 10 and l r of 10 the maximum difference of 19 14 between the results of the sbe and cst is obtained for same composite layup with r h of 20 and l r of 10 table 8 for shell with r h of 50 the maximum difference of 17 61 between the results of the sbe and cst is obtained for composite layup 90 0 s and l r of 10 table 11 from table 11 it can be noted that the maximum difference of 42 25 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for carbon epoxy composite layup 90 0 s with r h of 5 and l r of 6 similarly the maximum difference of 11 28 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for the same composite layup with r h of 10 and l r of 4 table 11 in the case of r h of 20 the maximum difference of 3 97 between the results of the cst and fosdt is obtained for carbon epoxy layup 90 0 s with l r of 2 table 11 as can be observed from table 11 the maximum difference of 60 55 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for carbon epoxy composite layup 90 0 s with r h of 5 and l r of 4 from the same table it is clear that the maximum difference of 29 58 between the results of the sbe and fosdt in the case of moderate thick shell with r h of 10 and l r of 8 is calculated for the same composite and layup in the case of r h of 20 the maximum difference of 20 64 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is obtained for carbon epoxy layup 90 0 s with l r of 8 table 11 this shows that for a thin shell ignoring the pressure stiffness can give rise to very inaccurate results in the case of very thin shell i e r h of 50 the maximum difference between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for carbon epoxy layup 90 0 s with l r of 10 which is equal to 17 99 table 11 this shows that even in the case of a very thin shell ignoring the pressure stiffness effect in the modeling of composite shell can substantially over predict the buckling pressure from table 14 it can be noted that the overall maximum difference of 21 30 between the results of the sbe and cst is calculated for glass epoxy composite layup 0 90 with r h of 5 and l r of 8 from the same table it can be observed that the maximum difference of 19 77 between the results of the sbe and cst is calculated for the same composite layup with r h of 10 and l r of 10 table 14 also shows that the for r h of 20 and 50 the maximum difference of 18 64 and 17 96 between the results of the sbe and cst is obtained for the same composite layup with l r of 10 as can be observed from table 13 the maximum difference of 16 97 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for glass epoxy layup 0 90 0 s with r h of 5 and l r of 2 the maximum difference of 6 79 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for glass epoxy layup 90 0 s with r h of 10 and l r of 2 table 17 similarly it can be noted from table 17 that in the case of r h of 20 the maximum difference of 1 87 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for the same layup with l r of 4 for a very thin cylindrical shell i e r h of 50 the difference between the predictions of the cst and fosdt is less than 1 in the case of all layups and length to radius ratios similarly as can be observed from table 17 the maximum difference of 32 79 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is obtained for glass epoxy layup 90 0 s with r h of 5 and l r of 6 for r h of 10 the maximum difference of 21 88 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for glass epoxy layup 90 0 s with l r of 10 table 17 in the case of r h of 20 the maximum difference of 19 08 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for glass epoxy layup 0 90 with l r of 10 table 14 as can be noted from table 14 for a very thin glass epoxy cylindrical shell i e r h of 50 the maximum difference of 17 96 between the results of the sbe and fosdt is calculated for layup 0 90 with l r of 10 the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h 5 becomes more prominent and reaches more than 40 for carbon epoxy and 16 97 for glass epoxy for both composites the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h 10 is still considerable and for moderate thick shell fosdt should be used on the other hand the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h 20 is small and almost vanishes for r h of 50 from these observations it can be concluded that for r h 20 the cst can be used instead of the fosdt with sufficient accuracy to determine the buckling pressure of the composite cylindrical shell the use of the cst for r h 20 instead of the fosdt will simplify the analytical modeling and also reduce the computational efforts without affecting the accuracy of the results due to the absence of the pressure stiffness effect in its formulation the sbe gives higher values of buckling pressure even in the case of r h of 50 as compared to the fosdt and cst the effect of the pressure stiffness increases with the decrease of number of circumferential wave n the same observation was also noted in the reference study of kasagi and sridharan 1995 therefore based on the findings in this paper it is not recommended to use the sbe for determining the elastic stability of longer cylindrical shell even with r h as large as 50 however it can be used for a rough estimate of buckling pressure in the case of larger r h with proper factor of safety to account for the error in its estimate of the buckling pressure 4 conclusions the analytical buckling formulation for the composite closed cylindrical shell subjected to hydrostatic pressure is derived based on the first order shear deformation theory fosdt the pressure stiffness effect is also included in the derivation of the analytical buckling formulation the results obtained from the fosdt are compared with the results of two other buckling formulations the analytical shell buckling equation sbe and the classical shell theory cst a total of 12 layup configurations using two composite materials carbon epoxy and glass epoxy are used in modeling of the composite cylindrical shell from the present study the following points can be concluded the difference among the results of the sbe and fosdt and the sbe and cst increases with the increase of the length to radius ratios and with the decrease of number of circumferential waves for a shell with radius to thickness ratio of 50 and length to radius ratio of 10 the difference between the results of the sbe and fosdt and the sbe and cst is still significant this shows that ignoring the pressure stiffness affects negatively the accuracy of the buckling pressure even in the case of long and thin shell therefore it is recommended that for long and thin shell the fosdt or cst should be used for calculation of the buckling pressure the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h of 5 becomes more significant and approaches more than 40 for carbon epoxy and 16 97 for glass epoxy therefore based on this observation the fosdt should be used in the case of r h of 5 however for thick shell the fosdt may also predict less accurate results due to the absence of 1 z r terms in the derivation of the buckling formulation for r h of 10 the maximum difference of 11 28 and 6 79 between the results of the cst and fosdt is calculated for carbon epoxy and glass epoxy respectively this shows that even in the case of the moderately thick cylindrical shell the cst may over predict the buckling pressure the difference between the results of the cst and fosdt for r h 20 declines and almost disappears for r h 50 this shows that ignoring the transverse shear stresses in the analysis of the composite cylindrical shell for r h 20 does not affect the buckling pressure in some of the earlier studies on the stability analysis of the composite cylindrical shell under hydrostatic pressure the researchers have used the buckling formulations derived on the basis of cross ply assumption for general ply configurations therefore it is recommended that the formulations derived here and elsewhere for the cross ply configurations should be used only for the cross ply laminated cylindrical shells to accurately predict the buckling pressure credit authorship

20874,in dredging high pressure water jets are commonly applied to assist the mobilization of soil this work considers the excavation of cohesive soil the key objective is to predict the development of the cavity in the soil as a function of the undrained shear strength translation velocity and hydrodynamic pressure of a single nozzle a generic computational fluid dynamics cfd model has been developed that captures both the jet flow and the soil failure in a single framework the results are compared with data from a previous experimental study the cfd model predicts the cavity dimensions with reasonable accuracy in addition the model provides detailed data to study the cyclic nature of the soil failure process the cfd model is promising and can be applied for more complex nozzle configurations to assist the design process of dragheads and improve production estimates keywords dredging cohesive soil undrained soil failure moving jet computational fluid dynamics cfd dynamic mesh drift flux model openfoam 1 introduction submerged jets are used in a wide spectrum of offshore engineering applications such as pile installation de brum passini et al 2018 lourenço et al 2020 spud can extraction bienen et al 2009 kohan et al 2015 trenching perng and capart 2008 zhang et al 2017 and drilling xu et al 2017 wang and song 2019 in dredging engineering submerged jets mounted on a drag head assist the mobilization of both cohesive soil nobel 2013 and non cohesive soil weegenaar et al 2015 see fig 1 this study focusses on the hydraulic excavation by a translating high pressure jet for the excavation of cohesive soil where the dynamic pressure of the jet p j is typically much higher 5 than the undrained shear strength s u the soil failure process under these conditions is very complex and the erosion type is classified as mass erosion winterwerp et al 2012 the soil fails undrained and lumps of soil are torn from the bed by the hydrodynamic stresses when the jet traverses the bed fig 2 mass erosion is much harder to predict compared to floc and surface erosion that correspond to milder flow conditions in the marine environment winterwerp et al 2012 the case of a fixed submerged jet on cohesive soil has received a lot of attention in literature e g mazurek et al 2001 mazurek and hossain 2007 hou et al 2016 dong et al 2019 and standard jet erosion tests have been developed to assess the erodibility of cohesive soils hanson 1991 wardinski et al 2018 translating jets on non cohesive soils are also studied frequently perng and capart 2008 yeh et al 2009 weegenaar et al 2015 the combination of a translating jet above cohesive soil has received less attention zhang et al 2017 explored the high discharge regime with a relatively low jet pressure in a laboratory experiment 1 2 times s u and a sea trial 1 7 times s u rockwell 1981 is to the best knowledge of the authors the first publicly available report considering the high pressure regime he conducted a series of laboratory experiments and explored scaling relations for the cavity depth based on dimensional analysis machin and allan 2011 demonstrated that it is important to distinguish two contributions in the cavity formation a quasi instantaneous failure component related to the bearing capacity of the soil and an erosion part the later contribution strongly depends on the exposure time and hence the traverse velocity of the jet they also argued that the erodibility depends on the permeability and the plasticity of the soil and concluded this relation requires further study in their experiments the role of erosion on the cavity formation was considered negligible for a jet traverse velocity higher than 0 1 0 5 m s for lower speeds significantly deeper cavities where formed due to progressing erosion at the cavity surface the model of machin and allan 2011 for the maximum cavity depth requires an estimate for the bearing capacity factor n c a constant value corresponding to shallow cone penetration was suggested however an appropriate choice for n c was regarded by the authors as an open question nobel 2013 conducted a large set of experiments different types of failure were identified depending on the relative jet pressure p j s u and the traverse velocity v t of the nozzle more details about these observations and regime definitions that are relevant for the present study will be provided in section 1 1 nobel 2013 argues that both the static pressure and shear stress distribution on the cavity wall are important the magnitude of each force depends on the location in the cavity the experiments of zhang et al 2016 confirmed the scaling of the cavity depth with the nozzle diameter as proposed by rockwell 1981 in contrast to the quasi instantaneous penetration concept of machin and allan 2011 and the observations of nobel 2013 zhang et al 2016 argue that erosion at yan et al 2020 the cavity surface controls the migration of the cavity surface and the role of static pressure can be ignored this assumption would strongly simplify the modeling as it would allow the usage of existing erosion relations for cohesive soil determined for unidirectional flows along the trajectory of the jet unfortunately information about the static pressure at the cavity surface is missing in literature so support for this argument is lacking and requires further study more recently experiments of yin et al 2019 on extremely high pressure jets up to 30 mpa confirm the general trend reported in previous works of a decreasing cavity depth with increasing traverse velocity and increasing cavity depth with increasing jet pressure the above literature survey demonstrates that many questions remain open regarding both the qualitative understanding of the failure mechanism and the prediction of the penetration depth and width of the cavity existing analytical models strongly depend on assumptions on the driving forces and failure mechanisms computational fluid dynamics cfd could be helpful as it is a more generic approach and it could reveal diagnostic information that is difficult or even impossible to retrieve experimentally such as the static pressure on the cavity walls and shear plane formation in front of the jet cfd models have been developed for impinging jet flow and scour related problems yan et al 2020 the challenges for a cfd model for this problem are to track or capture the soil fluid interface charin et al 2017 and to model the undrained cohesive failure in the soil region simultaneously in this work we follow the methodology proposed by lalli et al 2005 to combine the fluid and solid region in a single computational framework by applying suitable constitutive models for the stress tensors in both regions the advantage is that mesh deformations are not needed and external coupling between soil mechanical and fluid mechanical solvers is avoided recently wang and song 2019 have also followed this modeling strategy for static jet excavation in cohesive soil the key objective is to predict the cavity shape as a function of the jet traverse velocity jet pressure and the undrained shear strength of the cohesive soil 1 1 failure modes during jetting in this work the failure mode definitions of nobel 2013 are adopted which will briefly given here for the sake of readability of the present work penetrating jet fig 4 1 penetrating jet happens when p j s u 12 and v t u f h where u f h is the soil horizontal propagation velocity which is defined in fig 3 2 the soil cavity is narrow and deep with a cavity width of 1 1 5 times the jet diameter 3 a soil wall texture with vertical and curving nerves the vertical nerves are present in the non deflection zone while the curving nerves are in the deflection zone 4 the dislodged soil is completely fluidized deflecting jet fig 5 1 deflecting jet happens when 7 3 p j s u 12 or v t u f v where u f v is the soil vertical propagation velocity which is defined in fig 3 2 the soil cavity is shallower compared with the penetrating jet and smaller than 2 5 times the nozzle diameter 3 a soil wall texture with curving nerves appears representing the deflection zone 4 limited amount of dislodged soil lumps can be found after the experiments dispersing jet 1 dispersing jet happens when 5 4 p j s u 7 3 or v t u f v 2 the depth of the soil cavity is shallow while the width of the soil cavity is wider which can be equal to 5 times the nozzle diameter 3 the soil wall structure is irregular 4 the dislodged soil can be found after the experiments hydro fracturing hydro fracturing happens when v t 0 15 m s the soil cavity dimensions are irregular the soil fails at its weakest position the penetrating jet and deflecting jet are the most relevant failure modes the penetrating jet and deflecting jet are the main objectives to be investigated in this study the penetrating jet has two jet zones which are the non deflection zone and the deflection zone see fig 4 in the non deflection zone of the penetrating jet the pressure builds up on the top of the soil element until the jet stagnation pressure exceeds the bearing capacity of the soil thereafter the soil is pushed downwards by the stagnation pressure of the jet the smaller the jet ratio p j s u the longer the duration of this vertical process when the traverse velocity of the nozzle is relatively low the jet flow can follow a vertical line in the non deflection zone as shown in fig 4 as the traverse velocity of the jet is increasing the jet flow in the non deflection region will have an inclination angle as shown in fig 4 the higher the jet traverse velocity the larger the inclination angle will be in the deflection zone of the penetrating jet the jet flow will be deflected due to the traverse velocity of the jet and the resistance of the soil as the jet traverse velocity increases even more the non deflection zone will disappear which is shown in fig 5 this failure mode is called deflecting jet the failure mechanism of the deflecting jet is comparable with that in the deflection zone of the penetrating jet 2 material and methods inspired by the works of nguyen et al 2014 weij et al 2016 goeree 2018 and wang and song 2019 a model for the solid fluid mixture is combined with a plastic description of soil to capture the jet flow and the cavity formation in a single computational framework the drift flux model describes the solid fluid mixture and the cohesive soil is modelled as a bingham plastic with a fixed yield stress to represent the undrained shear strength a threshold value of the solid phase fraction distinguishes solid from fluid regions in order to select locally appropriate constitutive laws for the mixture flow 2 1 drift flux model the drift flux approach consists of a mass and momentum balance of the solid fluid mixture combined with separate transport equations for the solid phase fractions the mass balance of the mixture results in the continuity equation 1 ρ m t ρ m u m 0 where ρ m is the mixture density u m is the mixture velocity the mixture momentum equation is 2 ρ m u m t ρ m u m u m p m t m k 1 n α k ρ k u k m u k m ρ m g where p m is the mixture pressure t m is the mixture shear stress tensor g is the gravitational acceleration vector α k is the volume fraction of phase k this term is closed by the transport equation 3 α k t α k u k γ t α k where γ t is the turbulent diffusion coefficient u k m which is the relative velocity between mixture and phase k is closed by the following equation 4 u k m u k r k 1 n c k u k r where c k is the mass fraction of phase k u k r is the relative velocity between the carrier fluid and the solids which is obtained by the hindered settling relations of richardson and zaki 1954 the mixture pressure p m is governed by a poisson equation that can be obtained by combining the continuity and momentum equations 1 and 2 respectively for details see goeree 2018 2 2 cohesive soil model bingham plastic to implement the cohesive soil into the drift flux model the non newtonian fluid model bingham plastic bingham 1922 lalli et al 2005 goeree et al 2016 is applied bingham plastics behave as a solid at low shear stress and as a fluid at high shear stress which is represented by the constitutive relation 5 τ τ y η γ where τ y is the yield stress η is the plastic viscosity γ is the shear rate in 3d equal to the second invariant of the rate of deformation tensor u m from equation 5 the viscosity of the bingham plastic is calculated as 6 μ τ y γ ε η where ε is an arbitrarily small value which is used to prevent singularity in the limit of vanishing shear rate the yield stress τ y is only applied in the soil region which is determined by the volume concentration the yield stress τ y follows 7 τ y τ y w h e n α s α t 0 w h e n α s α t where α s is the volume concentration of the sediment phase α t is the threshold volume concentration value 2 3 mixture stress tensor the rans model b u o y a n t k ε is used in this study to compute the eddy viscosity in b u o y a n t k ε model henkes et al 1991 the modulation of turbulent kinetic energy caused by density stratification effects is incorporated for the sake of compactness the equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation ε are omitted here the eddy viscosity is computed as μ e ρ m c μ k 2 ε where c μ 0 09 is a universal constant the mixture stress tensor required in the momentum balance equation 2 is finally computed as 8 t m μ m u m u m t 2 3 i u m where i is the identity tensor the mixture viscosity μ m equals the regularized bingham viscosity equation 6 in the solid region and equals the eddy viscosity in the fluid regions boussinesq approximation of turbulent stresses it is assumed that after dislodgement the soil elements disrupt quickly into fine solid particles clay that instantaneously follow the turbulent motions of the fluid carrier phase for this reason it is assumed that the turbulent diffusivity γ required in equation 3 equals the turbulent viscosity ν e μ e ρ m which corresponds to a turbulent prandtl schmidt number σ 1 2 4 numerical implementation the finite volume method has been selected to solve the governing equations described in the previous sections all flow variables are defined at the cell centres of the mesh collocated mesh the momentum transport and pressure poisson equations are solved implicitly in a segregated approach inspired by the piso algorithm of issa 1986 the open source platform openfoam v1812 open field operation and manipulation is used for cfd numerical simulation in this study openfoam website openfoam is an open source object oriented library for numerical simulations in continuum mechanics based on the finite volume method in this study the drift flux solver driftfluxfoam is combined with two dynamic mesh algorithms arbitrairy mesh refinement a r and arbitrairy mesh interface ami to model the translation of the jet as for the numerical schemes used in this paper a central scheme has been applied to the diffusion terms of the momentum equations the van leer scheme has been implemented for the concentration convection terms the local min scheme which takes the minimum value of the owner and its neighbour cells has been implemented to the turbulent eddy viscosity to prevent numerical diffusion at the soil water interface a threshold concentration for the turbulence model is also included in the model when the concentration in the cell is larger than the threshold value the turbulent eddy viscosity will be switched off by doing this the turbulence eddy viscosity can be switched off inside the soil to model the moving jet dynamic mesh methods are used in this study in this study a combination of ami arbitrary mesh interface and a r cell layer addition removal is used to model the moving jet see fig 6 2 5 mesh techniques the steady mesh region separates the a r dynamic mesh region by the ami interface the moving jet is located in the a r dynamic mesh region when the jet is moving from left to right new mesh layers will be added to the left blue region old mesh layers will be removed from the right yellow region the jet has a diameter of 30 m m and a sod stand off distance the distance between jet outlet and soil surface of 20 m m which are representative values for dredging engineering applications nobel 2013 a cartesian computational grid is applied with a mesh size of 0 005 m 2 6 initial and boundary conditions the initial condition is presented in fig 7 the height and width of the soil region are 0 28 m and 0 15 m which ensures the soil cavity is smaller than the computational domain the side view and front view of the computational domain with boundary conditions setup is shown in fig 8 the cohesive soil is placed in between the two side walls outlet boundary conditions are implemented in front end and top of the computational domain no slip boundary condition is applied to the walls dirichlet boundary condition is implemented to the jet inlet wall functions wilcox et al 1998 are applied to the turbulence dissipation rate ε and turbulence kinetic energy k on the walls table 1 shows the detailed boundary conditions setup of the computational domain it has to be mentioned that no boundary condition is applied to the interface between water and soil in this numerical model the concentration at the soil water interface is not changing sharply but gradually 2 7 input parameters a key parameter for the hydraulic excavation process is the ratio between the jet pressure p j and the undrained shear strength of the clay s u see section 1 2 this study focuses on the regime p j s u the second key parameter is the transverse velocity v t the input parameter matrix covers different combinations of p j s u traverse velocities v t and nozzle exit velocities v j see table 2 the nozzle diameter and stand off distance are kept constant these settings correspond to the operational regime of nozzles in the offshore and dredging field the only difference is that the effect of a single nozzle is studied here while in practice multiple nozzles operate simultaneously and are often combined with mechanical tools comparable settings were considered in the experimental study of nobel 2013 the values for the solid concentration α s and soil mixture density ρ m are adopted from the latter experiments 3 results and discussion in this section the results calculated by the cfd model will be validated with the experiment of nobel 2013 some analysis of the soil failure mechanism based on the cfd model are also carried out an adjustable time step is applied based on the courant number stability criterium at the same time mesh and residual convergence analyses are carried out before conducting the validation fig 9 shows the jet cavity during jetting calculated by the cfd model when the jet traverses the soil sample the cavity formation is clearly retrieved by the model it can be concluded that the model qualitatively reproduces the general picture of the cavity formation process for high pressure jets in cohesive soil as sketched in fig 2 the jet flow quickly starts to disperse after the deflection which reduces the velocity considerably 3 1 validation with experiment 3 1 1 failure modes during jetting two important jet regimes are shown in fig 10 it is clearly seen in fig 10 a that in sim 1 two zones are present the non deflection zone and the deflection zone as defined in section 1 1 therefore it can be concluded that the model can represent the penetrating jet regime fig 10 b shows that the jet flow immediately bends backwards indication that only a deflection zone is present this means that the model can retrieve the regime change between the penetrating jet and deflecting jet regimes 3 1 2 cavity depth and width the dimensionless soil cavity depth is calculated as z c d n where z c is the soil cavity depth and d n is the nozzle diameter to validate the cfd model cfd sim 2 which has a jet ratio p j s u 19 5 with different jet traverse velocities v t has been carried out the results are validated with the experiment of nobel 2013 see fig 11 the b u o y a n t k ε rans model has been applied and compared with the experimental results the uncertainty of the experiment as mentioned in nobel 2013 is 20 see the red uncertainty bar in fig 11 several conclusions can be drawn from the numerical results both the cfd model and the experimental work show a decreasing trend of dimensionless soil cavity depth as the jet traverse velocity increases the trend lines are almost parallel to each other meaning the slope of the trend lines are close to each other the computed width of the cavity w is 0 05 m with an uncertainty of one grid cell size of 0 005 m for all simulations nobel 2013 observed that for penetrating jets and 12 p j s u 200 that the cavity width is about 1 1 5 times the nozzle diameter the dimensionless cavity width in the present simulations is slightly larger 1 7 given the experimental uncertainties in e g the shear strength and the determination of the cavity dimensions after jetting the prediction of the cavity depth is reasonably accurate 3 1 3 soil surface dislodgement rate in this section the soil surface dislodgement rate calculated from cfd simulation will be compared with experimental results of nobel 2013 cfd sim 1 which is a penetrating jet case is used here for validation fig 12 shows the amount of soil dislodged during the experiment it can be seen that around 9 cells of 5 m m 5 m m are removed after 0 004 s of jetting because of the limitation of the experimental data at hand the instantaneous surface soil dislodgement rate of the experiment cannot be calculated with the experimental data at hand the averaged surface soil dislodgement rate is calculated as 0 056 m 2 s the surface dislodgement rate of the cohesive soil as a function of time calculated by cfd simulation is shown in fig 13 the green dash line represents the soil surface dislodgement rate of the experiment it is found that the soil surface dislodgement rate of the experiment is in between the maximum and minimum value calculated by cfd model it can also be seen that the dislodgement rate calculated by cfd model has a cyclic behavior with a period of 0 02 s this relates to the layer wise failure of the cavity wall as observed in fig 12 the jet first needs to step a certain distance on the top of the cavity wall to reach a critical momentum transfer level to initiate shear plane formation inside the wall after failure the jet has to translate a certain distance before this critical level is reached again in section 3 3 this processes will be examined in further detail the vertical speed of the soil front u f of the experiment and cfd simulation is also compared see fig 14 the vertical front speeds of the experiment and cfd simulation are both around 12 m s 3 2 analysis based on the numerical model in this section some analysis based on this cfd model will be carried out on the following aspects the pressure exerting on the soil as a function of time the shear plane change during jetting as a function of time the soil wall texture nerves which shows the soil failure pattern on the soil cavity wall 3 2 1 pressure on soil surface over time the cohesive soil fails when the pressure exerting on it exceeds the bearing capacity the pressure is expected to build up on the soil surface over time until the pressure exerting on the soil is large enough to deform the soil fig 15 shows the computed pressure profile of a fixed point on the soil surface over time it is seen that when the jet is impinging upon the soil surface the pressure is building up when the pressure is large enough to deform the soil the soil fails in such a way that the flow can enter the cavity with less obstruction flow more parallel to the cavity surface and hence the pressure on the cavity surface will decrease fig 16 and fig 17 show the maximum pressure on a horizontal line through the soil over time the horizontal line is on a vertical distance of 0 19 m from the bottom of the computational domain at this location the jet starts to deflect by more than five degrees indicating the end of the non deflection and beginning of the deflection zone the maximum pressure as expected occurs on the intersection between the soil surface and the horizontal line the soil is represented by the red region in figs 16 and 17 it is also observed that the maximum pressure on the soil changes periodically for both the deflecting jet and penetrating jet case with a periodicity of 0 012 s and 0 045 s respectively therefore the simulations clearly demonstrate that the failure mechanism is discontinuous the jet has to step a certain increment forwards before enough force is exerted by the jet flow to the soil before failure occurs after failure of a soil increment the static pressure decreases again while the jet moves forward to start a new cycle fig 17 also demonstrates that in between the main failure cycles intermediate clay dislodgement events can occur yielding local pressure peaks in section 3 3 a simplified failure model is derived based on these observations comparing the maximum pressure in figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the maximum pressure on the soil surface in fig 15 is smaller than that at a lower position in fig 16 this means that the stagnation point of the jet is located somewhat below the original bed level the stagnation point can be regarded as the location where the jet starts deflecting it also means that the soil at the surface fails before the arrival of the jet core this results in a lower pressure at the original bed level deeper in the cavity where the jet core hits the clay surface a higher pressure builds up 3 2 2 transients in shear rate distribution the shear plane is the demarcation between deforming and non deforming regions the exact position of the shear plane cannot be determined from the simulations as the soil is modelled as a regularized bingham fluid however an indication of the location of the shear plane can be obtained by plotting the second invariant i 2 of the shear rate tensor see fig 18 this distinguishes regions with large deformation rates from regions where soil deformation is practically absent fig 18 shows the shear plane patterns of the penetrating jet in sim 3 over time the shear plane pattern is marked by the white curve in fig 18 it is observed that the shear planes in the penetrating jet regime of sim 3 change periodically in 0 045 s this coincides the period of maximum pressure on the soil in fig 17 for the deflecting jet in sim 2e the shear plane pattern also changes periodically the period is 0 012 s which coincides the period of maximum pressure on the soil in fig 16 the failure patterns on the cavity wall for two different experimental conditions sim 2e and sim 3 are shown in fig 19 these patterns confirm the layer wise failure of the cavity wall it can be seen that the patterns on the wall are repeating this reveals the periodic behavior of the jetting process the period of the jetting process can be calculated as the pattern distance divided by the jet trail velocity v t the corresponding periods in figs 19a and b are 0 012 s and 0 045 s respectively which is consistent with the time traces of the maximum pressure in section 3 2 1 the horizontal length scale of texture carved in the cavity wall in sim 2e and sim 3 is approximately the same sim 3 fig 19b also demonstrates several pattern repetitions along the jet flow trajectory which are absent in sim 2e fig 19a this can be related to the number of sub maxima of the pressure within on cycle figs 16 and 17 this implies that in the penetrating jet regime the cavity depth is reached by a sequence of pressure build up and failure events 3 3 simplified failure model to understand the cyclic behaviour of the jet excavation process it is helpful to schematize the problem fig 20 it is assumed that the jet has to travel a certain distance δ x on the soil element dashed before the momentum transfer from the jet to the soil element is sufficiently large to overcome the strength of the clay and a shear plane forms at the backside of the soil element after failure the jet has to step further before a new cycle sets in after δ t time units the objective is to predict the cavity depth h the vertical dislodgement velocity v c δ x and δ t as a function of the jet nozzle exit velocity v j nozzle radius r shear strength s u τ y and traverse velocity v t to solve this problem four equations are required it is assumed that the soil is incompressible undrained which implies that 9 δ x v t δ t and 10 h v c δ t the vertical momentum flux of the nozzle f j π r 2 ρ f v j 2 2 π r 2 p j is balanced by the normal stress σ on the cavity basis and shear stress τ on the sides of dislodged element for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that during failure the mobilized shear stress equals the yield stress undrained shear strength τ τ y s u this simplification is only reasonable if the difference between the undrained shear strength at critical state and peak do not differ considerably and does not depend on the shear rate for the cohesive soils considered here this difference is limited and falls within the accuracy range to determine the shear strength with various methods see nobel 2013 the momentum balance becomes 11 τ y h 2 δ x w β f j where β f j is the fraction of the momentum flux that acts on the soil element which is compensated by the shear force while the fraction 1 β f j is the fraction of the momentum flux that acts on the cavity basis the total jet power that is exerted on the soil element is 1 2 β f j v j a fraction α of this power is required to overcome the friction at the shear plane and a fraction 1 α is required for the bulk deformation of the soil element in the deflection zone this bulk deformation consists of large plastic deformations and in the non deflection zone energy is required to form internal shear planes the energy balance becomes 12 τ y h 2 δ x w v c 1 2 α β f j v j solving the closed set of equations 9 12 yields 13 v c 1 2 α v j h α v j 8 τ y v t w τ y 2 16 τ y v t π r 2 β ρ f v j α w τ y δ t h v c δ x v t δ t it follows that the cavity dimensions and period of the failure process are controlled by the momentum and energy coefficients α and β these parameters cannot be obtained a priori and require advanced modelling techniques to describe both the momentum distribution of the jet flow inside the cavity and the large soil mechanical deformations of the walls table 3 reports the energy and momentum distribution coefficients α and β of the three different simulations computed with the cavity depth h and observed periodicity δ t the values for α indicates that less than 60 of the jet momentum flux is exerted on the soil element the values for β indicates that less than 40 of the jet power on the soil element is used for shearing the cavity wall the values of the coefficients show significant variations between the simulations demonstrating that the momentum and the energy distribution are a function of the jet traverse velocity clay strength and jet pressure the nozzle diameter and stand off distance are not varied in this study these parameters will probably have an effect on the cavity width w and also on the distribution coefficients α and β this requires further study for simulations 2a d the width of the cavity determined by the cfd models is approximately the same as for case 2e the periodicity of the jetting process has not been determined for 2a d however if it assumed that α and β do not depend on the jet traverse velocity it is possible to compute the cavity depth fig 21 shows the computed cavity depths for different jet traverse velocities of simulations 2a e it is seen that the simplified failure model provides a reasonable prediction of the cavity depth which indicates that the momentum and energy distribution coefficients do not strongly depend on the jet traverse velocity for this case this might be a useful observation for finding an optimum between the cavity depth and traverse velocity in terms of production excavated volume per unit of time however a more extended study should be performed to draw firm conclusions in this direction 4 conclusions the proposed cfd model predicts the cavity depth with reasonable accuracy for a range of jet pressures undrained shear strengths of the soil and traverse velocities of a single nozzle the second novelty of this work is that it clearly confirms that the failure process of a high pressure jet in cohesive soil at sufficiently high traverse velocities is essentially a discontinuous process with a given periodicity the cfd calculations provide very valuable information regarding the shear and pressure evolution during the cavity formation this diagnostic information which has not been obtained by experimental studies so far is very useful to explain this phenomenon based on the analysis of the cfd data a simplified failure model has been developed that provides more basic understanding of the failure process by linking the observed step length periodicity and cavity depth to the control parameters soil strength jet pressure and traverse velocity this simplified approach is also useful to assist practical calculations more experimental or cfd data is required to calibrate the coefficients of this simplified failure model since the cfd model is generically formulated it can be applied for different nozzle configurations in a wide range of dredging and offshore engineering equipment such as dragheads trenchers and drilling tools this is helpful to improve the design of dredging equipment optimize operational settings and estimate production credit authorship contribution statement boyao

20874,in dredging high pressure water jets are commonly applied to assist the mobilization of soil this work considers the excavation of cohesive soil the key objective is to predict the development of the cavity in the soil as a function of the undrained shear strength translation velocity and hydrodynamic pressure of a single nozzle a generic computational fluid dynamics cfd model has been developed that captures both the jet flow and the soil failure in a single framework the results are compared with data from a previous experimental study the cfd model predicts the cavity dimensions with reasonable accuracy in addition the model provides detailed data to study the cyclic nature of the soil failure process the cfd model is promising and can be applied for more complex nozzle configurations to assist the design process of dragheads and improve production estimates keywords dredging cohesive soil undrained soil failure moving jet computational fluid dynamics cfd dynamic mesh drift flux model openfoam 1 introduction submerged jets are used in a wide spectrum of offshore engineering applications such as pile installation de brum passini et al 2018 lourenço et al 2020 spud can extraction bienen et al 2009 kohan et al 2015 trenching perng and capart 2008 zhang et al 2017 and drilling xu et al 2017 wang and song 2019 in dredging engineering submerged jets mounted on a drag head assist the mobilization of both cohesive soil nobel 2013 and non cohesive soil weegenaar et al 2015 see fig 1 this study focusses on the hydraulic excavation by a translating high pressure jet for the excavation of cohesive soil where the dynamic pressure of the jet p j is typically much higher 5 than the undrained shear strength s u the soil failure process under these conditions is very complex and the erosion type is classified as mass erosion winterwerp et al 2012 the soil fails undrained and lumps of soil are torn from the bed by the hydrodynamic stresses when the jet traverses the bed fig 2 mass erosion is much harder to predict compared to floc and surface erosion that correspond to milder flow conditions in the marine environment winterwerp et al 2012 the case of a fixed submerged jet on cohesive soil has received a lot of attention in literature e g mazurek et al 2001 mazurek and hossain 2007 hou et al 2016 dong et al 2019 and standard jet erosion tests have been developed to assess the erodibility of cohesive soils hanson 1991 wardinski et al 2018 translating jets on non cohesive soils are also studied frequently perng and capart 2008 yeh et al 2009 weegenaar et al 2015 the combination of a translating jet above cohesive soil has received less attention zhang et al 2017 explored the high discharge regime with a relatively low jet pressure in a laboratory experiment 1 2 times s u and a sea trial 1 7 times s u rockwell 1981 is to the best knowledge of the authors the first publicly available report considering the high pressure regime he conducted a series of laboratory experiments and explored scaling relations for the cavity depth based on dimensional analysis machin and allan 2011 demonstrated that it is important to distinguish two contributions in the cavity formation a quasi instantaneous failure component related to the bearing capacity of the soil and an erosion part the later contribution strongly depends on the exposure time and hence the traverse velocity of the jet they also argued that the erodibility depends on the permeability and the plasticity of the soil and concluded this relation requires further study in their experiments the role of erosion on the cavity formation was considered negligible for a jet traverse velocity higher than 0 1 0 5 m s for lower speeds significantly deeper cavities where formed due to progressing erosion at the cavity surface the model of machin and allan 2011 for the maximum cavity depth requires an estimate for the bearing capacity factor n c a constant value corresponding to shallow cone penetration was suggested however an appropriate choice for n c was regarded by the authors as an open question nobel 2013 conducted a large set of experiments different types of failure were identified depending on the relative jet pressure p j s u and the traverse velocity v t of the nozzle more details about these observations and regime definitions that are relevant for the present study will be provided in section 1 1 nobel 2013 argues that both the static pressure and shear stress distribution on the cavity wall are important the magnitude of each force depends on the location in the cavity the experiments of zhang et al 2016 confirmed the scaling of the cavity depth with the nozzle diameter as proposed by rockwell 1981 in contrast to the quasi instantaneous penetration concept of machin and allan 2011 and the observations of nobel 2013 zhang et al 2016 argue that erosion at yan et al 2020 the cavity surface controls the migration of the cavity surface and the role of static pressure can be ignored this assumption would strongly simplify the modeling as it would allow the usage of existing erosion relations for cohesive soil determined for unidirectional flows along the trajectory of the jet unfortunately information about the static pressure at the cavity surface is missing in literature so support for this argument is lacking and requires further study more recently experiments of yin et al 2019 on extremely high pressure jets up to 30 mpa confirm the general trend reported in previous works of a decreasing cavity depth with increasing traverse velocity and increasing cavity depth with increasing jet pressure the above literature survey demonstrates that many questions remain open regarding both the qualitative understanding of the failure mechanism and the prediction of the penetration depth and width of the cavity existing analytical models strongly depend on assumptions on the driving forces and failure mechanisms computational fluid dynamics cfd could be helpful as it is a more generic approach and it could reveal diagnostic information that is difficult or even impossible to retrieve experimentally such as the static pressure on the cavity walls and shear plane formation in front of the jet cfd models have been developed for impinging jet flow and scour related problems yan et al 2020 the challenges for a cfd model for this problem are to track or capture the soil fluid interface charin et al 2017 and to model the undrained cohesive failure in the soil region simultaneously in this work we follow the methodology proposed by lalli et al 2005 to combine the fluid and solid region in a single computational framework by applying suitable constitutive models for the stress tensors in both regions the advantage is that mesh deformations are not needed and external coupling between soil mechanical and fluid mechanical solvers is avoided recently wang and song 2019 have also followed this modeling strategy for static jet excavation in cohesive soil the key objective is to predict the cavity shape as a function of the jet traverse velocity jet pressure and the undrained shear strength of the cohesive soil 1 1 failure modes during jetting in this work the failure mode definitions of nobel 2013 are adopted which will briefly given here for the sake of readability of the present work penetrating jet fig 4 1 penetrating jet happens when p j s u 12 and v t u f h where u f h is the soil horizontal propagation velocity which is defined in fig 3 2 the soil cavity is narrow and deep with a cavity width of 1 1 5 times the jet diameter 3 a soil wall texture with vertical and curving nerves the vertical nerves are present in the non deflection zone while the curving nerves are in the deflection zone 4 the dislodged soil is completely fluidized deflecting jet fig 5 1 deflecting jet happens when 7 3 p j s u 12 or v t u f v where u f v is the soil vertical propagation velocity which is defined in fig 3 2 the soil cavity is shallower compared with the penetrating jet and smaller than 2 5 times the nozzle diameter 3 a soil wall texture with curving nerves appears representing the deflection zone 4 limited amount of dislodged soil lumps can be found after the experiments dispersing jet 1 dispersing jet happens when 5 4 p j s u 7 3 or v t u f v 2 the depth of the soil cavity is shallow while the width of the soil cavity is wider which can be equal to 5 times the nozzle diameter 3 the soil wall structure is irregular 4 the dislodged soil can be found after the experiments hydro fracturing hydro fracturing happens when v t 0 15 m s the soil cavity dimensions are irregular the soil fails at its weakest position the penetrating jet and deflecting jet are the most relevant failure modes the penetrating jet and deflecting jet are the main objectives to be investigated in this study the penetrating jet has two jet zones which are the non deflection zone and the deflection zone see fig 4 in the non deflection zone of the penetrating jet the pressure builds up on the top of the soil element until the jet stagnation pressure exceeds the bearing capacity of the soil thereafter the soil is pushed downwards by the stagnation pressure of the jet the smaller the jet ratio p j s u the longer the duration of this vertical process when the traverse velocity of the nozzle is relatively low the jet flow can follow a vertical line in the non deflection zone as shown in fig 4 as the traverse velocity of the jet is increasing the jet flow in the non deflection region will have an inclination angle as shown in fig 4 the higher the jet traverse velocity the larger the inclination angle will be in the deflection zone of the penetrating jet the jet flow will be deflected due to the traverse velocity of the jet and the resistance of the soil as the jet traverse velocity increases even more the non deflection zone will disappear which is shown in fig 5 this failure mode is called deflecting jet the failure mechanism of the deflecting jet is comparable with that in the deflection zone of the penetrating jet 2 material and methods inspired by the works of nguyen et al 2014 weij et al 2016 goeree 2018 and wang and song 2019 a model for the solid fluid mixture is combined with a plastic description of soil to capture the jet flow and the cavity formation in a single computational framework the drift flux model describes the solid fluid mixture and the cohesive soil is modelled as a bingham plastic with a fixed yield stress to represent the undrained shear strength a threshold value of the solid phase fraction distinguishes solid from fluid regions in order to select locally appropriate constitutive laws for the mixture flow 2 1 drift flux model the drift flux approach consists of a mass and momentum balance of the solid fluid mixture combined with separate transport equations for the solid phase fractions the mass balance of the mixture results in the continuity equation 1 ρ m t ρ m u m 0 where ρ m is the mixture density u m is the mixture velocity the mixture momentum equation is 2 ρ m u m t ρ m u m u m p m t m k 1 n α k ρ k u k m u k m ρ m g where p m is the mixture pressure t m is the mixture shear stress tensor g is the gravitational acceleration vector α k is the volume fraction of phase k this term is closed by the transport equation 3 α k t α k u k γ t α k where γ t is the turbulent diffusion coefficient u k m which is the relative velocity between mixture and phase k is closed by the following equation 4 u k m u k r k 1 n c k u k r where c k is the mass fraction of phase k u k r is the relative velocity between the carrier fluid and the solids which is obtained by the hindered settling relations of richardson and zaki 1954 the mixture pressure p m is governed by a poisson equation that can be obtained by combining the continuity and momentum equations 1 and 2 respectively for details see goeree 2018 2 2 cohesive soil model bingham plastic to implement the cohesive soil into the drift flux model the non newtonian fluid model bingham plastic bingham 1922 lalli et al 2005 goeree et al 2016 is applied bingham plastics behave as a solid at low shear stress and as a fluid at high shear stress which is represented by the constitutive relation 5 τ τ y η γ where τ y is the yield stress η is the plastic viscosity γ is the shear rate in 3d equal to the second invariant of the rate of deformation tensor u m from equation 5 the viscosity of the bingham plastic is calculated as 6 μ τ y γ ε η where ε is an arbitrarily small value which is used to prevent singularity in the limit of vanishing shear rate the yield stress τ y is only applied in the soil region which is determined by the volume concentration the yield stress τ y follows 7 τ y τ y w h e n α s α t 0 w h e n α s α t where α s is the volume concentration of the sediment phase α t is the threshold volume concentration value 2 3 mixture stress tensor the rans model b u o y a n t k ε is used in this study to compute the eddy viscosity in b u o y a n t k ε model henkes et al 1991 the modulation of turbulent kinetic energy caused by density stratification effects is incorporated for the sake of compactness the equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation ε are omitted here the eddy viscosity is computed as μ e ρ m c μ k 2 ε where c μ 0 09 is a universal constant the mixture stress tensor required in the momentum balance equation 2 is finally computed as 8 t m μ m u m u m t 2 3 i u m where i is the identity tensor the mixture viscosity μ m equals the regularized bingham viscosity equation 6 in the solid region and equals the eddy viscosity in the fluid regions boussinesq approximation of turbulent stresses it is assumed that after dislodgement the soil elements disrupt quickly into fine solid particles clay that instantaneously follow the turbulent motions of the fluid carrier phase for this reason it is assumed that the turbulent diffusivity γ required in equation 3 equals the turbulent viscosity ν e μ e ρ m which corresponds to a turbulent prandtl schmidt number σ 1 2 4 numerical implementation the finite volume method has been selected to solve the governing equations described in the previous sections all flow variables are defined at the cell centres of the mesh collocated mesh the momentum transport and pressure poisson equations are solved implicitly in a segregated approach inspired by the piso algorithm of issa 1986 the open source platform openfoam v1812 open field operation and manipulation is used for cfd numerical simulation in this study openfoam website openfoam is an open source object oriented library for numerical simulations in continuum mechanics based on the finite volume method in this study the drift flux solver driftfluxfoam is combined with two dynamic mesh algorithms arbitrairy mesh refinement a r and arbitrairy mesh interface ami to model the translation of the jet as for the numerical schemes used in this paper a central scheme has been applied to the diffusion terms of the momentum equations the van leer scheme has been implemented for the concentration convection terms the local min scheme which takes the minimum value of the owner and its neighbour cells has been implemented to the turbulent eddy viscosity to prevent numerical diffusion at the soil water interface a threshold concentration for the turbulence model is also included in the model when the concentration in the cell is larger than the threshold value the turbulent eddy viscosity will be switched off by doing this the turbulence eddy viscosity can be switched off inside the soil to model the moving jet dynamic mesh methods are used in this study in this study a combination of ami arbitrary mesh interface and a r cell layer addition removal is used to model the moving jet see fig 6 2 5 mesh techniques the steady mesh region separates the a r dynamic mesh region by the ami interface the moving jet is located in the a r dynamic mesh region when the jet is moving from left to right new mesh layers will be added to the left blue region old mesh layers will be removed from the right yellow region the jet has a diameter of 30 m m and a sod stand off distance the distance between jet outlet and soil surface of 20 m m which are representative values for dredging engineering applications nobel 2013 a cartesian computational grid is applied with a mesh size of 0 005 m 2 6 initial and boundary conditions the initial condition is presented in fig 7 the height and width of the soil region are 0 28 m and 0 15 m which ensures the soil cavity is smaller than the computational domain the side view and front view of the computational domain with boundary conditions setup is shown in fig 8 the cohesive soil is placed in between the two side walls outlet boundary conditions are implemented in front end and top of the computational domain no slip boundary condition is applied to the walls dirichlet boundary condition is implemented to the jet inlet wall functions wilcox et al 1998 are applied to the turbulence dissipation rate ε and turbulence kinetic energy k on the walls table 1 shows the detailed boundary conditions setup of the computational domain it has to be mentioned that no boundary condition is applied to the interface between water and soil in this numerical model the concentration at the soil water interface is not changing sharply but gradually 2 7 input parameters a key parameter for the hydraulic excavation process is the ratio between the jet pressure p j and the undrained shear strength of the clay s u see section 1 2 this study focuses on the regime p j s u the second key parameter is the transverse velocity v t the input parameter matrix covers different combinations of p j s u traverse velocities v t and nozzle exit velocities v j see table 2 the nozzle diameter and stand off distance are kept constant these settings correspond to the operational regime of nozzles in the offshore and dredging field the only difference is that the effect of a single nozzle is studied here while in practice multiple nozzles operate simultaneously and are often combined with mechanical tools comparable settings were considered in the experimental study of nobel 2013 the values for the solid concentration α s and soil mixture density ρ m are adopted from the latter experiments 3 results and discussion in this section the results calculated by the cfd model will be validated with the experiment of nobel 2013 some analysis of the soil failure mechanism based on the cfd model are also carried out an adjustable time step is applied based on the courant number stability criterium at the same time mesh and residual convergence analyses are carried out before conducting the validation fig 9 shows the jet cavity during jetting calculated by the cfd model when the jet traverses the soil sample the cavity formation is clearly retrieved by the model it can be concluded that the model qualitatively reproduces the general picture of the cavity formation process for high pressure jets in cohesive soil as sketched in fig 2 the jet flow quickly starts to disperse after the deflection which reduces the velocity considerably 3 1 validation with experiment 3 1 1 failure modes during jetting two important jet regimes are shown in fig 10 it is clearly seen in fig 10 a that in sim 1 two zones are present the non deflection zone and the deflection zone as defined in section 1 1 therefore it can be concluded that the model can represent the penetrating jet regime fig 10 b shows that the jet flow immediately bends backwards indication that only a deflection zone is present this means that the model can retrieve the regime change between the penetrating jet and deflecting jet regimes 3 1 2 cavity depth and width the dimensionless soil cavity depth is calculated as z c d n where z c is the soil cavity depth and d n is the nozzle diameter to validate the cfd model cfd sim 2 which has a jet ratio p j s u 19 5 with different jet traverse velocities v t has been carried out the results are validated with the experiment of nobel 2013 see fig 11 the b u o y a n t k ε rans model has been applied and compared with the experimental results the uncertainty of the experiment as mentioned in nobel 2013 is 20 see the red uncertainty bar in fig 11 several conclusions can be drawn from the numerical results both the cfd model and the experimental work show a decreasing trend of dimensionless soil cavity depth as the jet traverse velocity increases the trend lines are almost parallel to each other meaning the slope of the trend lines are close to each other the computed width of the cavity w is 0 05 m with an uncertainty of one grid cell size of 0 005 m for all simulations nobel 2013 observed that for penetrating jets and 12 p j s u 200 that the cavity width is about 1 1 5 times the nozzle diameter the dimensionless cavity width in the present simulations is slightly larger 1 7 given the experimental uncertainties in e g the shear strength and the determination of the cavity dimensions after jetting the prediction of the cavity depth is reasonably accurate 3 1 3 soil surface dislodgement rate in this section the soil surface dislodgement rate calculated from cfd simulation will be compared with experimental results of nobel 2013 cfd sim 1 which is a penetrating jet case is used here for validation fig 12 shows the amount of soil dislodged during the experiment it can be seen that around 9 cells of 5 m m 5 m m are removed after 0 004 s of jetting because of the limitation of the experimental data at hand the instantaneous surface soil dislodgement rate of the experiment cannot be calculated with the experimental data at hand the averaged surface soil dislodgement rate is calculated as 0 056 m 2 s the surface dislodgement rate of the cohesive soil as a function of time calculated by cfd simulation is shown in fig 13 the green dash line represents the soil surface dislodgement rate of the experiment it is found that the soil surface dislodgement rate of the experiment is in between the maximum and minimum value calculated by cfd model it can also be seen that the dislodgement rate calculated by cfd model has a cyclic behavior with a period of 0 02 s this relates to the layer wise failure of the cavity wall as observed in fig 12 the jet first needs to step a certain distance on the top of the cavity wall to reach a critical momentum transfer level to initiate shear plane formation inside the wall after failure the jet has to translate a certain distance before this critical level is reached again in section 3 3 this processes will be examined in further detail the vertical speed of the soil front u f of the experiment and cfd simulation is also compared see fig 14 the vertical front speeds of the experiment and cfd simulation are both around 12 m s 3 2 analysis based on the numerical model in this section some analysis based on this cfd model will be carried out on the following aspects the pressure exerting on the soil as a function of time the shear plane change during jetting as a function of time the soil wall texture nerves which shows the soil failure pattern on the soil cavity wall 3 2 1 pressure on soil surface over time the cohesive soil fails when the pressure exerting on it exceeds the bearing capacity the pressure is expected to build up on the soil surface over time until the pressure exerting on the soil is large enough to deform the soil fig 15 shows the computed pressure profile of a fixed point on the soil surface over time it is seen that when the jet is impinging upon the soil surface the pressure is building up when the pressure is large enough to deform the soil the soil fails in such a way that the flow can enter the cavity with less obstruction flow more parallel to the cavity surface and hence the pressure on the cavity surface will decrease fig 16 and fig 17 show the maximum pressure on a horizontal line through the soil over time the horizontal line is on a vertical distance of 0 19 m from the bottom of the computational domain at this location the jet starts to deflect by more than five degrees indicating the end of the non deflection and beginning of the deflection zone the maximum pressure as expected occurs on the intersection between the soil surface and the horizontal line the soil is represented by the red region in figs 16 and 17 it is also observed that the maximum pressure on the soil changes periodically for both the deflecting jet and penetrating jet case with a periodicity of 0 012 s and 0 045 s respectively therefore the simulations clearly demonstrate that the failure mechanism is discontinuous the jet has to step a certain increment forwards before enough force is exerted by the jet flow to the soil before failure occurs after failure of a soil increment the static pressure decreases again while the jet moves forward to start a new cycle fig 17 also demonstrates that in between the main failure cycles intermediate clay dislodgement events can occur yielding local pressure peaks in section 3 3 a simplified failure model is derived based on these observations comparing the maximum pressure in figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the maximum pressure on the soil surface in fig 15 is smaller than that at a lower position in fig 16 this means that the stagnation point of the jet is located somewhat below the original bed level the stagnation point can be regarded as the location where the jet starts deflecting it also means that the soil at the surface fails before the arrival of the jet core this results in a lower pressure at the original bed level deeper in the cavity where the jet core hits the clay surface a higher pressure builds up 3 2 2 transients in shear rate distribution the shear plane is the demarcation between deforming and non deforming regions the exact position of the shear plane cannot be determined from the simulations as the soil is modelled as a regularized bingham fluid however an indication of the location of the shear plane can be obtained by plotting the second invariant i 2 of the shear rate tensor see fig 18 this distinguishes regions with large deformation rates from regions where soil deformation is practically absent fig 18 shows the shear plane patterns of the penetrating jet in sim 3 over time the shear plane pattern is marked by the white curve in fig 18 it is observed that the shear planes in the penetrating jet regime of sim 3 change periodically in 0 045 s this coincides the period of maximum pressure on the soil in fig 17 for the deflecting jet in sim 2e the shear plane pattern also changes periodically the period is 0 012 s which coincides the period of maximum pressure on the soil in fig 16 the failure patterns on the cavity wall for two different experimental conditions sim 2e and sim 3 are shown in fig 19 these patterns confirm the layer wise failure of the cavity wall it can be seen that the patterns on the wall are repeating this reveals the periodic behavior of the jetting process the period of the jetting process can be calculated as the pattern distance divided by the jet trail velocity v t the corresponding periods in figs 19a and b are 0 012 s and 0 045 s respectively which is consistent with the time traces of the maximum pressure in section 3 2 1 the horizontal length scale of texture carved in the cavity wall in sim 2e and sim 3 is approximately the same sim 3 fig 19b also demonstrates several pattern repetitions along the jet flow trajectory which are absent in sim 2e fig 19a this can be related to the number of sub maxima of the pressure within on cycle figs 16 and 17 this implies that in the penetrating jet regime the cavity depth is reached by a sequence of pressure build up and failure events 3 3 simplified failure model to understand the cyclic behaviour of the jet excavation process it is helpful to schematize the problem fig 20 it is assumed that the jet has to travel a certain distance δ x on the soil element dashed before the momentum transfer from the jet to the soil element is sufficiently large to overcome the strength of the clay and a shear plane forms at the backside of the soil element after failure the jet has to step further before a new cycle sets in after δ t time units the objective is to predict the cavity depth h the vertical dislodgement velocity v c δ x and δ t as a function of the jet nozzle exit velocity v j nozzle radius r shear strength s u τ y and traverse velocity v t to solve this problem four equations are required it is assumed that the soil is incompressible undrained which implies that 9 δ x v t δ t and 10 h v c δ t the vertical momentum flux of the nozzle f j π r 2 ρ f v j 2 2 π r 2 p j is balanced by the normal stress σ on the cavity basis and shear stress τ on the sides of dislodged element for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that during failure the mobilized shear stress equals the yield stress undrained shear strength τ τ y s u this simplification is only reasonable if the difference between the undrained shear strength at critical state and peak do not differ considerably and does not depend on the shear rate for the cohesive soils considered here this difference is limited and falls within the accuracy range to determine the shear strength with various methods see nobel 2013 the momentum balance becomes 11 τ y h 2 δ x w β f j where β f j is the fraction of the momentum flux that acts on the soil element which is compensated by the shear force while the fraction 1 β f j is the fraction of the momentum flux that acts on the cavity basis the total jet power that is exerted on the soil element is 1 2 β f j v j a fraction α of this power is required to overcome the friction at the shear plane and a fraction 1 α is required for the bulk deformation of the soil element in the deflection zone this bulk deformation consists of large plastic deformations and in the non deflection zone energy is required to form internal shear planes the energy balance becomes 12 τ y h 2 δ x w v c 1 2 α β f j v j solving the closed set of equations 9 12 yields 13 v c 1 2 α v j h α v j 8 τ y v t w τ y 2 16 τ y v t π r 2 β ρ f v j α w τ y δ t h v c δ x v t δ t it follows that the cavity dimensions and period of the failure process are controlled by the momentum and energy coefficients α and β these parameters cannot be obtained a priori and require advanced modelling techniques to describe both the momentum distribution of the jet flow inside the cavity and the large soil mechanical deformations of the walls table 3 reports the energy and momentum distribution coefficients α and β of the three different simulations computed with the cavity depth h and observed periodicity δ t the values for α indicates that less than 60 of the jet momentum flux is exerted on the soil element the values for β indicates that less than 40 of the jet power on the soil element is used for shearing the cavity wall the values of the coefficients show significant variations between the simulations demonstrating that the momentum and the energy distribution are a function of the jet traverse velocity clay strength and jet pressure the nozzle diameter and stand off distance are not varied in this study these parameters will probably have an effect on the cavity width w and also on the distribution coefficients α and β this requires further study for simulations 2a d the width of the cavity determined by the cfd models is approximately the same as for case 2e the periodicity of the jetting process has not been determined for 2a d however if it assumed that α and β do not depend on the jet traverse velocity it is possible to compute the cavity depth fig 21 shows the computed cavity depths for different jet traverse velocities of simulations 2a e it is seen that the simplified failure model provides a reasonable prediction of the cavity depth which indicates that the momentum and energy distribution coefficients do not strongly depend on the jet traverse velocity for this case this might be a useful observation for finding an optimum between the cavity depth and traverse velocity in terms of production excavated volume per unit of time however a more extended study should be performed to draw firm conclusions in this direction 4 conclusions the proposed cfd model predicts the cavity depth with reasonable accuracy for a range of jet pressures undrained shear strengths of the soil and traverse velocities of a single nozzle the second novelty of this work is that it clearly confirms that the failure process of a high pressure jet in cohesive soil at sufficiently high traverse velocities is essentially a discontinuous process with a given periodicity the cfd calculations provide very valuable information regarding the shear and pressure evolution during the cavity formation this diagnostic information which has not been obtained by experimental studies so far is very useful to explain this phenomenon based on the analysis of the cfd data a simplified failure model has been developed that provides more basic understanding of the failure process by linking the observed step length periodicity and cavity depth to the control parameters soil strength jet pressure and traverse velocity this simplified approach is also useful to assist practical calculations more experimental or cfd data is required to calibrate the coefficients of this simplified failure model since the cfd model is generically formulated it can be applied for different nozzle configurations in a wide range of dredging and offshore engineering equipment such as dragheads trenchers and drilling tools this is helpful to improve the design of dredging equipment optimize operational settings and estimate production credit authorship contribution statement boyao
